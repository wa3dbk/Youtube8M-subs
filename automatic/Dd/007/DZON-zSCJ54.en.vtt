00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.430
 hello again here I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.820
 and in this case it's a tutorial 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.710
 pretty spiral the reddish tones 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.780
 because because the shadow of transition is 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.850
 one that has redder rouge 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.490
 as I'm going to go stretching reddish and the 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.380
 reddish lips as you see is strong 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.570
 so I hope you like the 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.570
 look and I leave you watching the step by step 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.510
 The first thing I will do is apply 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.239
 a pre base for shadows this what 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.940
 will make them last longer and do not make us 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.780
 those ugly folds that happen with the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.149
 length of the works 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.480
 with an old gold pencil this is the 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.149
 Sep 11th of the new flour I am going to 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.460
 draw a line holding two tabs 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.489
 but I'm not going to cover the whole eyelid 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.489
 mobile 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.259
 once we have it like that 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.259
 a little 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.300
 this is what you do that the shadow that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.270
 let's put on as more intensity to 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.369
 root of the eyelashes but do not take us 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.470
 all the intensity in the whole body of the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.810
 mobile now I will use this 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.830
 umbrella that is the smoky mountains of 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.050
 enix also if you have the green smoke 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.080
 of mac you can also use it for 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.729
 This look is very beautiful and with 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.080
 a flat brush to apply shade 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.080
 let's apply 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.880
 on top of the mobile eyelid on the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.320
 eyelid mobile and on the orbits good 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.320
 the pencil that we used before 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.330
 now I'm going to use this shadow that is 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.670
 the key the word that I now think is 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.880
 flame tall goal of petals or something like that in 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.670
 your face and good can use the key 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.030
 the family where or something like that is that 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.010
 I agree very well the name of matrix in 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.500
 all that have this effect 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.900
 iridescent brown beige green or can 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.580
 serve and I'll apply it where 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.580
 the previous area ends 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.200
 now I'm going to use a beige shadow 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.690
 to illuminate this is the universal beige 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.010
 of sephora and with a chubby brush we're going 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.010
 to illuminate the bone of the eyebrows 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.780
 now in the lower eyelid I'm going to 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.780
 apply the fines 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.930
 and with a little of the verbiage the 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.120
 word on the bottom because 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.580
 have reddish dry can make us 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.680
 approaching tired kansas apps and 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.840
 teachers later I prefer to get a 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.519
 little bit on the outside now I'm going to 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.670
 catch a black pencil made in a quai 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.799
 from make a forever can draw a line 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.769
 slightly thick on the outside 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.250
 but the rest is fine because now 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.320
 I'm going to blur it 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.390
 and now with 115 the granite and one 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.850
 black shadow is the black one of kiko that 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.850
 I think the 180 on the pencil 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.190
 but giving small little touches 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.420
 the whole with the green that we put 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:58.430
 good green this color we met before 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.430
 we put on the skin water line 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.220
 it would only be necessary to make eyelashes and 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.220
 apply mascara 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.720
 Well, we would already have the video 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.610
 finished and now let's move on to 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.350
 make up the challenge of the face as I have 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.440
 said we went to the face and I'm going to run 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.900
 the ojera with corrector 576 of the baby 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.900
 we're going to supra color 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:44.229
 and then I'm going to find this proofreader 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:47.110
 mckellen w 20 that is the mineral I'm going to 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:51.360
 give in areas for example cover redness 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.360
 I have marquitas and others 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.700
 I do this because I use a 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.680
 base as in the fia fiaica and very light 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.840
 Well and use a little more 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.570
 corrector that is ligerito 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.910
 but imperfections like that the ugly mode 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.770
 as a single layer because it is enough 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.060
 as I said I use the weights 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.060
 moody in tone 11 2 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.009
 of rouge I will use the sunrise of 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.009
 slip 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.570
 of illuminator I will use sofas 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.570
 gentlemen mch 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.389
 and I'm going to fix my eyebrows with the ay 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.389

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.840
 I trust her a little bit with the ay braun 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.840
 designer of kiko 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.460
 and now lips, you can always 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.810
 opt for the color that you like best 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:38.680
 I'm going to go strong with I'm going to outline 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:41.310

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.310
 wine tone 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.190
 good and now I'm going to use a lipstick 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.590
 which is the same color as 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.889

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.610

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.190
 lipstick that the same color as the pencil 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:22.570
 You can buy the pencil and equal to put it 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.570
 over or because the thing 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.030
 well, the light would be finished 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.470
 protagonist color in this look just what 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:48.180
