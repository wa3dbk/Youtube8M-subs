00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.759
 so we will investigate a little bit though 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.680
 talk about what titles microsoft 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.300
 their large trophies have mentioned so 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.070
 and started the big line up 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.690
 with halo five guardians a little bit 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.099
 bigger information a closer 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.809
 title information we have out 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.970
 the singleplayer campaign some scenes 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.590
 seen release date he is 27 october 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.010
 this year that was already before 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.140
 known 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.529
 and yes, there were a few nice ones 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.730
 scenes looked good grÃ¶dig only 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.320
 play and I'm curious what too 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.250
 Continue for lighter 5 but there is yes 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.939
 actually everything in dry 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.369
 cloths 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.200
 in dry cloths he is in damp 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.510
 nipples exists has just been 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.890
 Of course also shown and the first 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.329
 times really saw the gameplay scenes 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.770
 actually say cool I have 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.440
 Unfortunately, I'm a little bit two years old 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.520
 felt in the time back because 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.070
 actually some parallel to 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.390
 previous coach as you honestly 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.640
 I completely do not care because the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.039
 formula worked and if so 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.149
 plays with a great graphics and a 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.070
 I am also perfect with a few innovations 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.480
 satisfied on the 10th of november the time has come 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 that is, all people who are more animal 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.619
 forward four and i am looking forward to the 10th 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.020
 it was thought that I empty he expected 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.030
 not the case because now attracts when 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.830
 we just rise of the tomb raider seems 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.200
 and it does not make it right 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.880
 important then what else did we have the sg 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.080
 s 4g software no longer only up to 4 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.900
 trucking just shorter and crisper 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.240
 that is also true where is in 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.560
 christmas 2016 is only as far as we are 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.030
 but have already seen the first gameplay 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.070
 which I also looked pretty good 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.409
 but somehow more of the same 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.880
 but in a year so of the mood 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.380
 I found very nice very dark 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.150
 you have kept the whole scenes of 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.979
 of the artwork from the graphic artist what to 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.180
 Anyway, but who is that? 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.530
 mood he was very dark and gloomy 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.409
 and I found that very nice of that 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.790
 is what I want what the wait to 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.119
 there can shorten so a bit 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.369
 The gears of war ultimate is definitely 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.140
 medium by thus edition one 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.060
 reprint of the first part of gears of 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.380
 was with aufgemotzt the graphic if I 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.240
 but a bit of a pity the setting only 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.170
 the first part is so if sony up 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.729
 sometime the uncharted gets 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.020
 territory measure for the pity that 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.329
 microsoft now in the first part of gears 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.860
 of war makes worker good 25 august is 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.860
 the time has come and you can play the game 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.619
 do yes 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.480
 and one of my personal highlights 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.150
 on the microsoft pk this year was the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.049
 Announcement for the 30th company anniversary 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.640
 from rave the 30 games collections of 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.180
 around 30 dollars probably with us 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.680
 analogous 30 euros , the titles are the one 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.090
 so far you have seen it 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.709
 of course, it's a pity that it's a pity 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.469
 It's not the nintendo title 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.030
 but have nintendo license at 30 titles 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.560
 from rehor for microsoft you can get them 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.849
 Some good ones expect a gender 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.049
 but it's cool that they're back 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.379
 are and are back on a new one 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.750
 Because she lives on beach as sawi 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.400
 Neuland for out there because it has 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.260
 definitely is because generally by Neuhaus 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.060
 must say those were pirate game what so 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.319
 mmo internet that was not touched 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.180
 it was with his friends on a 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.769
 pirate ship fighting against others and 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.060
 the capers as it looked and so 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.829
 We do not think we have multiplayer 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.870
 but actually said user over 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.639
 That's why the characters are great 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.500
 interesting setting I would have mega 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.359
 bock on it I am very curious how 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.799
 sony and especially like nintendo there 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.629
 pretty much so export already has 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.169
 Well presented and yes we are hoping 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.540
 later again 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.939
 he wanted the hashtag e3 2010 on 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.079
 twitter follows us at giga de / 3 and 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.859

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.859
