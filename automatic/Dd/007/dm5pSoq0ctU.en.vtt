00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
here because of the lightness of it but

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.990 
here because of the lightness of it but
this<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.950> taller<00:01:56.280> blade<00:01:56.670> than<00:01:56.909> the

this is a taller blade than the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
equivalent classic four-inch pairing so

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.249 
equivalent classic four-inch pairing so

a little bit more belly to it although

the top does come down a bit more than

the top does come down a bit more than

for a little bit higher performance so

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.060 
for a little bit higher performance so
it's<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.880> really<00:02:43.270> nice<00:02:43.420> looking<00:02:44.070> well-executed
