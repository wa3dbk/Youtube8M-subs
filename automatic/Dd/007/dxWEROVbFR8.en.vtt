Christian Way and the fact that we have

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.999 
Christian Way and the fact that we have
a<00:04:18.789> small<00:04:19.570> setting<00:04:20.109> where<00:04:20.229> we<00:04:20.349> can<00:04:20.560> minister<00:04:20.859> to

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
a small setting where we can minister to

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.159 
a small setting where we can minister to
each<00:04:21.280> of<00:04:21.430> them<00:04:21.609> individually<00:04:21.900> work<00:04:22.900> with<00:04:23.050> them

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
each of them individually work with them

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.629 
each of them individually work with them
individually<00:04:23.320> makes<00:04:24.190> all<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.490> difference

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
individually makes all the difference

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.029 
individually makes all the difference
and<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.180> helps<00:04:25.449> that<00:04:25.570> we<00:04:25.720> also<00:04:25.900> go<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.800> church

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
and it helps that we also go to church

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.350 
and it helps that we also go to church
here<00:04:27.220> on<00:04:27.340> Sundays<00:04:27.729> I<00:04:27.880> mean<00:04:28.060> they<00:04:28.180> have<00:04:28.330> a

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
here on Sundays I mean they have a

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.020 
here on Sundays I mean they have a
church<00:04:29.050> service<00:04:29.349> here<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:30.039> they're<00:04:30.669> really
