00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
slides out on the bottom i did find that

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.570 
slides out on the bottom i did find that
it<00:01:04.170> does<00:01:04.350> make<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> little<00:01:04.769> bit<00:01:05.159> heavier<00:01:05.519> but

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
it does make it a little bit heavier but

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.760 
it does make it a little bit heavier but
still<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.210> kind<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.229> nice<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.680> that

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
still it's kind of a nice to have that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.410 
still it's kind of a nice to have that
flexibility<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.700> touchscreen<00:01:09.210> and

keyboard input with the google android
operating<00:01:13.439> system<00:01:13.740> kind<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.400> similar<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
operating system kind of similar to the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.969 
operating system kind of similar to the
iphone<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.380> download<00:01:16.560> apps

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
iphone in that you can download apps

from the google app marketplace they

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.649 
from the google app marketplace they
don't<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.159> near<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.520> number<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:21.060> apps<00:01:21.509> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
don't have near the number of apps that

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.780 
don't have near the number of apps that
iphone<00:01:22.200> does<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:22.740> there's<00:01:22.979> still<00:01:23.070> literally

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
iphone does but there's still literally

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.640 
iphone does but there's still literally
tens<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.180> thousands<00:01:24.630> available<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.560> these

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
tens of thousands available for these

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
tens of thousands available for these
types<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.040> phones<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.490> anything<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.150> you

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
types of phones so anything that you

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.120 
types of phones so anything that you
find<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> iPhone<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.590> probably<00:01:29.009> find

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
find on the iPhone you can probably find

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.280 
find on the iPhone you can probably find
something<00:01:29.400> very<00:01:29.520> similar<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.689> device

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
something very similar on this device

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.429 
something very similar on this device
has<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.070> built-in<00:01:32.520> five<00:01:33.030> megapixel<00:01:33.689> camera<00:01:34.079> so

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
has a built-in five megapixel camera so

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.230 
has a built-in five megapixel camera so
you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.530> take<00:01:34.650> some<00:01:34.950> pretty<00:01:35.280> nice<00:01:35.579> snap<00:01:35.939> shots

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
you can take some pretty nice snap shots

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.550 
you can take some pretty nice snap shots
with<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.409> video

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
with this and you do have video

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.890 
with this and you do have video
recording<00:01:38.159> capability<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.909> well<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.869> can

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
recording capability as well so you can

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.140 
recording capability as well so you can
get<00:01:40.110> all<00:01:40.320> sorts<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.799> information<00:01:41.340> into<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
get all sorts of information into the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.630 
get all sorts of information into the
device<00:01:42.450> has<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.140> built-in<00:01:43.530> accelerometer<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
device has a built-in accelerometer a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.940 
device has a built-in accelerometer a
GPS<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.509> even<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.750> compass<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.680> makes<00:01:46.829> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
GPS and even a compass so it makes it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.429 
GPS and even a compass so it makes it
ideal<00:01:47.610> for<00:01:47.640> things<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.180> augmented<00:01:48.899> reality

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
ideal for things like augmented reality

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.319 
ideal for things like augmented reality
and<00:01:49.649> that's<00:01:50.549> kind<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.850> neat<00:01:51.090> concept

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
and that's kind of a neat concept

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.840 
and that's kind of a neat concept
basically<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.259> can<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.590> maps<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.340> because

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
basically you can have maps and because

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.429 
basically you can have maps and because
it<00:01:53.970> knows<00:01:54.149> exactly<00:01:54.509> where<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.990> are<00:01:55.170> it'll

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
it knows exactly where you are it'll

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.109 
it knows exactly where you are it'll
actually<00:01:55.619> show<00:01:55.979> things<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.460> bank<00:01:56.700> machines

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
actually show things like bank machines
