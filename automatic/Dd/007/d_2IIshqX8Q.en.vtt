at<00:01:03.570> dd's<00:01:03.930> success<00:01:04.320> factor<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> first

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
at dd's success factor in the first

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.140 
at dd's success factor in the first
match<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.360> each<00:01:06.659> lane<00:01:07.020> right<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.159> lane<00:01:08.310> 27<00:01:08.970> she

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
match on each lane right on lane 27 she

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.090 
match on each lane right on lane 27 she
struck<00:01:09.420> three<00:01:09.630> times<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:10.080> Lane<00:01:10.229> 28<00:01:10.710> she<00:01:10.890> struck

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
struck three times in Lane 28 she struck

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.280 
struck three times in Lane 28 she struck
four<00:01:11.340> times<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.820> I'd<00:01:11.939> say<00:01:12.119> Lane<00:01:12.330> 28<00:01:12.750> happens<00:01:13.140> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
four times so I'd say Lane 28 happens to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.399 
four times so I'd say Lane 28 happens to
be<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> little<00:01:13.710> bit<00:01:13.890> better<00:01:14.010> lean<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.549> her<00:01:14.670> and

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
be a little bit better lean for her and

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.510 
be a little bit better lean for her and
she'll<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.500> starting<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> match<00:01:17.100> there<00:01:17.400> with

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
she'll be starting the match there with

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.109 
she'll be starting the match there with
which<00:01:17.909> means<00:01:18.119> she'll<00:01:18.360> finish<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.930> 27<00:01:20.119> correct

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119

for<00:05:22.380> a<00:05:22.470> very<00:05:22.620> good<00:05:22.680> reason<00:05:22.830> right<00:05:23.220> now

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
for a very good reason right now

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.290 
for a very good reason right now
although<00:05:26.270> unfortunate<00:05:27.270> break<00:05:27.930> their<00:05:28.230> the

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
3679 this is a very difficult spare to

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.020 
3679 this is a very difficult spare to
pick<00:05:33.600> up<00:05:34.130> she<00:05:35.130> seems<00:05:35.430> like<00:05:35.550> she<00:05:35.730> got<00:05:35.850> a<00:05:35.880> little

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
pick up she seems like she got a little

the<00:05:37.710> ball<00:05:37.830> a<00:05:37.890> little<00:05:38.100> bit<00:05:38.280> further<00:05:38.520> right<00:05:38.880> than

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
the ball a little bit further right than

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.170 
the ball a little bit further right than
the<00:05:39.480> shop<00:05:39.720> prior<00:05:40.640> plus<00:05:41.640> it<00:05:41.790> could<00:05:41.910> also

the shop prior plus it could also

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.670 
the shop prior plus it could also
contribute<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:42.870> a<00:05:42.900> little<00:05:43.050> bit<00:05:43.140> of<00:05:43.230> carry<00:05:43.470> down

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
contribute to a little bit of carry down

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.840 
contribute to a little bit of carry down
as<00:05:43.890> well<00:05:44.040> Jan<00:05:44.370> as<00:05:44.550> we<00:05:44.910> discussed<00:05:45.030> earlier<00:05:46.850> now

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
as well Jan as we discussed earlier now

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.460 
as well Jan as we discussed earlier now
she<00:05:47.910> could<00:05:48.300> possibly<00:05:48.540> pick<00:05:49.080> this<00:05:49.260> out

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
she could possibly pick this out

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.470 
she could possibly pick this out
absolutely<00:05:50.160> she<00:05:50.370> has<00:05:50.580> to<00:05:50.730> get<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:51.000> ball<00:05:51.150> going

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
absolutely she has to get the ball going

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.620 
absolutely she has to get the ball going
to<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:51.900> right<00:05:52.080> of<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.470> three<00:05:52.830> pen<00:05:53.130> and<00:05:53.630> slowly

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
to the right of the three pen and slowly

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.860 
to the right of the three pen and slowly
hooking<00:05:55.080> it<00:05:55.230> past<00:05:56.300> that<00:05:57.300> was<00:05:57.450> close<00:05:57.690> almost

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
hooking it past that was close almost

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.050 
hooking it past that was close almost
kicked<00:05:58.800> it<00:05:58.920> out<00:05:58.980> of<00:05:59.100> the<00:05:59.250> gutter<00:06:01.880> if<00:06:02.880> you

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
kicked it out of the gutter if you

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.910 
kicked it out of the gutter if you
noticed<00:06:03.390> earlier<00:06:03.720> they<00:06:03.870> posted<00:06:04.290> her<00:06:04.380> averages

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
noticed earlier they posted her averages

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.830 
noticed earlier they posted her averages
from<00:06:05.430> two<00:06:05.670> thousand<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.180> two<00:06:06.330> thousand<00:06:06.750> one

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
from two thousand to two thousand one

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.780 
from two thousand to two thousand one
season<00:06:07.290> her<00:06:07.710> average<00:06:07.920> seemed<00:06:08.310> to<00:06:08.430> be<00:06:08.550> a<00:06:08.580> little

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
season her average seemed to be a little

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.580 
season her average seemed to be a little
bit<00:06:08.970> lower<00:06:09.240> this<00:06:09.510> year<00:06:09.570> but<00:06:09.930> that<00:06:10.080> contributes

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
bit lower this year but that contributes

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.430 
bit lower this year but that contributes
to<00:06:10.770> sport<00:06:11.100> bowling
