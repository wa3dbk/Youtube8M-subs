00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
by the floating houses I begun to notice

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.490

a<00:01:00.250> lot<00:01:00.370> of<00:01:00.430> green<00:01:01.089> plants<00:01:01.870> floating<00:01:02.290> in<00:01:02.379> the

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
a lot of green plants floating in the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.469 
a lot of green plants floating in the
water<00:01:02.710> they<00:01:03.370> started<00:01:03.729> to<00:01:03.790> get<00:01:03.909> thicker<00:01:04.210> and

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
water they started to get thicker and

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.399 
water they started to get thicker and
thicker<00:01:04.720> and<00:01:05.340> before<00:01:06.340> you<00:01:06.490> knew<00:01:06.670> it<00:01:06.700> we<00:01:07.409> were

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
thicker and before you knew it we were

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.440 
thicker and before you knew it we were
in<00:01:08.530> trouble<00:01:08.710> so<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:12.520> you<00:01:12.729> can<00:01:12.880> see<00:01:12.940> actually

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
in trouble so as you can see actually

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.389 
in trouble so as you can see actually
our<00:01:13.600> pathway<00:01:14.080> is<00:01:14.259> blocked<00:01:14.289> by<00:01:14.890> water

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
our pathway is blocked by water

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.090 
our pathway is blocked by water
hyacinths<00:01:16.140> when<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.289> when<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.530> actually<00:01:17.770> gets

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
hyacinths when it when it actually gets

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.980 
hyacinths when it when it actually gets
like<00:01:18.280> that<00:01:18.520> there's<00:01:19.030> no<00:01:19.270> other<00:01:19.479> way<00:01:19.780> in

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
like that there's no other way in

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.510 
like that there's no other way in
there's<00:01:20.229> no<00:01:20.380> roads<00:01:20.679> there's<00:01:21.130> there's<00:01:21.399> no

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
there's no roads there's there's no

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.609 
there's no roads there's there's no
other<00:01:21.640> way<00:01:21.789> so<00:01:21.850> actually<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.929> people<00:01:23.380> who

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
other way so actually the people who

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.380 
other way so actually the people who
live<00:01:23.800> there<00:01:23.830> currently<00:01:24.369> have<00:01:24.850> very<00:01:25.149> little

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
live there currently have very little

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.180 
live there currently have very little
access<00:01:25.600> here<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.409> people<00:01:26.710> who<00:01:26.800> live<00:01:26.979> over

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
access here and the people who live over

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.790 
access here and the people who live over
here<00:01:27.550> have<00:01:28.000> very<00:01:28.420> little<00:01:28.600> access<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:29.110> them<00:01:29.409> so

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
here have very little access to them so

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.910 
here have very little access to them so
it's<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.190> kind<00:01:31.030> of<00:01:31.090> a<00:01:31.210> unique<00:01:31.509> situation<00:01:31.929> to<00:01:32.740> be

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
it's a kind of a unique situation to be

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.350 
it's a kind of a unique situation to be
in<00:01:32.950> so<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:34.509> we<00:01:34.810> need<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.020> turn<00:01:35.229> around<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:36.700> we

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
in so we we need to turn around as we

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.779 
in so we we need to turn around as we
drove<00:01:37.630> back<00:01:37.929> I<00:01:38.380> was<00:01:38.890> getting<00:01:39.159> more<00:01:39.550> and<00:01:39.610> more

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
drove back I was getting more and more

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.359 
drove back I was getting more and more
curious<00:01:40.270> about<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.539> floating<00:01:41.020> houses<00:01:41.380> where

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
curious about the floating houses where

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.669 
curious about the floating houses where
the<00:01:42.490> fisherman<00:01:42.970> lived<00:01:43.179> so<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:44.380> were<00:01:44.500> actually

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
the fisherman lived so we were actually

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.380 
the fisherman lived so we were actually
invited<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.520> visit<00:01:45.789> one<00:01:46.270> of<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.450> houses<00:01:48.390> this

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
invited to visit one of the houses this

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.639 
invited to visit one of the houses this
actually<00:01:49.630> is<00:01:49.869> completely<00:01:50.319> self-contained

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
actually is completely self-contained

00:01:50.649 --> 00:02:15.860 
actually is completely self-contained
there's<00:01:51.310> there's<00:01:51.550> no<00:01:51.729> power<00:01:51.970> no<00:01:52.630> cell<00:01:52.869> service

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.020 

even<00:02:16.870> though<00:02:16.989> our<00:02:17.110> pathway<00:02:17.739> was<00:02:17.920> blocked<00:02:18.250> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
even though our pathway was blocked the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.000 
even though our pathway was blocked the
boat<00:02:19.239> tour<00:02:19.540> ended<00:02:19.959> up<00:02:20.080> being<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.620> really

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010
