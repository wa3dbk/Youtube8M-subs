 they are from the operator like the keyboard there is no 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.790

 remember that in very free hands 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.439
 important street we want to use 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.119
 the radio if we do not use the connect 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.729
 more legible the rules functions because 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.659
 basically hands-free that is 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.789
 used as antenna 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.130
 we have to find the box obviously 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.329
 your bus wall charger that also 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.909
 we can get it out through this 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.030
 data collector we connect to the other 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.380
 5 volt usb device side and 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.850
 we have every moment four or five 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:59.220
 things that come with the phone 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:02.970
 we found a micro usb of 2GB 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.640
 and finally the row the pile of 1300 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.100
 milliamperios let's look at the good we can 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.950
 recognize the one that many times soon 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.340
 the sellers of the center that big 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.030
 what they do is take out the original battery and 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.290
 change it for a china or generic like that 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.870
 they can take place in the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.060
 original author price of cash one 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.240
 cheap economic pile so that later you 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.590
 have to go back and buy another pillar 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.110
 another thing they do are the ones in the center 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.900
 is to take out the sb many times they sell you 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.209
 cinema headquarters and you get this data cable 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.940
 and forgive and I'll leave it like this 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.770
 only with the hands-free charger 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.740
 of the phone and his hand 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.120
