00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.300
 franco pepe what is the secret of a 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.160
 good pizza then the secret is not there 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.139
 passion could be secret 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.080
 the love for which a product is made a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.400
 anything I put a lot of effort into 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.519
 and I spend a lot of time working 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.260
 of my dough and then of 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.290
 consequence or a result with a good one 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.030
 pizza is important not to say good pizza 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.579
 better than others but certainly 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.350
 good because our goal is 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.160
 that of offering a good product there 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.640
 you have done with seasonings with excellence 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.090
 that can especially guarantee one 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.250
 great digestibility and can give gods 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.070
 true flavors of the various fragrances 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 people who taste my pizza 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.390
 what are the characteristics of yours 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.660
 dough I know it does everything nano yes or in 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.880
 hand meal on the third generation 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.210
 my grandfather and my father doing so me 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.439
 I continue to work by hand in the dough 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.450
 because according to me through this 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.280
 sensory path you succeed in 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.350
 perceive the so-called pasta point 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.640
 you can interpret the flour well 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.580
 and therefore all this 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.500
 let's say it's something that brings you 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.400
 then in the leavening a product 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.950
 the final 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.840
 let's say good what they are instead 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.810
 raw materials that you use in the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.860
 production in the adoration of pizza 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.780
 then part of the flour than that 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.170
 basic that is to choose the flour what 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.250
 very important because the farinati then 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.229
 from an indication of how to work it e 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.659
 how do you get your product for 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.100
 a great digestibility of the product 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.229
 because we pizzaioli 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.579
 we must be we are not chefs but 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.829
 we are artisans we are gods 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.570
 bakers so I mean us 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.070
 we owe the pizza dish of the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.649
 our dough is not a dish of 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.380
 ceramic then the condiments that 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.390
 others do and are good at making them there 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.530
 we must know how to put this dish 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.640
 of pasta that 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.640
 of our dough
