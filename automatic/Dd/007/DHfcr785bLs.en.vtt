going to get out some Adams gray

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.270 
going to get out some Adams gray
superfine<00:03:36.310> dubbing<00:03:37.770> and<00:03:38.770> I'm<00:03:38.830> going<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.010> dub<00:03:39.250> a

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
superfine dubbing and I'm going to dub a

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.520 
superfine dubbing and I'm going to dub a
very<00:03:39.760> thin<00:03:40.210> layer<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.510> dubbing<00:03:41.020> onto<00:03:41.380> the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
very thin layer of dubbing onto the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.770 
very thin layer of dubbing onto the
thread<00:03:41.800> you've<00:03:42.010> got<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.190> be<00:03:42.250> very<00:03:42.280> careful<00:03:42.940> not

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
thread you've got to be very careful not

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.250 
thread you've got to be very careful not
to<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:45.220> overdo<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.760> with<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.240> dubbing<00:03:46.570> it's

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
to to overdo it with the dubbing it's

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.460 
to to overdo it with the dubbing it's
very<00:03:47.500> easy<00:03:47.800> to<00:03:48.010> put<00:03:48.190> too<00:03:48.430> much<00:03:48.580> on<00:03:49.140> get<00:03:50.140> carried

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
very easy to put too much on get carried

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.230 
very easy to put too much on get carried
away<00:03:50.530> with<00:03:50.860> it<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:54.220> I<00:03:54.280> add<00:03:54.460> a<00:03:54.490> fairly<00:03:55.000> thin

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
away with it so I add a fairly thin

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:03.690 
away with it so I add a fairly thin
layer<00:04:01.170> once<00:04:02.170> I've<00:04:02.320> got<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.650> started<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.340> can

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
layer once I've got that started I can

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.160 
layer once I've got that started I can
basically<00:04:03.910> start<00:04:05.310> wrapping<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.780> on<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:08.020> the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
basically start wrapping it on to the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:22.140 
basically start wrapping it on to the
body<00:04:08.350> taper<00:04:09.100> it<00:04:09.280> forward<00:04:09.670> as<00:04:09.820> I<00:04:10.210> wrap<00:04:10.660> forward

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.000 

and<00:04:22.750> if<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:22.990> didn't<00:04:23.169> quite<00:04:23.290> add<00:04:23.530> enough<00:04:23.800> you

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
and if you didn't quite add enough you

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:34.469 
and if you didn't quite add enough you
can<00:04:24.160> just<00:04:24.900> add<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:26.020> little<00:04:26.260> more<00:04:33.210> it's<00:04:34.210> always

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
can just add a little more it's always

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.129 
can just add a little more it's always
better<00:04:34.720> to<00:04:36.030> take<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.180> off<00:04:37.330> if<00:04:37.600> you<00:04:37.660> add<00:04:37.840> too

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
better to take it off if you add too

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.189 
better to take it off if you add too
much<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:40.180> what<00:04:40.300> I'm<00:04:40.389> going<00:04:40.510> to<00:04:40.540> do<00:04:40.690> here<00:04:41.050> is

eye<00:06:04.810> I<00:06:04.960> can<00:06:05.380> capture<00:06:05.650> that<00:06:06.240> that<00:06:07.240> feather<00:06:08.639> lay

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
eye I can capture that that feather lay

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.200 
eye I can capture that that feather lay
down<00:06:09.820> a<00:06:09.849> couple<00:06:10.180> of<00:06:10.300> wraps<00:06:10.510> now<00:06:11.639> I<00:06:12.639> can<00:06:12.970> get<00:06:13.090> in

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
down a couple of wraps now I can get in

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.210 
down a couple of wraps now I can get in
here<00:06:13.240> and<00:06:13.479> trim<00:06:13.870> out<00:06:13.990> this<00:06:14.260> feather<00:06:14.530> to<00:06:14.979> get

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
here and trim out this feather to get

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.550 
here and trim out this feather to get
very<00:06:15.550> close<00:06:15.910> with<00:06:16.180> my<00:06:16.330> scissors<00:06:16.720> to<00:06:16.960> trim<00:06:17.199> it

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
very close with my scissors to trim it

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.760 
very close with my scissors to trim it
out<00:06:17.650> of<00:06:17.800> there<00:06:17.919> usually<00:06:18.669> I<00:06:18.910> have<00:06:19.120> a<00:06:19.180> couple<00:06:19.449> of

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
out of there usually I have a couple of

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.320 
out of there usually I have a couple of
little<00:06:20.770> barbs<00:06:21.220> I've<00:06:21.430> trapped<00:06:21.760> there's<00:06:22.270> a

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
little barbs I've trapped there's a

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.029 
little barbs I've trapped there's a
little<00:06:22.539> trick<00:06:22.750> to<00:06:22.960> get<00:06:23.139> those<00:06:23.349> I'll<00:06:23.680> just<00:06:23.860> take

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
little trick to get those I'll just take

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.909 
little trick to get those I'll just take
my<00:06:24.070> hackle<00:06:24.610> pliers<00:06:24.849> I'll<00:06:25.780> clip<00:06:26.080> into<00:06:26.380> those<00:06:26.590> I

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
my hackle pliers I'll clip into those I

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.909 
my hackle pliers I'll clip into those I
can<00:06:27.430> just<00:06:27.580> pull<00:06:27.760> those<00:06:27.970> out<00:06:28.150> a<00:06:28.680> little<00:06:29.680> bit

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
can just pull those out a little bit

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.850 
can just pull those out a little bit
easier<00:06:30.250> than<00:06:31.110> getting<00:06:32.110> in<00:06:32.320> there<00:06:32.530> with<00:06:32.560> my

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
easier than getting in there with my

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.709 
easier than getting in there with my
scissor<00:06:33.159> this<00:06:33.820> usually<00:06:34.180> breaks<00:06:34.450> them<00:06:34.630> off

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:34.719 
scissor this usually breaks them off

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:36.039 
scissor this usually breaks them off
nice<00:06:34.990> and<00:06:35.200> clean

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:36.049 
nice and clean

00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:39.469 
nice and clean
of<00:06:37.049> course<00:06:37.349> a<00:06:37.819> couple<00:06:38.819> of<00:06:39.029> them<00:06:39.179> are<00:06:39.269> being

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
of course a couple of them are being

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.359 
of course a couple of them are being
stubborn<00:06:39.749> there<00:06:40.139> we<00:06:40.259> go<00:06:40.439> one<00:06:40.919> more<00:06:43.369> can't

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819 
finish to finish off the fly I usually

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:07.939 
finish to finish off the fly I usually
just<00:07:05.969> do<00:07:06.209> three<00:07:06.689> four<00:07:06.899> turn<00:07:07.139> whip<00:07:07.409> finish<00:07:07.709> here

to finish it off and essentially you

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:19.339 
to finish it off and essentially you
have<00:07:12.869> a<00:07:13.429> classic<00:07:15.079> Adam's<00:07:16.079> dry<00:07:16.379> fly<00:07:18.349> fairly

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:19.349 
have a classic Adam's dry fly fairly

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:21.769 
have a classic Adam's dry fly fairly
easy<00:07:19.559> fly<00:07:19.979> to<00:07:20.039> tie<00:07:20.569> probably<00:07:21.569> the<00:07:21.629> most

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:21.779 
easy fly to tie probably the most

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:24.559 
easy fly to tie probably the most
difficult<00:07:22.049> part<00:07:22.319> is<00:07:22.739> the<00:07:23.029> the<00:07:24.029> wings<00:07:24.299> of<00:07:24.509> the

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:24.569 
difficult part is the the wings of the

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.739 
difficult part is the the wings of the
fly<00:07:24.809> and<00:07:25.110> some<00:07:26.009> people<00:07:26.329> argue<00:07:27.329> that<00:07:27.479> you<00:07:27.599> can

00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:27.749 
fly and some people argue that you can

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:30.109 
fly and some people argue that you can
actually<00:07:28.159> skip<00:07:29.159> the<00:07:29.369> wings<00:07:29.579> it's<00:07:29.969> not

00:07:30.109 --> 00:07:30.119 
actually skip the wings it's not

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:32.719 
actually skip the wings it's not
necessary<00:07:30.719> to<00:07:30.979> actually<00:07:31.979> have<00:07:32.129> those<00:07:32.309> but<00:07:32.610> it

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:32.729 
necessary to actually have those but it

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:34.669 
necessary to actually have those but it
gives<00:07:33.299> a<00:07:33.419> good<00:07:33.449> look<00:07:33.719> to<00:07:33.749> the<00:07:33.989> fly<00:07:34.169> you<00:07:34.229> can<00:07:34.379> see

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:34.679 
gives a good look to the fly you can see

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:36.049 
gives a good look to the fly you can see
I<00:07:34.709> tied<00:07:35.039> in<00:07:35.189> those<00:07:35.339> wings<00:07:35.579> a<00:07:35.669> little<00:07:35.879> longer

00:07:36.049 --> 00:07:36.059 
I tied in those wings a little longer

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:36.829 
I tied in those wings a little longer
than<00:07:36.269> the<00:07:36.299> hackle

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:36.839 
than the hackle

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:40.339 
than the hackle
I<00:07:36.869> like<00:07:37.709> those<00:07:37.860> wings<00:07:38.129> to<00:07:38.309> stand<00:07:38.610> up<00:07:39.319> be<00:07:40.319> a

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:40.349 
I like those wings to stand up be a

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:43.579 
I like those wings to stand up be a
little<00:07:40.649> bit<00:07:40.769> more<00:07:40.949> prevalent<00:07:41.550> and<00:07:42.379> that's<00:07:43.379> all

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:43.589 
little bit more prevalent and that's all

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:47.479 
little bit more prevalent and that's all
there<00:07:43.739> is<00:07:43.800> to<00:07:44.189> the<00:07:44.339> classic<00:07:45.149> Adams
