to<00:02:51.010> where<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.280> string<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.700> through<00:02:51.880> just

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
to where you just string it through just

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.400 
to where you just string it through just
like<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.180> floyd<00:02:52.450> lock<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:52.989> down

on<00:02:56.110> my<00:02:56.200> guitar<00:02:56.530> has<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.040> zero<00:02:57.400> fret<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.299> all<00:02:58.600> the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
on my guitar has a zero fret so all the

on my guitar has a zero fret so all the
strings<00:02:59.049> that<00:02:59.260> go<00:02:59.320> in<00:02:59.560> line<00:02:59.799> are<00:03:00.190> actually

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
strings that go in line are actually

actually<00:03:05.470> just<00:03:06.070> I<00:03:06.160> think<00:03:06.370> it's<00:03:06.489> a<00:03:06.640> 64th<00:03:07.239> for

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
actually just I think it's a 64th for

actually just I think it's a 64th for

back<00:03:43.690> which<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.230> really<00:03:44.500> great<00:03:44.620> because<00:03:44.680> I've

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
back which is really great because I've

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
back which is really great because I've
actually<00:03:45.040> already<00:03:45.250> changed<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.640> neck<00:03:45.790> on

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
actually already changed the neck on

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.580 
actually already changed the neck on
this<00:03:46.000> one<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.180> few<00:03:46.359> times<00:03:46.420> when<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:46.840> got<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.470> new

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
this one a few times when I got the new

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.920 
this one a few times when I got the new
body<00:03:47.830> in<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.280> it's<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.910> easiest<00:03:49.209> swap<00:03:49.510> out

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
body in and it's the easiest swap out

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.530 
body in and it's the easiest swap out
I<00:03:50.170> use<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.620> Dunlop<00:03:51.310> locking<00:03:51.700> strap<00:03:51.879> locks<00:03:52.239> and

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
I use a Dunlop locking strap locks and

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.449 
I use a Dunlop locking strap locks and
that<00:03:53.409> basically<00:03:54.040> sums<00:03:54.340> up<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.579> guitar<00:03:56.459> I'm

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
that basically sums up the guitar I'm

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.580 
that basically sums up the guitar I'm
using<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.879> fractal<00:03:58.299> to<00:03:58.450> kind<00:03:59.079> of<00:03:59.110> convenience

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
using the fractal to kind of convenience

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.839 
using the fractal to kind of convenience
on<00:03:59.680> tour<00:03:59.890> I<00:03:59.980> was<00:04:00.159> always<00:04:00.370> having<00:04:00.489> issues<00:04:00.819> with

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
on tour I was always having issues with

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.520 
on tour I was always having issues with
tubes<00:04:01.209> failing<00:04:01.720> on<00:04:01.840> tour<00:04:02.049> because<00:04:02.349> you're

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
tubes failing on tour because you're

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.990 
tubes failing on tour because you're
going<00:04:02.709> from<00:04:02.860> such<00:04:03.069> extreme<00:04:03.519> temperature

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
going from such extreme temperature

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.759 
going from such extreme temperature
changes<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:04.959> went<00:04:05.170> with<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.319> fractal

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
changes so I went with the fractal

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.289 
changes so I went with the fractal
pretty<00:04:06.340> much<00:04:06.519> because<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:06.790> does<00:04:06.909> everything

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
pretty much because it does everything

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.420 
pretty much because it does everything
and<00:04:07.659> its<00:04:07.810> convenience<00:04:08.260> inside<00:04:08.709> of<00:04:08.829> one<00:04:08.950> box<00:04:09.189> we

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
and its convenience inside of one box we

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.740 
and its convenience inside of one box we
don't<00:04:09.579> have<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.790> actually<00:04:09.939> tour<00:04:10.269> with<00:04:10.510> any

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
don't have to actually tour with any

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.449 
don't have to actually tour with any
kind<00:04:11.019> of<00:04:11.079> backline<00:04:11.500> even<00:04:11.799> though<00:04:11.920> on<00:04:12.159> certain

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
kind of backline even though on certain

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.309 
kind of backline even though on certain
tours<00:04:12.700> we<00:04:12.849> do<00:04:13.000> use<00:04:13.180> them<00:04:13.359> but<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.900> main<00:04:14.049> reason

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
tours we do use them but the main reason

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.990 
tours we do use them but the main reason
for<00:04:14.349> the<00:04:14.500> fractal<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.010> not<00:04:15.220> only<00:04:15.489> you<00:04:15.970> can

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
for the fractal is not only you can

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.699 
for the fractal is not only you can
match<00:04:16.299> literally<00:04:16.750> any<00:04:16.840> tone<00:04:17.079> like<00:04:17.289> I've<00:04:17.470> done

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
match literally any tone like I've done

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.199 
match literally any tone like I've done
in<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.160> play<00:04:18.310> thieves<00:04:18.579> you<00:04:18.669> guys<00:04:18.820> can<00:04:19.060> watch

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
in the play thieves you guys can watch

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.360 
in the play thieves you guys can watch
it's<00:04:19.930> matched<00:04:20.229> exactly<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.009> album<00:04:21.250> which

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
it's matched exactly to the album which

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.360 
it's matched exactly to the album which
I've<00:04:21.519> done<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:22.000> then<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:22.990> also<00:04:23.199> use<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.919> MFC

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
I've done and then I also use the MFC

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.790 
I've done and then I also use the MFC
101<00:04:24.699> controller<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.900> control<00:04:26.229> them<00:04:26.410> which<00:04:26.560> is

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
101 controller to control them which is

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.950 
101 controller to control them which is
optional<00:04:27.550> but<00:04:27.760> as<00:04:27.940> far<00:04:28.150> as<00:04:28.180> live<00:04:28.449> performance

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
optional but as far as live performance

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.410 
optional but as far as live performance
you<00:04:29.050> definitely<00:04:29.380> need<00:04:29.500> it

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
now I'm going to play some sound samples

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:44.550 
now I'm going to play some sound samples
of<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.640> pickups<00:04:34.970> this<00:04:35.270> is<00:04:35.420> a<00:04:35.450> 57<00:04:36.140> clean

in with the fractal 210 point Oh
software<00:06:00.810> it's<00:06:01.379> basically<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.919> perfect

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:02.129 
software it's basically the perfect

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:04.490

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
touring tone I use it in recording I use

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.980 
touring tone I use it in recording I use
it<00:06:04.710> in<00:06:04.830> clinics<00:06:05.280> teaching<00:06:05.939> same<00:06:06.539> recording
