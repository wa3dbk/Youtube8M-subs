nice now I kind of show you what put the
aftermath<00:03:04.710> and<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.920> field<00:03:05.160> looks<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:06.350> this

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
aftermath and the field looks like this

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.740 
aftermath and the field looks like this
is<00:03:07.470> where<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.650> mud<00:03:07.830> starts<00:03:08.600> entryway<00:03:09.600> into

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
is where the mud starts entryway into

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.690 
is where the mud starts entryway into
the<00:03:09.840> field<00:03:11.720> got<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.750> bit<00:03:12.960> spot<00:03:13.230> here<00:03:13.560> not<00:03:14.550> too

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the field got a bit spot here not too

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.500 
the field got a bit spot here not too
bad<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.440> then<00:03:16.440> we<00:03:16.680> got<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.980> gate<00:03:17.220> as<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:18.390> can

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
bad and then we got the gate as you can

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.270 
bad and then we got the gate as you can
see<00:03:18.690> it's<00:03:18.960> actually<00:03:19.260> pretty<00:03:19.410> deep<00:03:19.740> right<00:03:19.890> here

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
see it's actually pretty deep right here

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.540 
see it's actually pretty deep right here
but<00:03:21.270> obviously<00:03:21.360> we<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:21.900> powered<00:03:22.230> out<00:03:22.550> so

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
but obviously we just powered out so

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.600 
but obviously we just powered out so
that<00:03:23.640> was<00:03:23.730> no<00:03:23.850> big<00:03:24.060> deal<00:03:25.190> never<00:03:26.190> got<00:03:26.370> stuck

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
that was no big deal never got stuck

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.790 
that was no big deal never got stuck
here<00:03:26.850> that's<00:03:27.090> fine<00:03:27.330> but<00:03:28.290> then<00:03:28.440> again<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.680> was

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
here that's fine but then again I was

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.949 
here that's fine but then again I was
going<00:03:28.950> pretty<00:03:29.310> fast<00:03:30.320> then<00:03:31.320> whenever<00:03:31.650> there

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
going pretty fast then whenever there

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.360 
going pretty fast then whenever there
did<00:03:33.959> some<00:03:34.170> loops<00:03:35.300> came<00:03:36.300> down<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.220> is

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
did some loops came down and this is

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.730 
did some loops came down and this is
where<00:03:38.490> the<00:03:38.580> car<00:03:38.760> was<00:03:38.940> stuck<00:03:39.560> here's<00:03:40.560> the

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
where the car was stuck here's the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:49.130 
where the car was stuck here's the
aftermath<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.250> managed<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.730> dig<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.000> out<00:03:48.140> and

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
aftermath so I managed to dig it out and

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.250 
aftermath so I managed to dig it out and
move<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.560> one<00:03:50.550> card<00:03:50.880> length<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.420> first<00:03:52.080> two

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
move it one card length in the first two

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.620 
move it one card length in the first two
hours<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:52.800> then<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:54.060> got<00:03:54.150> stuck<00:03:54.390> right<00:03:54.600> here

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
hours and then it got stuck right here

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.030 
hours and then it got stuck right here
and<00:03:55.250> then<00:03:56.250> as<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.489> can<00:03:56.670> see<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.620> built<00:03:58.620> up<00:03:58.800> some

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
and then as you can see I built up some

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.750 
and then as you can see I built up some
planks<00:04:00.260> with<00:04:01.260> use<00:04:01.410> my<00:04:01.590> handy<00:04:01.980> dandy<00:04:02.010> costco

right out and just reversed all the way
out<00:04:13.830> I<00:04:14.330> consider<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:15.450> pretty<00:04:16.200> lucky<00:04:16.470> it's

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
out I consider that pretty lucky it's

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.990 
out I consider that pretty lucky it's
good<00:04:16.859> thing<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.070> wasn't<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:17.340> damp<00:04:17.549> over<00:04:17.790> here

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
good thing it wasn't so damp over here
