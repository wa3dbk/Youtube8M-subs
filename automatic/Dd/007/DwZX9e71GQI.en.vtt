00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.610 
interesting story about this is I got it
from<00:05:24.070> monarch<00:05:24.280> under<00:05:25.090> there<00:05:25.210> I'm<00:05:25.419> unique<00:05:25.840> 99

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
from monarch under there I'm unique 99

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.870 
from monarch under there I'm unique 99
silver<00:05:26.979> they<00:05:27.100> have<00:05:27.220> a<00:05:27.250> couple<00:05:27.460> of<00:05:27.550> art<00:05:27.640> bars

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
silver they have a couple of art bars

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.980 
silver they have a couple of art bars
and<00:05:28.120> things<00:05:28.300> and<00:05:28.479> every<00:05:28.630> now<00:05:28.720> and<00:05:28.900> then

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
and things and every now and then

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.250 
and things and every now and then
they'll<00:05:29.740> get<00:05:29.860> an<00:05:29.979> older<00:05:30.190> piece<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:31.120> they<00:05:32.050> had

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
they'll get an older piece and they had

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.430 
they'll get an older piece and they had
this<00:05:32.410> on<00:05:32.620> there<00:05:33.000> for<00:05:34.000> four<00:05:34.450> hundred<00:05:34.840> and<00:05:35.050> forty

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
this on there for four hundred and forty

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.130 
this on there for four hundred and forty
dollars<00:05:35.760> so<00:05:36.760> essentially<00:05:37.360> this<00:05:37.510> ends<00:05:37.750> up<00:05:37.840> when

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
dollars so essentially this ends up when

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.010 
dollars so essentially this ends up when
I<00:05:38.169> purchased<00:05:38.650> it<00:05:38.800> it<00:05:38.979> was<00:05:39.130> right<00:05:39.370> around<00:05:40.020> was

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
I purchased it it was right around was

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.870 
I purchased it it was right around was
that<00:05:41.050> two<00:05:41.380> dollars<00:05:41.680> over<00:05:41.919> spot<00:05:42.190> because<00:05:42.729> I

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
that two dollars over spot because I

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.500 
that two dollars over spot because I
think<00:05:43.120> silver<00:05:43.479> was<00:05:43.600> at<00:05:44.729> 1970<00:05:45.729> when<00:05:46.090> I<00:05:46.120> got<00:05:46.330> this

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510

one so you

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.450 
one so you
not<00:05:47.849> like<00:05:47.999> it's<00:05:48.210> an<00:05:48.719> expensive<00:05:49.409> bar<00:05:49.680> but<00:05:50.370> the

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
not like it's an expensive bar but the

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.920 
not like it's an expensive bar but the
interesting<00:05:50.819> thing<00:05:50.879> is<00:05:51.180> if<00:05:51.300> you<00:05:51.389> go<00:05:51.539> on<00:05:51.629> eBay

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930
