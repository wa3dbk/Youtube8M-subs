hello YouTube my name is Michael Franks

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.360 
hello YouTube my name is Michael Franks
and<00:00:02.909> uh<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.480> made<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.589> video<00:00:04.890> about<00:00:05.100> the

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
and uh I made a video about the

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.330 
and uh I made a video about the
intensifier<00:00:05.879> mod<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:06.480> how<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.980> can<00:00:08.010> mess<00:00:08.309> up

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
intensifier mod and how it can mess up

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.459 
intensifier mod and how it can mess up
pretty<00:00:08.849> easy<00:00:09.030> when<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.360> attach<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.200> suit

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
pretty easy when you attach to the suit

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.249 
pretty easy when you attach to the suit
button<00:00:10.800> right<00:00:10.980> here<00:00:11.690> here<00:00:12.690> if<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.929> do<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.139> to

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
button right here here if you do it to

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.740 
button right here here if you do it to
these<00:00:13.410> no<00:00:13.650> one's<00:00:13.830> well<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.400> does<00:00:14.639> but<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.630> have

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
these no one's well it does but you have

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.109 
these no one's well it does but you have
to<00:00:15.839> get<00:00:15.929> good<00:00:16.109> at<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.740> since<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.760> made<00:00:17.789> that

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
to get good at it and since I made that

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.090 
to get good at it and since I made that
video<00:00:18.240> I've<00:00:18.690> gotten<00:00:19.619> into<00:00:19.800> modding

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
video I've gotten into modding

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.939 
video I've gotten into modding
controllers<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.730> I've<00:00:20.820> gotten<00:00:21.119> better<00:00:21.150> at<00:00:21.390> it

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
controllers and I've gotten better at it

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.570 
controllers and I've gotten better at it
not<00:00:22.949> found<00:00:23.189> out<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:24.890> when<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.980> do<00:00:26.189> not<00:00:26.400> it

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
not found out that when you do not it

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.279 
not found out that when you do not it
it's<00:00:26.760> really<00:00:27.119> hard<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.570> connect<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.170> this

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
it's really hard to connect it to this

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.919 
it's really hard to connect it to this
middle<00:00:28.890> sync<00:00:29.130> button<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.000> know<00:00:30.779> you

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
middle sync button it is I know you

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.240 
middle sync button it is I know you
can't<00:00:31.140> see<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.410> my<00:00:31.560> camera<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.070> there's<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
can't see with my camera but there's a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.170 
can't see with my camera but there's a
middle<00:00:32.399> one<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.880> there<00:00:33.739> right<00:00:34.739> there

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
middle one right in there right there

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.750 
middle one right in there right there
don't<00:00:36.180> come<00:00:36.329> into<00:00:36.480> focus<00:00:36.660> I'm<00:00:37.050> sorry<00:00:37.760> grab

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
don't come into focus I'm sorry grab

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.810 
don't come into focus I'm sorry grab
your<00:00:38.850> camera<00:00:39.210> buddy<00:00:39.510> old<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.489> if<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.610> could

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
your camera buddy old but if you could

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.170 
your camera buddy old but if you could
if<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.360> could<00:00:42.480> see<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.110> right<00:00:43.230> now<00:00:43.489> it<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.969> hard

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
if you could see it right now it is hard

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.790 
if you could see it right now it is hard
to<00:00:45.270> get<00:00:45.420> into<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:45.899> once<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.230> get<00:00:46.320> into<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.649> you

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
to get into but once you get into it you

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.700 
to get into but once you get into it you
get<00:00:47.280> pretty<00:00:47.489> good<00:00:47.550> at<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.110> but

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
get pretty good at it you can do it but

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.150 
get pretty good at it you can do it but
as<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.039> see<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.430> controller<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:52.160> have

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
as you can see on this controller I have

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.860 
as you can see on this controller I have
this<00:00:54.000> little<00:00:54.059> box<00:00:54.480> type<00:00:54.899> deal<00:00:55.110> right<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.610> and

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
this little box type deal right here and

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.569 
this little box type deal right here and
I'm<00:00:57.870> pretty<00:00:58.109> sure<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.620> CG<00:00:59.190> they<00:00:59.370> call

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
I'm pretty sure this is a CG they call

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.360 
I'm pretty sure this is a CG they call
it<00:00:59.789> there's<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.750> matrix<00:01:01.199> i'm<00:01:01.410> not<00:01:01.530> sure<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:01.980> i

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
it there's a matrix i'm not sure but i

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
it there's a matrix i'm not sure but i
just<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.390> connect<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.110> d6

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
just know that you connect it to this d6

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.820 
just know that you connect it to this d6
part<00:01:04.979> right<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.080> all<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.439> lot

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
part right here and it's all a lot

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.429 
part right here and it's all a lot
simpler<00:01:08.369> than<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:10.110> if

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
simpler than this one right here so if

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.010 
simpler than this one right here so if
you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.770> get<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> controller<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:12.020> then

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
you can get a controller with this then

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.929 
you can get a controller with this then
you'll<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> lot<00:01:13.950> better<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.400> modding<00:01:14.820> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
you'll do a lot better at modding it

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.050 
you'll do a lot better at modding it
than<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:16.040> there's<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.159> lot<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.030> lot

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
than this one there's a lot it's a lot

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.320 
than this one there's a lot it's a lot
different<00:01:18.810> trust<00:01:19.350> me<00:01:19.590> that's<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:21.119> made

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
different trust me that's so I just made

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.550 
different trust me that's so I just made
this<00:01:21.479> video<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.140> heard<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> lot<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
this video because I heard a lot of

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.200 
this video because I heard a lot of
people<00:01:22.830> saying<00:01:22.979> oh<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.490> can't<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> doric

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
people saying oh I can't get a doric

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.840 
people saying oh I can't get a doric
connected<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.900> sync<00:01:25.110> button<00:01:25.290> gotta<00:01:26.159> yeah<00:01:26.340> we'll

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
connected a sync button gotta yeah we'll

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.020 
connected a sync button gotta yeah we'll
make<00:01:26.970> sure<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.390> CG<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:28.049> matrix<00:01:28.530> controller

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
make sure it's a CG or matrix controller

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.270 
make sure it's a CG or matrix controller
not<00:01:30.030> possible<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> analysis<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.770> I'll<00:01:32.040> find

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
not possible to analysis but I'll find

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.940 
not possible to analysis but I'll find
it<00:01:32.400> out<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.290> don't<00:01:34.290> know<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> name<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
it out but I don't know the name of it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.080 
it out but I don't know the name of it
but<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.220> how<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.460> connect<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
but I know how to connect it and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.499 
but I know how to connect it and
everything<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.310> make<00:01:38.310> sure<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:39.119> connect<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
everything and make sure you connect it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.420 
everything and make sure you connect it
to<00:01:39.600> either<00:01:39.720> right<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.259> these<00:01:40.439> d6<00:01:41.040> this

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
to either right here these d6 this

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.450 
to either right here these d6 this
little<00:01:41.750> light<00:01:42.750> right<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:42.930> or<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:44.189> very

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
little light right here or the very

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.370 
little light right here or the very
middle<00:01:44.759> one<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.210> these<00:01:45.329> three<00:01:45.540> prongs<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.200> here

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
middle one of these three prongs in here

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.249 
middle one of these three prongs in here
the<00:01:46.590> sync<00:01:46.860> button<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
lie there on the glue add you can see is

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.670 
lie there on the glue add you can see is
to<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> size<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.240> my<00:01:57.390> finger<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.320> seat<00:01:58.530> bottom

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
to the size of my finger the seat bottom

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.580 
to the size of my finger the seat bottom
is<00:01:58.829> pretty<00:01:59.040> small<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.549> sure<00:02:00.240> what<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.899> as<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
is pretty small so sure what I do as I

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.800 
is pretty small so sure what I do as I
sharpen<00:02:02.070> my<00:02:02.189> toothpicks<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.479> helps<00:02:03.719> a

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
sharpen my toothpicks to and it helps a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.789 
sharpen my toothpicks to and it helps a
lot<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.719> when<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.380> do<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.619> these<00:02:07.740> are

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
lot and so just when you do it these are

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.229 
lot and so just when you do it these are
the<00:02:07.950> major<00:02:08.190> problem<00:02:08.700> that's<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.090> major

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the major problem that's the major

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.969 
the major problem that's the major
problems<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.110> intensifier<00:02:10.619> modest

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
problems with the intensifier modest
