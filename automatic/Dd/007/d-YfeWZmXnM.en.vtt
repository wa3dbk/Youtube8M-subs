00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
got corrupted I did not know what

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.289 
got corrupted I did not know what
happened<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.380> had<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.649> go<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.100> crashed<00:01:47.399> we<00:01:48.060> had<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
happened I had to go it crashed we had a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.760 
happened I had to go it crashed we had a
game<00:01:48.600> save<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:50.509> game<00:01:51.509> save<00:01:51.750> backup<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.530> didn't

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
game save and game save backup it didn't

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.609 
game save and game save backup it didn't
work<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.640> crashed<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.329> launch<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.290> I'm

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
work it just crashed at launch so I'm

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.810 
work it just crashed at launch so I'm
thinking<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.630> related<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.820> crashing

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
thinking that is related to the crashing

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.630 
thinking that is related to the crashing
with<00:01:59.939> fraps<00:02:00.270> as<00:02:00.780> there<00:02:01.619> might<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.100> line<00:02:02.460> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
with fraps as there might be a line of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.089 
with fraps as there might be a line of
code<00:02:02.880> that's<00:02:03.409> incompatible<00:02:04.409> or<00:02:05.270> of<00:02:06.270> such<00:02:07.039> so<00:02:08.039> I

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
code that's incompatible or of such so I

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.839 
code that's incompatible or of such so I
just<00:02:08.459> tested<00:02:08.849> out<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849
