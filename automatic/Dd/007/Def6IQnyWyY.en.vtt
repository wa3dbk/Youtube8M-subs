this<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.680> tutorial<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.460> how<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> mod<00:00:26.970> your

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
this is the tutorial on how to mod your

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.230 
this is the tutorial on how to mod your
Shane<00:00:27.930> shot<00:00:28.199> deal<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.820> alright<00:00:29.820> so

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
Shane shot deal with you alright so

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.810 
Shane shot deal with you alright so
basically<00:00:30.830> for<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.890> forum<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:32.460> I'm<00:00:32.669> gonna

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
basically for the forum one I'm gonna

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.080 
basically for the forum one I'm gonna
get<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.420> first<00:00:34.399> it<00:00:35.399> was<00:00:35.550> pretty<00:00:35.820> simple

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
get to that first it was pretty simple

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.490 
get to that first it was pretty simple
I'm<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:37.290> gonna<00:00:37.380> take<00:00:37.649> two<00:00:37.829> random<00:00:37.950> pieces

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
I'm just gonna take two random pieces

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.680 
I'm just gonna take two random pieces
you<00:00:40.500> just<00:00:40.530> stand<00:00:41.040> down<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.489> corners<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
you just stand down the corners the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.910 
you just stand down the corners the
inner<00:00:42.840> corners<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.950> 2x2<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:45.270> they<00:00:46.200> split

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
inner corners of the 2x2 so they split

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.220 
inner corners of the 2x2 so they split
like<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.629> two<00:00:49.020> more

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
like that and I'm going to get two more

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.229 
like that and I'm going to get two more
pieces<00:00:49.579> or<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:51.570> more<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.989> then<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:54.260> laid<00:00:55.260> up

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
pieces or one more and then I laid up

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.430 
pieces or one more and then I laid up
and<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.360> basically<00:00:58.100> what<00:00:59.100> happens<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.760> when

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
and so basically what happens is when

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.260 
and so basically what happens is when
you<00:01:01.440> get<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.660> wide<00:01:03.660> opening<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.040> your<00:01:05.970> cube

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you get a wide opening so you your cube

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.109 
you get a wide opening so you your cube
will<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.510> able<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.049> corner<00:01:07.229> cut<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
will be able to corner cut but with the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.270 
will be able to corner cut but with the
thing<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> chainsaw<00:01:09.689> -<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.170> -<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:11.100> all

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
thing with the chainsaw - but - it all

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.780 
thing with the chainsaw - but - it all
depends<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> interest<00:01:12.869> because<00:01:13.290> you

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
depends with the interest because you

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.420 
depends with the interest because you
can<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.939> two<00:01:15.680> constant<00:01:16.680> mod<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.250> inner

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
can have two constant mod the inner

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.219 
can have two constant mod the inner
layers<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.680> tutorial<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:21.080> mostly<00:01:22.080> about

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
layers so this tutorial is mostly about

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.749 
layers so this tutorial is mostly about
the<00:01:23.100> constant<00:01:23.880> mod<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.659> um<00:01:25.220> really<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.549> is

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
the constant mod so um really this is

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.460 
the constant mod so um really this is
the<00:01:27.259> change<00:01:28.259> channel<00:01:28.560> TYT<00:01:28.829> core<00:01:30.290> not<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the change channel TYT core not that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.590 
the change channel TYT core not that
special<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:32.220> directly<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.360> ball

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
special just directly to what do ball

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.069 
special just directly to what do ball
core<00:01:33.840> um<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.420> nothing<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.900> do

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
core um you have you know nothing to do

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.100 
core um you have you know nothing to do
with<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> first<00:01:39.329> step<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.930> want

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
with this so so the first step you want

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.010 
with this so so the first step you want
to<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.530> take<00:01:40.920> apart<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> whole<00:01:41.460> cube

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
to do is take apart the whole cube

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.620 
to do is take apart the whole cube
I<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.680> sorting<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.520> my<00:01:44.549> pieces<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.479> not

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
I like sorting out my pieces so it's not

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.359 
I like sorting out my pieces so it's not
so<00:01:45.899> hard<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.829> look<00:01:47.130> through<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
so hard to just like look through the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.069 
so hard to just like look through the
pile<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.149> get<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.960> uh<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> what<00:01:51.840> we're<00:01:51.990> gonna

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
pile and get it uh so what we're gonna

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.030 
pile and get it uh so what we're gonna
do<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.619> sand<00:01:52.979> down<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.610> edge<00:01:53.880> pieces<00:01:55.040> okay

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
do is sand down the edge pieces okay

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
do is sand down the edge pieces okay
well<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:57.119> these<00:01:57.240> edge<00:01:57.479> pieces<00:01:58.880> this<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
well for these edge pieces this on the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.560 
well for these edge pieces this on the
left<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:02.159> constant<00:02:02.700> modern<00:02:03.030> edge<00:02:03.299> piece

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
left is the constant modern edge piece

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.899 
left is the constant modern edge piece
and<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> right<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.979> unconsummated

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
and on the right is the unconsummated

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
and on the right is the unconsummated
and<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.600> can<00:02:06.780> tell<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> difference<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.680> just

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and you can tell the difference is just

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.150 
and you can tell the difference is just
by<00:02:08.099> looking<00:02:08.459> at<00:02:08.670> it

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
by looking at it

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.290 
by looking at it
here<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.520> mean<00:02:10.120> one<00:02:10.510> is<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:11.140> lot<00:02:11.380> rounder<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
here I mean one is a lot rounder and the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.400 
here I mean one is a lot rounder and the
other<00:02:13.420> this<00:02:13.780> one<00:02:13.990> is<00:02:14.290> rectangular<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.310> plus

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
other this one is rectangular and plus

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.870 
other this one is rectangular and plus
the<00:02:17.410> edge<00:02:17.560> piece<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.070> lot<00:02:18.400> more<00:02:18.580> blocker

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
the edge piece is a lot more blocker

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.810 
the edge piece is a lot more blocker
than<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.540> one<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:20.050> shaved<00:02:20.560> down<00:02:20.770> this<00:02:21.460> whole

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
than this one I shaved down this whole

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.380 
than this one I shaved down this whole
centerpiece<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.800> know<00:02:24.460> interact<00:02:25.120> there's

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
centerpiece so you know interact there's

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.300 
centerpiece so you know interact there's
no<00:02:25.510> interaction<00:02:26.170> with<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.740> edge<00:02:26.860> piece<00:02:27.100> and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
no interaction with the edge piece and

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.560 
no interaction with the edge piece and
the<00:02:27.550> core<00:02:29.130> okay<00:02:30.130> well<00:02:30.580> now<00:02:30.850> we're<00:02:31.030> gonna<00:02:31.150> stand

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
the core okay well now we're gonna stand

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:39.630 
the core okay well now we're gonna stand
the<00:02:32.550> SP<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:35.650> um<00:02:36.450> fans<00:02:37.450> down<00:02:37.690> see<00:02:38.640> what

I'm<00:02:40.390> not<00:02:40.540> gonna<00:02:40.690> stand<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:40.990> all<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.200> way

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
I'm not gonna stand it all the way

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.370 
I'm not gonna stand it all the way
because<00:02:41.850> in<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.030> last<00:02:43.210> clip<00:02:43.450> we<00:02:43.660> saw<00:02:43.930> what<00:02:44.230> its

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
because in the last clip we saw what its

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:52.140 
because in the last clip we saw what its
gonna<00:02:44.650> look<00:02:44.800> like<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:48.750> yeah<00:02:50.490> alright<00:02:51.490> so<00:02:51.850> now

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
gonna look like and yeah alright so now

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.510 
gonna look like and yeah alright so now
we're<00:02:52.390> gonna<00:02:52.510> sand<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.380> edge<00:02:53.500> because<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:54.340> like

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
we're gonna sand the edge because I like

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.970 
we're gonna sand the edge because I like
it<00:02:54.550> all<00:02:54.790> around<00:02:55.140> when<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.200> it's<00:02:56.410> round<00:02:56.710> it<00:02:56.950> has

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
it all around when you it's round it has

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.010 
it all around when you it's round it has
less<00:02:57.460> friction<00:02:57.700> with<00:02:58.090> other<00:02:58.210> parts<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:58.900> it

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
less friction with other parts and it

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:06.620 
less friction with other parts and it
allows<00:02:59.710> it<00:02:59.740> to<00:02:59.950> corner<00:03:00.310> cut<00:03:00.930> rather<00:03:02.130> smoothly

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:17.670 

and<00:03:07.680> scrape-up<00:03:08.680> degrees<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.750> just<00:03:17.350> do<00:03:17.620> all

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
and scrape-up degrees and just do all

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.290 
and scrape-up degrees and just do all
day

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300

okay guys well I'm done with the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.090 
okay guys well I'm done with the
constant<00:03:21.730> mod<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:23.320> only<00:03:23.590> thing<00:03:23.800> I<00:03:23.920> did

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
constant mod the only thing I did

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.620 
constant mod the only thing I did
differently<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.970> didn't<00:03:25.210> tell<00:03:25.390> you<00:03:25.480> guys

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
I'm sorry is the corners the corners

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.670 
I'm sorry is the corners the corners
I<00:03:30.490> just<00:03:30.820> sanded<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:35.080> sharp<00:03:35.320> edges<00:03:35.500> to

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
I just sanded the the sharp edges to

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.460 
I just sanded the the sharp edges to
make<00:03:35.890> them<00:03:35.950> blunt<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:37.660> sent<00:03:38.080> it<00:03:38.200> off<00:03:38.320> the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
make them blunt and I sent it off the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.100 
make them blunt and I sent it off the
tips<00:03:38.770> and<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:40.000> think<00:03:40.270> in<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.450> video<00:03:40.690> in<00:03:40.840> the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
tips and I think in the video in the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.330 
tips and I think in the video in the
beginning<00:03:41.230> of<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.650> video<00:03:41.770> you<00:03:42.010> can<00:03:42.070> see<00:03:42.310> how

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
beginning of the video you can see how

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.380 
beginning of the video you can see how
pointy<00:03:43.000> they<00:03:43.120> all<00:03:43.390> work<00:03:43.660> no<00:03:44.440> they're<00:03:44.710> all<00:03:44.890> flat

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
pointy they all work no they're all flat

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.340 
pointy they all work no they're all flat
and<00:03:46.390> all<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.860> edge<00:03:48.010> pieces<00:03:48.040> are<00:03:48.580> flat<00:03:49.350> you

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
and all the edge pieces are flat you

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.680 
and all the edge pieces are flat you
know<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:51.990> they're<00:03:52.990> more<00:03:53.290> like<00:03:53.590> an<00:03:53.890> alpha<00:03:54.280> cube

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
know and they're more like an alpha cube

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.110 
know and they're more like an alpha cube
so<00:03:55.690> let's<00:03:56.140> put<00:03:56.440> this<00:03:56.530> together<00:03:56.710> and<00:03:57.250> just<00:03:57.940> it

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
so let's put this together and just it

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.900 
so let's put this together and just it
out<00:03:58.680> okay<00:03:59.710> well<00:04:00.010> this<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.460> constant

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
out okay well this is the constant

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.790 
out okay well this is the constant
modded<00:04:01.240> slash<00:04:01.720> Florian<00:04:02.560> modded<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.640> by<00:04:03.790> to

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
modded slash Florian modded to by to

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.090 
modded slash Florian modded to by to
change<00:04:05.800> out<00:04:06.070> to<00:04:06.220> button<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:08.410> improved<00:04:08.860> on

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
change out to button and it improved on

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.770 
change out to button and it improved on
a<00:04:09.550> couple<00:04:10.270> things

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
a couple things

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.490 
a couple things
and<00:04:11.160> that's<00:04:12.160> corner-cutting<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:13.570> can<00:04:13.810> ease<00:04:14.230> it

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
and that's corner-cutting it can ease it

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.870 
and that's corner-cutting it can ease it
with<00:04:14.890> ease<00:04:15.250> cut<00:04:15.970> 45<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:18.959> don't<00:04:20.310> well<00:04:21.310> you

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
with ease cut 45 and you don't well you

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.780 
with ease cut 45 and you don't well you
really<00:04:22.330> don't<00:04:22.630> need<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:22.930> iron<00:04:23.230> cut<00:04:23.530> 45<00:04:23.800> but

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
really don't need to iron cut 45 but

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.030 
really don't need to iron cut 45 but
just<00:04:25.480> get<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.870> have<00:04:26.050> that<00:04:26.080> honestly<00:04:26.680> was<00:04:26.740> you

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
just get to have that honestly was you

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.190 
just get to have that honestly was you
me<00:04:27.520> read<00:04:28.450> straight<00:04:29.460> is<00:04:30.460> that<00:04:30.760> I<00:04:31.030> mean<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:32.110> think

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
me read straight is that I mean I think

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.150 
me read straight is that I mean I think
I<00:04:32.380> can<00:04:33.480> it<00:04:34.480> can<00:04:34.600> almost<00:04:34.750> go<00:04:35.020> more<00:04:35.230> but<00:04:35.410> on<00:04:35.980> the

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
I can it can almost go more but on the

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.080 
I can it can almost go more but on the
red<00:04:36.840> best<00:04:37.840> easiest<00:04:38.830> side<00:04:39.130> suit<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:39.790> want<00:04:40.030> to

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
red best easiest side suit you want to

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.700 
red best easiest side suit you want to
cut<00:04:40.210> on<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:41.430> green<00:04:42.430> not<00:04:43.300> so<00:04:43.540> much<00:04:43.750> because<00:04:43.990> it

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
cut on and green not so much because it

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.050 
cut on and green not so much because it
sounds<00:04:44.980> different<00:04:45.190> corner<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.840> orange<00:04:47.740> is

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
sounds different corner and orange is

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.490 
sounds different corner and orange is
really<00:04:49.060> good<00:04:49.360> too<00:04:50.640> and<00:04:51.640> it<00:04:52.330> also<00:04:52.510> improved<00:04:53.290> on

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
really good too and it also improved on

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.100 
really good too and it also improved on
speed<00:04:54.030> alright<00:04:55.030> so<00:04:55.300> here<00:04:55.510> I<00:04:55.540> got<00:04:55.720> my<00:04:55.810> cube
