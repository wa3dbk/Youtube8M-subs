to maybe buy a yearling from the sales

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.230 
to maybe buy a yearling from the sales
because<00:00:10.590> what<00:00:11.219> what<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.400> find<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.059> buy

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
because what what I find is you buy

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.180 
because what what I find is you buy
these<00:00:12.300> horses<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:13.080> put<00:00:13.230> into<00:00:13.469> training<00:00:13.710> and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
these horses you put into training and

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.099 
these horses you put into training and
you<00:00:14.460> end<00:00:14.639> up<00:00:14.820> probably<00:00:15.179> getting<00:00:15.540> one<00:00:15.690> running

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
you end up probably getting one running

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.660 
you end up probably getting one running
when<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.740> two-year-old<00:00:17.130> at<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> end<00:00:17.609> of

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
when it's a two-year-old at the end of

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.939 
when it's a two-year-old at the end of
the<00:00:17.760> season<00:00:20.840> because<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:22.080> know<00:00:22.260> if<00:00:22.320> you've

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the season because you know if you've

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.500 
the season because you know if you've
been<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.220> sales<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.640> think<00:00:23.820> minute<00:00:24.060> they<00:00:24.359> won't

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
been to sales I think minute they won't

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.170 
been to sales I think minute they won't
really<00:00:24.689> try<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.960> be<00:00:25.199> early<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> yours<00:00:25.920> yes<00:00:26.430> but

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
really try to be early to yours yes but

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.910 
really try to be early to yours yes but
even<00:00:27.300> early<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.840> our<00:00:27.930> standing<00:00:28.439> six<00:00:28.680> seven

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
even early to our standing six seven

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
even early to our standing six seven
months<00:00:29.010> at<00:00:29.220> our<00:00:29.340> training<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> race<00:00:29.910> right

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
months at our training for a race right

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.040 
months at our training for a race right
so<00:00:30.990> generally<00:00:31.759> ma<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.540> probably<00:00:33.809> I

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
so generally ma but I can probably I

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.360 
so generally ma but I can probably I
could<00:00:34.260> do<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.500> I've<00:00:34.590> done<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.829> before<00:00:34.920> three

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
could do it I've done it before three

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
could do it I've done it before three
months<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:36.390> get<00:00:36.480> an<00:00:36.600> Australian<00:00:36.989> for<00:00:37.140> racing

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
months to get an Australian for racing

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.340 
months to get an Australian for racing

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
so three man if there wasn't nothing it

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.590 
so three man if there wasn't nothing it
was<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.950> three-month<00:00:41.190> period<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.420> horse

about<00:02:03.420> backing<00:02:03.930> because<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.229> was<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
about backing because I was here the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.530 
about backing because I was here the
concept<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.400> breaking<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.270> subtle

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
concept of breaking it's subtle

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.510 
concept of breaking it's subtle
another<00:02:06.840> difference<00:02:07.409> between<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:08.340> way<00:02:08.459> you

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
another difference between the way you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.900 
another difference between the way you
train<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.569> South<00:02:09.929> Africa<00:02:10.289> was<00:02:10.730> something<00:02:11.730> new

train in South Africa was something new
I<00:02:11.940> think<00:02:12.180> worldwide<00:02:12.840> coming<00:02:13.260> hope<00:02:13.500> well

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I think worldwide coming hope well

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.199 
I think worldwide coming hope well
should<00:02:14.190> go<00:02:14.310> world<00:02:14.550> world<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.850> think<00:02:15.060> yes<00:02:15.180> that

one<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.220> your<00:02:53.340> fillies<00:02:53.790> which<00:02:54.030> was

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
one of your fillies which was

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.960 
one of your fillies which was
fascinating<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.440> see<00:02:55.709> what<00:02:56.040> what<00:02:56.670> she<00:02:56.819> was

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970

doing
so<00:02:57.780> quite<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:57.989> tricky<00:02:58.350> funny<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.709> get<00:02:58.799> into<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
so quite a tricky funny to get into the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.830 
so quite a tricky funny to get into the
stores<00:02:59.459> isn't<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.880> yeah<00:03:00.239> it's<00:03:00.630> always<00:03:00.750> a

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
stores isn't it yeah it's always a

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:10.640 
stores isn't it yeah it's always a
because<00:03:08.930> generally<00:03:09.930> sometimes<00:03:10.320> if<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.500> go

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
because generally sometimes if you go

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.289 
because generally sometimes if you go
out<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:10.829> stud<00:03:11.220> farm<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.579> you<00:03:11.640> watched<00:03:11.820> before
