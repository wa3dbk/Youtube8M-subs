 what to do is drop the liquid and look 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.750
 if drawings are formed if they are formed

 to put it in the molds the molds 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:59.040
 what you can use are molds 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:01.410
 of this type or of plastic so that 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.360
 then it is easy to disassemble the 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:11.120
 unmold them once we have the 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.120

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.210
 in each of the soaps 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:33.410
 according to the proportion of smell that we want 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.410
 and we mix it 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.160
 in the same way you can add others 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.180

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.670
 it dries 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.099
 once they dry you can 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.920
 demold well here we have the soaps 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:05.120
