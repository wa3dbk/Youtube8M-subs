through<00:03:53.520> was<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.120> primarily<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.230> was<00:03:55.380> a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
through was that primarily it was a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.920 
through was that primarily it was a
single<00:03:56.040> isolated<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:57.000> relatively<00:03:57.720> dense

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
single isolated and relatively dense

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.540 
single isolated and relatively dense
floater<00:03:58.410> which<00:03:58.950> gave<00:03:59.160> me<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.310> very

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
floater which gave me a very

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.730 
floater which gave me a very
well-defined<00:04:00.030> target<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.959> also<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.620> was

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
well-defined target and also it was

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.280 
well-defined target and also it was
located<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.760> anterior<00:04:03.180> or<00:04:03.330> front<00:04:03.480> half<00:04:04.110> of

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
located in the anterior or front half of

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.410 
located in the anterior or front half of
the<00:04:04.350> eye<00:04:04.380> rather<00:04:04.830> than<00:04:05.070> further<00:04:05.490> back<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:06.390> I

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
the eye rather than further back so I

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.850 
the eye rather than further back so I
was<00:04:06.600> still<00:04:06.780> able<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:06.990> get<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.170> laser<00:04:07.380> energy

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
was still able to get the laser energy

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.960 
was still able to get the laser energy
on<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:09.650> this<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:10.830> actually<00:04:11.220> fairly<00:04:11.520> dense

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
on it and this is actually fairly dense

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.650 
on it and this is actually fairly dense
and

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
and

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.120 
and
so<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.930> have<00:04:13.050> to<00:04:13.110> kind<00:04:13.290> of<00:04:13.320> keep<00:04:13.590> working<00:04:14.010> in

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
so you have to kind of keep working in

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.320 
so you have to kind of keep working in
and<00:04:14.310> keep<00:04:14.460> working<00:04:14.610> it'll<00:04:15.000> just<00:04:15.150> disappear

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
and keep working it'll just disappear

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.910 
and keep working it'll just disappear
and<00:04:15.750> kind<00:04:15.990> of<00:04:16.050> drop<00:04:16.200> back<00:04:16.380> down<00:04:16.530> in<00:04:16.709> place

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
and kind of drop back down in place

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.800 
and kind of drop back down in place
again<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.090> just<00:04:18.330> have<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.540> very

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
again and so you just have to very

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.080 
again and so you just have to very
tedious<00:04:19.380> Li<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:19.860> laborious<00:04:20.100> Li<00:04:20.430> go<00:04:20.640> after<00:04:21.000> it

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
tedious Li and laborious Li go after it

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.640 
tedious Li and laborious Li go after it
again<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:21.930> again<00:04:22.170> and<00:04:22.290> again

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
again and again and again

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.560 
again and again and again
just<00:04:23.100> you'll<00:04:23.400> see<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.790> with<00:04:24.030> some<00:04:24.450> of<00:04:24.510> the

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
just you'll see that with some of the

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.240 
just you'll see that with some of the
laser<00:04:24.690> impact<00:04:25.170> there<00:04:25.290> will<00:04:25.380> be<00:04:25.410> some<00:04:25.740> little

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
laser impact there will be some little

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.490 
laser impact there will be some little
bubbles<00:04:26.550> you'll<00:04:26.670> see<00:04:26.820> floating<00:04:27.090> upwards<00:04:27.500> this

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
bubbles you'll see floating upwards this

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.350 
bubbles you'll see floating upwards this
patient<00:04:28.860> will<00:04:28.950> actually<00:04:29.310> see<00:04:29.640> little<00:04:30.030> specks

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
patient will actually see little specks

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.720 
patient will actually see little specks
little<00:04:31.050> black<00:04:31.230> specks<00:04:31.560> falling<00:04:32.070> or<00:04:32.400> appear<00:04:32.640> to

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
little black specks falling or appear to

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.430 
little black specks falling or appear to
be<00:04:32.820> falling<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.300> they're<00:04:33.930> actually<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.290> gas

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
be falling and they're actually the gas

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.170 
be falling and they're actually the gas
bubbles<00:04:34.830> that<00:04:34.920> are<00:04:34.980> rising<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:36.090> the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
bubbles that are rising to the to the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.660 
bubbles that are rising to the to the
roof<00:04:36.330> of<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.570> eye<00:04:37.250> it's<00:04:38.250> kind<00:04:38.370> of<00:04:38.400> interesting

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
roof of the eye it's kind of interesting

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.670 
roof of the eye it's kind of interesting
to<00:04:38.880> watch<00:04:39.090> but<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:39.840> is<00:04:39.990> actually<00:04:40.440> the

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
to watch but that is actually the

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.180 
to watch but that is actually the
intended<00:04:41.450> product<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:43.200> laser<00:04:43.380> we<00:04:43.800> are

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
intended product of the laser we are

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.270 
intended product of the laser we are
converting<00:04:44.760> solids<00:04:45.590> directly<00:04:46.590> into<00:04:46.830> gases

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
converting solids directly into gases

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.830 
converting solids directly into gases
sublimating<00:04:47.850> them<00:04:47.970> directly<00:04:48.240> in<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.450> gas<00:04:48.630> is

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
sublimating them directly in the gas is

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.150 
sublimating them directly in the gas is
probably<00:04:49.110> carbon<00:04:49.440> dioxide<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.860> little<00:04:50.010> bit<00:04:50.100> of

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
probably carbon dioxide a little bit of

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.670 
probably carbon dioxide a little bit of
nitrogen<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.810> as<00:04:51.810> they<00:04:51.930> float<00:04:52.170> away<00:04:52.260> they'll

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
nitrogen and as they float away they'll

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.900 
nitrogen and as they float away they'll
remain<00:04:52.950> at<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.160> roof<00:04:53.310> of<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.520> eye<00:04:53.550> for

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
remain at the roof of the eye for

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.600 
remain at the roof of the eye for
approximately<00:04:54.690> fifteen<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:56.160> thirty<00:04:56.190> minutes

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
approximately fifteen to thirty minutes

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.810 
approximately fifteen to thirty minutes
or<00:04:56.850> so<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.120> they<00:04:57.330> just<00:04:57.540> disappear<00:04:58.170> so<00:04:59.100> as<00:04:59.670> I

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
or so and they just disappear so as I

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.340 
or so and they just disappear so as I
keep<00:04:59.970> working<00:05:00.120> on<00:05:00.330> this<00:05:00.510> you'll<00:05:00.750> see<00:05:00.840> that

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
keep working on this you'll see that

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.680 
keep working on this you'll see that
there<00:05:01.650> becomes<00:05:02.340> gradually<00:05:02.760> less<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.510> less<00:05:03.630> of

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
there becomes gradually less and less of

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.010 
there becomes gradually less and less of
that<00:05:03.900> material<00:05:04.470> to<00:05:04.620> work<00:05:04.800> on<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:06.020> this

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
that material to work on and this

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.170 
that material to work on and this
particular<00:05:07.620> treatment<00:05:08.130> lasted<00:05:08.790> probably

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
particular treatment lasted probably

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.700 
particular treatment lasted probably
about<00:05:09.630> 15<00:05:10.290> to<00:05:10.560> 25<00:05:10.860> minutes<00:05:11.400> or<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:11.610> and<00:05:12.530> I<00:05:13.530> was

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
about 15 to 25 minutes or so and I was

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.510 
about 15 to 25 minutes or so and I was
really<00:05:13.890> quite<00:05:14.130> successful<00:05:16.070> this<00:05:17.070> gentleman's

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
really quite successful this gentleman's

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.130 
really quite successful this gentleman's
treatment<00:05:17.880> was<00:05:18.030> a<00:05:18.060> bit<00:05:18.300> of<00:05:18.390> an<00:05:18.480> exception<00:05:18.810> to

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
treatment was a bit of an exception to

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.730 
treatment was a bit of an exception to
the<00:05:19.230> rule

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
the rule

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.760 
the rule
I<00:05:19.770> do<00:05:20.310> like<00:05:20.670> most<00:05:20.940> patients<00:05:21.510> to<00:05:21.780> expect<00:05:22.350> that

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
I do like most patients to expect that

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.590 
I do like most patients to expect that
they<00:05:22.890> will<00:05:23.040> need<00:05:23.280> more<00:05:24.000> than<00:05:24.180> one<00:05:24.330> treatment

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
they will need more than one treatment

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.450 
they will need more than one treatment
two<00:05:25.050> or<00:05:25.140> three<00:05:25.410> would<00:05:25.560> be<00:05:25.590> very<00:05:25.920> typical<00:05:26.370> and

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
two or three would be very typical and

two or three would be very typical and
