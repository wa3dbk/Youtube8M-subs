progress on my secret garden mini in a
book<00:00:17.460> box<00:00:18.920> so<00:00:19.920> I'm<00:00:20.039> working<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:24.199> books<00:00:27.920> so

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
book box so I'm working on the books so

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:37.900 
book box so I'm working on the books so
let's<00:00:30.029> say<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.480> where<00:00:30.869> i<00:00:30.900> am<00:00:31.019> now<00:00:31.199> i<00:00:31.769> have

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.900 

c<00:00:38.910> i<00:00:38.969> Jes<00:00:39.360> owed<00:00:39.710> all<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.100> edges<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.670> think

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
c i Jes owed all the edges I think

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.690 
c i Jes owed all the edges I think
that's<00:00:42.090> where<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.480> left<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:44.000> this<00:00:45.079> these<00:00:46.079> boxes

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.639 

must<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.149> coated<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.719> something<00:00:52.579> so

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
must be like coated with something so

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.170 
must be like coated with something so
they<00:00:55.649> don't<00:00:56.539> accept<00:00:57.539> stuff<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.199> well<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.180> I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
they don't accept stuff so well and so I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.150 
they don't accept stuff so well and so I
just<00:01:00.660> covered<00:01:00.870> everything<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.680> gesso

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
just covered everything with gesso

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.820 
just covered everything with gesso
rather<00:01:02.699> than<00:01:03.049> sometimes<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.199> sand<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.799> that

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
rather than sometimes I sand and that

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.149 
rather than sometimes I sand and that
works<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.869> case<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> just

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
works but in this case and then I just

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.330 
works but in this case and then I just
took<00:01:08.340> brown<00:01:08.970> coat<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.450> paint<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:12.450> went<00:01:13.350> over

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
took brown coat of paint and went over

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:23.179 
took brown coat of paint and went over
all<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> gesso<00:01:17.330> then<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:20.060> cut<00:01:21.060> my<00:01:21.270> pieces<00:01:22.189> for

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
all the gesso then I I cut my pieces for

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.719 
all the gesso then I I cut my pieces for
the<00:01:23.220> front<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> back<00:01:25.369> goes<00:01:26.369> for<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the front and for the back goes for the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:37.190 
the front and for the back goes for the
back<00:01:26.909> view<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.909> I<00:01:34.189> used<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.930> heavy<00:01:36.930> gel

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
back view here and I used this heavy gel

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.020 
back view here and I used this heavy gel
mat<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:39.110> that's<00:01:40.110> how<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.409> applied<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
mat and that's how I applied this so I I

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.960 
mat and that's how I applied this so I I
put<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.630> really<00:01:42.689> heavy<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> put<00:01:44.759> my

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
put it on really heavy and then I put my

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.170 
put it on really heavy and then I put my
paper<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.140> then<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.680> put<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.579> heavy<00:01:47.880> over

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
paper on and then I put it on heavy over

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.149 
paper on and then I put it on heavy over
the<00:01:48.270> top<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.049> actually<00:01:49.290> did<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> second

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the top and then I actually did a second

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.460 
the top and then I actually did a second
coat<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:51.360> one<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.920> very<00:01:53.220> much

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
coat on this one so it's very much

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.929 
coat on this one so it's very much
can<00:01:56.470> take<00:01:56.710> whatever<00:01:56.979> kind<00:01:57.369> of<00:01:57.399> handling<00:01:57.790> you

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
can take whatever kind of handling you

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.870 
can take whatever kind of handling you
dish<00:01:58.149> out<00:01:58.299> to<00:01:58.570> it<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:58.960> then<00:01:59.170> I<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:02.110> I

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
dish out to it and then I here I

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.070 
dish out to it and then I here I
practiced<00:02:03.880> on<00:02:04.030> my<00:02:04.180> little<00:02:04.420> lid<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.810> did<00:02:05.049> a

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
practiced on my little lid I did a

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.170 
practiced on my little lid I did a
couple<00:02:05.229> coats<00:02:05.590> on<00:02:06.040> paper<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.520> tried<00:02:06.970> different

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
couple coats on paper I tried different

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.290 
couple coats on paper I tried different
things<00:02:07.360> on<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.869> edge<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:12.099> I<00:02:12.370> took<00:02:12.430> my<00:02:12.849> very

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
things on the edge and so I took my very

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.770 
things on the edge and so I took my very
bendable<00:02:13.830> stencil<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:16.000> one's<00:02:16.209> about<00:02:16.360> art

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
bendable stencil this one's about art

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.850 
bendable stencil this one's about art
and<00:02:17.849> but<00:02:18.849> it's<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.330> right<00:02:19.540> type<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.290> script

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
and but it's the right type of script

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.690 
and but it's the right type of script
that<00:02:21.010> kind<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.280> goes<00:02:21.489> with<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.170> paper<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:24.519> of

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
that kind of goes with the paper and of

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.220 
that kind of goes with the paper and of
course<00:02:24.880> its<00:02:25.060> bendable<00:02:25.390> here<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:25.900> i<00:02:25.930> just<00:02:26.140> kind

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
course its bendable here so i just kind

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.580 
course its bendable here so i just kind
of<00:02:26.470> laid<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:26.920> across<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.850> i<00:02:28.420> used<00:02:28.630> my<00:02:28.780> stays<00:02:29.350> on

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
of laid it across and i used my stays on

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.930 
of laid it across and i used my stays on
so<00:02:30.040> what<00:02:30.400> would<00:02:30.940> stay<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:32.069> I<00:02:33.069> practice<00:02:33.700> first

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
so what would stay and I practice first

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.820 
so what would stay and I practice first
a<00:02:34.150> little<00:02:34.269> on<00:02:34.510> paper<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.260> see<00:02:35.440> how<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.739> would

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
a little on paper to see how that would

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.170 
a little on paper to see how that would
look<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:38.680> know<00:02:38.709> fold<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.459> over<00:02:39.640> I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
look and I just you know fold it over I

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.780 
look and I just you know fold it over I
used<00:02:40.870> one<00:02:41.049> of<00:02:41.080> these<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.769> I<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:42.069> dabbed<00:02:42.400> some

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
used one of these and I just dabbed some

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.930 
used one of these and I just dabbed some
places<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:44.200> made<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.100> word<00:02:45.250> show<00:02:45.519> up<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.730> little

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
places I made the word show up a little

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.550 
places I made the word show up a little
better<00:02:46.120> than<00:02:46.360> others<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:46.630> then<00:02:46.989> if<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.260> didn't

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
better than others and then if it didn't

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.140 
better than others and then if it didn't
put<00:02:48.010> them<00:02:48.190> out<00:02:48.340> right<00:02:48.549> I<00:02:49.530> needed<00:02:50.580> some<00:02:51.580> more<00:02:51.760> or

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
put them out right I needed some more or

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.789 
put them out right I needed some more or
something<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.630> waited<00:02:52.959> till<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.170> dried<00:02:53.470> and

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
something I waited till it dried and

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.680 
something I waited till it dried and
then<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:54.069> laid<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.340> back<00:02:54.459> on<00:02:54.760> there<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.209> just

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
then I laid it back on there and just

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.080 
then I laid it back on there and just
did<00:02:56.440> where<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:57.040> needed<00:02:57.370> till<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.819> had<00:02:58.060> a

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
did where I needed till I had a

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.580 
did where I needed till I had a
comfortable<00:02:58.390> feel<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:01.019> didn't<00:03:02.019> really<00:03:02.140> want

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
comfortable feel so I didn't really want

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.520 
comfortable feel so I didn't really want

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
it to be readable but it turned out just

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.240

over this whole part to unify it this is

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.479 
over this whole part to unify it this is
why<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.079> thing<00:03:35.079> opens<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:35.890> this<00:03:36.040> one's<00:03:36.250> had

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489
