00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.180
 I 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.910
 I 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.220
 Well 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.839
 Hello and welcome to a third of Hamburg 10 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.179
 I have her the Marko Pavic title ZDF 100 millimeters 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.269
 awakened accompanied by two comas 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.289
 that is for the know who already stands 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.289
 that's why I bet that then bad luck is just attach 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.630
 I can contact directly 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.970
 none with adhesive tape 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.890
 TransFair installation cd MPA Quick Start Guide 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.890
 but that's not so important 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.410
 Well packaged here in one 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 won extra hole 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.360
 Some are so and can find out 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.170
 By the way, do not let my voice put you off I'm a little bit 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.120
 catches 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.340
 So that's the shell for the objective that's bitter when you're with 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.430
 you can 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.430
 easy 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.890
 leather 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.320
 one would then have assured Emco 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.180
 It should be here already 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.600
 the objective Kappel Blender so not so much I'm not a friend from the outside or 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.370
 of the page 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.180
 the facts in the foreground 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 then the percent is the f2 f-stop 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.350
 that is also good as threatening to store and change until I then read 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 i really just lay it too many as sloppiness 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880
 Heat presented to me more easily 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.650
 that's a lot 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.300
 she is Euro 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.130
 here is the manual focus is relatively large, it has to touch and 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.130
 you too 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.210
 Well we can still operate the setting 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.760
 Percentage points more 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.280
 how to set the nerve so again Marko Brecht 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.860
 Autofocus manual focus down stabilizer is still in there 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.310
 very cool i can do a bit now 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.220
 spread 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.589
 compared to 0 percent 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:13.689
 only my look deep 18 to 35 millimeters 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.799
 It will be even a little bit longer, but it will be a lot longer 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.739
 if you then percent 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.099
 every disaster 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.099
 and I do not want to waste any more 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:27.610
 and 2 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.459
 some times briefly to the side 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.749
 Let's take the ball identification numbers there 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.049
 Inter had the title in any case should not be copied off 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:42.729
 alone in any case 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.949
 just hang around 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:48.169
 5 inso 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.169
 sometimes look again 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.309
 you get so good Roth 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.799
 Euro and 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.059
 this is embedded 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.059
 so that's the macro lens on about the Munich 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.209
 The chapel should serve antivirus protection to wars not in the heads 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.719
 Prokop 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:22.189
 said he is here now 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.169
 that that Marco Pecht IV I said so relatively were still for the chamber 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.909
 Piece back and middleman counts 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.129
 and 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.300
 This is exactly where the camera alone now only puts the cap 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.279
 that is very much "We are not far away 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.249
 I will now include a few pictures and some videos for you 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:43.999
 the whole team around Mark Hurd 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.090
 Area goes out otherwise I say 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.090
 Liszt and how her husband Kurt Riechmann commented on an overview 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.619
 and see you next time 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.489
 and 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.459
 Prof 

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:35.289
