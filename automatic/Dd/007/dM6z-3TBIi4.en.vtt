00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
you know talking about working together

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.230 
you know talking about working together
you<00:00:15.950> know<00:00:16.039> what's<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.520> relationship<00:00:16.970> between

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
you know what's the relationship between

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.839 
you know what's the relationship between
the<00:00:17.510> glute<00:00:17.840> and<00:00:17.869> the<00:00:18.349> hip<00:00:18.529> flexors<00:00:18.980> Microflex

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:19.849 
the glute and the hip flexors Microflex

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.940 
the glute and the hip flexors Microflex
is<00:00:20.029> for<00:00:20.150> me<00:00:20.270> is<00:00:20.390> really<00:00:20.630> the<00:00:21.110> Achilles<00:00:21.650> heel<00:00:21.680> of

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
is for me is really the Achilles heel of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.819 
is for me is really the Achilles heel of
cyclists<00:00:22.640> yeah<00:00:22.849> we're<00:00:23.060> we're<00:00:23.570> in<00:00:23.599> this<00:00:23.840> awful

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:24.829 
cyclists yeah we're we're in this awful

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.980 
cyclists yeah we're we're in this awful
position<00:00:24.980> yep<00:00:25.669> you<00:00:26.090> know<00:00:26.180> I<00:00:26.240> at<00:00:26.570> least<00:00:26.720> around

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
position yep you know I at least around

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.269 
position yep you know I at least around
us<00:00:27.079> get<00:00:27.259> the<00:00:27.349> opportunity<00:00:27.710> to<00:00:27.740> stretch<00:00:28.039> it<00:00:28.189> out

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
us get the opportunity to stretch it out

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.290 
us get the opportunity to stretch it out
when<00:00:28.520> they're<00:00:28.700> you<00:00:28.849> know<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.029> hopefully

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
when they're you know the hopefully

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.390 
when they're you know the hopefully
enjoy<00:00:29.480> it<00:00:30.019> they<00:00:30.439> get<00:00:30.590> to<00:00:30.650> stretch<00:00:30.949> it<00:00:31.070> out<00:00:31.189> when

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
enjoy it they get to stretch it out when

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.310 
enjoy it they get to stretch it out when
you're<00:00:31.490> striding<00:00:32.029> so<00:00:32.210> they<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:32.840> hip<00:00:33.019> flex<00:00:33.230> is

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
you're striding so they so hip flex is

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.259 
you're striding so they so hip flex is
being<00:00:33.530> stretched<00:00:33.800> stretch<00:00:34.400> out<00:00:34.550> but<00:00:34.699> cyclists

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
being stretched stretch out but cyclists

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.180 
being stretched stretch out but cyclists
are<00:00:35.360> on<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:35.629> bike<00:00:35.780> yeah<00:00:36.379> then<00:00:36.589> this<00:00:36.769> in<00:00:37.070> this

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
are on the bike yeah then this in this

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.560 
are on the bike yeah then this in this
sort<00:00:37.339> of<00:00:37.460> compressed<00:00:37.850> moment<00:00:38.210> where<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.390> hip

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
sort of compressed moment where the hip

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.060 
sort of compressed moment where the hip
flexors<00:00:38.930> just<00:00:39.170> sort<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.379> going<00:00:39.589> you<00:00:39.830> know<00:00:39.920> the

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
flexors just sort of going you know the

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.890 
flexors just sort of going you know the
upper<00:00:40.430> legs<00:00:40.670> going<00:00:41.059> like<00:00:41.210> that<00:00:41.239> yeah<00:00:41.660> and

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
upper legs going like that yeah and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.420 
upper legs going like that yeah and
their<00:00:42.140> body<00:00:42.320> is<00:00:42.440> just<00:00:42.620> sitting<00:00:42.860> on<00:00:42.949> top<00:00:43.010> of<00:00:43.220> it

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
their body is just sitting on top of it

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.279 
their body is just sitting on top of it
trying<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.699> stabilize<00:00:43.970> it<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:44.510> you<00:00:45.200> know

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
trying to stabilize it so you know

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.049 
trying to stabilize it so you know
you're<00:00:45.469> in<00:00:45.559> this<00:00:45.649> position<00:00:45.860> we<00:00:46.219> just<00:00:46.610> really

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
you're in this position we just really

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.850 
you're in this position we just really
it's<00:00:47.420> shortened<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:47.989> shortened<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.739> whole

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
it's shortened to shortened the whole

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.799 
it's shortened to shortened the whole
time<00:00:49.129> yeah<00:00:49.399> so<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.300> relationship<00:00:50.780> between

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
time yeah so the relationship between

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.540 
time yeah so the relationship between
the<00:00:51.170> hip<00:00:51.289> flicks<00:00:51.500> now<00:00:51.680> my<00:00:51.860> understanding<00:00:52.460> is

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
the hip flicks now my understanding is

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.610 
the hip flicks now my understanding is
that<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:53.270> hip<00:00:53.449> flexor<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.140> glute<00:00:54.379> work

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
that the hip flexor and the glute work

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.160 
that the hip flexor and the glute work
together<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:55.460> if<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:56.480> can't<00:00:56.750> if<00:00:56.930> you've<00:00:57.050> got<00:00:57.140> a

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
together so if you can't if you've got a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.639 
together so if you can't if you've got a
weak<00:00:57.350> hip<00:00:57.559> flexor<00:00:58.030> then<00:00:59.030> your<00:00:59.239> gluts<00:00:59.649> it's

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
weak hip flexor then your gluts it's

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.709 
weak hip flexor then your gluts it's
gonna<00:01:00.800> be<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:01.489> can't<00:01:01.760> get<00:01:01.910> as<00:01:02.030> much<00:01:02.359> power<00:01:02.690> out

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
gonna be you can't get as much power out

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.990 
gonna be you can't get as much power out
of<00:01:02.870> your<00:01:02.989> glute<00:01:03.230> which<00:01:03.410> is<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.620> body<00:01:04.070> because

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
of your glute which is the body because

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.880 
of your glute which is the body because
sorry<00:01:05.239> big<00:01:05.600> muscle<00:01:05.899> muscle<00:01:06.350> in<00:01:06.470> your<00:01:06.500> body

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
sorry big muscle muscle in your body

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.830 
sorry big muscle muscle in your body
yep<00:01:07.130> yeah<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:08.149> what's<00:01:08.360> your<00:01:08.509> what's<00:01:08.810> your

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
yep yeah so what's your what's your

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.690 
yep yeah so what's your what's your
what's<00:01:08.960> a<00:01:09.380> new<00:01:09.590> take<00:01:09.860> on<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:10.220> now<00:01:10.430> is<00:01:10.580> there

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
what's a new take on that now is there

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.279 
what's a new take on that now is there
any<00:01:10.820> further<00:01:11.240> developments<00:01:11.539> on<00:01:12.080> what's

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
any further developments on what's

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.499 
any further developments on what's
happening<00:01:12.710> with<00:01:12.860> you<00:01:13.490> know<00:01:13.610> with<00:01:14.090> that<00:01:14.300> sort

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
happening with you know with that sort

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:15.910 
happening with you know with that sort
of<00:01:14.570> theory<00:01:14.960> on<00:01:15.050> the<00:01:15.110> glute<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:15.470> hip<00:01:15.590> flexor

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
of theory on the glute and hip flexor

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.050 
of theory on the glute and hip flexor
movement<00:01:16.280> look<00:01:17.650> do<00:01:18.650> they<00:01:18.799> they<00:01:19.130> they<00:01:19.520> do<00:01:19.580> work

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
movement look do they they they do work

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.050 
movement look do they they they do work
together<00:01:20.380> they<00:01:21.380> will<00:01:21.619> not<00:01:21.920> only<00:01:22.100> create<00:01:22.369> or

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
together they will not only create or

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.450 
together they will not only create or
call<00:01:23.360> global<00:01:23.840> movement<00:01:24.200> which<00:01:24.350> is<00:01:24.530> big

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
call global movement which is big

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.100 
call global movement which is big
movement<00:01:25.850> yeah<00:01:26.090> but<00:01:26.659> they'll<00:01:26.810> also

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
movement yeah but they'll also

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.080 
movement yeah but they'll also
dynamically<00:01:27.799> stabilize<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:28.520> hip<00:01:28.670> joint<00:01:28.700> at

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
dynamically stabilize that hip joint at

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.870 
dynamically stabilize that hip joint at
the<00:01:29.150> same<00:01:29.360> time<00:01:29.630> right<00:01:30.020> okay<00:01:30.680> they<00:01:31.430> work<00:01:31.670> in

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
the same time right okay they work in

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.480 
the same time right okay they work in
synergy<00:01:32.180> we<00:01:32.659> used<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:32.990> think<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.259> one<00:01:33.860> muscle

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
synergy we used to think that one muscle

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.920 
synergy we used to think that one muscle
does<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.329> opposite<00:01:35.810> the

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
does this and the opposite the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.130 
does this and the opposite the
antagonist<00:01:36.590> will<00:01:37.189> do<00:01:37.369> that<00:01:37.610> yeah<00:01:37.970> now<00:01:38.299> again

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
antagonist will do that yeah now again

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.770 
antagonist will do that yeah now again
that's<00:01:39.320> looking<00:01:39.740> at<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.009> body<00:01:40.250> in<00:01:40.549> a<00:01:40.880> single

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
that's looking at the body in a single

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.760 
that's looking at the body in a single
plane<00:01:42.310> motion<00:01:43.310> segmented<00:01:44.270> yeah<00:01:44.840> overview<00:01:45.649> of

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
plane motion segmented yeah overview of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.929 
plane motion segmented yeah overview of
what<00:01:45.979> things<00:01:46.220> did<00:01:46.520> okay<00:01:47.979> again<00:01:48.979> it's<00:01:49.430> it's<00:01:49.670> not

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
what things did okay again it's it's not

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.730 
what things did okay again it's it's not
just<00:01:50.240> as<00:01:50.420> simple<00:01:50.630> as<00:01:50.899> looking<00:01:51.049> at<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.590> hip

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
just as simple as looking at the hip

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.010 
just as simple as looking at the hip
what<00:01:51.950> we<00:01:52.100> do<00:01:52.310> need<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.549> look<00:01:52.790> at<00:01:52.939> it<00:01:53.060> yeah<00:01:53.450> okay

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
what we do need to look at it yeah okay

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.990 
what we do need to look at it yeah okay
but<00:01:54.200> we<00:01:54.320> also<00:01:54.500> got<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.799> consider<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.850> other

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
but we also got to consider the other

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.450 
but we also got to consider the other
factors<00:01:56.479> what<00:01:57.409> does<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.740> ankle<00:01:58.009> do<00:01:58.159> because

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
factors what does the ankle do because

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.010 
factors what does the ankle do because
the<00:01:58.579> ankle<00:01:58.700> can<00:01:59.030> shut<00:01:59.240> down<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.540> hip<00:01:59.659> flexors

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
the ankle can shut down the hip flexors

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.080 
the ankle can shut down the hip flexors
just<00:02:00.259> as<00:02:00.320> much<00:02:00.500> as<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.799> glutes<00:02:01.070> really<00:02:01.700> okay

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
just as much as the glutes really okay

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.330 
just as much as the glutes really okay
all<00:02:02.600> right<00:02:02.780> all<00:02:02.960> right

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
all right all right

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.280 
all right all right
so<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.850> they<00:02:05.149> can<00:02:05.299> also<00:02:05.450> if<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.049> ankle

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
so and they can also if the ankle

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.080 
so and they can also if the ankle
switches<00:02:06.619> off<00:02:06.770> again<00:02:07.100> yeah<00:02:07.460> can<00:02:07.670> also<00:02:07.790> switch

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
switches off again yeah can also switch

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.009 
switches off again yeah can also switch
the<00:02:08.119> glutes<00:02:08.450> off<00:02:08.679> really<00:02:09.679> yeah<00:02:09.979> Wow<00:02:10.750> so<00:02:11.750> if

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
the glutes off really yeah Wow so if

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.660 
the glutes off really yeah Wow so if
that<00:02:12.170> ankle<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.769> mean<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.070> ankle<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.489> little

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
that ankle I mean that ankle a little

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.420 
that ankle I mean that ankle a little
joint<00:02:14.290> it's<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.410> big<00:02:15.560> joint<00:02:15.799> there's<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.280> big

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
joint it's a big joint there's a big

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.400 
joint it's a big joint there's a big
there's<00:02:16.579> a<00:02:16.640> lot<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:16.970> moving<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.360> like<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.900> when

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
there's a lot of moving it like and when

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.110 
there's a lot of moving it like and when
I<00:02:18.440> say<00:02:18.650> ankle<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.070> do<00:02:19.430> include<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:19.850> foot

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
I say ankle I do include the foot

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.849 
I say ankle I do include the foot
complex<00:02:20.570> right<00:02:20.930> back<00:02:21.169> it's<00:02:21.350> thirty<00:02:21.560> three

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:21.859 
complex right back it's thirty three

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.500 
complex right back it's thirty three
three<00:02:22.400> three<00:02:22.430> bones<00:02:22.850> in<00:02:23.060> there<00:02:23.239> there's

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
three three bones in there there's

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.810 
three three bones in there there's
something<00:02:23.840> like<00:02:24.370> 2,000<00:02:25.370> proprioceptors

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
something like 2,000 proprioceptors

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.710 
something like 2,000 proprioceptors
there

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
there

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.600 
there
okay<00:02:27.230> it's<00:02:27.470> almost<00:02:27.620> as<00:02:27.860> many<00:02:28.100> as<00:02:28.250> your<00:02:28.400> tongues

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
okay it's almost as many as your tongues

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.180 
okay it's almost as many as your tongues
got<00:02:28.790> yeah<00:02:29.210> okay<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.410> lot<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.590> proprioceptors

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
got yeah okay so a lot of proprioceptors

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.180 
got yeah okay so a lot of proprioceptors
and<00:02:31.580> we<00:02:31.670> need<00:02:31.850> proprioception<00:02:32.480> yep<00:02:33.020> okay<00:02:33.320> if

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
and we need proprioception yep okay if

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.740 
and we need proprioception yep okay if
it<00:02:34.430> shuts<00:02:34.610> down<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.180> there<00:02:35.330> are<00:02:35.450> lots<00:02:35.660> of

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
it shuts down and there are lots of

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.140 
it shuts down and there are lots of
joints<00:02:35.960> in<00:02:36.200> there<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.770> will<00:02:36.950> shut<00:02:37.190> down<00:02:37.250> all

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
joints in there it will shut down all

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.450 
joints in there it will shut down all
right

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
right

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.120 
right
then<00:02:40.510> whatever<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.870> small<00:02:42.050> motion<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.770> lose

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
then whatever the small motion you lose

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.880 
then whatever the small motion you lose
ya<00:02:43.760> little<00:02:44.690> passion<00:02:45.140> down<00:02:45.320> a<00:02:45.350> little<00:02:45.620> motion

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
ya little passion down a little motion

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.310 
ya little passion down a little motion
down<00:02:46.250> there<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.760> big<00:02:47.090> motion<00:02:47.450> up<00:02:47.570> tight<00:02:47.870> okay

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
down there is big motion up tight okay

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.590 
down there is big motion up tight okay
you<00:02:48.680> have<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.860> understand<00:02:49.310> yep<00:02:49.550> okay<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:50.120> if<00:02:50.390> we

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
you have to understand yep okay so if we

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.840 
you have to understand yep okay so if we
lose<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.590> ability<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.070> ankle<00:02:52.430> to

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
lose the ability of that ankle to

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.840 
lose the ability of that ankle to
pronate<00:02:53.630> which<00:02:54.230> is<00:02:54.410> rolling<00:02:54.650> oh<00:02:54.920> yeah<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.520> go

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
pronate which is rolling oh yeah and go

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.050 
pronate which is rolling oh yeah and go
through<00:02:56.240> sort<00:02:56.450> of<00:02:56.540> lateral<00:02:57.020> movement<00:02:57.080> as<00:02:57.560> well

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
through sort of lateral movement as well

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.440 
through sort of lateral movement as well
the<00:02:59.060> gluts<00:02:59.390> won't<00:02:59.720> work<00:02:59.960> right<00:03:00.790> okay<00:03:01.790> which

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
the gluts won't work right okay which

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.830 
the gluts won't work right okay which
required<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.410> motion<00:03:03.890> down<00:03:04.100> there<00:03:04.630> as<00:03:05.630> you

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
required that motion down there as you

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.020 
required that motion down there as you
switch<00:03:06.110> them<00:03:06.350> on<00:03:06.560> right<00:03:07.370> it's<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.700> reaction

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
switch them on right it's a reaction

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.940 
switch them on right it's a reaction
just<00:03:08.870> think<00:03:09.080> that<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.260> body<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.620> chain

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
just think that the body is a chain

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.870 
just think that the body is a chain
reaction<00:03:10.100> yeah

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
reaction yeah

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.780 
reaction yeah
what<00:03:11.270> happens<00:03:11.690> down<00:03:11.930> on<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.500> pedal<00:03:12.920> yeah<00:03:13.340> for

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
what happens down on the pedal yeah for

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.390 
what happens down on the pedal yeah for
a<00:03:13.820> psych<00:03:14.060> listen<00:03:14.540> in<00:03:15.020> that<00:03:15.410> shoe<00:03:15.770> you<00:03:16.340> know

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
a psych listen in that shoe you know

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.250 
a psych listen in that shoe you know
he's<00:03:16.880> just<00:03:17.240> as<00:03:17.450> important<00:03:17.930> as<00:03:18.020> what<00:03:18.050> happens

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
he's just as important as what happens

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.130 
he's just as important as what happens
up<00:03:18.710> in<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:18.950> hip<00:03:19.130> right<00:03:19.370> amazing<00:03:20.090> all<00:03:20.720> right<00:03:20.900> so

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
up in the hip right amazing all right so

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.160 
up in the hip right amazing all right so
if<00:03:21.410> we<00:03:21.440> can<00:03:21.890> create<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:23.000> this<00:03:23.150> is<00:03:23.330> why<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.930> I

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
if we can create and this is why and I

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.480 
if we can create and this is why and I
know<00:03:24.230> we'll<00:03:24.500> talk<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.710> little<00:03:24.920> bit<00:03:25.070> later<00:03:25.370> about

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
know we'll talk a little bit later about

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.440 
know we'll talk a little bit later about
it<00:03:25.960> we<00:03:26.960> introduced<00:03:27.710> mobilizers<00:03:28.490> yeah<00:03:28.970> sure

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
it we introduced mobilizers yeah sure

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.350 
it we introduced mobilizers yeah sure
okay<00:03:29.990> those<00:03:30.440> mobilizers<00:03:31.370> were<00:03:31.580> designed<00:03:32.030> to

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
okay those mobilizers were designed to

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.229 
okay those mobilizers were designed to
facilitate<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.530> right<00:03:33.770> motions<00:03:34.400> in<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:35.000> foot

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
facilitate the right motions in the foot

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.330 
facilitate the right motions in the foot
ankle<00:03:35.540> complex<00:03:36.020> yep<00:03:36.530> okay<00:03:36.860> now<00:03:37.010> we've<00:03:37.160> got<00:03:37.220> a

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
ankle complex yep okay now we've got a

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.729 
ankle complex yep okay now we've got a
whole<00:03:37.400> range<00:03:37.580> of<00:03:37.940> mobilizers<00:03:38.480> on<00:03:38.600> a<00:03:38.630> DVD<00:03:38.840> we<00:03:39.590> do

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
whole range of mobilizers on a DVD we do

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.550 
whole range of mobilizers on a DVD we do
have<00:03:39.950> really<00:03:40.190> strange<00:03:40.430> huge<00:03:40.790> there's

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
have really strange huge there's

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.210 
have really strange huge there's
millions<00:03:42.560> more<00:03:42.739> yeah<00:03:43.550> okay

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
millions more yeah okay

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.729 
millions more yeah okay
so<00:03:46.220> by<00:03:46.850> looking<00:03:47.090> after<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.750> foot<00:03:47.959> yeah<00:03:48.530> and

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
so by looking after the foot yeah and

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.320 
so by looking after the foot yeah and
the<00:03:48.950> ankle<00:03:49.310> okay

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
the ankle okay

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.110 
the ankle okay
we<00:03:50.630> will<00:03:50.900> help<00:03:51.530> facilitate<00:03:51.970> bed<00:03:52.970> and

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
we will help facilitate bed and

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.330 
we will help facilitate bed and
lengthening<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:54.020> loading<00:03:54.680> which<00:03:54.860> is<00:03:55.040> sort<00:03:55.280> of

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
lengthening and loading which is sort of

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.250 
lengthening and loading which is sort of
I<00:03:55.700> suppose<00:03:55.910> we'll<00:03:56.269> call<00:03:56.390> it<00:03:56.510> activation<00:03:57.170> of

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
I suppose we'll call it activation of

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.229 
I suppose we'll call it activation of
muscle<00:03:57.709> subconscious<00:03:58.550> activation<00:03:59.150> of

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
muscle subconscious activation of

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.170 
muscle subconscious activation of
muscles<00:03:59.600> in<00:04:00.260> that<00:04:00.590> hip<00:04:00.800> complex<00:04:01.310> sure<00:04:01.730> okay

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
muscles in that hip complex sure okay

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.970 
muscles in that hip complex sure okay
now<00:04:02.330> cycling<00:04:02.870> yes<00:04:03.050> it<00:04:03.200> does<00:04:03.410> spend<00:04:03.709> a<00:04:03.769> lot<00:04:03.950> of

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
now cycling yes it does spend a lot of

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.880 
now cycling yes it does spend a lot of
time<00:04:04.250> in<00:04:04.459> flexion<00:04:04.760> yeah<00:04:05.600> that's<00:04:06.410> where<00:04:06.590> your

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
time in flexion yeah that's where your

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.240 
time in flexion yeah that's where your
hips

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
hips

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.370 
hips
yeah<00:04:07.820> they<00:04:08.180> closed<00:04:08.510> you<00:04:08.720> you're<00:04:08.989> closed<00:04:09.170> down

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
yeah they closed you you're closed down

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.509 
yeah they closed you you're closed down
okay

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519

and<00:04:10.790> that's<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.480> required<00:04:12.230> element<00:04:12.769> of<00:04:12.890> the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
and that's the required element of the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
that just means that whole anterior hip

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.370 
that just means that whole anterior hip
complex<00:04:19.519> not<00:04:19.700> just<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.090> hip<00:04:20.269> flexors<00:04:20.720> okay

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
complex not just the hip flexors okay

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.550 
complex not just the hip flexors okay
adductors<00:04:22.190> quads<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:24.110> couple<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.440> other

adductors quads and a couple of other

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.020 
adductors quads and a couple of other
muscle<00:04:24.919> groups<00:04:25.520> as<00:04:25.669> well

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
muscle groups as well

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.450 
muscle groups as well
they<00:04:26.660> will<00:04:27.020> over<00:04:27.470> period<00:04:27.830> time<00:04:28.010> gets<00:04:28.400> shorter

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
they will over period time gets shorter

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.530 
they will over period time gets shorter
yeah

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
yeah

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.350 
yeah
the<00:04:30.320> connective<00:04:30.860> tissue<00:04:31.130> will<00:04:31.820> start<00:04:32.120> to

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
the connective tissue will start to

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.740 
the connective tissue will start to
bunch<00:04:32.930> up<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.500> get<00:04:34.010> taut<00:04:34.280> taut<00:04:34.940> or<00:04:35.000> sorry<00:04:35.720> not

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
bunch up and get taut taut or sorry not

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.320 
bunch up and get taut taut or sorry not
to<00:04:36.020> up<00:04:36.140> it's<00:04:36.320> shorter<00:04:36.770> and<00:04:37.039> not<00:04:37.729> allow<00:04:38.270> the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
to up it's shorter and not allow the

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.240 
to up it's shorter and not allow the
muscle<00:04:39.050> complex<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.620> open<00:04:39.919> up

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
muscle complex to open up

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.050 
muscle complex to open up
yeah<00:04:40.730> okay<00:04:41.090> we<00:04:41.810> need<00:04:42.080> to<00:04:42.310> be<00:04:43.310> able<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.640> get<00:04:43.790> some

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
yeah okay we need to be able to get some

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.720 
yeah okay we need to be able to get some
form<00:04:44.600> or<00:04:44.780> some<00:04:45.110> level<00:04:45.470> of<00:04:45.560> extensibility<00:04:46.190> so

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
form or some level of extensibility so

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.240 
form or some level of extensibility so
extension<00:04:47.300> through<00:04:47.510> that<00:04:47.660> tissue<00:04:47.960> yeah<00:04:48.380> for

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
extension through that tissue yeah for

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.980 
extension through that tissue yeah for
that<00:04:49.370> hip<00:04:49.610> flex<00:04:49.850> it'll<00:04:50.060> open<00:04:50.150> up<00:04:50.390> so<00:04:50.630> that<00:04:50.810> the

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
that hip flex it'll open up so that the

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.020 
that hip flex it'll open up so that the
glutes<00:04:51.260> can<00:04:51.500> then<00:04:51.680> work<00:04:51.950> and<00:04:52.250> do<00:04:52.730> what<00:04:52.910> they

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
glutes can then work and do what they

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.780 
glutes can then work and do what they
need<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.300> do<00:04:53.420> as<00:04:53.570> well
