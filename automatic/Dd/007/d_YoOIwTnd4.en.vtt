tail<00:01:14.700> where<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.299> toss<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.930> starts<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.320> fire

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
tail where you toss it it starts on fire

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800 
tail where you toss it it starts on fire
we've<00:01:16.979> got<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.490> combat<00:01:18.030> axe<00:01:18.299> which<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.659> going

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
we've got the combat axe which is going

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.350 
we've got the combat axe which is going
to<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.930> basically<00:01:19.140> tomahawk<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.520> got<00:01:20.670> DC<00:01:21.090> for

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
to be basically tomahawk we got DC for

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.910 
to be basically tomahawk we got DC for
which<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> guys<00:01:22.259> already<00:01:22.439> heard<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.680> has<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
which if you guys already heard it has a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.230 
which if you guys already heard it has a
little<00:01:23.130> bit<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.430> change<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.909> now<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
little bit of a change to it now it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.510 
little bit of a change to it now it
doesn't<00:01:24.540> detonate<00:01:24.720> until<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.619> actually<00:01:25.650> hits

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
doesn't detonate until it actually hits

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.399 
doesn't detonate until it actually hits
something<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.659> doesn't<00:01:27.960> touch<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> wall

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
something so if it doesn't touch a wall

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.780 
something so if it doesn't touch a wall
to<00:01:28.439> floor<00:01:28.950> something<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.610> won't

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
to floor something that it won't

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.190 
to floor something that it won't
detonate<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> last<00:01:30.869> thing<00:01:31.049> is

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
detonate and then the last thing is

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
detonate and then the last thing is
going<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> destruction<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.150> mind

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
going to be a destruction and mind

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.480 
going to be a destruction and mind
destruction<00:01:33.930> mind<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.619> will<00:01:34.740> explode<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
destruction mind that will explode and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.249 
destruction mind that will explode and
deal<00:01:35.640> damage<00:01:35.820> once<00:01:36.150> triggered<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.630> hopefully

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
deal damage once triggered so hopefully

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.140 
deal damage once triggered so hopefully
it's<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> mine<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.369> not<00:01:38.549> hey<00:01:38.850> you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
grenades we got the flash concussion EMP

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.929 
grenades we got the flash concussion EMP
which<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> little<00:01:47.399> bit<00:01:47.549> different<00:01:47.880> this

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
which is a little bit different this

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.609 
which is a little bit different this
time<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.270> destroys<00:01:48.600> equipment<00:01:49.079> scorestreaks

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
time it destroys equipment scorestreaks

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.580 
time it destroys equipment scorestreaks
enemy<00:01:50.130> HUDs<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.869> cybernetics<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> short

the trophy drone which is going to be a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.249 
the trophy drone which is going to be a
hovering<00:01:56.820> version<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.479> now<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
hovering version of it now and the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.230 
hovering version of it now and the
vicinity<00:01:58.950> mine<00:01:59.219> which<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.490> basically<00:02:00.000> going

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
vicinity mine which is basically going

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.109 
vicinity mine which is basically going
to<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> portable<00:02:01.979> UAV<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:02.939> used

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
to be like the portable UAV that we used

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.090 
to be like the portable UAV that we used
to<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.420> before<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:04.049> black<00:02:04.380> ops<00:02:04.560> 1<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.979> it's

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
to have before in black ops 1 so it's

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.889 
to have before in black ops 1 so it's
going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> tag<00:02:05.549> enemies<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.210> your<00:02:06.659> mini-map

enemies we saw this again in the trailer
itself<00:03:29.040> where<00:03:29.430> everyone<00:03:29.759> was<00:03:29.879> calling<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.269> the

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
butterflies but they're called fireflies

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.240 
butterflies but they're called fireflies
and<00:03:32.909> it's<00:03:33.239> basically<00:03:33.449> a<00:03:33.959> miniature<00:03:34.709> version

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
and it's basically a miniature version

of the swarm from black ops 2 and then
the<00:03:37.650> biggest<00:03:37.859> one<00:03:38.189> at<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.489> moment<00:03:38.609> is<00:03:38.939> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
the biggest one at the moment is the

the biggest one at the moment is the
mothership<00:03:39.689> which<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.019> remotely

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
mothership which is a remotely

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
controlled mothership that lets you have

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.240 
controlled mothership that lets you have
two<00:03:42.509> teammates<00:03:42.870> assisting<00:03:43.439> you<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.829> as<00:03:43.979> of

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
vonderhaar actually tweeted out a little

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.920 
vonderhaar actually tweeted out a little
bit<00:03:49.889> ago<00:03:50.009> that<00:03:50.639> they<00:03:50.819> are<00:03:50.939> not<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.209> fan<00:03:51.509> of<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.750> so
