isn't<00:00:43.110> really<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> help<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
isn't really going to help you have to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.940 
isn't really going to help you have to
reset<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> tile<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.260> it's<00:00:46.260> really<00:00:46.530> helpful<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
reset the tile so it's really helpful to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.560 
reset the tile so it's really helpful to
try<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> little<00:00:47.670> homework<00:00:47.940> before<00:00:48.539> you

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
try to do a little homework before you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.410 
try to do a little homework before you
do<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> tile<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.190> essentially<00:00:50.789> there's<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
do the tile but essentially there's a

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.610 
do the tile but essentially there's a
couple<00:00:51.600> things<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.930> need<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.230> know<00:00:52.379> before

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
unsanded form of grout and it's capable

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.590 
unsanded form of grout and it's capable
of<00:00:58.949> doing<00:00:59.100> joints<00:00:59.609> up<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.879> an<00:01:00.059> eighth<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.449> an

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
of doing joints up to an eighth of an

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.920 
of doing joints up to an eighth of an
inch

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
inch

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.240

anything beyond that you want to use
sand<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.789> sand<00:01:02.969> acts<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:04.019> Bhandar<00:01:05.030> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
sand the sand acts is like a Bhandar it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.109 
sand the sand acts is like a Bhandar it
keeps<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.450> tile<00:01:07.520> together<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.729> mean<00:01:08.880> excuse<00:01:09.090> me

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
keeps the tile together I mean excuse me

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.899 
keeps the tile together I mean excuse me
the<00:01:09.240> grout<00:01:09.540> together<00:01:10.100> from<00:01:11.100> shrinking<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the grout together from shrinking and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.469 
the grout together from shrinking and
whatnot<00:01:12.590> you'd<00:01:13.590> use<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.310> unsanded<00:01:14.790> grout<00:01:14.909> for

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
whatnot you'd use the unsanded grout for

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.270 
whatnot you'd use the unsanded grout for
examples<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.590> where<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.250> know

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
examples like this where the you know

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.890 
examples like this where the you know
the<00:01:17.549> grouts<00:01:17.820> less<00:01:18.180> than<00:01:18.360> an<00:01:18.479> eighth<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.810> an

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the grouts less than an eighth of an

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320 
the grouts less than an eighth of an
inch<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.740> let's<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:20.790> started

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
inch so let's get started

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.999 
inch so let's get started
we're<00:01:21.509> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.689> mix<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.049> some<00:01:22.110> sanded<00:01:22.979> grout

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
we're going to mix up some sanded grout

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.700 
we're going to mix up some sanded grout
for<00:01:23.520> our<00:01:23.759> quarter<00:01:24.600> inch<00:01:24.630> application<00:01:25.560> which

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
for our quarter inch application which

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.100 
for our quarter inch application which
is<00:01:25.860> right<00:01:26.040> here<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.180> particular<00:01:27.509> grout

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
is right here so this particular grout

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230 
is right here so this particular grout
has<00:01:28.500> additive<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.850> doesn't<00:01:30.210> have

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
has additive in it if it doesn't have

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.999 
has additive in it if it doesn't have
additive<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.290> sell<00:01:31.560> liquid

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
additive in it they sell liquid

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.609 
additive in it they sell liquid
additives<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.790> add<00:01:33.079> it's<00:01:34.079> very

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
additives that you can add it's very

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.170 
additives that you can add it's very
important<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.640> some<00:01:35.850> sort<00:01:36.030> of

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
important that you have some sort of

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.760 
important that you have some sort of
additive<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.780> mean<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.229> helps<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
additive I mean it really helps the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.010 
additive I mean it really helps the
grout<00:01:38.009> stay<00:01:38.340> bonded<00:01:38.850> we're<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> want<00:01:39.869> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
grout stay bonded we're going to want to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.319 
grout stay bonded we're going to want to
mix<00:01:40.439> our<00:01:40.770> particular<00:01:41.250> grout<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> peanut

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
mix our particular grout to a peanut

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.050 
mix our particular grout to a peanut
buttery<00:01:42.659> consistency<00:01:43.310> now<00:01:44.310> grout<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
buttery consistency now grout is the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.870 
buttery consistency now grout is the
weakest<00:01:45.600> part<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:46.110> any<00:01:46.649> tile<00:01:46.950> installation<00:01:47.670> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
weakest part of any tile installation I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.120 
weakest part of any tile installation I
mean<00:01:48.030> outside<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.810> actual<00:01:48.960> tile<00:01:49.860> being

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
mean outside of the actual tile being

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.730 
mean outside of the actual tile being
set<00:01:50.460> properly<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.869> most<00:01:52.020> poorest<00:01:52.470> part

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
set properly it's the most poorest part

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.050 
set properly it's the most poorest part
and<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.340> really<00:01:53.670> want<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
and you really want to get the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.179 
and you really want to get the
consistency<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.350> too<00:01:55.590> wet<00:01:55.890> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
consistency right if it's too wet it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.060 
consistency right if it's too wet it
won't<00:01:56.430> be<00:01:57.020> won't<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> strength<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.770> it

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
won't be won't have the strength to it

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.969 
won't be won't have the strength to it
won't<00:01:59.280> bond<00:01:59.640> as<00:01:59.939> well<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.290> really<00:02:01.710> want<00:02:01.890> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
won't bond as well so you really want to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.800 
won't bond as well so you really want to
get<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.250> right<00:02:02.460> mix<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.969> consistency<00:02:03.659> when

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
get the right mix and consistency when

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.660 
get the right mix and consistency when
you're<00:02:03.930> mixing<00:02:04.259> up<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:05.759> grout<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.619> suggest

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
you're mixing up the the grout I suggest

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.130 
you're mixing up the the grout I suggest
pouring<00:02:08.670> small<00:02:08.970> amounts<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.539> water<00:02:09.780> I'm<00:02:10.050> going

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
pouring small amounts of water I'm going

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.750 
pouring small amounts of water I'm going
to<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.379> reach<00:02:10.590> back<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.129> grab<00:02:11.250> some<00:02:11.520> water

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
to just reach back and grab some water

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.600 
to just reach back and grab some water
here<00:02:12.030> mix<00:02:12.569> with<00:02:12.750> our<00:02:12.870> float<00:02:13.200> until<00:02:14.010> we<00:02:14.340> get<00:02:14.489> the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
here mix with our float until we get the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.880 
here mix with our float until we get the
right<00:02:14.760> consistency<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.840> again<00:02:16.680> it's

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
right consistency and again it's

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.530 
right consistency and again it's
supposed<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.129> be<00:02:17.280> almost<00:02:17.849> like<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.180> peanut

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
supposed to be almost like a peanut

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.420 
supposed to be almost like a peanut
buttery<00:02:18.900> consistency<00:02:19.170> that's<00:02:19.920> what<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.160> want

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
buttery consistency that's what you want

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.490 
buttery consistency that's what you want
so<00:02:20.700> we've<00:02:21.150> actually<00:02:21.330> gotten<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> consistency

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
so we've actually gotten the consistency

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.990 
so we've actually gotten the consistency
we<00:02:22.650> want<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.160> we're<00:02:23.340> going<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.489> go<00:02:23.610> over<00:02:23.879> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
we want and we're going to go over and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.780 
we want and we're going to go over and
start<00:02:24.180> installing<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.319> in<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.530> top<00:02:25.790> so

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
start installing it in on top so

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.770 
start installing it in on top so
basically<00:02:27.120> we're<00:02:27.300> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.480> double<00:02:27.629> check

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
basically we're going to double check

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.330 
basically we're going to double check
the<00:02:28.020> joint<00:02:28.260> make<00:02:28.440> sure<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> loose<00:02:29.010> grouts

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the joint make sure all the loose grouts

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.160 
the joint make sure all the loose grouts
been<00:02:29.580> removed<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.300> then<00:02:30.900> we're<00:02:31.019> going<00:02:31.140> to

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
been removed and then we're going to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.339 
been removed and then we're going to
sweep<00:02:31.410> with<00:02:31.620> our<00:02:31.800> grout<00:02:32.040> brush<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:34.080> now<00:02:34.200> we're

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
sweep with our grout brush so now we're

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.780 
sweep with our grout brush so now we're
going<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.560> install<00:02:34.860> our<00:02:34.920> grout<00:02:35.400> it's

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
going to install our grout it's

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.490 
going to install our grout it's
basically<00:02:36.180> going<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.569> gather<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.110> grout<00:02:37.319> on

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
basically going to gather the grout on

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.280 
basically going to gather the grout on
our<00:02:37.620> float<00:02:38.390> I'm<00:02:39.390> going<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.629> push<00:02:39.810> down<00:02:39.840> into

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
our float I'm going to push down into

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.839 
our float I'm going to push down into
the<00:02:40.410> groove<00:02:42.410> make<00:02:43.410> sure<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.739> all<00:02:43.890> full<00:02:44.220> no

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
the groove make sure it's all full no

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.720 
the groove make sure it's all full no
air<00:02:45.060> bubbles<00:02:45.450> no<00:02:45.959> voids<00:02:46.290> now<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.489> stuff<00:02:47.700> is

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
air bubbles no voids now this stuff is

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.030 
air bubbles no voids now this stuff is
going<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.090> set<00:02:48.330> pretty<00:02:48.629> quickly<00:02:48.959> with<00:02:49.920> the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
going to set pretty quickly with the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.160 
going to set pretty quickly with the
additive<00:02:50.519> especially<00:02:51.090> especially<00:02:51.540> if<00:02:51.690> it's<00:02:52.110> a

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
additive especially especially if it's a

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.070 
additive especially especially if it's a
warm<00:02:52.410> day<00:02:52.680> it'll<00:02:52.920> set<00:02:53.160> up<00:02:53.280> right<00:02:53.610> away<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:55.050> you

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
warm day it'll set up right away so you

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.930 
warm day it'll set up right away so you
know<00:02:55.379> try<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.620> do<00:02:55.830> smaller<00:02:56.129> areas<00:02:56.610> if<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.849> have

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
know try to do smaller areas if you have

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.170 
know try to do smaller areas if you have
larger<00:02:57.360> areas<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.930> have<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.170> touch<00:02:58.349> up

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
larger areas that you have to touch up

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.899 
larger areas that you have to touch up
but<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:01.170> will<00:03:01.319> set<00:03:01.620> up<00:03:01.739> on<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.129> what<00:03:02.760> we're

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
but it will set up on you what we're

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.670 
but it will set up on you what we're
going<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.269> is<00:03:03.510> we're<00:03:03.989> going<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.140> go<00:03:04.349> across

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
going to do is we're going to go across

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.920 
going to do is we're going to go across
the<00:03:05.159> tile<00:03:05.430> on<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.730> diagonal<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.450> don't<00:03:06.750> want<00:03:06.870> to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
the tile on a diagonal you don't want to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.479 
the tile on a diagonal you don't want to
use<00:03:07.050> an<00:03:07.170> excessive<00:03:07.590> amount<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.890> water<00:03:08.099> because

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
use an excessive amount of water because

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.790 
use an excessive amount of water because
that'll<00:03:08.819> weaken<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.540> actual<00:03:09.840> grout<00:03:10.170> might

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
that'll weaken the actual grout might

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.259 
that'll weaken the actual grout might
even<00:03:10.980> discolor<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.489> depending<00:03:11.909> on<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.090> color

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
even discolor it depending on the color

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.149 
even discolor it depending on the color
you're<00:03:12.450> getting<00:03:12.569> so<00:03:13.200> it's<00:03:13.319> very<00:03:13.470> crucial<00:03:14.040> to

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
you're getting so it's very crucial to

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.430 
you're getting so it's very crucial to
use<00:03:14.340> just<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> right<00:03:14.849> amount<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.239> water<00:03:15.780> to

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
use just the right amount of water to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.430 
use just the right amount of water to
remove<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.890> grout<00:03:17.700> from<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.180> tile<00:03:18.480> or<00:03:19.230> that

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
remove the grout from the tile or that

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.720 
remove the grout from the tile or that
you'll<00:03:19.739> you'll<00:03:19.980> end<00:03:20.159> up<00:03:20.250> with<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> haze

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
you'll you'll end up with a haze

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.630 
you'll you'll end up with a haze
eventually<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:22.260> you'll<00:03:22.409> just<00:03:22.680> wipe<00:03:23.400> off

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
eventually that you'll just wipe off

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.380
