00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
on the cooler master website i can

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.639 
on the cooler master website i can
actually<00:01:42.360> buy<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> little<00:01:42.869> front<00:01:43.229> panel<00:01:43.560> USB

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
actually buy a little front panel USB

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.429 
actually buy a little front panel USB
3.0<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:45.210> plugs<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.630> into<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.930> connector

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
3.0 that plugs right into that connector

the<00:02:45.150> first<00:02:45.390> time<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.720> painted<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:47.220> i<00:02:47.370> think<00:02:47.730> i'm

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
the first time I painted and i think i'm

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.840 
the first time I painted and i think i'm
going<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.060> try<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.209> find<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.540> blue<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:50.310> flake<00:02:50.670> it

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
going to try to find a blue to flake it

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.870 
going to try to find a blue to flake it
with<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.330> add<00:02:51.930> kind<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.380> flake<00:02:52.709> texture<00:02:53.310> to

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
with and add kind of a flake texture to

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.420 
with and add kind of a flake texture to
the<00:02:54.000> bottom<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.570> when<00:02:55.080> i<00:02:55.140> put<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.470> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
the bottom so that when i put the the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.880 
the bottom so that when i put the the
cold<00:02:56.670> cathodes<00:02:57.209> back<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:58.440> creates<00:02:58.770> a

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
cold cathodes back in it creates a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.550 
cold cathodes back in it creates a
really<00:02:59.250> nice<00:02:59.670> little<00:02:59.880> color<00:03:00.209> fact<00:03:00.570> so<00:03:01.380> that's

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
really nice little color fact so that's

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.040 
really nice little color fact so that's
what<00:03:01.680> I'm<00:03:01.770> going<00:03:01.920> for<00:03:02.780> I've<00:03:03.780> had<00:03:03.900> some

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
questions over this front panel the LEDs

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.840 
questions over this front panel the LEDs
on<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.290> front<00:03:07.530> panel<00:03:08.570> do<00:03:09.570> they<00:03:10.200> are<00:03:10.290> both<00:03:10.470> red

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
on the front panel do they are both red

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.949 
on the front panel do they are both red
I'm<00:03:11.850> going<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.060> change<00:03:12.300> that<00:03:12.360> I've<00:03:12.690> got<00:03:12.930> a

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
get one off the cooler master website so

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.729 
get one off the cooler master website so
as<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.239> can<00:03:54.420> see<00:03:54.660> got<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.380> pretty<00:03:55.590> well
