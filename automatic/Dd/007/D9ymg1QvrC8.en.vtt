00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.600
 what can we invent to do? 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.700
 understand to people that flowers and flowers 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.170
 plants must be respected, for example 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.450
 we can tell him that if you are lucky 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.370
 to catch the right pin and the points 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.500
 on a flower here is what gives you 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.630
 millions of change of clothes for free and with 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.939
 relative capacity as cook clothes 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.800
 become better than blessed parodi 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.930
 perhaps it is not the best known of the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.119
 various wizards from the 80s and maybe there is a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.099
 because it is a girl of 15 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.219
 years living in france one day 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.469
 is approached by two exact goblins 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.090
 who are called dudu and does not know that 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.160
 they come to you in the form of a cat dog 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.840
 which of course the two talk about 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.030
 which come from the flower star 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.129
 this planet full of beautiful of course 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.230
 plants where they seek the heir to the throne 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.180
 the heir will be the one who will find the flower 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.250
 of 7 colors this amazing plant 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.140
 with all the colors of the indigo iris 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.750
 including and found somewhere 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.030
 on earth he finds it to be one 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.260
 half magical creature lives with grandparents 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.449
 because you guess the exact orphan and find out 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.519
 that his parents were half human 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.049
 and half flower spirits 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.729
 and it will be the grandparents who know 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.439
 the whole story push her to start in 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.869
 mission for the world as any one would do 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.520
 caring grandfather to the granddaughter of 15 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.100
 years that he has always lived in a small town 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.500
 presumably lost in provence, go 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.780
 Dear parties also for abroad 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.430
 of course are not all roses and flowers and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.500
 in the true sense of the word since 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.780
 in pursuit of the ire of the osa 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.270
 the mourning rival is also part of the plant 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.820
 genica with the faithful iab hoc a species 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.740
 of raccoon distant relative of clean lo 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.720
 genes there is also a power that of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.610
 summon pollen wind a hurricane 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.840
 that wipes everything out but that is small 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.610
 collateral effect 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.619
 every time he uses it it becomes old and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.509
 wrinkled worse than the queen in the wood 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.729
 another character that appears every 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.439
 bet and if you this young man with 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.720
 sack on the shoulder that at the end of the episode 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.909
 gives strangers seeds to plant 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.990
 to make the world better with 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.939
 the narrator who at the end of the episode 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.600
 also tells the meaning of the flower 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.790
 in question 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.930
 for example if you are the seed gifts of 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.540
 no more forgetting me 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.299
 the narrator states the not forgetting you 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.799
 of me it means memory and it served 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.379
 just a botany expert 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.180
 however he goes around the world not 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.620
 finding a beautiful city but knowing 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.060
 dogs and pigs is forced 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.739
 at some point to go home because 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.159
 informed of the fact that the grandfather is going to 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.780
 to die 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.209
 actually the old man was better than 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.190
 we and they find out what the flower 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.049
 of the seven colors sought in all 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.209
 places in all the lakes as a would say 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.180
 valerio scanu more and more similar to lady 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.769
 oscar was in the home garden part the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.510
 contest genic account that had it 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.730
 pursued until now but the wind of 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.370
 the pollen he uses to lulù turns to her 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.810
 against the lifted life of the plant 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.700
 it goes on the planet of flowers but we have 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.470
 saw more enthusiastic people in the room 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.329
 looking like a dentist and that's why 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.220
 the nostalgia of the earth is strong 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.470
 especially Russia also in love 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.870
 of céline that however looks at you come out 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.609
 that nothing less than the prince consort 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.290
 therefore it would be all right but in 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.540
 reality not because even if there is the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.120
 prince and princess the kingdom 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.879
 probably not enough money 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.250
 blue wants the facts back to the grandparents e 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.870
 what then decides if he renounces them 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.489
 he too throne to live with lulù 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.069
 on earth and leave the scepter to 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.590
 younger brother we saw that between but 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.329
 that you say who is almost similar to that of 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.920
 sandy with a thousand colors but only because it is 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.269
 a flower-shaped brooch can create 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.530
 what he wants that something after a 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.060
 There are two goblins that disappear 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.160
 both go to the planet for a moment 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.209
 alien then return to earth but no 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.209
 they are only impressions
