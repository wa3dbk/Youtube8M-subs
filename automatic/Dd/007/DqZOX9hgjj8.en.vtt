one I have to be careful because I want

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.140 
one I have to be careful because I want
to<00:02:33.830> wreck<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.190> mean<00:02:34.490> eat<00:02:34.610> where<00:02:34.970> where

to wreck the I mean eat where where

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.490 
to wreck the I mean eat where where
connect<00:02:35.450> sure<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:35.660> connect<00:02:36.020> around<00:02:36.170> here

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.480 

basically<00:02:39.500> what's<00:02:39.680> going<00:02:39.920> on<00:02:40.040> here<00:02:40.250> there's<00:02:40.430> a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
basically what's going on here there's a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.590 
basically what's going on here there's a
switch<00:02:40.790> right<00:02:41.060> here<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.980> puts<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.310> camera

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
switch right here that puts the camera

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.490 
switch right here that puts the camera
into<00:02:44.600> standby<00:02:44.960> mode<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:47.000> what<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.050> is<00:02:48.260> is

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
into standby mode and what this is is

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.870 
into standby mode and what this is is
like<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.680> little<00:02:48.980> lever<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.310> pushes<00:02:49.520> on<00:02:49.850> a

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
like a little lever that pushes on a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.480 
like a little lever that pushes on a
little<00:02:50.120> micro<00:02:50.510> switch<00:02:50.890> that's<00:02:51.890> inside<00:02:52.340> of

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
little micro switch that's inside of

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.430 
little micro switch that's inside of
here<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:54.970> what<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.000> found<00:02:56.300> out<00:02:56.510> last<00:02:56.870> fall<00:02:57.200> is

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
here and what I found out last fall is

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.580 
here and what I found out last fall is
that<00:02:57.650> this<00:02:57.920> switch<00:02:58.480> has<00:02:59.480> gone<00:02:59.900> bad<00:03:00.260> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
that this switch has gone bad the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.190 
that this switch has gone bad the
contacts<00:03:01.130> inside<00:03:01.370> have<00:03:01.670> gone<00:03:01.850> bad<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.420> so

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
contacts inside have gone bad and so

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.160 
contacts inside have gone bad and so
what<00:03:03.410> ends<00:03:03.650> up<00:03:03.710> happening<00:03:03.770> is<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:05.570> it<00:03:05.810> will

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
what ends up happening is that it will

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.360 
what ends up happening is that it will
turn<00:03:07.070> on<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.430> off<00:03:07.550> at<00:03:07.790> random<00:03:08.890> I'll<00:03:09.890> put<00:03:10.190> the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
turn on and off at random I'll put the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.350 
turn on and off at random I'll put the
thing<00:03:10.910> back<00:03:10.940> in<00:03:11.240> the<00:03:11.330> viewfinder<00:03:11.510> here<00:03:12.610> so<00:03:13.610> and

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
thing back in the viewfinder here so and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.770 
thing back in the viewfinder here so and
I'll<00:03:14.480> just<00:03:15.040> I'll<00:03:16.040> kind<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.430> push<00:03:16.670> just<00:03:17.480> gently

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
I'll just I'll kind of push just gently

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.110 
I'll just I'll kind of push just gently
on<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:18.290> cast<00:03:18.530> case<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:19.460> see<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.730> camera

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
on the cast case and you see the camera

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.360 
on the cast case and you see the camera
shuts<00:03:20.360> off<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:22.700> fires<00:03:22.910> right<00:03:23.180> back<00:03:23.390> on<00:03:24.370> and

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
shuts off and it fires right back on and

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.740 
shuts off and it fires right back on and
sometimes<00:03:25.820> when<00:03:25.940> there's<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.180> tape<00:03:26.390> in<00:03:26.540> there

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
sometimes when there's a tape in there

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:34.030 
sometimes when there's a tape in there
it<00:03:27.620> won't<00:03:27.770> even<00:03:27.950> record

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.970 

I<00:03:34.099> momentarily<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.569> momentarily<00:03:36.079> lost<00:03:36.500> contact
