00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.549
 make your own blocks of ice 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.549
 tricks for summer 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.690
 in summer especially you will need 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.330
 transport food keeping us 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.430
 low temperatures today we're going to 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.590
 teach how you can make blocks of 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.620
 ice that hold a lot of hours in 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.350
 perfect condition 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.090
 for this we will only need a 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.790
 mold and water 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.910
 for the mold we will use tetra packs of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.930
 liter for its size and shape are ideal 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.930
 for what we are going to do 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.760
 Rinse the containers you are going to use 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.760
 and fill them with water 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.560
 as water freezes expands leaves 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.000
 a margin of an unfilled finger of this 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.000
 way you will prevent it from bursting 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.400
 but for the number of containers that it foresees 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.400
 do you are going to be the falcon 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.220
 ze carlos and put them in the freezer 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.200
 of acting 24 hours will be ready 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.200
 to use 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.189
 as you can see it is blocks of 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.100
 solid ice in addition to being of a size 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.110
 considerable holding the several hours 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.890
 at high temperatures within a 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.890
 fridge therefore 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.200
 also how these containers are tight 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.269
 as ice slowly melts 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.269
 they will prevent food from getting wet 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.650
