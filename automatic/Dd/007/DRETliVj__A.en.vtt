00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.000 

went<00:00:15.900> outside

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.250 

the<00:00:20.280> distance<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.940> takes<00:00:21.150> forever<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.690> cycle

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
the distance it takes forever to cycle

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.490 
the distance it takes forever to cycle
out<00:00:22.410> over<00:00:22.950> the<00:00:23.100> noise<00:00:23.250> for<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.880> window

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.730 

Jesus

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.530 

anyway<00:00:32.600> when<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:33.750> wet<00:00:33.960> outside<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.550> distal

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
anyway when it's wet outside the distal

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.830 
anyway when it's wet outside the distal
distance<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.770> from<00:00:37.950> other<00:00:38.190> cars

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
distance that you have from other cars

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.869 
distance that you have from other cars
really<00:00:39.840> has<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.320> widen<00:00:40.950> up<00:00:41.070> because<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.640> can't

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
really has to widen up because you can't

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.270 
really has to widen up because you can't
slow<00:00:42.300> down<00:00:42.540> half<00:00:43.170> as<00:00:43.470> fast<00:00:43.680> when<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.070> wet

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
slow down half as fast when it's wet

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.740 
slow down half as fast when it's wet
outside<00:00:44.430> especially<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.510> right<00:00:45.690> now

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
outside especially like it is right now

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.720 
outside especially like it is right now
where<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.470> know<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.040> can<00:00:47.190> put<00:00:47.309> my<00:00:47.340> hand<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.670> my

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
where you know I can put my hand on my

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.400 
where you know I can put my hand on my
foot<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.269> ground<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.690> nothing<00:00:49.170> like

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
foot on the ground and nothing like

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.299 
foot on the ground and nothing like
there's<00:00:49.620> no<00:00:49.830> traction<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.519> all<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.890> yeah<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
there's no traction at all and yeah that

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.259 
there's no traction at all and yeah that
is<00:00:53.430> because<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.699> was<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.940> middle<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
is because I was in the middle of the

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.450 
is because I was in the middle of the
road<00:00:54.420> while<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> oil<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:56.220> still

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
road while the oil is but it's still

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.460 
road while the oil is but it's still
it's<00:00:56.879> still<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.449> really<00:00:57.900> low<00:00:58.080> traction<00:00:58.670> so

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
it's still like really low traction so

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.610 
it's still like really low traction so
that's<00:01:01.470> something<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.309> know<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.059> car

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
that's something you you know in a car

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.840 
that's something you you know in a car
when<00:01:04.620> it's<00:01:04.769> wet<00:01:04.949> outside<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.610> try<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
when it's wet outside and you try to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.180 
when it's wet outside and you try to
stop<00:01:06.210> you'll<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.570> slide<00:01:08.090> but<00:01:09.530> on<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:11.100> know

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
stop you'll just slide but on a you know

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.570 
stop you'll just slide but on a you know
the<00:01:11.340> car<00:01:11.549> you're<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:11.760> balancing<00:01:13.190> in<00:01:14.190> a<00:01:14.340> bike

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the car you're not balancing in a bike

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.300 
the car you're not balancing in a bike
you<00:01:14.970> know<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.960> lose<00:01:16.200> traction<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:17.159> your

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
you know if you lose traction with your

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.940 
you know if you lose traction with your
front<00:01:17.490> tire<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.060> locks<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.740> just<00:01:19.740> locking

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
front tire and it locks up just locking

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.770 
front tire and it locks up just locking
your<00:01:20.130> tires<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:20.670> very<00:01:20.850> easy<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.690> this

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
your tires that was very easy in this

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.319 
your tires that was very easy in this
weather<00:01:22.880> your<00:01:23.880> front<00:01:24.119> tire<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:25.170> your

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
weather your front tire is like your

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.609 
weather your front tire is like your
it's<00:01:28.329> hard<00:01:28.509> to<00:01:28.570> explain<00:01:28.689> i<00:01:29.020> guess<00:01:29.350> if<00:01:29.499> you

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
it's hard to explain i guess if you

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.859 
it's hard to explain i guess if you
haven't<00:01:29.890> written<00:01:30.009> your<00:01:30.939> bag<00:01:31.210> Harry<00:01:31.479> gives<00:01:31.719> you

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
haven't written your bag Harry gives you

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.450 
haven't written your bag Harry gives you
momentum<00:01:32.049> so<00:01:32.469> if<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.649> lock<00:01:32.859> your<00:01:33.039> back<00:01:33.189> tire

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
momentum so if you lock your back tire

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.340 
momentum so if you lock your back tire
up<00:01:33.700> you<00:01:33.850> lose<00:01:34.060> your<00:01:34.270> momentum<00:01:34.390> you<00:01:34.960> lose<00:01:35.109> your

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
up you lose your momentum you lose your

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.740 
up you lose your momentum you lose your
push<00:01:35.590> if<00:01:36.340> you<00:01:36.490> lock<00:01:36.670> your<00:01:36.880> front<00:01:37.000> tire<00:01:37.299> up<00:01:37.569> you

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
push if you lock your front tire up you

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.080 
push if you lock your front tire up you
lose<00:01:37.960> your<00:01:38.200> your<00:01:38.619> steering<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.999> locking<00:01:42.999> your

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
lose your your steering so locking your

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.270 
lose your your steering so locking your
front<00:01:43.390> tire<00:01:43.569> up<00:01:43.840> is<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.020> real<00:01:44.259> easy<00:01:44.679> way<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.069> get

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
front tire up is a real easy way to get

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.419 
front tire up is a real easy way to get
in<00:01:45.399> a<00:01:45.429> wreck<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.140> for<00:01:47.709> us<00:01:47.740> that<00:01:48.069> have<00:01:48.189> written

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
in a wreck so for us that have written

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.099 
in a wreck so for us that have written
for<00:01:48.729> a<00:01:48.759> while<00:01:48.969> when<00:01:49.179> we<00:01:49.359> see<00:01:49.569> that<00:01:49.750> it's<00:01:49.899> wet

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
for a while when we see that it's wet

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.919 
for a while when we see that it's wet
outside<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:51.520> know<00:01:51.670> normally<00:01:52.119> riding<00:01:52.599> on<00:01:52.780> a

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
outside you know normally riding on a

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.690 
outside you know normally riding on a
dry<00:01:53.229> day<00:01:53.259> I'd<00:01:53.590> be<00:01:53.740> on<00:01:53.829> that<00:01:53.979> cars<00:01:54.250> like<00:01:54.520> right

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
dry day I'd be on that cars like right

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.149 
dry day I'd be on that cars like right
behind<00:01:54.849> him<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:56.259> right<00:01:56.469> here<00:01:56.649> this<00:01:56.859> is<00:01:56.920> about

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
behind him but right here this is about

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.190 
behind him but right here this is about
as<00:01:57.340> close<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:57.849> feel<00:01:58.060> safe<00:01:58.329> following<00:01:58.599> my<00:01:58.929> car

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
as close as I feel safe following my car

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.080 
as close as I feel safe following my car
so<00:01:59.439> it's

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
so it's

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.179 
so it's
runnin<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.020> wet<00:02:02.289> rain<00:02:04.079> really<00:02:05.079> makes<00:02:05.380> a

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
runnin the wet rain really makes a

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.940 
runnin the wet rain really makes a
difference<00:02:06.310> in<00:02:07.210> how<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.390> ride<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:08.709> has

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
to you know if it doesn't you're going

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.440 
to you know if it doesn't you're going

to get in a wreck and you're turning is
a<00:02:13.480> lot<00:02:13.840> different<00:02:14.379> not<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.310> lot<00:02:15.550> different<00:02:15.970> but

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
a lot different not a lot different but

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.430 
a lot different not a lot different but
a<00:02:16.480> lot<00:02:17.170> more<00:02:17.290> careful<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.720> don't<00:02:19.780> turn<00:02:20.170> it
