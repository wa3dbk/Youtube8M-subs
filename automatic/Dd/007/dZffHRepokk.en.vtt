00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:09.700
 I'm losing I'm losing 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.590
 Subscribers are leaving little by little or 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.990
 en masse as if everyone were to 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.180
 agreement and they said and we're going to go 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.640
 we will go and they are going they go they go they go 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.769
 calmly so that one can go 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.910
 it has to devote himself to criticize 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.890
 another youtuber 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.210
 play minecraft but I will not play 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.330
 minecraft because I do not like said that 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:37.250
 there's the gameplay I'm not interested in my town 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:39.950
 be chaos things do not improve 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:45.360
 as you can see in the video that 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:48.810
 I did business covers my town 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.410
 I do not see any solution to jakarta 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.200
 sanitary the mud is full of shit 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.650
 the mine tailings are mixed and there 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.500
 dust this seems to direct it to those 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.260
 80s movies that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.730
 that had to do with the bomb 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.520
 atomic and the day after there is a 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:13.190
 movie that really scares me when 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.190
 the children that after 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.360
 Hahaha 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.580
 and it showed a war this clock of the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.040
 bombs and everything that will happen next and the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.909
 chaos and it's like that the people the dust 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.759
 the rubble of the wreck so it looks 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.950
 see me to talk about this but I 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.220
 I'm going to add to the trend car and 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.799
 I will talk about urban myths 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.680
 urban myths now occupy the internet 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.869
 as in your script naming up 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.580
 everyone out that although I 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.869
 this happens that is a short story and 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.819
 that has dyes of horror and that has 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:15.709
 a crooked end or end 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.920
 brusque and the other interesting thing that 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.920
 massive is viralized you almost never know 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.040
 who is the author and points to the genre of 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.200
 horror to have been several especially 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.599
 video videos the one who walks around 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.510
 hours at the VIP bar next to I saw that 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.170
 it appeared like 2012 more or less but 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.000
 now it became popular even in a 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.609
 newspaper that I follow on twitter the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.370
 only news also from the video and 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.689
 this was done a long time ago and what 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.310
 incredible for you to know the 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.590
 story of a video and other parts 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.719
 where will be a woman who is mutilated and 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.969
 you suspect you have to have a 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:55.939
 disease a disorder 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:58.730
 I'm going to prescribe what down it is like 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:02.329
 a disorder of body identity in 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.930
 what is it that people cut themselves or 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:08.299
 has an unstoppable desire to amputate 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.579
 the limbs because it has a 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.639
 distortion with the day which they 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.780
 they feel that they feel strange with the 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.520
 tip now 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.980
 there are several theories that explain it but 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.650
 I oriented myself more neurologically with 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.180
 what it says related to some failure to 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.340
 brain level the level of 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.170
 neurotransmitters because there is another one 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.980
 psychological that points out that a subject 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.350
 audio maybe to a subject amputated and that 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.870
 that is generated as a contour object 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.380
 of erotic desire being that like them 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.540
 they want to be 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.120
 but this video that breaks me and appears 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.140
 a woman with amputated arms does not 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.140
 listen very well to the sound 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.430
 and there is the whole story behind the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.019
 subject we find it where you 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.370
 they know the story and if they do not know it 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.720
 could leave some links so that 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.400
 explain why I extend myself already 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.400
 I've been 4 minutes and I'm too 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.200
 I think this is not real and I think that 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.510
 is a crime pasta more good if it arises from 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.080
 fortin for a change but that's what I 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:25.570
 enough more because there is a detail in the 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:28.780
 video that wakes me up if I suspect 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.440
 it is supposed because people who have 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.320
 this disorder or this disorder 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.060
 of body image will not help your 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.310
 limbs they want to cut 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.370
 because a woman appears with her arms 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.860
 toned and with muscular arms 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.780
 that is to say not muscular but in reason 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.560
 toned it shows that there is a job 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.080
 physical weights gym where are 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.470
 marked the world is muscle but it 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.870
 note that there is exercise 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.240
 is a person who exercised me 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.190
 I ask if a person who has this 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.410
 upset and want to aim not to 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.140
 I would dedicate to do exercises for 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.490
 tone your arms and legs like this 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.220
 well it is believed that this is like a 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.990
 camera type recording of the hoop where there 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.720
 a psychiatrist who is interviewing her 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.300
 I think this is a fragment of 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.090
 some movie or something that can be 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.320
 have done with subjects that are a 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.560
 audiovisuals collection 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.790
 and they created it in the background I do not think it's 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.139
 a 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:35.770
 and a real recording 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:40.560
 and I rely simply on that detail that 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:45.099
 is the story that surrounds to interest 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.319
 but I repeat if you look at the woman 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.169
 the woman has toned arm 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:52.180
 there's a gym behind and a person who 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.240
 have this disorder would not have so 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.330
 both a clip up more then it is a 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.340
 more story 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.960
 what surrounds 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.000
 to the internet and that also comes to 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.180
 finalize that one is done as 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.360
 need for horror the need for 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.630
 twist the events to generate 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.449
 something unknown and something completely 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.540
 removed from reality as if 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.820
 there is a dark side and you are 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.340
 stories appeal to that but it 's a 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.860
 history more is a crime pasta is a 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.690
 story is an urban legend is like the 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.639
 video I do not know if they remember to obey 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.710
 the walrus that is a pretty video 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.260
 disturbing but then it was discovered 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.120
 that it was a subject that had done it 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:43.689
 had been abused and therefore everything 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:45.639
 a problem leave me the name of you 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.649
 it was outbreak of medical license that 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.389
 omar and there was this video made that were 

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:51.849
 quite disturbing asia I recognize 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:55.379
 it's pretty well done because it 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:58.239
 it struck did not give his error tone but 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:07:01.809
 it impacted and the same thing I think of the varnish 

00:06:58.239 --> 00:07:04.899
 point so it's like this wake of 

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:07.959
 of mystery of terror 

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:10.119
 I want apple to write pasta but 

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:13.539
 it's a more non-crafty story 

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:16.719
 destroyed with that with that detail a 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:20.559
 person with that disorder would not take care 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:23.169
 in working and improving your body post 

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:25.209
 who hates it especially the extremity 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:28.760
 it's because it points to people 

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:30.470
 they want to amputate their limbs 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.230
 then here there is already so that you go to 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.040
 exercise and have toned arms 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.080
 muscular so I'm going to cut them 

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.360
 univision dude good has nothing has 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.160
 good sense I extended again 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.050
 It has been a habit with hope victory 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.950
 that are well subscribe like 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:47.870
 disclose comment and watch and with what 

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.350
 I hope it is very well this has 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.350
 been a binnacle
