00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
I mean I've I've dropped outside of the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.220 
I mean I've I've dropped outside of the
top<00:02:21.920> 16<00:02:22.099> many<00:02:22.459> times<00:02:22.700> in<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:22.940> career<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:23.630> I

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
top 16 many times in the career so I

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.110 
top 16 many times in the career so I
know<00:02:24.590> what<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.069> takes<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.370> get<00:02:25.550> back<00:02:25.760> but<00:02:25.970> it's

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
know what it takes to get back but it's

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.339 
know what it takes to get back but it's
not<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.300> nice<00:02:26.540> feeling<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.140> keep

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
not a nice feeling that you keep

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.010 
not a nice feeling that you keep
dropping<00:02:27.620> off<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.970> elite<00:02:29.239> group<00:02:29.480> because<00:02:29.750> I

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
dropping off the elite group because I

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.740 
dropping off the elite group because I
know<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.170> belong<00:02:30.680> there<00:02:31.099> but<00:02:31.489> now<00:02:31.880> I'm<00:02:32.239> back

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
know I belong there but now I'm back

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.949 
know I belong there but now I'm back
into<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> top<00:02:33.380> 16<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.360> yeah<00:02:35.360> it's<00:02:35.540> just<00:02:35.870> a

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
into the top 16 and yeah it's just a

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.500 
into the top 16 and yeah it's just a
great<00:02:36.170> feeling<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.670> can<00:02:37.880> secure<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:38.300> spot

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
great feeling that I can secure a spot

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.210 
great feeling that I can secure a spot
in<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.780> top<00:02:38.840> 16<00:02:39.110> good<00:02:39.470> standards<00:02:39.920> getting

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
in the top 16 good standards getting

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.309 
in the top 16 good standards getting
higher<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.489> higher<00:02:40.670> so<00:02:41.090> it's<00:02:41.930> very<00:02:42.140> difficult

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
higher and higher so it's very difficult

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.150 
higher and higher so it's very difficult
for<00:02:42.739> for<00:02:43.340> us<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:43.640> stay<00:02:43.819> in<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.180> top<00:02:44.330> 16

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
for for us to stay in the top 16

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.470 
for for us to stay in the top 16

him<00:03:18.980> in<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.160> final<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:19.790> yeah<00:03:20.510> if<00:03:20.600> I<00:03:20.660> plane<00:03:20.870> was

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
him in a final so yeah if I plane was

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.420 
him in a final so yeah if I plane was
going<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.290> be<00:03:21.380> a<00:03:21.410> good<00:03:21.500> match<00:03:21.709> but<00:03:21.950> sean<00:03:22.220> is

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
going to be a good match but sean is

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.819 
going to be a good match but sean is
playing<00:03:22.900> pretty<00:03:23.900> good<00:03:23.989> at<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.440> moment<00:03:24.560> I

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
playing pretty good at the moment I

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.430 
playing pretty good at the moment I
think<00:03:25.959> struggling<00:03:26.959> a<00:03:26.989> little<00:03:27.079> bit<00:03:27.260> at<00:03:27.410> the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
think struggling a little bit at the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.720 
think struggling a little bit at the
beginning<00:03:27.560> of<00:03:27.829> a<00:03:27.890> season<00:03:28.070> but<00:03:28.370> he<00:03:28.459> slowly

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
beginning of a season but he slowly

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.599 
beginning of a season but he slowly
playing<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.480> lot<00:03:29.660> better<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.290> very<00:03:31.280> hard<00:03:31.519> to

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
playing a lot better so very hard to

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.550 
playing a lot better so very hard to
pick<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.820> winner<00:03:32.030> while<00:03:32.959> you're<00:03:33.109> still<00:03:33.290> in<00:03:33.350> the
