Hi, I'm Anne Ebeling.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.290
You're watching Parents TV.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.410
Are you tired of feeding your baby the jarred-
stuff or maybe your child is ready for something

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.570
a little bit more substantial but you don't
know where to start.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.969
Well, fret no more, the moms here at Baby
Yums in New York are about to show us some

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:23.240
fresh, easy recipes that will satisfy the
tiniest tot or even the pickiest toddler.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.830
Thomasina Forbes and Ginger Dhaliwal are some
of the freshest moms in Manhattan.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.880
Hitting the kitchen to whip- up fresh healthy
options for their little one, Ginger and Thomasina

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.230
don't just make fresh food for their own babies,
they teach other moms to do the same.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.910
And that's how their business called Baby
Yums was born.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.730
&gt;&gt;And I think that's one of the things that
are clasp these days, is told parents that,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.780
you know, eating is a skill and it's important
to sort of experiment with the textures and

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.340
the types of foods that you're giving your
child, so that they can build that skill in

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.822
them and eventually have a very healthy eating
habits when they grow up.

00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:06.659
&gt;&gt;They give moms guidance, taking them through
their baby's taste one step at a time.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.710
&gt;&gt;Most pediatricians don't emphasize on what
food to start.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.600
They just say, 'oh, you can start solid' and
they send them to the store and there's just

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.360
bunch of different jarred food that's offer
out there and then they do a stage one, two,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.929
three and then they say 'okay, where do I
go now, what can I buy to -- what do I buy

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:25.929
next?'

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:31.090
They get very confused and its better off
that you just start from scratch then you

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.520
don't have to go through that period.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.569
&gt;&gt;And while the moms admit that taking time-
out to prepare your baby meal is a labor of

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.560
love, it may be easier than you think.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.340
&gt;&gt;We're busy moms, we don't expect you stay
in the kitchen.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.799
We don't want you to make for your infant,
your 5- year old and your husband and yourself

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.039
or whoever comes along.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.979
We just want you to make one meal and get
on with it and enjoy spending time with your

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.290
children or whatever you need to, for your
personal life as well.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.709
&gt;&gt;Plus, many of their recipes can be frozen
and eaten later.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.929
So, you don't have to spend hours flaming
over a hot stew.

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:11.190
&gt;&gt;It's very easy because you can bake -- but
-- sweet potato, butternut, squash, apple,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.540
pears, all in the oven within an hour.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.360
And then you have two weeks' worth of baby
food in the freezer and you don't have to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.680
do it again in another two weeks.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:36.310
&gt;&gt;So, let's get to the good stuff -- the food.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.330
First up, a pear puree, perfect for your little
gnashing novice.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.070
Start off by peeling the pear and slicing
it into long pieces, removing the seeds as

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.330
you go then just wrap it in tinfoil and it's
ready to go in the oven.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.000
&gt;&gt;Depending on the size of the pear.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.860
It will be at 375 in the oven for 20- 25-
minutes.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:10.320
&gt;&gt;Once it's done, unwrap the tinfoil and pop
it in the blender until its nice and smooth.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.040
Then you can put it in an ice cube tray like
this one, which can be frozen and then found

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.800
again in the refrigerator when baby needs
to eat.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.760
&gt;&gt;We particularly like this ice cube tray
because it has the silicon back to it and

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.210
you can actually take out the cubes very easily
and each cube is one- ounce.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:36.290
And one tray is efficient for, like, two weeks
of baby food, when they're first starting

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.160
off solids.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.980
&gt;&gt;Now for some super soft meatballs with veggies
and a pasta.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:55.600
&gt;&gt;These are meatballs and for beginners with
not that many molars, we recommend fatty cut-

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.260
off meat just because it's softer.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:05.440
So, instead of a 93 % cut, you probably want
83 % lean ground beef.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.030
&gt;&gt;Instead of salt, Thomasina and Ginger used
grated parmesan cheese in their meatballs,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.520
as well as basil, garlic, garlic powder and
a bread crumbs.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.099
&gt;&gt;So, I'm just gonna sear this.

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:26.650
&gt;&gt;While the meatballs are cooking, Thomasina
says to go ahead and start saut�ing the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.650
veggie.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.939
&gt;&gt;And for the non- vegetable eater, you can
add as many different varieties of vegetables

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:37.530
as you like into the meatball sauce because
it would hide the vegetables.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.169
It's a great way to cheat.

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:49.330
It has onions, mushrooms, zucchini, red pepper,
and if you like you can add the yellow zucchini,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.110
you can add squash, you can add eggplant,
anything you like.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.550
The meatballs are sizzling a little bit, I'm
just gonna turn them over.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.289
And be very gentle because they're really
soft.

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.550
Once the meatballs are sear just add them
to pasta sauce and let the whole thing simmer

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.550
for 20 minutes.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.699
&gt;&gt;Now, in the meantime, you can cook the pasta
on the side.

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.220
And just keep this on the stove, so we can
go on and play -- do play- doh, or do a little

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.180
crayon with your child.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.749
That's it.

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:29.969
&gt;&gt;Now the food's all finish and ready to eat.

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:36.279
Here we have dish cakes, super- soft meatballs
with veggies and pasta, a sweet potato muffin

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:39.319
and milk poached fish with saut�ed vegetables.

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:43.020
Now Ginger and Thomasina did say that the
food is also adult friendly, so I'm gonna

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.740
give it a try myself.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.150
Really, really great.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.490
