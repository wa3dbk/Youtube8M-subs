00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.750
 welcome 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.469
 you invite that representation of this 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.849
 evening there lasted about an hour and a half 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.590
 before I start I will not go 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.919
 ask to turn off your phones 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.050
 laptops but just tell you that we 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.140
 did not find an issue so we 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.200
 let's focus on the presence 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.739
 here even emergency exits 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.360
 specify and this question of the outcome 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.330
 know that theaters according to the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.170
 French legislation are designed to 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.630
 way to help limit and risk 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.570
 to alert the occupants in case of 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.140
 sinister to favor the evacuation and 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.350
 on his to avoid panic 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.270
 besides the stability of the theater and 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.440
 guarantees so that they did not collapse 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.670
 during evacuation or during 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.070
 interventions of the emergency services 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.370
 these buildings therefore have exit 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.630
 sufficient relief in number and 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:18.380
 width signal was marked and especially 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.970
 well spread note that it opens 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.970
 in the sense of evaluation 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.860
 just to finish three right words 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.090
 years 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.670
 we
