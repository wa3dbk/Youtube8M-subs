00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 It's time for 'Food Adventure Program for Awesome People' 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.820
 The 'ink' edition 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.660
 Because squid are inky and we have squid on a stick. 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.360
 You've got a point 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:15.880
 smart :) 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.940
 Ok let's get some ... ridiculous, tasty street food 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.940
 Na na na na na na! 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.940
 It is logical! 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.940
 Ok intvis on a stick, squid have ink 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.200
 My joke is funny, it's legit and this is legit 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.920
 Damn! 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 We came here like nobody 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.280
 And now there is a row 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.120
 You see, we are trendsetters here in Korea 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.400
 We determine the tastes for the people 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.400
 No we don't, we are just lucky 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.820
 Thank you 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.680
 Oooh yes 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.680
 Spicy 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.620
 * giggling * 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.620
 You have to be careful when you eat it 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.140
 You have two sticks that you can poke into your eye sockets 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.220
 And kill you 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.700
 Be careful and why do I say eye sockets? 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.180
 Because Leigh always says eye sockets 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.440
 Curse Leigh for ruining my vocabulary 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300
 They dip a large wet squid in egg 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.020
 Roll it is flour and fry it for 2 and a half minutes. 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.120
 Ooooh ... mmmmm ... oh yeah 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.720
 Ok, I know some people at home think 'that's the dirtiest ever' 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.400
 However, you get used to eating squid in Korea 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.160
 And it's delicious! 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.160
 It is tender and perfectly prepared 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.240
 I hated squid before I came to Korea but this is one of the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.240
 best squid I have ever had in my entire life 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.520
 Forget what you know about calamari with the squeezed lemon and everything 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.200
 That is nothing compared to this 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.820
 This is glorious 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.980
 You take a few bites, your teeth sink right through 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.660
 I don't like raw squid but I wouldn't doubt it for a second 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.180
 Do you know what it really tastes like? 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.680
 What? 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.640
 Such as KFC 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.800
 Just like that deep fried chicken, only replace the chicken with squid 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.140
 Squid tastes like chicken 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.620
 Heeey Leigh, I know you want to taste some of the squid 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.240
 yes I want that 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.840
 What is the title of Junsoo's new song? 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.260
 For a fried squid tentacle 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.960
 No 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.620
 Thing thing thing thing! You've got it! I sometimes have a nose in my nose 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.700
 Tell her she won a piece of your squid 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.760
 But that's mine! 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.700
 Simon has licked his fingers a million times 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.220
 Let me say 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.920
 This is not suitable for a date 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.480
 There is nothing sexy about this 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.060
 I'm dirty, messy, this is striking everywhere 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.820
 You cannot maintain your dignity 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.980
 What are you talking about? so sexy 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.140
 So that's it for this week's "Food Adventure Program for Awesome People" 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.240
 If you want to know how to get to this great place 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.320
 Then click on the link to the blog below, we will give you a map with the route 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.100
 You're going to love it 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.300
 I feel that many more new exchange students have just come to Korea 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.300
 Now is the time to gain new experiences 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.940
 And you know what? I bet it isn't here in the summer 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.160
 Because you never know, things always change, so it will probably be an ice cream parlor 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.800
 Go get that squid! 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.820
 Now it's still possible 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.920
