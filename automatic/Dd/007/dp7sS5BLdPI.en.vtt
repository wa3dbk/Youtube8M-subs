that<00:00:06.330> sounds<00:00:06.629> kind<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.870> boring<00:00:07.049> but<00:00:07.649> actually

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
that sounds kind of boring but actually

that sounds kind of boring but actually
terminal<00:00:08.519> connections<00:00:08.970> are<00:00:09.120> crucial<00:00:09.690> and

about<00:00:28.140> noticing<00:00:28.710> these<00:00:29.060> posts<00:00:30.060> here<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.539> that

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
about noticing these posts here are that

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.930 
about noticing these posts here are that
these<00:00:31.710> type<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.250> posts<00:00:32.579> are<00:00:32.669> which<00:00:32.759> you'll

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
these type of posts are which you'll

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.389 
these type of posts are which you'll
find<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.420> an<00:00:33.600> enclosure<00:00:33.899> anyways<00:00:34.440> 90%<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
find in an enclosure anyways 90% of the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.280 
find in an enclosure anyways 90% of the
time<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.270> let's<00:00:36.300> go<00:00:36.630> see<00:00:36.989> what<00:00:38.870> goes<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.079> to

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
time so let's go see what goes on to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.530 
time so let's go see what goes on to
these<00:00:40.410> connections<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:42.300> don't<00:00:42.450> get

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
these connections so that you don't get

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.280 
these connections so that you don't get
confused

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
confused

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.069 
confused
these<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:44.420> terminal<00:00:45.420> post<00:00:45.570> connectors

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
these are terminal post connectors

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.740 
these are terminal post connectors
they're<00:00:46.559> insulated<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.280> jacketed<00:00:47.820> why<00:00:48.690> you

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
they're insulated and jacketed why you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.860 
they're insulated and jacketed why you
may<00:00:49.020> ask<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.250> say<00:00:50.910> wire<00:00:51.239> gets<00:00:51.510> pinched

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
may ask is so if say wire gets pinched

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.130 
may ask is so if say wire gets pinched
too<00:00:52.050> tight<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:53.160> don't<00:00:53.340> ground<00:00:53.579> out<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.140> set

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
too tight you don't ground out and set

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.840 
too tight you don't ground out and set
your<00:00:55.289> driver<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.710> fire<00:00:55.920> ground<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:56.640> blow

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
your driver on fire ground out or blow

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.910 
your driver on fire ground out or blow
it<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.199> they<00:00:58.199> slide<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.100> driver<00:01:00.859> like<00:01:01.859> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
it up they slide on the driver like a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.119 
it up they slide on the driver like a
and<00:01:02.870> they<00:01:03.870> come<00:01:04.049> off<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.010> can

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and they come off so that you can

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.149 
and they come off so that you can
service<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.549> woofer<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> future<00:01:06.650> now<00:01:07.650> these

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
service a woofer in the future now these

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.340 
service a woofer in the future now these
type<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.030> drivers<00:01:09.510> are<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> little<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:10.110> time

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
type of drivers are a little more time

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.149 
type of drivers are a little more time
consuming<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.070> connection<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:13.740> let's<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:14.040> on

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
consuming on connection so let's go on

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.670 
consuming on connection so let's go on
to<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> next<00:01:14.549> driver<00:01:18.080> again<00:01:19.080> we're<00:01:19.380> at<00:01:19.500> the
