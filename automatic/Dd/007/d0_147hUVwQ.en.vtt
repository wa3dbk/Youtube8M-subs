00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to go to to pass basically this means

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.859 
to go to to pass basically this means
that<00:01:10.080> once<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.610> done<00:01:11.820> exporting<00:01:12.360> once<00:01:12.570> it's

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that once it is done exporting once it's

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.230 
that once it is done exporting once it's
going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.229> back<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.770> export<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.670> again

going to go back and export it again

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.420 
going to go back and export it again
it's<00:01:15.450> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:15.780> two<00:01:15.990> passes<00:01:16.439> which<00:01:17.130> means

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
it's going to do two passes which means

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.999 
it's going to do two passes which means
you'll<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> best<00:01:17.939> quality<00:01:18.710> again<00:01:19.710> so

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
you'll get the best quality again so

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.530 
you'll get the best quality again so
