 were on the loose in alcabideche 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.200
 The animals were poorly fed and 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.209
 a danger to road traffic 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.740
 public the animals were now the fact 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.550

 since 2008 in all the years to have several 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.300
 denounces our apartment forward to 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.120
 existence of animals on public roads without 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.890
 on this road as on the freeway and this

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.460
 circulation of public roads and itself the 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.690
 maltreatment or poor packaging 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.610
 of animals 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.379
 one week ago one of the mares died 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.489
 because I had no living conditions of 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.309
 another solution 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.500
 Mr. Barros determines that he has no 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.809
 financial means in order to maintain 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.790
 these animals in a good condition and this 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.980
 has originated in the original during 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.980
 years all a whole process quantity 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.800
 that it is possible to refer 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.020
 finally put so many organisms that 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.450
 have their own powers of safeguarding 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.729
 of the municipal regulation, which is the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.950
 also the set-up is very demanding to 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.500
 level of safeguarding the animal condition 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.000
 we can not agree with this pac 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.299
 type of situations and in this sense 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.620
 we are here to tour and we are certain that 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.620
 we are doing what is right to do 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.659
 We already have our own facilities. 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.979
 We have other animals as well. 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.130

 pactual sa sintra-cascais of the movement 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.590
 cascades 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.659
 we are in a position to give a good 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.909
 treatment of feed 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.310
 health care investments will 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.189
 need and so they will stay 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.039
 certainly better and he for us is always 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.539
 another moment of beauty within the 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.599
 natural beauty that is the very
