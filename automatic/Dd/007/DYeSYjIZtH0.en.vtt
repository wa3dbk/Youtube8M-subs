00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
look at really putting the moves on him

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.980 
look at really putting the moves on him
doing<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.280> thing<00:01:08.580> right<00:01:08.880> there<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.780> we're

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
doing this thing right there now we're

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.929 
doing this thing right there now we're
in<00:01:10.049> position<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.619> score<00:01:10.740> again<00:01:11.220> Ridley<00:01:11.760> with

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
in position to score again Ridley with

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.870 
in position to score again Ridley with
another<00:01:12.210> touchdown<00:01:12.979> that<00:01:13.979> was<00:01:14.130> his<00:01:14.310> second<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
another touchdown that was his second of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
another touchdown that was his second of
the<00:01:15.000> half<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.600> now<00:01:15.810> we're<00:01:16.049> still<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the half so now we're still in the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.359 
the half so now we're still in the
second<00:01:16.950> quarter

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
second quarter

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.109 
second quarter
my<00:01:17.729> man's<00:01:17.970> pay<00:01:18.210> dropping<00:01:18.810> back<00:01:19.080> he's<00:01:19.320> sacked

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
my man's pay dropping back he's sacked

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.399 
my man's pay dropping back he's sacked
so<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.180> believe<00:01:21.509> he<00:01:21.630> made<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> quarterback

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
so I believe he made a quarterback

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.219 
so I believe he made a quarterback
change<00:01:22.680> after<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.280> he<00:01:24.270> put<00:01:24.479> his<00:01:24.600> man<00:01:24.780> EJ

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
change after that he put his man EJ

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.530 
change after that he put his man EJ
Manuel<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.950> he's<00:01:26.400> throwing<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.939> dot<00:01:27.210> right

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
Manuel in he's throwing a dot right

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.210 
Manuel in he's throwing a dot right
there<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.470> not<00:01:28.560> enough<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.159> first

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
there but it's not enough for the first

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.240 
there but it's not enough for the first
down<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> few<00:01:31.170> more<00:01:31.350> seconds<00:01:31.799> in

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
down so now I have a few more seconds in

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950 
down so now I have a few more seconds in
the<00:01:32.549> second<00:01:32.909> quarter<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.329> want<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> try<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.780> get

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the second quarter I want to try to get

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.590 
the second quarter I want to try to get
in<00:01:34.079> field<00:01:34.380> goal<00:01:34.619> position<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.270> bounds

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
in field goal position I'm out of bounds

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.270
