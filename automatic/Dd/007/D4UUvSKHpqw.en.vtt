spear<00:00:27.689> spokes<00:00:28.340> I<00:00:29.340> went<00:00:29.970> with<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:31.070> external

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
spear spokes I went with the external

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.220 
spear spokes I went with the external
USB<00:00:33.380> cable<00:00:34.880> because<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.120> decided<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.840> go<00:00:37.020> with

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
USB cable because I decided to go with

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.400 
USB cable because I decided to go with
the<00:00:37.500> external<00:00:38.070> controller<00:00:38.930> simply<00:00:39.930> because

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the external controller simply because

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.430 
the external controller simply because
reading<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> forums<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.960> controller

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
reading on the forums and the controller

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.369 
reading on the forums and the controller
that<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:44.010> internal<00:00:44.870> if<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.020> go<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.350> that

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
that is internal if you go for that

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.130 
that is internal if you go for that
option<00:00:46.850> some<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> guys<00:00:48.239> wish<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.930> that

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
option some of the guys wish to that

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.869 
option some of the guys wish to that
actually<00:00:49.469> got<00:00:49.620> external<00:00:50.160> simply<00:00:50.520> because

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
actually got external simply because

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.799 
actually got external simply because
they<00:00:51.719> had<00:00:52.140> more<00:00:52.410> options<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.750> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
they had more options so with that I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.270 
they had more options so with that I
just<00:00:55.140> was<00:00:55.289> okay<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:56.699> still<00:00:56.969> um<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.710> cost

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
just was okay or going still um the cost

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.660 
just was okay or going still um the cost
of<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.539> USB<00:01:01.199> cable<00:01:01.469> was<00:01:01.829> about<00:01:02.070> twenty<00:01:02.399> US

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
of the USB cable was about twenty US

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.800 
of the USB cable was about twenty US
dollars<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:04.640> made<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.820> China<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.299> thought<00:01:06.630> that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
dollars but made in China I thought that

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.230 
dollars but made in China I thought that
was<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:07.170> bit<00:01:07.470> expensive<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.760> don't

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
was a little bit expensive but I don't

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.810 
was a little bit expensive but I don't
have<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> wiring<00:01:09.720> diagrams<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:11.189> thought

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
have the wiring diagrams and I thought

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.800 
have the wiring diagrams and I thought
well<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.600> know<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.799> get<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.920> now<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.810> right

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
well you know I get it now and right

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.050 
well you know I get it now and right
what<00:01:16.439> else<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.520> handgun

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
what else you get is you get a handgun

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.560 
what else you get is you get a handgun
and<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.610> take<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> left<00:01:21.240> hand

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and this is for I take it the left hand

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.649 
and this is for I take it the left hand
side<00:01:21.900> possibly<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:23.460> plastic<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.150> seems<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
side possibly this plastic in seems a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.600 
side possibly this plastic in seems a
little<00:01:24.810> bit<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.470> don't<00:01:25.740> know<00:01:26.630> cheap<00:01:27.630> but

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
little bit I don't know cheap but

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.730 
little bit I don't know cheap but
hopefully<00:01:29.689> hopefully<00:01:30.689> it'll<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.140> okay

not don't end on dropping it on the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.510 
not don't end on dropping it on the
left-hand<00:01:35.400> side<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.689> button<00:01:37.520> some

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520

left-hand side you have button some
buttons<00:01:38.850> switches<00:01:39.170> for<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.229> horn<00:01:40.560> and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
buttons switches for the horn and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.039 
buttons switches for the horn and
another<00:01:41.520> Reed<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:41.939> now<00:01:42.180> I'm<00:01:42.240> not<00:01:42.479> really<00:01:42.750> sure

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
what it is do it I had to look at the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.580 
what it is do it I had to look at the
instructions

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
instructions

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.929

maybe<00:01:48.189> something<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.579> do<00:01:48.640> with<00:01:48.729> cruise

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
maybe something to do with cruise

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.690

further on we have the controller itself
going<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.829> take<00:02:00.009> a<00:02:00.039> little<00:02:00.280> probably<00:02:00.700> fit

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
going to take a little probably fit

it's<00:02:32.799> got<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.280> button<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.180> taking<00:02:34.569> this<00:02:34.690> as

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
it's got a button on taking this as

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.229 
it's got a button on taking this as
possibly<00:02:35.170> for<00:02:35.410> cruise<00:02:35.650> control<00:02:36.000> now<00:02:37.000> you've

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
possibly for cruise control now you've

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.059 
possibly for cruise control now you've
got<00:02:37.480> three<00:02:37.690> lights<00:02:38.019> for<00:02:38.440> battery<00:02:38.830> condition

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
got three lights for battery condition

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.949 
got three lights for battery condition
for<00:02:40.440> half<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.830> empty<00:02:42.340> that's<00:02:43.330> probably<00:02:43.750> when

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
for half and empty that's probably when

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.610 
for half and empty that's probably when
you<00:02:44.049> pedals<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.500> peeling<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:47.140> does

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
you pedals that peeling you that it does

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.250 
you pedals that peeling you that it does
come<00:02:47.890> with<00:02:47.920> brake<00:02:48.549> handles<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.569> doesn't<00:02:50.019> come

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
come with brake handles it doesn't come

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.590 
come with brake handles it doesn't come
with<00:02:50.560> disc<00:02:50.980> brakes<00:02:51.040> like<00:02:51.640> one<00:02:52.150> person

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
with disc brakes like one person

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.500 
with disc brakes like one person
suggested<00:02:52.840> but<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:54.459> does<00:02:54.730> come<00:02:55.000> with<00:02:55.030> the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
suggested but it does come with the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.500 
suggested but it does come with the
brake<00:02:55.750> handles<00:02:56.170> probably<00:02:56.890> sense<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.970> for

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
brake handles probably sense that for

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.710 
brake handles probably sense that for
being<00:02:58.780> for<00:02:59.049> regenerative<00:02:59.799> braking<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.760> let

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
being for regenerative braking and let

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.360 
being for regenerative braking and let
the<00:03:01.810> control<00:03:02.109> unknown<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.980> if<00:03:03.069> you<00:03:03.160> can<00:03:03.250> see

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
the control unknown and if you can see

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.759 
the control unknown and if you can see
the<00:03:03.459> switch<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:03.910> their<00:03:04.030> little<00:03:04.299> red<00:03:04.390> thing

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
the switch and their little red thing

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.190 
the switch and their little red thing
that<00:03:06.299> you're<00:03:07.299> actually<00:03:07.660> activating<00:03:07.959> the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
that you're actually activating the

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.949 
that you're actually activating the
brake<00:03:08.380> so<00:03:08.910> drop<00:03:09.910> out<00:03:10.060> cruise<00:03:10.359> control<00:03:10.810> and

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
brake so drop out cruise control and

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.020 
brake so drop out cruise control and
we're<00:03:11.109> sort<00:03:11.380> of<00:03:11.410> back<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:11.859> get<00:03:12.549> two<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.819> those

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
we're sort of back so get two of those

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.319 
we're sort of back so get two of those
and<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:14.530> think<00:03:14.769> that's<00:03:14.950> about<00:03:15.579> it<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:16.030> didn't

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
and I think that's about it it didn't

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.960 
and I think that's about it it didn't
take<00:03:16.480> about<00:03:16.690> ten<00:03:16.989> days<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.440> get<00:03:17.590> here<00:03:17.920> but<00:03:18.670> that

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
take about ten days to get here but that

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.460 
take about ten days to get here but that
was<00:03:19.120> fine<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.450> contracted<00:03:19.959> through<00:03:20.079> you<00:03:20.290> miss

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
was fine you contracted through you miss

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.569 
was fine you contracted through you miss
shipping<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.720> half<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.959> cost<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.530> about<00:03:24.370> half

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
shipping and half the cost of about half

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.420 
shipping and half the cost of about half
the<00:03:24.760> cost<00:03:24.970> of<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.329> kit<00:03:25.680> was<00:03:26.680> involved<00:03:27.130> an

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
the cost of this kit was involved an

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.690 
the cost of this kit was involved an
actual<00:03:27.970> shipping<00:03:28.389> and<00:03:28.859> so<00:03:29.859> yeah<00:03:30.190> that's<00:03:30.430> about

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
actual shipping and so yeah that's about

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.449 
actual shipping and so yeah that's about
it<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.500> we<00:03:32.500> didn't<00:03:32.769> go<00:03:32.859> for<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.069> battery

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
it and we didn't go for the battery

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.160 
it and we didn't go for the battery
packs<00:03:34.019> because<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:36.100> local<00:03:36.489> suppliers<00:03:37.170> seemed

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
packs because the local suppliers seemed

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.280 
packs because the local suppliers seemed
to<00:03:38.530> be<00:03:38.739> cheaper<00:03:39.280> but<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.450> know<00:03:40.569> we'll<00:03:40.750> look

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
to be cheaper but you know we'll look

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.030 
to be cheaper but you know we'll look
into<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.709> as<00:03:41.920> we<00:03:42.100> go<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:42.850> I<00:03:43.150> guess<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:44.799> build

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
into that as we go so I guess the build

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.819 
into that as we go so I guess the build
starts<00:03:45.549> soon
