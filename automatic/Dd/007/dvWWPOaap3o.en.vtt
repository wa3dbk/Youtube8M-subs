folks<00:00:50.350> ask<00:00:51.100> about<00:00:52.000> how<00:00:52.540> to<00:00:52.600> put<00:00:52.960> in<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.170> filter

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
folks ask about how to put in the filter

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.960 
folks ask about how to put in the filter
so<00:00:54.520> I<00:00:54.580> just<00:00:54.730> want<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:55.000> show<00:00:55.180> you<00:00:55.240> guys<00:00:55.540> that

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
so I just want to show you guys that

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.060 
so I just want to show you guys that
basically<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.450> Kim<00:00:59.080> X<00:00:59.260> filter<00:00:59.590> is<00:00:59.740> a<00:00:59.770> much

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
basically the Kim X filter is a much

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.900 
basically the Kim X filter is a much
thicker<00:01:00.460> filter<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.980> its<00:01:03.280> purpose<00:01:03.700> is<00:01:03.880> to

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
thicker filter and so its purpose is to

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.580 
thicker filter and so its purpose is to
really<00:01:04.330> you're<00:01:04.600> gonna<00:01:05.079> have<00:01:05.289> a<00:01:05.320> slower

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
really you're gonna have a slower

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.230 
really you're gonna have a slower
brewing<00:01:05.920> process<00:01:06.070> that's<00:01:06.759> why<00:01:06.939> you<00:01:07.000> want

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
brewing process that's why you want

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.139 
brewing process that's why you want
grind<00:01:07.420> coarser<00:01:07.840> but<00:01:08.619> as<00:01:08.799> you<00:01:08.920> see<00:01:09.130> it<00:01:09.280> has<00:01:09.429> one

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
grind coarser but as you see it has one

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:18.810 
grind coarser but as you see it has one
two<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:13.229> three<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:14.439> four<00:01:16.859> flaps<00:01:17.859> here<00:01:18.280> you

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
two and three and four flaps here you

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.529 
two and three and four flaps here you
basically<00:01:18.969> want<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.539> take<00:01:19.829> one<00:01:20.829> and<00:01:21.509> three<00:01:22.509> and

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
basically want to take one and three and

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.550 
basically want to take one and three and
divide<00:01:22.990> them<00:01:23.170> out<00:01:24.869> I'll<00:01:25.869> show<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.380> right

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
divide them out I'll show you that right

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.099 
divide them out I'll show you that right
there<00:01:26.859> and<00:01:27.149> so<00:01:28.149> one<00:01:28.450> side<00:01:28.659> is<00:01:28.780> going<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:28.990> be

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
there and so one side is going to be

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.399 
there and so one side is going to be
thicker<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:30.369> thicker<00:01:30.670> side<00:01:31.109> you<00:01:32.109> want<00:01:32.350> to

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
thicker the thicker side you want to

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.559 
thicker the thicker side you want to
place<00:01:33.270> them<00:01:34.270> right<00:01:35.020> on<00:01:35.079> the<00:01:35.380> spout<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:37.329> like

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
place them right on the spout just like

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.160 
place them right on the spout just like
that<00:01:37.810> you<00:01:38.439> don't<00:01:38.649> want<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:40.509> know<00:01:40.630> have<00:01:40.929> it

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
that you don't want to you know have it

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.830 
that you don't want to you know have it
the<00:01:41.469> corner<00:01:41.979> into<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.340> spout<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:43.479> don't<00:01:43.659> want

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
the corner into the spout you don't want

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.080 
the corner into the spout you don't want
it<00:01:43.929> reversed<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:45.340> want<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.579> make<00:01:45.670> sure<00:01:45.700> you

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
it reversed you want to make sure you

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.669 
it reversed you want to make sure you
have<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.329> right<00:01:46.600> on<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.869> spout<00:01:47.109> the<00:01:47.409> reason

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
have it right on the spout the reason

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.809 
have it right on the spout the reason
for<00:01:47.829> this<00:01:48.009> is<00:01:48.069> you<00:01:48.280> want<00:01:48.549> proper<00:01:49.359> air<00:01:49.509> flow

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
for this is you want proper air flow

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.010 
for this is you want proper air flow
throughout<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:51.999> brewing<00:01:52.240> process

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
throughout the brewing process

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.309 
throughout the brewing process
so<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:54.130> gases<00:01:54.310> can<00:01:54.639> escape<00:01:55.030> if<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:55.929> don't<00:01:56.139> do

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
so the gases can escape if you don't do

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.139 
so the gases can escape if you don't do
that<00:01:56.499> you're<00:01:57.280> going<00:01:57.459> to<00:01:57.609> see<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.030> your

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
that you're going to see that your

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.459 
that you're going to see that your
coffee<00:01:58.359> is<00:01:58.509> going<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:58.659> bubble<00:01:58.899> up<00:01:59.139> and<00:01:59.380> it's

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
coffee is going to bubble up and it's

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.080 
coffee is going to bubble up and it's
going<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.619> cause<00:01:59.829> a<00:01:59.859> mess<00:02:00.189> with<00:02:00.789> a<00:02:00.819> little

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090
