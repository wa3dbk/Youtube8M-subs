00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
draw like an earthquake hi guys welcome

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.840 
draw like an earthquake hi guys welcome
to<00:00:13.980> my<00:00:14.610> review<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:17.869> TX<00:00:18.869> 2002<00:00:19.850> metal

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
to my review of the TX 2002 metal

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.900 
to my review of the TX 2002 metal
detector<00:00:21.300> G<00:00:21.630> will<00:00:21.750> use<00:00:21.960> pinpointer<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.130> you

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
detector G will use pinpointer and you

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.519 
detector G will use pinpointer and you
could<00:00:24.090> use<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> metal<00:00:25.050> detector<00:00:25.170> as

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
could use this as a metal detector as

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.040 
could use this as a metal detector as
well<00:00:25.710> that's<00:00:25.949> why<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.220> says<00:00:26.609> your<00:00:26.939> leaves<00:00:27.150> so

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
well that's why it says your leaves so

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.770 
well that's why it says your leaves so
yeah<00:00:28.920> let's<00:00:30.710> let's<00:00:31.759> start<00:00:32.759> off<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.149> putting

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
yeah let's let's start off with putting

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.500 
yeah let's let's start off with putting
the<00:00:33.870> battery<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.620> got<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> new<00:00:35.700> brand<00:00:36.360> new

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the battery in I got a new brand new

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.010 
the battery in I got a new brand new
battery<00:00:36.899> here<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.129> plug<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.870> like<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
battery here and you plug it to like it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.319 
battery here and you plug it to like it
should<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:42.260> there<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:43.850> then<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.059> place<00:00:45.300> it

so first off I'm going to show you a
little<00:00:54.809> some<00:00:55.379> features<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.340> TX<00:00:56.820> 2000

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
little some features with the TX 2000

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.250 
little some features with the TX 2000
first<00:00:58.500> off<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> volume<00:00:59.309> button<00:00:59.460> here

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
first off you have a volume button here

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.860 
first off you have a volume button here
now<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.730> here<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.329> pinpoint

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
now it's on here you have the pinpoint

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.240 
now it's on here you have the pinpoint
button<00:01:04.790> if<00:01:05.790> we<00:01:05.970> turn<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.650> there<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> little

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
button if we turn it there is a little

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.420 
button if we turn it there is a little
LED<00:01:08.430> light<00:01:08.460> when<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.330> put<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:11.070> pinpoint

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
LED light when you put the pinpoint

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.649 
LED light when you put the pinpoint
button<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.790> here's<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.750> sensitivity<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
button on here's the sensitivity and

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.999 
button on here's the sensitivity and
yeah<00:01:15.659> that's<00:01:15.990> pretty<00:01:16.200> much<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.560> here's<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
yeah that's pretty much it here's the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.350 
yeah that's pretty much it here's the
probe<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:20.130> also<00:01:20.369> follows<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.119> this

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
probe and it also follows with this

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.260 
probe and it also follows with this
copper<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.710> put<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:24.090> that's

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
copper here you can put it in so that's

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.920 
copper here you can put it in so that's
nice<00:01:25.220> mine<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> little<00:01:26.970> bit<00:01:27.119> used<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.689> of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
nice mine is a little bit used so of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.069 
nice mine is a little bit used so of
course<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.290> will<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:29.210> exactly<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.540> good<00:01:30.869> as

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
course it will not be exactly as good as

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.310 
course it will not be exactly as good as
a<00:01:31.110> brand<00:01:31.560> new<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:32.509> but<00:01:33.979> yeah<00:01:35.900> it's<00:01:36.900> really

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
a brand new one but yeah it's really

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.640 
a brand new one but yeah it's really
cheap<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.369> gets<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> job<00:01:39.450> done<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.960> I

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
cheap and it gets the job done so I

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.270 
cheap and it gets the job done so I
recommend<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:42.740> one<00:01:43.740> thing<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.189> don't

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
recommend it and one thing that I don't

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.670 
recommend it and one thing that I don't
like<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.899> sensitivity<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
like with it is the sensitivity you

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.190 
like with it is the sensitivity you
can't<00:01:46.950> turn<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.250> sensitivity<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:48.149> fill<00:01:48.360> this

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
can't turn the sensitivity to fill this

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.539 
can't turn the sensitivity to fill this
now<00:01:50.420> if<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.630> turn<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:53.540> it<00:01:54.680> reads<00:01:55.680> itself<00:01:56.280> and

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
now if I turn it it reads itself and

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.859 
now if I turn it it reads itself and
that's<00:01:56.610> not<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.149> good<00:01:57.450> thing<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:59.750> we're<00:02:00.750> going

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
that's not a good thing so we're going

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.560 
that's not a good thing so we're going
to<00:02:00.930> put<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.710> almost<00:02:02.130> max<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.909> we're<00:02:03.420> gonna

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
to put it to almost max and we're gonna

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.419 
to put it to almost max and we're gonna
check<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:07.399> okay<00:02:08.399> so

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
check here okay so

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.630 
check here okay so

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
here I have put out centimeters and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.039 
here I have put out centimeters and
here's<00:02:16.000> inches<00:02:16.540> like<00:02:17.260> here<00:02:17.590> should<00:02:17.859> be<00:02:19.049> three

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
here's inches like here should be three

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:25.500 
here's inches like here should be three
inches<00:02:20.379> but<00:02:21.370> it's<00:02:21.879> not<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.239> powerful<00:02:24.510> so

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
inches but it's not that powerful so

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.910 
inches but it's not that powerful so
about<00:02:25.780> this<00:02:25.989> for<00:02:26.290> about<00:02:27.900> 30<00:02:28.900> bucks<00:02:29.530> or

a<00:02:45.609> pretty<00:02:46.239> small<00:02:46.689> coin<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.829> we're<00:02:47.980> going<00:02:48.129> to

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
a pretty small coin and we're going to

00:02:48.189 --> 00:03:06.170 
a pretty small coin and we're going to
check<00:02:48.370> how<00:02:48.669> close<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.359> gets<00:02:52.769> let's<00:02:53.769> turn<00:02:54.069> it<00:02:54.159> on

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.309 
okay so this little coin about it
triggers<00:03:13.120> off<00:03:13.269> at<00:03:13.449> 2<00:03:13.720> centimeters<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.989> camera

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
triggers off at 2 centimeters the camera

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.869 
triggers off at 2 centimeters the camera
angle<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.769> little<00:03:18.069> bit<00:03:18.190> wrong<00:03:18.370> so<00:03:18.549> I<00:03:18.609> can<00:03:18.760> see

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
angle is a little bit wrong so I can see

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.759 
angle is a little bit wrong so I can see
from<00:03:19.090> upper<00:03:19.359> 2<00:03:19.810> centimeters<00:03:20.489> so<00:03:21.489> that's<00:03:21.970> nice

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
from upper 2 centimeters so that's nice

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.929 
from upper 2 centimeters so that's nice
do<00:03:23.769> something<00:03:24.099> like<00:03:24.159> this<00:03:24.280> on<00:03:24.459> this<00:03:24.669> little

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:04.739 
okay at one inch it does definitely

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:12.799 
okay at one inch it does definitely
trigger<00:06:05.869> here<00:06:10.159> this<00:06:11.159> doesn't<00:06:12.059> use<00:06:12.269> that<00:06:12.300> much

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:12.809 
trigger here this doesn't use that much

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.139 
trigger here this doesn't use that much
battery<00:06:13.259> and<00:06:13.529> since<00:06:14.129> it's<00:06:14.279> really<00:06:14.639> cheap<00:06:14.879> I

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:15.149 
battery and since it's really cheap I

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:17.419 
battery and since it's really cheap I
thought<00:06:15.779> it<00:06:15.959> would<00:06:16.169> be<00:06:16.289> really<00:06:16.499> bad<00:06:16.800> detector

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:17.429 
thought it would be really bad detector

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:20.629 
thought it would be really bad detector
no<00:06:17.909> pin<00:06:18.479> pointer<00:06:18.839> but<00:06:19.619> for<00:06:20.009> the<00:06:20.099> price<00:06:20.309> it's

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
no pin pointer but for the price it's

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.499 
no pin pointer but for the price it's
actually<00:06:21.149> really<00:06:21.449> good<00:06:21.719> I<00:06:23.209> recommend<00:06:24.209> using

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
actually really good I recommend using

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.669 
actually really good I recommend using
this<00:06:24.899> all<00:06:25.439> the<00:06:25.679> time<00:06:26.689> maybe<00:06:27.689> put<00:06:28.199> a<00:06:28.229> plastic

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:28.679 
this all the time maybe put a plastic

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:30.679 
this all the time maybe put a plastic
bag<00:06:28.739> like<00:06:29.129> I<00:06:29.249> do<00:06:29.309> for<00:06:29.639> rain<00:06:29.819> proof<00:06:30.029> mud<00:06:30.360> proof
