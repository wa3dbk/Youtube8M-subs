to show you guys a little basically it's
the<00:00:09.750> useless<00:00:10.050> machine<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.740> Minecraft<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:12.120> is

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
the useless machine in Minecraft this is

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.570 
the useless machine in Minecraft this is
probably<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.870> most<00:00:12.900> compact<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.130> made<00:00:14.429> it

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
probably the most compact I have made it

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.540 
probably the most compact I have made it
and<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:15.630> err<00:00:15.780> comers<00:00:16.080> these<00:00:16.740> are<00:00:16.949> other

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and it's err comers these are other

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.679 
and it's err comers these are other
versions<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.539> one<00:00:18.750> here<00:00:18.930> works<00:00:20.689> these

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
versions like this one here works these

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.800 
versions like this one here works these
two<00:00:22.080> are<00:00:22.140> both<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.500> same<00:00:23.060> this<00:00:24.060> here<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.480> just

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
two are both the same this here is just

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.080 
two are both the same this here is just
a<00:00:25.789> version<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.859> if<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.670> don't<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:29.970> what

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
a version of it if you don't know what

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.030 
a version of it if you don't know what
the<00:00:30.179> end<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.810> here<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.679> weird

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the end this here is like a weird

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.380 
the end this here is like a weird
version<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:35.270> don't<00:00:36.270> know

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
version that it's just I don't know

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.139 
version that it's just I don't know
what's<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.200> never<00:00:37.380> worked<00:00:37.940> this<00:00:38.940> one

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
what's that one never worked this one

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.580 
what's that one never worked this one
doesn't<00:00:39.510> work<00:00:39.829> it<00:00:40.829> does<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:42.260> but<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> feel

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
doesn't work it does that but I feel

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.959 
doesn't work it does that but I feel
this<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.010> here<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.309> probably<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.760> most

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
this one here is probably the most

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.720 
this one here is probably the most
compact<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.750> I've<00:00:45.870> ever<00:00:46.079> made<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:47.250> there's

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
compact that I've ever made and there's

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.840 
compact that I've ever made and there's
a<00:00:47.820> little<00:00:47.969> reset<00:00:48.360> much<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.690> there<00:00:48.870> but

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
a little reset much in there but

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.330 
a little reset much in there but
basically<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.449> tired<00:00:51.719> machine<00:00:52.199> itself<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
basically the tired machine itself is a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.860 
basically the tired machine itself is a
3x3<00:00:54.329> square<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.170> let's<00:00:56.039> start<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.370> that

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
3x3 square so let's start with that

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.070 
3x3 square so let's start with that
Frank<00:00:58.489> creating<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.050> 3x3<00:01:01.050> square<00:01:03.080> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
Frank creating it's a 3x3 square and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.550 
Frank creating it's a 3x3 square and
then<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:06.049> make<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.290> little

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
then what you do is so make your little

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.030 
then what you do is so make your little
3x3<00:01:08.130> square<00:01:08.159> hat<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:13.350> all<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.650> machine

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
3x3 square hat so all this machine

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.810 
3x3 square hat so all this machine
really<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:16.290> all<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> 3x3<00:01:17.369> square<00:01:17.460> so

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
really is is it's all in a 3x3 square so

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.700 
really is is it's all in a 3x3 square so
you<00:01:17.850> could<00:01:18.119> take<00:01:18.509> out<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:20.299> alright<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.710> here

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
you could take out that alright so here

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.800 
you could take out that alright so here
is<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.610> actual<00:01:23.759> block<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.509> you're<00:01:24.689> good

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
is the actual block that you're good

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.710 
is the actual block that you're good
with<00:01:25.439> alright<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.880> choose<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.270> sitting<00:01:27.570> on

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
with alright if you choose up sitting on

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.920 
with alright if you choose up sitting on
bedrock<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:29.159> makes<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.150> lot<00:01:30.270> easier<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
bedrock it makes it a lot easier and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.039 
bedrock it makes it a lot easier and
right<00:01:31.320> you're<00:01:32.040> gonna<00:01:32.159> need<00:01:32.430> either<00:01:33.049> basically

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
right you're gonna need either basically

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.880 
right you're gonna need either basically
fence<00:01:34.380> gates<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.689> boost<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.900> rails<00:01:39.890> redstone

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
fence gates to boost the rails redstone

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.399 
fence gates to boost the rails redstone
lamp<00:01:41.159> or<00:01:41.579> whatever<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.329> prefer<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.110> redstone

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
lamp or whatever I prefer the redstone

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.810 
lamp or whatever I prefer the redstone
I'm<00:01:43.560> considering<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.130> doesn't<00:01:44.340> make<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> sound

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
I'm considering it doesn't make a sound

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.210 
I'm considering it doesn't make a sound
and<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:46.170> don't<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.409> need<00:01:46.649> block

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and you don't really need block

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.389 
and you don't really need block
underneath<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> would<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.920> nice<00:01:50.130> but

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
underneath it and it would be nice but

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.510 
underneath it and it would be nice but
okay<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:52.009> basically<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.430> activate<00:01:55.520> two

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
okay so as basically to activate two

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.240 
okay so as basically to activate two
Pistons<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:57.770> which<00:01:58.770> one<00:01:59.100> is

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
Pistons that we have here which one is

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.940 
Pistons that we have here which one is
gonna<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> sticky<00:02:00.060> pistons<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.560> all

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
gonna be a sticky pistons that is all

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.330 
gonna be a sticky pistons that is all
nice<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.250> sticky<00:02:02.790> from<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.360> those<00:02:03.450> slimes

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
nice and sticky from one of those slimes

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.869 
nice and sticky from one of those slimes
and<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> next<00:02:05.909> one<00:02:07.160> is<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:09.690> normal<00:02:10.229> person

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
and then the next one is a normal person

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.710 
and then the next one is a normal person
then<00:02:11.879> what<00:02:12.000> you're<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.270> want<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.510> do

here is
just<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.810> carve<00:02:16.020> out<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.170> little<00:02:16.350> two<00:02:16.740> channels

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
just to carve out a little two channels

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.100 
just to carve out a little two channels
right<00:02:17.340> here<00:02:18.860> then<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.160> one<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.090> gonna<00:02:21.240> be<00:02:21.510> like

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
right here then and one is gonna be like

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
that and let me just double check over

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.160 
that and let me just double check over
here<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:28.260> didn't<00:02:28.470> know<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> ones<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:28.950> gonna

here you didn't know the ones just gonna

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.570 
here you didn't know the ones just gonna
go<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:32.160> that

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
go like that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.110 
go like that
so<00:02:33.140> was<00:02:34.140> gonna<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:35.280> goal<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.790> put<00:02:35.970> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
so was gonna the goal is to put the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.290 
so was gonna the goal is to put the
redstone<00:02:36.710> here

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
redstone here

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.460 
redstone here
no<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.480> one's<00:02:39.630> gonna<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.170> put<00:02:40.350> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
no the one's gonna be to put the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.250 
no the one's gonna be to put the
redstone<00:02:40.620> here<00:02:44.450> like<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.660> redstone<00:02:46.020> signal

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
redstone here like the redstone signal

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.240 
redstone here like the redstone signal
even<00:02:47.040> though<00:02:47.310> if<00:02:47.490> you<00:02:47.610> power<00:02:48.830> either<00:02:49.830> those

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
even though if you power either those

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.920 
even though if you power either those
blocks<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.730> believe<00:02:50.970> even<00:02:51.120> if<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:51.660> powered

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
blocks I believe even if I just powered

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.190 
blocks I believe even if I just powered
that<00:02:52.110> one<00:02:52.460> I'd<00:02:53.460> basically<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.180> lengthen<00:02:55.020> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
that one I'd basically the lengthen the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.290 
that one I'd basically the lengthen the
delay<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.280> bottom<00:02:56.550> once<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.850> stays<00:02:57.090> up

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
delay on the bottom once it stays up

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.480 
delay on the bottom once it stays up
longer<00:02:59.960> there<00:03:00.960> you<00:03:01.020> go<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.170> do<00:03:01.320> is<00:03:01.590> read<00:03:01.770> set<00:03:02.070> put

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
longer there you go I do is read set put

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.570 
longer there you go I do is read set put
redstone<00:03:02.930> dust<00:03:03.930> right<00:03:04.440> there<00:03:04.710> in<00:03:04.860> there<00:03:05.100> so

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
redstone dust right there in there so

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.510 
redstone dust right there in there so
that<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:07.530> go<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.860> then<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.040> get<00:03:08.280> your

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
that you go and then you get your

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.060 
that you go and then you get your
repeaters<00:03:09.120> here<00:03:09.860> which<00:03:10.970> are<00:03:11.970> kind<00:03:12.210> of<00:03:12.240> key

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
repeaters here which are kind of key

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.220 
repeaters here which are kind of key
this<00:03:14.070> one<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.400> don't<00:03:14.550> really<00:03:14.670> need<00:03:15.000> or<00:03:15.420> peer

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
this one you don't really need or peer

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.180 
this one you don't really need or peer
but<00:03:16.530> this<00:03:16.710> one<00:03:16.890> you<00:03:16.920> do<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:18.290> could<00:03:19.290> just<00:03:20.010> do<00:03:20.160> that

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
but this one you do I could just do that

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.700 
but this one you do I could just do that
and<00:03:20.670> believe<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.330> should<00:03:21.780> still<00:03:22.140> work<00:03:22.350> then<00:03:22.620> we

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
and believe it should still work then we

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.270 
and believe it should still work then we
grab<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:24.560> lover<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:27.590> okay<00:03:28.590> yeah<00:03:28.710> yeah<00:03:28.890> no<00:03:29.070> you

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
grab a lover and okay yeah yeah no you

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.450 
grab a lover and okay yeah yeah no you
needs<00:03:29.520> a<00:03:29.580> repeater<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:32.360> need<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.450> or<00:03:33.600> Peter

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
needs a repeater you need to or Peter

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.980 
needs a repeater you need to or Peter
and<00:03:35.460> it's<00:03:36.090> always<00:03:36.270> a<00:03:36.330> good<00:03:36.450> idea<00:03:36.510> put<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
and it's always a good idea put the

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.570 
and it's always a good idea put the
reset<00:03:37.320> button<00:03:37.730> there<00:03:39.410> just<00:03:40.410> in<00:03:40.770> case<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:41.190> have

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
reset button there just in case you have

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.170 
reset button there just in case you have
mistakes<00:03:42.120> but<00:03:43.580> yeah<00:03:44.580> so<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.820> make<00:03:45.000> sure<00:03:45.150> that

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
mistakes but yeah so I make sure that

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.490 
mistakes but yeah so I make sure that
they're<00:03:45.450> on<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.950> ticks<00:03:47.220> are<00:03:48.500> completely

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
they're on to the ticks are completely

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.980 
they're on to the ticks are completely
different<00:03:49.710> so<00:03:50.190> it's<00:03:51.060> mostly<00:03:51.390> trial<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:51.870> error

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
different so it's mostly trial and error

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.120 
different so it's mostly trial and error
with<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.230> text<00:03:53.480> this<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.810> believe<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:55.770> being

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
with the text this I believe this being

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.850 
with the text this I believe this being
on<00:03:56.250> um<00:03:56.600> so<00:03:57.600> in<00:03:57.690> here<00:03:57.810> being<00:03:58.020> on<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.110> one<00:03:58.440> tick<00:03:58.680> and

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
on um so in here being on a one tick and

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.570 
on um so in here being on a one tick and
this<00:03:58.950> one<00:03:59.130> being<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.370> have<00:03:59.490> to<00:03:59.730> tick<00:04:00.320> works<00:04:01.580> but

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
this one being I have to tick works but

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.390 
this one being I have to tick works but
you<00:04:02.640> can<00:04:02.700> also<00:04:02.910> have<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.450> get<00:04:04.260> three<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.740> a<00:04:04.830> two

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
you can also have I get three and a two

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.420 
you can also have I get three and a two
or<00:04:05.580> something<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.590> finish<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:07.920> off<00:04:08.100> put

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
or something and to finish it off put

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.120 
or something and to finish it off put
sand<00:04:08.850> or<00:04:09.030> gravel<00:04:09.240> on<00:04:09.600> top<00:04:09.630> of<00:04:11.270> the<00:04:12.270> piston<00:04:13.130> and

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
sand or gravel on top of the piston and

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.360 
sand or gravel on top of the piston and
if<00:04:14.970> all<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.480> does<00:04:15.870> is<00:04:16.080> it<00:04:16.260> allows<00:04:16.680> you<00:04:17.220> to

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
if all that does is it allows you to

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.410 
if all that does is it allows you to
hide<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.930> somewhat<00:04:18.930> not<00:04:19.560> really<00:04:19.859> but<00:04:20.390> when<00:04:21.390> I

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
hide it somewhat not really but when I

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.600 
hide it somewhat not really but when I
see<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.900> obsidian<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.620> kiss<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.950> sadness

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
see the obsidian and the kiss of sadness

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.320 
see the obsidian and the kiss of sadness
or<00:04:24.210> growls<00:04:24.840> like<00:04:25.110> really

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
or growls like really

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.820 
or growls like really
you<00:04:27.330> paint<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:29.900> mean<00:04:30.900> unless<00:04:31.380> you<00:04:31.560> can<00:04:31.680> find

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
you paint I mean unless you can find

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.470 
you paint I mean unless you can find
some<00:04:32.100> invisible<00:04:32.670> block<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.150> could<00:04:33.300> push

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
some invisible block that you could push

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.460 
some invisible block that you could push
things<00:04:33.690> through<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.440> won't<00:04:35.180> mean<00:04:36.380> for<00:04:37.380> all

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
things through and it won't mean for all

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.090 
things through and it won't mean for all
I<00:04:37.500> care<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.250> mean<00:04:38.460> put<00:04:38.760> a<00:04:38.820> melon<00:04:39.150> there<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:40.100> just

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
I care I mean put a melon there and just

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.670 
I care I mean put a melon there and just
watch<00:04:41.310> it<00:04:41.550> go<00:04:41.730> away<00:04:42.380> yeah<00:04:45.140> if<00:04:46.140> that<00:04:46.440> could<00:04:46.590> be<00:04:46.650> a

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
watch it go away yeah if that could be a

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.480 
watch it go away yeah if that could be a
machine<00:04:47.070> that'd<00:04:47.370> be<00:04:47.490> amazing

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
machine that'd be amazing

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.460 
machine that'd be amazing
it's<00:04:50.490> basically<00:04:50.880> how<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.210> build<00:04:51.570> this<00:04:51.870> version

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
it's basically how to build this version

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.730 
it's basically how to build this version
of<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:53.870> chamois<00:04:54.870> there<00:04:55.140> are<00:04:55.230> other<00:04:55.500> versions

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
of the chamois there are other versions

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.970 
of the chamois there are other versions
I've<00:04:56.040> made<00:04:56.280> like<00:04:56.990> let<00:04:57.990> me<00:04:58.080> see<00:04:58.140> if<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:58.830> can

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
I've made like let me see if I can

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.570 
I've made like let me see if I can
quickly<00:04:59.220> make<00:04:59.550> one<00:05:03.680> basically<00:05:04.680> this<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:05.460> then

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
quickly make one basically this and then

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:13.390 
quickly make one basically this and then
you<00:05:05.880> go<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:08.510> that's<00:05:09.510> this<00:05:09.960> then<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:11.040> go<00:05:11.250> I

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
you go to that's this then you go I

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.710 
you go to that's this then you go I
think<00:05:14.400> that<00:05:14.850> I<00:05:14.880> think<00:05:15.180> yes<00:05:17.360> then<00:05:18.360> you<00:05:18.510> put

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
think that I think yes then you put

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.340 
think that I think yes then you put
delay<00:05:19.350> on<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:20.400> block<00:05:20.910> with<00:05:21.450> let<00:05:22.080> me<00:05:22.140> just

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
delay on this block with let me just
