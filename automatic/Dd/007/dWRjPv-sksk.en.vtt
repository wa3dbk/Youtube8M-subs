00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
nice you know I'm not even doing

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.140 
nice you know I'm not even doing
anything<00:01:31.840> too<00:01:32.200> fancy<00:01:32.229> but<00:01:32.619> it<00:01:33.100> sounds<00:01:33.700> melodic

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
anything too fancy but it sounds melodic

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:56.080 
anything too fancy but it sounds melodic
and<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.920> i'm<00:01:36.100> doing<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:37.680> literally<00:01:38.680> just

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.090 

so<00:01:57.090> something<00:01:57.930> very<00:01:58.230> easy<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.830> can<00:01:58.980> hear

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
so something very easy but you can hear

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.950 
so something very easy but you can hear
the<00:01:59.220> chord<00:01:59.460> progression<00:01:59.940> so<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.690> hang<00:02:00.840> out

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the chord progression so if you hang out

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.850 
the chord progression so if you hang out
by<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.170> root<00:02:01.440> notes<00:02:02.240> there's<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.860> there's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
by the root notes there's a there's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.960 
by the root notes there's a there's
already<00:02:05.210> basically<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.800> melodic<00:02:07.800> type<00:02:08.009> element

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
already basically a melodic type element

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.940 
already basically a melodic type element
that's<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> come<00:02:09.570> out<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:10.470> soloing

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
that's going to come out of your soloing

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.990 
that's going to come out of your soloing
because<00:02:11.220> you're<00:02:11.370> following<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> chord

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
because you're following the chord

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.340 
because you're following the chord
progression<00:02:12.390> instead<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.720> just<00:02:12.840> playing

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.110 

whatever<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.560> know<00:02:16.680> pentatonic<00:02:17.520> craziness

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
whatever you know pentatonic craziness

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.970 
whatever you know pentatonic craziness
you're<00:02:18.960> gonna<00:02:19.080> add<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.470> pentatonic

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
you're gonna add that pentatonic

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.620 
you're gonna add that pentatonic
craziness<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.550> minute<00:02:20.790> though<00:02:20.910> let's<00:02:21.480> check

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
craziness in a minute though let's check

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.850 
craziness in a minute though let's check
me<00:02:21.810> out<00:02:21.840> one<00:02:22.050> thing<00:02:22.200> at<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.350> time<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.710> that's

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860

your<00:02:22.950> first<00:02:23.190> step<00:02:23.400> right<00:02:23.580> hanging<00:02:24.450> out<00:02:24.540> by<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
your first step right hanging out by the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.390 
your first step right hanging out by the
root<00:02:24.900> notes<00:02:25.110> exploring<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:25.770> little<00:02:26.010> bit<00:02:26.130> on<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
root notes exploring a little bit on the

root notes exploring a little bit on the
scale<00:02:28.310> next<00:02:30.680> thing<00:02:31.680> will<00:02:32.310> be<00:02:33.740> still<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:36.240> pick

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780

scale next thing will be still to pick
felt<00:02:37.050> adding<00:02:37.910> rhythmic<00:02:38.910> element<00:02:39.360> now<00:02:39.480> of

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
felt adding rhythmic element now of

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.410 
felt adding rhythmic element now of
repetition<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.910> phrasing<00:02:41.910> repented

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
repetition and phrasing repented

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.320 
repetition and phrasing repented
phrasing<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.520> then<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.640> break<00:02:44.880> that

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
phrasing and then you break that

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.300 
phrasing and then you break that
repetitive<00:02:45.660> phrasing<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.440> create<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.860> sense<00:02:47.190> of

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
repetitive phrasing to create a sense of

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.010 
repetitive phrasing to create a sense of
interest<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.270> might<00:02:48.420> be<00:02:48.510> thinking<00:02:48.630> what<00:02:48.959> the

monotone wait that's exactly what

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.400 
monotone wait that's exactly what
happens<00:04:26.919> when<00:04:27.789> you<00:04:28.120> give<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.330> guitar<00:04:29.110> so<00:04:29.259> good

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
happens when you give a guitar so good

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.260 
happens when you give a guitar so good
amount<00:04:29.590> so<00:04:29.650> when<00:04:29.889> you<00:04:30.039> hear<00:04:33.030> sounds<00:04:34.030> boring

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
to throw in there pentatonic phrases

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.860 
to throw in there pentatonic phrases
with<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:45.070> repetitiveness<00:04:45.610> so<00:04:46.000> last<00:04:46.660> but<00:04:46.720> not

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870

00:04:46.870 --> 00:05:03.510 
with the repetitiveness so last but not
least<00:04:48.240> let<00:04:49.240> it<00:04:49.270> run<00:04:49.479> one<00:04:49.690> time

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
two notes away from that central root

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.260 
two notes away from that central root

pentatonic so practice these three
elements<00:06:13.349> separately<00:06:14.009> and<00:06:14.340> I<00:06:14.430> try<00:06:14.729> to

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
elements separately and I try to

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.529 
elements separately and I try to
implement<00:06:15.180> them<00:06:15.479> and<00:06:15.660> you'll<00:06:16.470> notice<00:06:16.680> that
