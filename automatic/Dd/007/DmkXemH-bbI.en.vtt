00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.000
 Hello! I'm Susana from Pink &amp; Fun and today I want to show you the Nini Album 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.420
 Here he is! 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.840
 On the cover I put her photograph 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.840
 the name 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.000
 a ribbon with a hanging heart 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.000
 and here's a little card with the album title 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 and with space behind to write 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 about the subject of the photographs that will be placed here, 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 the date or any other relevant information 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.000
 On the spine I put only decorated paper and lace 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.000
 and behind the same thing 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.000
 Inside here, just like the other albums I've done, 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.300
 I put a small pocket with labels 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.940
 with space to write or place photos 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:18.000
 and a frame to decorate later the photographs in the free pages of the album 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.000
 now you will stay guarded here 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.700
 this side has a flap 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 here another 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.000
 and here, photo space 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.500
 using this scheme of photo montages 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.000
 like what's on the cover 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 monetize your album space better 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 because you can put more photos on each page 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.000
 Here, another label with space to write and / or photos 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.900
 that is, all tags work like this 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.000
 has space or for one thing or another or both 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.500
 then it is up to each one to decide how he or she wants to make the most of space 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 here is the same thing 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.980
 and here in a photo-mat with more useful space 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.840
 on here 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.840
 one more flap 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.500
 With this grinder I held some labels 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.000
 and here behind 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 more tags inside a pouch 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.120
 and a "photo-mat" 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.660
 here the flaps complement each other 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.000
 one says the beginning of the sentence, another says the end 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.460
 here, I left room for more photography 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.000
 and here's a rug to put a picture on top 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.800
 or to fit a photo here afterwards 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.220
 with or without carpet 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.000
 and one more "photo-mat" 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.000
 on this side another flap 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.000
 another tag inside a pocket 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.000
 and here is an acetate 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.000
 which later serves to decorate the photographs that are placed here below 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.580
 here, another little pocket 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 with another label 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 one smaller 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.560
 and a frame to paste later on the photographs 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.000
 this page is a more interactive page 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 what do you have here 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 space for photos inside 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.920
 and also a pocket with another label 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And how could it not be, a "photo-mat" 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.000
 and here the flap instead of opening to the side, opens up 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.640
 and a "photo mat" 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.320
 Finally, another pocket 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.540
 with more photo space 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.120
 another tag 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.380
 and another frame 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 And ready! this is Nini's Album 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 I also made a little box to save it. 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 within the same tones 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.000
 And here it is! I hope you have enjoyed this project 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Nini, I hope you like the album 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.620
 Thank you very much for watching the video and see you next time!
