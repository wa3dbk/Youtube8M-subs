design whereas when we go to the wind
tunnel<00:02:03.250> we<00:02:03.700> could<00:02:03.880> analyze<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.390> results<00:02:04.479> and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
tunnel we could analyze the results and

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.540 
tunnel we could analyze the results and
that<00:02:05.020> process<00:02:05.229> could<00:02:05.560> take<00:02:05.619> days<00:02:06.009> weeks<00:02:06.070> or

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
that process could take days weeks or

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.340 
that process could take days weeks or
months<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:10.390> events<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:10.959> we<00:02:11.020> have<00:02:11.140> on<00:02:11.260> the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
months with events that we have on the

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.180 
months with events that we have on the
TT<00:02:11.650> for<00:02:11.950> we<00:02:13.500> actually<00:02:14.500> doing<00:02:14.890> something

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
TT for we actually doing something

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.000 
TT for we actually doing something
different<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.790> what's<00:02:15.970> been<00:02:16.239> done<00:02:16.450> previously

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
different to what's been done previously

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.259 
different to what's been done previously
so<00:02:18.010> one<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.310> cool<00:02:18.519> technologies<00:02:19.150> they

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
so one of the cool technologies they

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.180 
so one of the cool technologies they
brought<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:19.630> here<00:02:19.780> there's<00:02:19.959> these<00:02:20.140> gills<00:02:20.530> that

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
brought in here there's these gills that

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.800 
brought in here there's these gills that
we've<00:02:21.310> built<00:02:21.430> into<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.790> side<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.450> airfoil

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
we've built into the side of the airfoil

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.110 
we've built into the side of the airfoil
shapes<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:23.980> actually<00:02:24.160> giving<00:02:24.700> active

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
shapes and it's actually giving active

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.350 
shapes and it's actually giving active
venting<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:27.430> dirty<00:02:27.640> air<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.060> used<00:02:28.239> for

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
venting the dirty air is used for

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.060 
venting the dirty air is used for
cooling<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:29.140> we<00:02:29.230> get<00:02:29.350> rid<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.620> dirty<00:02:29.920> air

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
cooling so we get rid of the dirty air

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.160 
cooling so we get rid of the dirty air
and<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.760> enables<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.330> high<00:02:31.420> quality<00:02:31.660> air<00:02:32.019> to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
and that enables the high quality air to

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.720 
and that enables the high quality air to
stay<00:02:32.350> attached<00:02:32.680> as<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.190> flows<00:02:33.400> around<00:02:33.550> the
