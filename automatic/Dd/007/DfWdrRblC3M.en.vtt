00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.770
 a new video today we are going to do 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.250
 steamed egg with rice milestone and all in 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.550
 one single pot to save time 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.950
 and energy then first we need 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.370
 a little berry 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.930
 and a bowl for the egg we put 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.240
 station cited within 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.850
 First 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:40.230
 the reason then and butter 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.230
 so that the egg does not stick 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.390
 yes 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.260
 then we need 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.410
 rice 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.900
 and to take the rice and not goal 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.900
 at below the rate 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.280
 that everything 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.640
 we fight like this 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.370
 then in a cup part with warm water 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:24.550
 Soak a shiitake mushroom or toco 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.550
 and it is normally well is dry 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.020
 and after soaking 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.780
 everything stays that way 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.470
 soft 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.909
 already 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.520
 so 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.570
 what I'm going to do is 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.770
 in fact the water for the same rice 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.770
 a gas attack 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.090
 the fact 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.090
 a little 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.190
 two 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.690
 they will associate goals where the game is going 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.979
 and for a prostrate 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.150
 and later 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.150
 we grab more 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.130
 the remaining water of the shiitake mushroom 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.510
 I'm going to put in a possible role and I'm going to 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.510
 measure how many are 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.720
 two eggs then two eggs are 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:39.930
 approximately 100 milliliters 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.560
 with almost half a cup of liquid 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.260
 then we will complete twice as much 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.879
 Water 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.520
 it's going to be half water half egg and he wants 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.090
 tell 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.310
 If I had 100 milliliters, I will have 200 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.190
 milliliters once you add the water 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.190
 then I add the water where woman 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.569
 more a little more if I missed 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.769
 Water 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.769
 a little salt 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.410
 Pepper 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.470
 and the other one was pepper 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.600
 and we beat it 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.239
 this is pretty much a mix style 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:39.890
 Japanese Chinese here in my house does not 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.750
 put new attacks that this depends on 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:47.139
 water of the visitors we can put 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:50.139
 a chicken broth or directly water 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.139
 so 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.980
 you put it in the bowl that was inside 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.370
 from the pot 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:13.200
 you put the shiitake mushroom on top 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:16.430
 there he will float and a few 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.430
 Chinese chives 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.299
 and that's all 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.640
 Now I like to flavor rice 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.250
 and then I eat it with a 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.760
 Chinese sausage that is like a cava no 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.810
 yes but pork and salty snacks next 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.050
 sweet not spicy 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.440
 So I put that in there, we're going to 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:44.180
 sit on the rigged rice 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.930
 so that for the parties and the methods 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.930
 we put 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.569
 there at medium-high until it boils and 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:05:00.520
 then we lower it down and once 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:03.039
 is ready we let you wait 10 minutes 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.889
 and the rice and the egg is going to cook at 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.889
 same time now I teach you 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.870
 well then now as you see it started 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.330
 to boil the water of the rice 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.360
 in theory we do not let it uncover but you 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.270
 I wanted to teach that there is already boiling 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.900
 then I will lower the fire 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.210
 down medium low 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.780
 there we continue cooking 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.300
 for I do not know if he's going to know but 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.270
 when the rice is already dry and you do not see 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.720
 water bubbling over is that it's already 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.670
 almost ready 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.270
 if there is still some water down 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:50.090
 but you can not see it there anymore, turn off the fire and 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:54.280
 you let finish cooking with the heat that 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.280
 is in 10 minutes 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.849
 ok once ready we put the rice in a 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.910
 bowl cited to eat 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.410
 we throw a little sealing 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.410
 on top of the egg 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:15.250
 and ready 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.250
 the table is served 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:22.590
 to enjoy 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.590
 if everything is well cooked
