00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.770
 and of course 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.100
 treated of chihuahua and welcome a 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.309
 more time to a banfield 4 video today 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.279
 let's play with the aika 971 one of my 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.720
 favorite weapons of the whole game one of 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.310
 the best assault rifles too 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.110
 for me to play the klaus 4 and for 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.250
 supposed to play with silencer and 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.480
 well here in truth this team does not 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.919
 I had silenced the truth I do not remember 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.169
 because he had taken it off but so 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.700
 Overall the achievement although I like it 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.410
 carry with this weapon is almost always with 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.140
 silencer and some kind of done gone or 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.370
 mika or something that allows me to have a 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.140
 A little more precision when you're in 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.670
 movement this is a weapon that one 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.640
 takes great advantage in situations of 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.960
 short distance and it really is not a 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.300
 weapon to play long distances 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.489
 because the reason why bullet speed is 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.780
 very high but good as ever they 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.609
 I'm doing right now lately 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.230
 reviews and my arms 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.629
 opinions then let's see what you say 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.789
 try camps here is up there 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.730
 and sanz to realize that the weapon has 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.190
 900 bullets per minute which is the second and 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.260
 fastest of all or highest 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.759
 capacity or higher fire rate of 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.870
 all the assault rifles the first is 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.460
 Fame 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.440
 it really is very compared to this 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.930
 also because of the ability it has to 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.130
 shoot from the hip and have some 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.540
 things that are quite common in 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.270
 weapons such as the damage model 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.850
 of 25 of 25 years that is falling down 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.680
 the 50 meters and then change 18 that's 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.440
 pretty normal four bullets five bullets 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.790
 to kill 31 enemies and bullets is 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.990
 magazine which is pretty good is 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.420
 very good to shoot from the hip 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.860
 as I said before it has the recovers of 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.480
 what is called the cone spread of 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.590
 dispersion of the bullets with each of 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.240
 the shots 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:47.120
 of 0.1 17 degrees for each bullet that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.680
 shoot that means when one 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.450
 is shooting, including pointing 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.060
 from the sight the bullets will come out 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.710
 to the point where you are pointing 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.240
 the first time and then you will lose 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.970
 as they are called to have a few 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.890
 Deviation degrees with each of the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.780
 bullets that come out is so tiny that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.820
 really do not feel much and for 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.920
 course for when it starts 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.300
 affect more will have come out so many 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.950
 bullets from your gun that probably the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.330
 most will have stuck and that's a 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.790
 of the great advantages that this 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.530
 arms the possibility of doing a lot 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.750
 damage very little time apart that the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.590
 Recharge of the magazine is quite fast 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.690
 They are 2.3 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.129
 when you still have bullets and it gets 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.920
 quite slow 3.6 when you've already 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.239
 shot the magazine's last bullet in 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.709
 overall this is a very good weapon that 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.150
 you are going to see a lot in the field 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.830
 of battle because all the people the 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.410
 recognizes for all his exploits that 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.970
 have to me it seems that the most 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.200
 fun to use them is almost like 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.480
 if it were a chaperone to be able to move 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.980
 fast on the map is not that kind of 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.569
 weapon that you are going to use as for 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.030
 defend a point and wait for it to arrive 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.530
 people because because of its high rate of 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.750
 fire happens similar when he had spoken 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.980
 a little bit of fame but not done 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.410
 a review itself but when the uv is 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.660
 naked that the bullet is running out very very 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.459
 quickly then when there are enemies 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.720
 in front probably with him with the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.970
 number of bullets that you have the magazine 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.459
 maybe I'll catch you killing one or two already 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.530
 the best if you are very very good has very 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.390
 good marksmanship you can kill inclusion 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.910
 third with the bad you have the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.920
 magazine the problem is where is 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.000
 where where the problems start is 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.500
 that that shot so fast that has going to 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.780
 be that you constantly stay without 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.480
 bullets then you have to try to 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.370
 use the map in your favor so that 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.150
 so that in order to take power 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.250
 best long things they should not 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.260
 do try to kill big enemies 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.540
 distances and with silencer is quite 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.099
 silly the bullet drop of the muffler 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.379
 also subtracts speed from the bullet 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.030
 then it is not no it does not help those 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:45.159
 enemies that are far and in addition 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.319
 moving and of course the great 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.879
 great fire rate added to the 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.980
 recoil that does not speak much 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.420
 recoil by recoil the most 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.069
 strong he has is a kick towards 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.750
 up then in a vertical kick 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.099
 which is not that it is difficult to control 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.200
 because as I told you before they are going to 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.970
 be shooting everyone hopefully that 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.549
 less than 50 meters then it is not so 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.109
 difficult to control but when either 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.790
 a little over 50 meters, you are going 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.370
 to start feeling that the weapon always 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.590
 try to go up in my opinion 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.849
 that sometimes helps because you manage to connect 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.430
 a lot of headsets that probably 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.810
 you would not have targeted by the way 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.100
 they heard there back there are screams to the 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.660
 left this is something that maybe 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.160
 many of you do not know but when 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.470
 there are enemies nearby and you have just 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.150
 kill one the other classmates the 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.919
 dolls in the crea and there he was for 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.000
 he calling all the other dolls 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.980
 around the sea 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.690
 those who are his companions begin to 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.330
 shout at you in Chinese or in Russian or in English 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.330
 or in the language that is as it is called 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.000
 some of his little things see there as he said 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.860
 if it's fire some of those things that he 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.120
 it's what it's called they're already 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.830
 predetermined in the game as 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.990
 recordings of the soldiers but when 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.770
 that happens, I'll tell you where 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.780
 look for the enemy 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.130
 so pay attention to next 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.810
 time they kill someone and listen 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.180
 around you and listen to some 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.280
 shout in Chinese or Russian or whatever 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.660
 or English because it probably is 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.460
 some of the classmates that you 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.870
 they get out of killing that hit a scream and that 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.610
 you can not control it also happens with 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.560
 you when someone dies around 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.390
 of you be sure that your 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.810
 little soldier is going to say some shout that 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.520
 let him say his position very little 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.410
 people know this percent so that's the 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.700
 look to you so that what 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.530
 know next time if I help them 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.810
 find your enemies and cell phones 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.850
 they ask how I knew how he knew there was 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.890
 someone around without you being 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.660
 moving and without it being marked in 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.260
 the map because you already know 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.470
 so going back to 971 my favorite weapon of 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.620
 flank with the assault class by the 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.810
 reason why coria recharge them 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.250
 I said before reloading the magazine is not 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.050
 as terrible as for example the 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.400
 fame and probably if fame 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.350
 was at the same amount of bullets 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.900
 that it had the same speed of 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.300
 recharge I think it would be the most 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.920
 popular from close encounters 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.020
 obviously there are weapons that you may know 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.500
 better as a couple of carbines if at 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:02.120
 better the Tamil CRC or whatever that is called 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:04.850
 rubber bullet has that engineer gun 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.670
 of defense of personal princess but the 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.120
 there is 971 here is definitely the most 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.980
 popular 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.290
 because as I told you before it is the most 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.730
 fast to use at the speed of 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.650
 bullet because as I told you before it is not 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.910
 that is the big thing is not bad either 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.860
 Well simply and simply this weapon does not 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.150
 is for me designed to shoot 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.890
 to people from afar then do not do it 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.690
 a recommendation of course if 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.700
 they want to use the hip gun is 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.740
 that they put some kind of tip 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.240
 laser sight laser like here was 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.920
 using I think that of three dots 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.050
 but it could be any of the 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.840
 little laser points that you help them 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.520
 and reduce that dispersion cone from the 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.580
 hip and make them alarmed a bit more 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.990
 effective hip that for me is a 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.430
 of the union saved from this weapon for 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.870
 achieve guys up here I have to the 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.490
 review if you liked the video you know 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.819
 a mistake is taste weave what 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.819
 they please , and until next time 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.819
 goodbye
