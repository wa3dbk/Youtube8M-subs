00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
opaque with mineral colors for example

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.429 
opaque with mineral colors for example
the<00:03:30.569> mineral<00:03:31.569> green<00:03:31.989> or<00:03:32.439> blue<00:03:33.009> color<00:03:33.370> on<00:03:34.439> is

the mineral green or blue color on is

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.469 
the mineral green or blue color on is
opaque<00:03:35.979> and<00:03:37.169> you<00:03:38.169> have<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.590> use<00:03:38.799> a<00:03:38.829> special<00:03:39.579> way

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:40.479 
opaque and you have to use a special way

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:44.520 
opaque and you have to use a special way
to<00:03:40.509> apply<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:41.650> in<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.549> case<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:43.150> green<00:03:44.139> color

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
to apply it in this case the green color

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.390 
to apply it in this case the green color
is<00:03:45.030> applied<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.479> the<00:03:46.659> back<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:48.509> rice<00:03:49.509> paper

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
is applied to the back of the rice paper

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.770 
is applied to the back of the rice paper
so<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.459> will<00:03:51.849> not<00:03:51.970> cover<00:03:52.419> the<00:03:52.840> ink<00:03:53.290> effect

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
so you will not cover the ink effect

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.189 
so you will not cover the ink effect
sometimes<00:03:55.780> we<00:03:56.409> use<00:03:56.859> the<00:03:57.069> opacity<00:03:57.340> of<00:03:57.849> a<00:03:58.199> middle

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199 
sometimes we use the opacity of a middle

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.619 
sometimes we use the opacity of a middle
color<00:03:59.439> like<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.680> green<00:04:00.159> or<00:04:00.430> blue<00:04:00.729> in<00:04:01.209> this<00:04:01.359> case

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
color like a green or blue in this case

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.860 
color like a green or blue in this case
to<00:04:02.319> cover<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:03.569> ink<00:04:04.569> on<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:05.409> dark<00:04:05.709> even<00:04:06.099> dark<00:04:06.340> ink

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
to cover the ink on a dark even dark ink

to cover the ink on a dark even dark ink
on<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.530> head<00:04:08.769> of<00:04:08.949> this<00:04:09.189> pig

on the head of this pig

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.810 
on the head of this pig
you<00:04:09.900> can<00:04:10.080> see<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.530> mineral<00:04:11.810> blue<00:04:13.820> which

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
you can see the mineral blue which

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.410 
you can see the mineral blue which
creates<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:15.600> last<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.680> feather<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.489> also

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
creates the last of the feather and also

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.560 
creates the last of the feather and also
on<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.660> crown<00:04:18.959> mineral<00:04:19.769> green<00:04:20.040> this<00:04:21.000> method

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
on the crown mineral green this method

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.810 
on the crown mineral green this method
we<00:04:21.750> call<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.260> as<00:04:23.060> embedding<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:25.530> use<00:04:25.820> the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
we call it as embedding you use the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.760 
we call it as embedding you use the
color<00:04:27.090> like<00:04:27.360> an<00:04:27.540> alignment<00:04:28.460> on<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.670> base<00:04:29.970> of

color like an alignment on the base of

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.590 
color like an alignment on the base of
ink<00:04:31.880> so<00:04:32.880> in<00:04:33.690> general<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.740> Chinese<00:04:35.240> color<00:04:36.240> is

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
ink so in general the Chinese color is

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.550 
ink so in general the Chinese color is
more<00:04:37.410> friendly<00:04:37.800> with<00:04:38.280> ink<00:04:39.950> you<00:04:40.950> can<00:04:42.020> apply<00:04:43.020> in
