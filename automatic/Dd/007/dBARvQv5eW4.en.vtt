cities have contacted us to basically

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.279 
cities have contacted us to basically
follow<00:01:19.770> suit<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:21.060> power<00:01:21.299> plant<00:01:21.420> for

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
follow suit this is the power plant for

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.770 
follow suit this is the power plant for
the<00:01:22.500> all-electric<00:01:22.799> bus<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.969> has<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> small

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the all-electric bus it has a small

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.859 
the all-electric bus it has a small
gasoline<00:01:25.350> driven<00:01:25.950> engine<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:27.479> has<00:01:27.659> all

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
gasoline driven engine and it has all

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.149 
gasoline driven engine and it has all
the<00:01:28.020> electronics<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.539> provide<00:01:30.619> 230<00:01:31.619> volts<00:01:31.979> AC

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the electronics to provide 230 volts AC

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.539 
the electronics to provide 230 volts AC
to<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.030> HVAC<00:01:33.600> unit<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.859> engine<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
to this HVAC unit like the engine the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
to this HVAC unit like the engine the
transmission<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:36.420> HVAC<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.109> major

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
transmission the HVAC is a major

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.999 
transmission the HVAC is a major
component<00:01:37.619> no<00:01:38.430> HVAC<00:01:38.969> no<00:01:39.600> bus<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.079> day<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.859> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
component no HVAC no bus that day so the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.190 
component no HVAC no bus that day so the
reliability<00:01:41.280> really<00:01:42.060> helps<00:01:42.359> keeps<00:01:42.600> buses<00:01:43.049> on

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
reliability really helps keeps buses on

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.469 
reliability really helps keeps buses on
the<00:01:43.229> street<00:01:43.909> well<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.939> think<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.359> big

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the street well I think so the big

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.419 
the street well I think so the big
benefits<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.350> would<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.130> fact<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
benefits with the would be the fact that

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.459 
benefits with the would be the fact that
it's<00:01:47.850> an<00:01:47.969> electric<00:01:48.420> drive<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.170> don't<00:01:49.289> have

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
it's an electric drive is we don't have

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.020 
it's an electric drive is we don't have
the<00:01:49.530> gear<00:01:49.710> shifting<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.789> don't<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the gear shifting going on we don't a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.550 
the gear shifting going on we don't a
big<00:01:51.179> noisy<00:01:51.570> diesel<00:01:51.869> engine<00:01:52.170> running<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.500> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
big noisy diesel engine running in the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.709 
big noisy diesel engine running in the
background<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:53.969> a<00:01:54.060> much<00:01:54.210> quieter

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
background so it's a much quieter

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.679 
background so it's a much quieter
smoother<00:01:55.079> ride<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.159> thermal<00:01:56.520> King<00:01:56.759> electric

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
smoother ride the thermal King electric

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.349 
smoother ride the thermal King electric

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
air conditioning systems have generated

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.380 
air conditioning systems have generated
about<00:02:00.450> an<00:02:00.719> 8%<00:02:01.409> reduction<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:02.280> overall<00:02:02.429> fuel

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
about an 8% reduction in overall fuel

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.480 
about an 8% reduction in overall fuel
consumption<00:02:04.049> which<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> very<00:02:04.799> significant

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490

the price of gasoline today we are

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.320 
the price of gasoline today we are
really<00:02:10.050> seeing<00:02:10.349> right<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:11.330> gathering

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
really seeing right now a gathering

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.710 
really seeing right now a gathering
storm<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:13.050> interest<00:02:13.530> around<00:02:14.150> electric<00:02:15.150> HVAC

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
storm of interest around electric HVAC

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.199 
storm of interest around electric HVAC
technology<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.159> point<00:02:17.459> where<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.730> think<00:02:17.849> in

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
technology to the point where I think in

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.030 
technology to the point where I think in
another<00:02:18.480> five<00:02:18.810> or<00:02:18.989> six<00:02:19.200> years<00:02:19.500> we<00:02:19.590> believe

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
another five or six years we believe

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.800 
another five or six years we believe
it'll<00:02:20.280> become<00:02:20.400> almost<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.150> standard<00:02:21.629> within

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
it'll become almost a standard within

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.899 
it'll become almost a standard within
the<00:02:21.989> transit<00:02:22.379> industry<00:02:22.700> everybody<00:02:23.700> in

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
the transit industry everybody in

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.460 
the transit industry everybody in
gardenia<00:02:24.209> should<00:02:24.510> feel<00:02:24.720> proud<00:02:25.019> of<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.290> I

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
gardenia should feel proud of that I

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.500 
gardenia should feel proud of that I
think<00:02:25.769> they've<00:02:25.920> gone<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.340> long<00:02:26.580> way<00:02:26.909> to<00:02:26.970> help

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
think they've gone a long way to help

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.930 
think they've gone a long way to help
convince<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:28.230> very<00:02:28.470> conservative<00:02:28.980> industry

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940

that<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.569> worth<00:02:30.810> changing<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.530> there<00:02:31.620> are

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
that it is worth changing and there are

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.199 
that it is worth changing and there are
better<00:02:31.920> technologies<00:02:32.610> out<00:02:32.790> there<00:02:32.819> for<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
better technologies out there for the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.869 
better technologies out there for the
