three answers the third answer the wood
gas<00:00:25.509> composition<00:00:25.930> will<00:00:26.529> be<00:00:26.560> in<00:00:26.739> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
knew Baxter the dog and the first

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.180 
knew Baxter the dog and the first
question<00:00:34.210> was<00:00:34.420> what<00:00:34.780> is<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.320> most<00:00:35.530> overlooked

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
question was what is the most overlooked

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.849 
question was what is the most overlooked
prep<00:00:36.579> and<00:00:36.940> again<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:37.630> said<00:00:37.780> I'm<00:00:38.140> picking<00:00:38.530> it<00:00:38.649> and

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
prep and again I said I'm picking it and

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.639 
prep and again I said I'm picking it and
I<00:00:39.039> believe<00:00:39.280> it's<00:00:39.430> in<00:00:39.519> my<00:00:39.910> opinion<00:00:40.510> of<00:00:40.899> ways<00:00:41.230> to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
they haven't even thought of ways to

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.710 
they haven't even thought of ways to
heat<00:01:26.990> water<00:01:27.230> and<00:01:27.740> it<00:01:28.610> can<00:01:28.760> be<00:01:28.880> as<00:01:28.970> primitive<00:01:29.570> as

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
heat water and it can be as primitive as

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.920 
heat water and it can be as primitive as
a<00:01:29.750> black<00:01:30.110> bag<00:01:30.440> out<00:01:30.710> in<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.010> Sun<00:01:31.280> or<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:32.450> solar

thermal<00:01:33.050> water<00:01:33.800> heating<00:01:34.250> I'm<00:01:34.550> just<00:01:34.760> putting

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
thermal water heating I'm just putting

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.090 
thermal water heating I'm just putting
it<00:01:35.150> at<00:01:35.330> my<00:01:35.480> geyser<00:01:35.720> right<00:01:36.110> now<00:01:36.260> this<00:01:36.470> geyser<00:01:36.770> is

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
it at my geyser right now this geyser is

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.520 
it at my geyser right now this geyser is
making<00:01:37.430> hot<00:01:37.610> water<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.870> it's<00:01:39.020> heating<00:01:39.350> this

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
making hot water and it's heating this

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.100 
making hot water and it's heating this
tank<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.280> it<00:01:40.729> just<00:01:41.090> shut<00:01:41.270> off<00:01:41.300> cuz<00:01:41.720> I<00:01:41.810> set<00:01:41.990> the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
tank and it just shut off cuz I set the

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.020 
tank and it just shut off cuz I set the
thermostat<00:01:42.440> to<00:01:42.650> hopefully<00:01:43.130> turn<00:01:43.610> off<00:01:43.760> during

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
thermostat to hopefully turn off during

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.570 
thermostat to hopefully turn off during
this<00:01:44.240> video<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:45.410> it<00:01:45.590> was<00:01:45.710> supposed<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.370> do<00:01:46.550> that

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
this video so it was supposed to do that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.820 
this video so it was supposed to do that
when<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.300> temperature<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.900> tank<00:01:48.170> came<00:01:48.410> up<00:01:48.590> to

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
when the temperature the tank came up to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.460 
when the temperature the tank came up to
the<00:01:48.950> right<00:01:49.130> probe<00:01:50.090> temperature<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:51.110> guys<00:01:51.290> who

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
the right probe temperature the guys who

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.590 
the right probe temperature the guys who
would<00:01:51.620> shut<00:01:51.860> off<00:01:51.890> this<00:01:52.490> is<00:01:52.640> just<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.880> cool<00:01:53.090> gizmo

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
would shut off this is just a cool gizmo

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.990 
would shut off this is just a cool gizmo
that<00:01:54.320> gives<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.710> side<00:01:54.979> benefit<00:01:55.520> of<00:01:55.550> air

sophisticated<00:02:46.550> way<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:47.090> making<00:02:48.019> hot<00:02:48.320> water

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
sophisticated way of making hot water

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.600 
sophisticated way of making hot water
off-grid<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.310> using<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.940> Nile<00:02:50.180> geyser<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:51.610> so

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
off-grid is using the Nile geyser and so

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.120 
off-grid is using the Nile geyser and so
there's<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.970> lot<00:02:53.300> of<00:02:53.420> ways<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.720> do<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:54.050> but

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
there's a lot of ways to do this but

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.320 
there's a lot of ways to do this but
hopefully<00:02:55.130> you'd<00:02:55.250> have<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.459> solution<00:02:55.880> in<00:02:56.209> place

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
hopefully you'd have a solution in place

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.720 
hopefully you'd have a solution in place
or<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.440> can<00:02:57.590> make<00:02:57.709> enough<00:02:57.950> hot<00:02:58.160> water<00:02:58.190> take

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
or you can make enough hot water take

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.940 
or you can make enough hot water take
care<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.000> your<00:02:59.120> family<00:02:59.540> or<00:02:59.720> take<00:03:00.110> care<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.709> a
