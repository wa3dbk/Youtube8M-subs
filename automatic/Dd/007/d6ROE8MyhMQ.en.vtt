00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.610
 and goes more 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.460
 the lion king 'was produced at the same 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.779
 time that few people for the successes 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.880
 previous with the tales of princesses 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.199
 Disney had higher expectations for 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.449
 few together and this one had the greatest 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.699
 budget at the end the lion king 'got 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.680
 600 million dollars more than 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.790
 pocahontas and it's generally better 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.790
 remembered that she too 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.100
 the story the movie is based very 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.110
 slightly in the work of william 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.699
 shakespeare hamlet producers 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.070
 decided to continue this topic in the 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.059
 sequel since the lion king '2 is inspired 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.739
 by romeo and julieta 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.930
 this was not followed with the third 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.190
 movie that is expected more in months 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.190
 cruise saints exterior 3000 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.390
 the beginning of the movie was supposed 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.100
 I was going to have a lot more dialogue explaining 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.320
 what happens in the scene but the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.910
 producers were so impressed 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.920
 for the opening song composed by 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.540
 hans zimmer that they changed it so that 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.080
 there was only the song that you 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.080
 they are hearing 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.170
 reports say that the song be 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.970
 ready already where the character sings 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.250
 while the army of full 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.740
 prepares was inspired by video 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.960
 documented of adolf hitler speaking 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.470
 while his soldiers marched out 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.470
 your own conclusions 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.140
 to completely animate the scene in 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.450
 where the animals stampede 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.420
 which results in the death of mufasa 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.790
 spoiler 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.040
 It took approximately three years for 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.070
 animating said scene lasts two minutes and 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.070
 medium 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.600
 grave is the first disney character 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.730
 that farts in front of the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.470
 camera 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.680
 We give very vital information in this 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.680
 channel 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.530
 originally the movie was going to 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.000
 head the king of the jungle like some 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.980
 months refers to the lions in English 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.630
 but the producers changed it because 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.960
 really the lions do not live in the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.960
 jungle 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.180
 generally in the packs of lions 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.700
 there is an alpha male and several females like 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.260
 it can be seen as false and the leonesas 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.609
 this means that very false is the father 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.670
 most of the Leonese and Leonese 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:41.250
 that are born in the place like the wings 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.030
 Wait a moment if nothing is the daughter of 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.110
 an easy 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.110
 and she does 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.890
