00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
complete hockey stick for the experience

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.670 
complete hockey stick for the experience
walk<00:00:21.420> us<00:00:21.570> through<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.560> way<00:00:22.650> it

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
walk us through this so the way it

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.410 
walk us through this so the way it
started<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:23.939> felt<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.210> if<00:00:24.330> you're

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
started is we we felt that if you're

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.420 
started is we we felt that if you're
going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> be<00:00:24.689> playing<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.019> motion<00:00:25.920> based<00:00:26.070> game

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
going to be playing a motion based game

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.189 
going to be playing a motion based game
it<00:00:26.670> should<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.000> real<00:00:27.269> accurate<00:00:27.689> motions

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
it should have real accurate motions

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.259 
it should have real accurate motions
like<00:00:28.619> even<00:00:28.859> play<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.039> real<00:00:29.189> life<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.179> we

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
like even play in real life so what we

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.790 
like even play in real life so what we
did<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.599> actually<00:00:30.960> took<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> composite

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
did is we actually took a composite

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.110 
did is we actually took a composite
hockey<00:00:31.980> stick<00:00:32.369> which<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.850> about<00:00:32.969> three

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
hockey stick which is about three

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.670 
hockey stick which is about three
hundred<00:00:33.149> dollars<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.079> tried<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> saw<00:00:34.559> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
hundred dollars and we tried to saw it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.799 
hundred dollars and we tried to saw it
to<00:00:34.800> pieces<00:00:34.980> which<00:00:35.309> didn't<00:00:35.550> end<00:00:35.670> well<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.690> we

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
to pieces which didn't end well but we

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.200 
to pieces which didn't end well but we
duct-taped<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.829> wii<00:00:38.100> remote<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.760> nunchuck

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
duct-taped a wii remote and a nunchuck

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.880 
duct-taped a wii remote and a nunchuck
to<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:40.140> kind<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.410> came<00:00:40.559> up<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.800> this

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
to it and we kind of came up with this

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.590 
to it and we kind of came up with this
frankenstein-looking<00:00:41.850> hockey<00:00:42.300> stick<00:00:42.480> we

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
frankenstein-looking hockey stick we

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.940 
frankenstein-looking hockey stick we
said<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.989> really<00:00:43.230> how<00:00:43.440> how<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:43.860> should

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
said this is really how how we should

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.250 
said this is really how how we should
make<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.309> game<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.809> start<00:00:45.989> demoing

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
make this game and we we start demoing

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.540 
make this game and we we start demoing
some<00:00:46.440> software<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:46.950> said<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.160> week<00:00:47.399> we're

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
some software and said this week we're

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.479 
some software and said this week we're
onto<00:00:47.700> something<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.300> get<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.489> nine

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
onto something here we get it so nine

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.860 
onto something here we get it so nine
different<00:00:50.820> iterations<00:00:51.239> later<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> hockey

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
different iterations later on the hockey

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.630 
different iterations later on the hockey
stick<00:00:52.199> we've<00:00:52.410> got<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> final<00:00:53.250> model

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
stick we've got what is the final model

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.049 
stick we've got what is the final model
here<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:55.100> it<00:00:56.100> comes<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> box<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
here and it comes in the box with the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.490 
here and it comes in the box with the
game<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.510> then<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.780> got<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> phone<00:00:58.199> blade

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
game and then it's got a phone blade

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.930 
game and then it's got a phone blade
here<00:00:58.800> because<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.550> know<00:00:59.640> you're<00:00:59.820> playing

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
here because if you know you're playing

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.189 
here because if you know you're playing
a<00:01:00.090> game<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.270> swing<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.660> sticker<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.079> want

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
a game you swing a sticker on you want

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.650 
a game you swing a sticker on you want
to<00:01:01.260> make<00:01:01.350> sure<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.559> good<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.680> save<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
to make sure it's good and save and it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.359 
to make sure it's good and save and it
basically<00:01:03.809> utilizes<00:01:04.559> motion<00:01:04.860> control<00:01:05.159> for

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
basically utilizes motion control for

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.700 
basically utilizes motion control for
both<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:06.150> these<00:01:06.360> devices<00:01:06.630> here<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.680> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
both of these devices here so if you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.130 
both of these devices here so if you
have<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.890> wii<00:01:08.280> remote<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.299> nunchuck<00:01:09.659> they

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
have a wii remote and a nunchuck they

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.649 
have a wii remote and a nunchuck they
both<00:01:10.380> actually<00:01:10.890> send<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.549> signal<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.479> wheat

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
both actually send a signal to the wheat

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.510 
both actually send a signal to the wheat
so<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.229> very<00:01:13.380> accurate<00:01:13.680> because<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.280> wii

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
so it's very accurate because as the wii

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.859 
so it's very accurate because as the wii
remotes<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.150> way<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> nunchucks

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
remotes going this way and the nunchucks

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
remotes going this way and the nunchucks
going<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.320> way<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.950> very<00:01:17.220> accurate<00:01:17.430> you

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
going that way it's very accurate you

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.100 
going that way it's very accurate you
can<00:01:17.759> figure<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:17.970> what<00:01:18.090> you're<00:01:18.210> doing<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
can figure out what you're doing and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.990 
can figure out what you're doing and
it's<00:01:19.650> largely<00:01:20.040> motion-based<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.729> almost<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it's largely motion-based to almost the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.940 
it's largely motion-based to almost the
entire<00:01:21.270> game<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.600> motion-based<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.590> control

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
entire game as motion-based you control

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.499 
entire game as motion-based you control
your<00:01:23.130> player<00:01:23.340> by<00:01:23.520> moving<00:01:23.729> around<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> control

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
your player by moving around the control

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.510 
your player by moving around the control
stick<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.409> when<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.560> want<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.740> pass<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
stick and then when you want to pass you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.830 
stick and then when you want to pass you
hit<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.729> button<00:01:26.939> there<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.659> everything

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
hit that button there but everything
