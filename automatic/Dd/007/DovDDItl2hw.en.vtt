00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.820
 to youtube friends welcome to me 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.740
 new channel th killer in this first 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.379
 video we will test this iphone 6 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.410
 plus as you can see it works without any 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.380
 problem 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.330
 as new perfect conditions like what 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.850
 can see and well what we are going to 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.920
 do in this at this stage are going to be 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.240
 two tests the first is that we're going to 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.270
 put in this video container 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.340
 submerged in water for one minute and 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.070
 later we will put it to 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.070
 freeze it up with nothing more to say 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.070
 let's start 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.260
 nothing 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.920
 as you can see the iphone is still 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.860
 On, the screen has not been turned off 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.820
 you can see some small bubbles 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.690
 this means that the water is 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.690
 entering the device 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.790
 that is about to finish the stage 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.920
 let's see what happened 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.640
 as you can see it has a little water 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.640
 but 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.270
 it's still working 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.810
 and after drying the iphone as can 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.340
 As you can see everything is still working 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.140
 the touch and it continues to work without any 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.100
 problem 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.330
 then we will continue 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.600
 to put it in the freezer 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.680
 good friends already for the last test 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.860
 let's proceed to the iphone the water 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.070
 and wait in the freezer 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.650
 and I will return with you good as 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.650
 can see is partially frozen 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.459
 of about an hour and a half 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.310
 the freezer then let's do the 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:29.170
 test at the end to know if it's still 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.170
 working I'm going to dial me 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.620
 hab 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.940
 as you can see 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.800
 well 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.600
 still so then later on you can 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.320
 be another video to tell them what is it 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.300
