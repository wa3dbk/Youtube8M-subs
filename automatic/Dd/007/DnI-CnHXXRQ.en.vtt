five<00:01:30.550> stars<00:01:31.000> fiving<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.660> most<00:01:31.900> saudi<00:01:32.350> arabia

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
five stars fiving the most saudi arabia

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.330 
five stars fiving the most saudi arabia
but<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:34.000> think<00:01:34.840> for<00:01:35.020> what<00:01:35.260> it's<00:01:35.409> built<00:01:35.590> for<00:01:35.710> it's

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
but I think for what it's built for it's

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.899 
but I think for what it's built for it's
a<00:01:36.430> five<00:01:36.640> there's<00:01:37.180> no<00:01:37.330> doubt

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
a five there's no doubt

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.969 
a five there's no doubt
it's<00:01:38.420> built<00:01:38.719> to<00:01:38.840> be<00:01:38.960> fast<00:01:39.259> as<00:01:39.499> he<00:01:39.590> built<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.799> be

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
it's built to be fast as he built to be

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.980 
it's built to be fast as he built to be
light<00:01:40.189> still<00:01:40.909> give<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:41.119> some<00:01:41.329> comfort<00:01:41.569> it<00:01:41.960> is

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
light still give you some comfort it is

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.349 
light still give you some comfort it is
a<00:01:42.140> full-blown<00:01:42.619> race<00:01:42.920> bike<00:01:43.189> it<00:01:44.149> was<00:01:44.299> very

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
a full-blown race bike it was very

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.149 
a full-blown race bike it was very
comfortable<00:01:44.990> for<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.259> full<00:01:45.499> born<00:01:45.710> race<00:01:45.920> bike

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
comfortable for a full born race bike

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.830 
comfortable for a full born race bike
and<00:01:46.310> my<00:01:46.369> concern<00:01:46.729> was<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:46.969> comfort<00:01:47.479> versus

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
and my concern was the comfort versus

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.020 
and my concern was the comfort versus
performance<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:49.009> it<00:01:49.130> was<00:01:49.250> good<00:01:49.460> on<00:01:49.579> both<00:01:49.729> ends

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
performance and it was good on both ends

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.539 
performance and it was good on both ends
so<00:01:50.149> I'll<00:01:50.329> say<00:01:50.539> five<00:01:50.780> out<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.020> five<00:01:51.200> five<00:01:52.189> very

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
so I'll say five out of five five very

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.459 
so I'll say five out of five five very
