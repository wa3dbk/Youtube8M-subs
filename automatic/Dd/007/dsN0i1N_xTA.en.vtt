00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
entertainer let's start off with the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.549 
entertainer let's start off with the
most<00:00:53.789> important<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.270> right<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
most important one right here in the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.279 
most important one right here in the
corner<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> microphone<00:00:57.239> section<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:58.260> have

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
corner is the microphone section we have

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.970 
corner is the microphone section we have
a<00:00:58.440> discrete<00:00:59.090> amp<00:01:00.230> circuit<00:01:01.230> here<00:01:01.469> that

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
a discrete amp circuit here that

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.429 
a discrete amp circuit here that
supports<00:01:02.399> two<00:01:02.930> independent<00:01:03.930> microphones

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
supports two independent microphones

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.210 
supports two independent microphones
each<00:01:05.100> mike<00:01:05.430> has<00:01:05.700> echo<00:01:05.970> talk<00:01:06.689> over<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
each mike has echo talk over and on the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.670 
each mike has echo talk over and on the
front<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:08.780> it<00:01:09.780> has<00:01:09.960> its<00:01:10.140> own<00:01:10.350> independent

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
front here it has its own independent

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.630 
front here it has its own independent
high<00:01:11.250> low<00:01:11.520> EQ<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.240> with<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> echo<00:01:13.770> ratio<00:01:14.400> knob

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
high low EQ and with a echo ratio knob

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.910 
high low EQ and with a echo ratio knob
so<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.150> want<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> add<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> little<00:01:15.600> echo<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
so if you want to add a little echo to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.170 
so if you want to add a little echo to
your<00:01:17.070> announcement<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.030> as

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
your announcement you can do that as

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.469 
your announcement you can do that as
well<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.720> addition<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.710> mic<00:01:20.210> we<00:01:21.210> also<00:01:21.360> have

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
well in addition to the mic we also have

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.719 
well in addition to the mic we also have
a<00:01:21.659> signal<00:01:22.140> peak<00:01:22.409> meter<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.280> that's<00:01:23.640> very

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
a signal peak meter here that's very

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.830 
a signal peak meter here that's very
important<00:01:24.590> on<00:01:25.670> controllers<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.390> never<00:01:27.659> been

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
important on controllers it's never been

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.810 
important on controllers it's never been
done<00:01:27.900> before<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:29.220> put<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.700> there

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
done before and we put that in there

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.520 
done before and we put that in there
specifically<00:01:30.329> because<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.290> how

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
specifically because we know how

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.370 
specifically because we know how
important<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:33.420> don't<00:01:33.810> distort

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
important it is that you don't distort

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.770 
important it is that you don't distort
while<00:01:34.650> making<00:01:35.329> announcements<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.710> sort

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
while making announcements of sort

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.160 
while making announcements of sort
so<00:01:39.409> let's<00:01:39.740> move<00:01:39.920> over<00:01:40.070> to<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:41.299> center<00:01:41.960> here

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
so let's move over to the center here

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.560 
so let's move over to the center here
the<00:01:43.159> center<00:01:43.490> point<00:01:43.670> this<00:01:44.060> is<00:01:44.240> unique<00:01:44.540> to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
the center point this is unique to

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.530 
the center point this is unique to
that's<00:01:44.900> never<00:01:45.320> been<00:01:45.530> done<00:01:45.590> before<00:01:46.540> unlike

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
that's never been done before unlike

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.430 
that's never been done before unlike
most<00:01:47.720> controllers<00:01:48.290> that<00:01:48.320> have<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:51.200> past

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
most controllers that have the the past

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.200 
most controllers that have the the past
the<00:01:51.650> four<00:01:51.830> by<00:01:51.950> four<00:01:52.159> pads<00:01:52.460> with<00:01:52.909> all<00:01:53.090> the

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
the four by four pads with all the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.660 
the four by four pads with all the
functions<00:01:53.630> on<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.990> we<00:01:54.619> actually<00:01:54.830> separated

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
functions on it we actually separated

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.090 
functions on it we actually separated
the<00:01:55.790> sampler<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:56.420> its<00:01:56.570> own<00:01:56.720> section<00:01:56.990> here<00:01:57.440> why

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
the sampler in its own section here why

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.380 
the sampler in its own section here why
did<00:01:58.310> we<00:01:58.399> do<00:01:58.520> that<00:01:58.550> because<00:01:59.540> we<00:01:59.750> know<00:02:00.020> that

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
did we do that because we know that

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.789 
did we do that because we know that
basically<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.570> have<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.750> trigger<00:02:03.259> songs

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
basically you have to trigger songs

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.830 
basically you have to trigger songs
during<00:02:04.130> announcements<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:05.420> instead<00:02:05.780> of

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
during announcements so instead of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.020 
during announcements so instead of
having<00:02:05.960> them<00:02:06.259> buried<00:02:06.619> here<00:02:06.860> on<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.130> pad<00:02:07.340> we

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
having them buried here on the pad we

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.760 
having them buried here on the pad we
put<00:02:08.239> them<00:02:08.360> here<00:02:08.539> directly<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:09.350> can<00:02:09.500> fire

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
put them here directly so you can fire

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.240 
put them here directly so you can fire
them<00:02:09.979> off<00:02:10.160> as<00:02:10.459> as<00:02:11.060> you're<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.440> know<00:02:12.530> changing

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
them off as as you're you know changing

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.310 
them off as as you're you know changing
songs<00:02:13.580> here<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.540> has<00:02:14.750> its<00:02:15.050> own

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
songs here and it has its own

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
unbalanced is a feat for your video guys

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.290 
unbalanced is a feat for your video guys
so<00:04:10.830> we<00:04:10.950> thought<00:04:11.100> of<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.280> too<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.880> video<00:04:12.090> guy

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
so we thought of that too the video guy

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.140 
so we thought of that too the video guy
needs<00:04:12.570> direct<00:04:13.350> sound<00:04:13.620> in<00:04:14.400> addition<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.970> that
