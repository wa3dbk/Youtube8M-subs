00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
time and you can only do this once

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.080 
time and you can only do this once
you're<00:02:11.950> past<00:02:12.040> level<00:02:12.400> 10<00:02:12.580> if<00:02:12.730> they<00:02:12.820> died

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
you're past level 10 if they died

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.210 
you're past level 10 if they died
anytime<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:14.410> cannot<00:02:14.710> resurrect<00:02:14.890> them

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
anytime you cannot resurrect them

they're dead so it's just like in real
fantasy<00:02:17.950> life<00:02:18.340> kind<00:02:18.820> of<00:02:18.880> which<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.590> ridiculous

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
fantasy life kind of which is ridiculous

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.190 
fantasy life kind of which is ridiculous
to<00:02:21.100> actually<00:02:21.580> try<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:21.940> do<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.480> but<00:02:22.780> it's<00:02:22.960> so

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
to actually try to do that but it's so

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.870 
to actually try to do that but it's so
much<00:02:23.470> fun<00:02:23.800> it's<00:02:24.100> one<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.370> those<00:02:24.460> things<00:02:24.700> that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
much fun it's one of those things that

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.220 
much fun it's one of those things that
you<00:02:24.970> would<00:02:25.120> do<00:02:25.240> after<00:02:25.540> you've<00:02:25.840> played<00:02:26.080> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
you would do after you've played the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.440 
you would do after you've played the
game<00:02:26.260> for<00:02:26.770> numerous<00:02:27.190> times<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.790> mean<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.330> whole

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
point of this game is to actually go

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.500 
point of this game is to actually go
through<00:02:30.190> each<00:02:30.280> character<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.090> get<00:02:31.240> all<00:02:31.360> of

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
that he was only at 900 what the Xbox

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.580 
that he was only at 900 what the Xbox
900<00:02:58.270> yeah<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:58.690> is<00:02:58.840> that's<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.110> nice<00:02:59.230> number

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
900 yeah this is that's a nice number

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.160 
900 yeah this is that's a nice number
but<00:02:59.830> it<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.070> 1080<00:03:00.340> on<00:03:00.580> Bowl<00:03:00.790> systems<00:03:01.270> what<00:03:02.140> I

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
but it is 1080 on Bowl systems what I

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.650 
but it is 1080 on Bowl systems what I
noticed<00:03:02.620> about<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.580> there's<00:03:04.090> very

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
noticed about this is that there's very

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.110 
noticed about this is that there's very
very<00:03:05.080> very<00:03:05.410> minimal<00:03:05.920> slowdown<00:03:06.519> and<00:03:06.820> I<00:03:06.910> mean

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
very very minimal slowdown and I mean

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.360 
very very minimal slowdown and I mean
like<00:03:07.360> when<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.690> have<00:03:07.930> crazy<00:03:08.650> effects<00:03:09.160> going

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
like when you have crazy effects going

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.610 
like when you have crazy effects going
on<00:03:09.580> particle<00:03:10.060> effects<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.989> all<00:03:11.290> sorts<00:03:11.560> of

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
on particle effects and all sorts of

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.290 
on particle effects and all sorts of
like<00:03:11.830> 3d<00:03:12.190> animations<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.730> are<00:03:12.820> kind<00:03:13.269> of

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
like 3d animations that are kind of

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.420 
like 3d animations that are kind of
jumping<00:03:13.630> up<00:03:13.870> at<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.170> screen<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.769> characters

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
jumping up at the screen and characters

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.120 
jumping up at the screen and characters
exploding<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.480> never<00:03:17.170> really<00:03:17.590> slowed<00:03:17.920> down

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
exploding it never really slowed down

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.979 
exploding it never really slowed down
and<00:03:18.489> loading<00:03:18.910> time<00:03:19.060> there<00:03:19.239> isn't<00:03:19.600> any<00:03:19.750> it's

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
and loading time there isn't any it's

time<00:03:25.390> there<00:03:25.540> was<00:03:25.660> never<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.989> moment<00:03:26.080> where<00:03:26.290> I

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
time there was never a moment where I

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.170 
time there was never a moment where I
was<00:03:26.350> just<00:03:26.590> going<00:03:26.800> okay<00:03:27.130> let's<00:03:27.700> get<00:03:27.820> into<00:03:28.030> this

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
was just going okay let's get into this

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.330 
was just going okay let's get into this
the<00:03:29.170> other<00:03:29.320> thing<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.739> have<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:30.010> bring<00:03:30.160> up

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
the other thing that I have to bring up

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.070 
the other thing that I have to bring up
would<00:03:30.519> be<00:03:30.550> the<00:03:30.760> menu<00:03:31.030> system<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.570> you'd<00:03:31.780> think

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
would be the menu system and you'd think

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.199 
would be the menu system and you'd think
with<00:03:32.290> an<00:03:32.440> RPG<00:03:32.830> like<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.430> would<00:03:33.580> be<00:03:33.700> very<00:03:33.910> hard

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
with an RPG like this would be very hard

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.050 
with an RPG like this would be very hard
to<00:03:34.360> sort<00:03:35.050> of<00:03:35.080> to<00:03:35.230> port<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.680> over<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.190> console

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
to sort of to port it over to a console

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.020 
to sort of to port it over to a console
but<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:38.230> runs<00:03:38.590> really<00:03:39.130> well<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.760> works

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
but it runs really well it works

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.720 
but it runs really well it works
perfectly<00:03:40.660> with<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.530> spin<00:03:41.860> wheel<00:03:42.070> sort<00:03:42.640> of

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
perfectly with the spin wheel sort of

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.150 
perfectly with the spin wheel sort of
architect<00:03:43.390> you<00:03:43.959> go<00:03:44.200> around<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.680> spin<00:03:44.950> wheel

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
architect you go around the spin wheel

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.880 
architect you go around the spin wheel
and<00:03:45.400> equip<00:03:45.760> different<00:03:46.260> parts<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.350> your<00:03:47.470> you

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
and equip different parts to your you

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
negative about that would be that when

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.180 
negative about that would be that when

little big planet where it is
that<00:04:06.950> part<00:04:07.130> of<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.250> screen<00:04:07.490> that<00:04:07.760> was<00:04:08.120> really

the only thing I thought was kind of
weird<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:11.060> other<00:04:11.090> thing<00:04:11.510> would<00:04:11.690> be<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.900> when

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
weird the other thing would be the when

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.380 
weird the other thing would be the when
you<00:04:12.740> go<00:04:12.890> into<00:04:13.250> sort<00:04:13.610> of<00:04:13.700> dungeons<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.210> have<00:04:14.300> to
