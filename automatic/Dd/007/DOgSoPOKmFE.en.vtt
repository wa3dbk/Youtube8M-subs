transitioned<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.200> 38<00:01:16.770> millimeters<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.729> 40

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
transitioned from 38 millimeters to 40

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.350 
transitioned from 38 millimeters to 40
millimeters<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.490> 43<00:01:20.490> millimeters<00:01:21.180> in

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
millimeters and then 43 millimeters in

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.359 
millimeters and then 43 millimeters in
their<00:01:21.840> pro<00:01:22.049> diver<00:01:22.259> collection<00:01:22.560> over<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> past

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
17 or 18 years and in my opinion I think

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.490 
17 or 18 years and in my opinion I think
the<00:01:26.850> 43<00:01:27.450> millimeter<00:01:27.900> was<00:01:28.049> probably<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the 43 millimeter was probably the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.100 
the 43 millimeter was probably the
perfect<00:01:28.770> size<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.790> got<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> nice<00:01:30.329> big<00:01:30.750> look
