blue spheres forever and I originally

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.370 
blue spheres forever and I originally
thought<00:00:22.730> that<00:00:22.970> this<00:00:23.180> might<00:00:23.570> have<00:00:23.810> some<00:00:24.140> kind

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
thought that this might have some kind

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.410 
thought that this might have some kind
of<00:00:24.410> continuation<00:00:25.130> to<00:00:25.160> it<00:00:25.490> but<00:00:25.789> no<00:00:26.030> this<00:00:26.360> is

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
of continuation to it but no this is

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.300 
of continuation to it but no this is

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
the Sonic 3 special stages and that is

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.850 
the Sonic 3 special stages and that is
that<00:01:03.890> it<00:01:04.189> seems<00:01:04.610> that<00:01:04.990> Sonic's<00:01:05.990> movements<00:01:06.649> can

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
that it seems that Sonic's movements can

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.580 
that it seems that Sonic's movements can
be<00:01:07.009> a<00:01:07.039> little<00:01:07.250> bit<00:01:07.490> jagged<00:01:08.000> sometimes<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:09.530> I

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
be a little bit jagged sometimes and I

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.500 
be a little bit jagged sometimes and I
know<00:01:09.649> that's<00:01:10.009> probably<00:01:10.399> a<00:01:11.000> weird<00:01:11.270> thing<00:01:11.450> to

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
know that's probably a weird thing to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.450 
know that's probably a weird thing to
say<00:01:11.659> when<00:01:12.080> you<00:01:12.229> consider<00:01:12.590> what<00:01:12.830> he's<00:01:12.920> doing<00:01:13.340> in

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
say when you consider what he's doing in

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.850 
say when you consider what he's doing in
the<00:01:13.610> special<00:01:13.940> stages<00:01:14.450> not<00:01:15.020> really<00:01:15.350> any<00:01:15.500> smooth

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
the special stages not really any smooth

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.340 
the special stages not really any smooth
movements<00:01:16.430> but<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:17.180> feels<00:01:17.510> I<00:01:17.869> don't<00:01:17.930> know<00:01:18.290> it

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
movements but it feels I don't know it

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.219 
movements but it feels I don't know it
feels<00:01:18.650> a<00:01:18.890> bit<00:01:18.920> stiffer<00:01:19.640> than<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.450> original

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
feels a bit stiffer than the original

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.350 
feels a bit stiffer than the original
titles<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.189> it's<00:01:22.340> really<00:01:22.700> hard<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.000> explain

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
titles and it's really hard to explain

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.330 
titles and it's really hard to explain
unless<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.900> play<00:01:24.200> it<00:01:24.260> yourself<00:01:24.439> and<00:01:24.979> there's

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
unless you play it yourself and there's

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.770 
unless you play it yourself and there's
also<00:01:25.460> another<00:01:25.820> problem<00:01:26.000> with<00:01:26.420> some<00:01:26.600> of<00:01:26.630> the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
also another problem with some of the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.469 
also another problem with some of the
collision<00:01:27.170> after<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.560> jump<00:01:28.330> when<00:01:29.330> you're

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
collision after a jump when you're

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.450 
collision after a jump when you're
jumping<00:01:29.930> in<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.350> game<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.860> doesn't<00:01:31.100> register

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
jumping in the game it doesn't register

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.370 
jumping in the game it doesn't register
quite<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.180> same<00:01:32.450> okay

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
quite the same okay

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.109 
quite the same okay
that's<00:01:33.770> entirely<00:01:34.100> my<00:01:34.250> fault<00:01:34.400> wasn't<00:01:34.850> paying

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
that's entirely my fault wasn't paying

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.620 
that's entirely my fault wasn't paying
attention<00:01:35.530> but<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.680> doesn't<00:01:36.979> quite<00:01:37.130> register

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
attention but it doesn't quite register

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.420 
attention but it doesn't quite register
certain<00:01:38.740> ways<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.460> original<00:01:40.939> did<00:01:41.180> and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
certain ways that the original did and

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.969 
certain ways that the original did and
it<00:01:43.430> feels<00:01:43.759> like<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:45.140> doesn't<00:01:45.439> always<00:01:45.590> register

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
it feels like it doesn't always register

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.460 
it feels like it doesn't always register
unless<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:46.939> jump<00:01:47.180> in<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.390> very<00:01:47.600> specific<00:01:47.900> way<00:01:48.229> I

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
unless you jump in a very specific way I

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.730 
unless you jump in a very specific way I
have<00:01:49.009> an<00:01:49.369> example<00:01:49.939> of<00:01:50.030> this<00:01:50.210> on<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:51.200> second

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
have an example of this on the second

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.640 
have an example of this on the second
stage<00:01:52.100> actually<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:52.960> fast-forward<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.259> that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
stage actually so fast-forward to that

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.109 
stage actually so fast-forward to that
so<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.250> second<00:01:55.640> stage<00:01:56.000> is<00:01:57.400> not<00:01:58.400> one<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.909> was

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
so the second stage is not one that was

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.090 
so the second stage is not one that was
actually<00:01:59.299> copied<00:02:00.259> I<00:02:00.439> believe<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:00.920> don't

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
actually copied I believe I don't

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.039 
actually copied I believe I don't
believe<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.460> was<00:02:01.579> because<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.180> first<00:02:02.210> one<00:02:02.689> was

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
believe it was because the first one was

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.999 
believe it was because the first one was
a<00:02:03.079> copy<00:02:03.590> of<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.610> very<00:02:04.909> original

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
a copy of the very original

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.940 
a copy of the very original
I'm<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.190> doing<00:02:08.399> great<00:02:08.610> today<00:02:08.819> am<00:02:09.060> i<00:02:09.830> but<00:02:10.830> yeah

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
I'm not doing great today am i but yeah

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.740 
I'm not doing great today am i but yeah
all<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> other<00:02:11.340> stages<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:11.970> far<00:02:12.209> seem<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.599> be

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
all the other stages so far seem to be

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.509 
all the other stages so far seem to be
completely<00:02:13.140> original<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.860> first<00:02:14.099> ones<00:02:14.340> just

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
completely original the first ones just

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.100 
completely original the first ones just
the<00:02:14.610> same<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:15.090> kind<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.390> get<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.629> used<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.959> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
the same to kind of get you used to the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.350 
the same to kind of get you used to the
engine<00:02:16.440> but<00:02:17.099> unfortunately<00:02:17.849> this<00:02:18.060> engine

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
engine but unfortunately this engine

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.420 
engine but unfortunately this engine
doesn't<00:02:18.780> really<00:02:19.110> apply<00:02:19.709> itself<00:02:20.129> well

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
doesn't really apply itself well

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.699 
doesn't really apply itself well
especially<00:02:20.819> when<00:02:21.209> going<00:02:21.480> fast<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.379> a<00:02:22.410> jump

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
especially when going fast to a jump

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.699 
especially when going fast to a jump
like<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.250> now<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.360> did<00:02:24.690> okay<00:02:25.170> because<00:02:25.440> I've

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
like that now I did okay because I've

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.380 
like that now I did okay because I've
learnt<00:02:25.950> how<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.129> manipulate<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.790> engine<00:02:27.180> I

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
learnt how to manipulate this engine I

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.710 
learnt how to manipulate this engine I
basically<00:02:28.260> have<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.799> jump<00:02:29.580> just<00:02:30.239> as<00:02:30.569> I'm

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
basically have to jump just as I'm

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.900 
basically have to jump just as I'm
turning<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.620> actually<00:02:32.040> get<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.519> work

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
turning to actually get it to work

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.930 
turning to actually get it to work
correctly<00:02:33.209> otherwise<00:02:34.049> if<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:34.950> were<00:02:35.099> to<00:02:35.310> turn

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
correctly otherwise if you were to turn

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.300 
correctly otherwise if you were to turn
then<00:02:36.450> jump<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> same<00:02:37.170> way<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.379> would<00:02:37.709> in<00:02:37.920> say

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
then jump the same way you would in say

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.850 
then jump the same way you would in say
the<00:02:38.489> original<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:39.390> will<00:02:39.540> actually<00:02:39.989> jump<00:02:40.319> over

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
the original you will actually jump over

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.729 
the original you will actually jump over
the<00:02:41.430> very<00:02:41.879> first<00:02:42.000> or<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.780> next<00:02:43.019> sequence<00:02:43.440> and

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
the very first or the next sequence and

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.470 
the very first or the next sequence and
would<00:02:43.920> miss<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.730> would<00:02:44.879> screw<00:02:45.269> up

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
would miss it and that would screw up

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.110 
would miss it and that would screw up
entirely<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.349> wish<00:02:47.010> there<00:02:47.250> was<00:02:47.340> some<00:02:47.610> better

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
entirely I wish there was some better

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.360 
entirely I wish there was some better
way<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.440> recognizing<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.680> jump<00:02:50.129> as

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
way of recognizing that jump as

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.809 
way of recognizing that jump as
collecting<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.510> orb<00:02:52.310> because<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.610> to

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
collecting that orb because you have to

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.509 
collecting that orb because you have to
be<00:02:54.000> really<00:02:54.840> precise<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.560> do<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.950> jump<00:02:56.280> and

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
be really precise to do that jump and

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.210 
be really precise to do that jump and
I've<00:02:56.700> had<00:02:56.910> some<00:02:57.120> practice<00:02:57.329> now<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.140> even<00:02:59.069> then

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
I've had some practice now so even then

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.670 
I've had some practice now so even then
I'm<00:02:59.340> still<00:02:59.670> messing<00:02:59.879> up<00:03:00.180> as<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.660> can<00:03:00.810> see<00:03:00.870> now

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
I'm still messing up as you can see now

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.140 
I'm still messing up as you can see now
I<00:03:01.709> do<00:03:01.859> say<00:03:02.129> I<00:03:02.160> think<00:03:02.459> there<00:03:02.579> was<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.730> way<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:02.879> jump

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
I do say I think there was a way to jump

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.880 
I do say I think there was a way to jump
over<00:03:03.390> two<00:03:03.569> orbs<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.170> original<00:03:04.560> if<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.799> are

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
over two orbs in the original if you are

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.580 
over two orbs in the original if you are
going<00:03:05.099> fast<00:03:05.340> enough<00:03:05.609> but<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:06.480> am<00:03:06.660> literally

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
going fast enough but I am literally

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.680 
going fast enough but I am literally
turning<00:03:08.220> around<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.910> doing<00:03:09.269> that<00:03:09.450> one

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
turning around and doing that one

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.839 
turning around and doing that one
section<00:03:10.019> right<00:03:10.410> away<00:03:11.099> from<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.579> very

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
section right away from the very

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.339 
section right away from the very
beginning<00:03:12.299> so<00:03:12.450> I've<00:03:12.599> barely<00:03:12.900> gained<00:03:13.200> any

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
beginning so I've barely gained any

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.339 
beginning so I've barely gained any
speed<00:03:13.680> if<00:03:13.829> any<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.599> this<00:03:15.599> is<00:03:15.720> like<00:03:15.900> my<00:03:15.930> main

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
speed if any and this is like my main

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.580 
speed if any and this is like my main
gripe<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.859> got<00:03:17.069> to<00:03:17.220> stage<00:03:17.489> two<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.590> had

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
gripe I got to stage two of this and had

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.750 
gripe I got to stage two of this and had
this<00:03:19.739> issue<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.250> now<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.430> know<00:03:20.549> how<00:03:20.700> to

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
this issue but now I know how to

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.500 
this issue but now I know how to
overcome<00:03:21.180> it

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
overcome it

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.360 
overcome it
I<00:03:21.540> am<00:03:21.989> really<00:03:22.680> looking<00:03:22.769> forward<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.220> trying

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
I am really looking forward to trying

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.069 
I am really looking forward to trying
out<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.760> other<00:03:23.910> stages<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.540> honestly<00:03:24.930> this

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
out the other stages and honestly this

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.990 
out the other stages and honestly this
is<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> really<00:03:25.650> good<00:03:25.859> little<00:03:26.160> game<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.549> do<00:03:26.609> like

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
is a really good little game I do like

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.819 
is a really good little game I do like
it<00:03:27.209> it's<00:03:27.299> a<00:03:27.480> nice<00:03:27.660> take<00:03:28.019> on<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.349> Sonic<00:03:28.650> 3

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
it it's a nice take on the Sonic 3

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.220 
it it's a nice take on the Sonic 3
special<00:03:29.220> stages<00:03:29.639> it's<00:03:30.359> got<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.510> nice<00:03:30.690> remix

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
special stages it's got a nice remix

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.710 
special stages it's got a nice remix
probably<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.519> faint<00:03:32.760> list<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.150> things<00:03:33.389> to<00:03:33.569> do

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
probably the faint list of things to do

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.599 
probably the faint list of things to do
maybe<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.560> try<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:34.889> tighten<00:03:35.160> up<00:03:35.370> that

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
maybe is to try and tighten up that

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.870 
maybe is to try and tighten up that
collision<00:03:36.480> if<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:37.139> and<00:03:38.040> then<00:03:38.280> give<00:03:38.700> the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
collision if you can and then give the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.400 
collision if you can and then give the
other<00:03:39.030> stages<00:03:39.359> a<00:03:39.569> bit<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.870> flavor<00:03:40.109> with

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
other stages a bit of flavor with

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.170 
other stages a bit of flavor with
different<00:03:40.739> even<00:03:40.950> different<00:03:41.430> color<00:03:41.669> flaws

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
different even different color flaws

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.449 
different even different color flaws
because<00:03:42.510> they're<00:03:42.720> all<00:03:42.840> green<00:03:43.230> maybe<00:03:43.980> make<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
because they're all green maybe make the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.099 
because they're all green maybe make the
orbs<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.940> little<00:03:45.180> bit<00:03:45.299> nicer<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.780> look<00:03:45.810> at

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
orbs a little bit nicer to look at
