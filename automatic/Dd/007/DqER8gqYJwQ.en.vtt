00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
to my players because that's what I

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.889 
to my players because that's what I

not<00:01:58.990> just<00:01:59.229> about<00:01:59.439> 2k<00:01:59.860> but<00:02:00.310> also<00:02:00.490> about<00:02:00.850> live

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
not just about 2k but also about live

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.139 
not just about 2k but also about live

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
with 2k / realm they said that there

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.160

would<00:02:04.240> be<00:02:04.270> no<00:02:04.570> height<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:04.990> weight

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
would be no height and weight

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.289 
would be no height and weight

restrictions and at first I was kind of

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.880 
restrictions and at first I was kind of
nervous<00:02:07.509> about<00:02:07.720> that<00:02:08.019> because<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.500> was<00:02:08.619> like<00:02:08.739> yo

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
nervous about that because I was like yo

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.670 
nervous about that because I was like yo
like<00:02:09.399> we<00:02:09.610> can't<00:02:09.850> have<00:02:10.060> five<00:02:10.440> seven-foot<00:02:11.440> small

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
forest again but at the same time 2k can

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.590 
forest again but at the same time 2k can
be<00:02:14.470> very<00:02:14.769> confident<00:02:15.370> about<00:02:15.850> their<00:02:16.150> attribute

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600
