field you're really excelling and
pushing<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.189> boundaries<00:00:28.130> most<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.369> work

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
pushing the boundaries most of the work

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.910 
pushing the boundaries most of the work
we<00:00:29.670> saw<00:00:29.880> had<00:00:30.420> taken<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.349> really<00:00:31.679> interesting

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
we saw had taken a really interesting

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.590 
we saw had taken a really interesting
approach<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> brief<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.090> they<00:00:33.210> not<00:00:33.540> only

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
approach to the brief so they not only

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.200 
approach to the brief so they not only
met<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> brief<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:34.530> they'd<00:00:34.800> gone<00:00:35.730> beyond<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
met the brief but they'd gone beyond the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.080 
met the brief but they'd gone beyond the
obvious<00:00:36.329> they've<00:00:36.780> gone<00:00:36.960> beyond<00:00:37.290> sort<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
obvious they've gone beyond sort of the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.740 
obvious they've gone beyond sort of the
cliched<00:00:39.090> initial<00:00:39.480> responses<00:00:41.329> it<00:00:42.329> was<00:00:42.510> layer

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
cliched initial responses it was layer

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.540 
cliched initial responses it was layer
upon<00:00:42.989> layer<00:00:43.050> took<00:00:43.710> because<00:00:43.860> his<00:00:44.219> shoulders

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
above everything else it was there it

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.990 
above everything else it was there it
was<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:47.070> human<00:00:47.640> sweet<00:00:48.300> idea<00:00:50.000> yeah

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
was just a really human sweet idea yeah

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.549 
was just a really human sweet idea yeah
it<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.300> quite<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> few<00:00:51.690> pieces<00:00:51.899> i<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
it was quite a few pieces i think that

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.100 
it was quite a few pieces i think that
warranted<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.489> lot<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.090> quite<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> lot<00:00:54.960> of

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
warranted a lot to be it quite a lot of

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.600 
warranted a lot to be it quite a lot of
owned<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.590> know<00:00:55.710> did<00:00:55.920> actually<00:00:56.160> fit<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
owned you know did actually fit the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.330 
owned you know did actually fit the
belief<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.170> affect<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> criteria<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.280> what

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
belief that affect the criteria of what

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.649 
belief that affect the criteria of what
it<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.699> being<00:00:59.910> asked<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.420> took<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> boxes

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.020 

this<00:01:06.659> was<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> really<00:01:07.080> clear<00:01:07.560> winner<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
this was a really clear winner in the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.690 
this was a really clear winner in the
category<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.780> us<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.619> craft<00:01:11.010> brief

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
category for us this was a craft brief

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.640 
category for us this was a craft brief
but<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.000> thought<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.240> actual<00:01:12.869> concept<00:01:13.320> over

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
but we thought that actual concept over

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.670 
but we thought that actual concept over
to<00:01:14.220> take<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.360> setting<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> films<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
to take and the setting of the films and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.039 
to take and the setting of the films and
bring<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> typography<00:01:18.090> into<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> setting<00:01:18.960> of

the<00:01:19.080> phone<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.830> quite<00:01:20.009> clever<00:01:20.280> I

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the phone was really quite clever I

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.560 
the phone was really quite clever I
thought<00:01:20.790> what<00:01:20.939> kind<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.150> students<00:01:21.509> are

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
thought what kind of students are

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.280 
thought what kind of students are
producing<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.200> standard<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.070> my<00:01:23.189> work

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.290 

as<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> nice<00:01:28.560> way<00:01:28.800> of<00:01:28.830> bridging<00:01:29.300> the

intangibility of facebook and yield
theory<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.330> 500<00:01:33.840> friends<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.260> you<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.530> in

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
theory or 500 friends that you have in

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
something you really hold and read and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.010 
something you really hold and read and
then<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.730> fact<00:01:38.940> that<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.180> fitted<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.780> well

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
then the fact that it fitted so well

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.590 
then the fact that it fitted so well
with<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> cooking

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
vice my heart hard for and that was so

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.330 
vice my heart hard for and that was so
simple<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.570> it'll<00:01:49.780> sound<00:01:49.990> like<00:01:50.229> but<00:01:51.039> it<00:01:51.159> did

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
simple and it'll sound like but it did

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.429 
simple and it'll sound like but it did
represent<00:01:52.000> me<00:01:52.149> within<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.479> five<00:01:52.869> foot<00:01:53.200> four

I<00:01:59.049> think<00:02:00.049> social<00:02:00.770> responsibility<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.030> and

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
I think social responsibility and and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.039 
I think social responsibility and and
the<00:02:03.439> responsibility<00:02:04.429> of<00:02:04.460> our<00:02:05.179> planet<00:02:05.630> seems

the responsibility of our planet seems

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.619 
the responsibility of our planet seems
to<00:02:06.259> be<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:06.649> rightfully<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:07.789> recurring

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
to be and rightfully so a recurring

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.490 
to be and rightfully so a recurring
theme

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500 

one<00:02:12.310> thing<00:02:12.490> they<00:02:12.580> didn't<00:02:12.820> make<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:12.970> which<00:02:13.330> I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
one thing they didn't make it which I

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.630 
one thing they didn't make it which I
wish<00:02:13.690> had<00:02:13.900> was<00:02:14.380> endangered<00:02:15.010> self<00:02:15.220> which<00:02:15.490> was

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
wish had was endangered self which was

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.620 
wish had was endangered self which was
an<00:02:15.760> idea<00:02:16.030> for<00:02:17.010> WWF<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.490> thought<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:19.360> was<00:02:19.480> an

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
an idea for WWF and I thought it was an

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.870 
an idea for WWF and I thought it was an
idea<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.930> could<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.980> should<00:02:21.520> happen

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
idea that could and should happen

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.580 
idea that could and should happen
tomorrow<00:02:22.060> like<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.750> was<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:23.260> was<00:02:23.410> ready<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.770> go

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
tomorrow like it was it was ready to go
