00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.070
 hello people my name is alia bunin 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.020
 looked at pixels or maybe 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.879
 correct to say last chance of adam 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.320
 sandler because lately with 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.570
 his participation that there was a lot 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.730
 go unsuccessful paintings have potential 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.920
 the movie was of course mad but shot 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.480
 whether he in general will tell you everything now 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.279
 pixels then fantastic action 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.080
 comedy whose plot seems to 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.960
 stolen from patrick jean author 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.970
 the 2010 short film project promised 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.800
 be very interesting so how to play on 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.140
 ups cult well audience and lovers 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.999
 8-bit games you always understand 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.040
 fine everyone would be glad to see 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.530
 some exciting symbiosis of 80s games 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.270
 cool plot action filled 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.190
 modern computer effects and 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.290
 pixel graphics did the same 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.420
 only partly which is rather strange because 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.030
 directed the picture is not anyhow who and Chris 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.710
 Columbus who has been writing for 25 years 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.270
 the script is being directed and 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.130
 producing some of the most successful 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.750
 pictures that the whole world knows 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.370
 one of the key merits of Columbus 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.440
 is the launch of one of the most successful 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.600
 franchises in cinema history 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.550
 Harry Potter saga Chris directed 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.080
 and the producer of the first three films about young 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.999
 the wizard and contrary to all 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.649
 caution to your movie friends 

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:08.630
 Columbus invited on the main role 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.240
 no one unknown then novices 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.060
 Daniel Radcliffe him watson rupert ogre 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.570
 on which now thanks to him have become 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.640
 superstars all three films 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.590
 delivered by map atari in aggregate 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.719
 collected in the world hire more than two 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.670
 half billion dollars as well 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.380
 it was Columbus who introduced the whole world to 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.319
 talented boy makalea kalkina 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.640
 removing the comedy alone at home I'm alone at home 2 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.889
 without which now the new year is not 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.719
 costs besides these pictures chris style 

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:34.789
 such wonderful films as stepmother 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.369
 Mrs. Daoutfire her bicentennial man 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.679
 with robin williams produced nights in 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.749
 servant museum in general you understand chris 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.490
 very talented cinematographer himself 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.840
 Columbus says he took up the pixels 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.249
 because he was attracted fresh 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.200
 concept of what could 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:50.090
 experiment with humor try 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.130
 create something like comedic 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.990
 eighties operatives and plus work 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.380
 to a wide audience for all ages 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.999
 plot in 1982 hoping to establish 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.560
 contact with extraterrestrial life 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:02.749
 Nasa launched a temporary capsule 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.909
 containing image frames of the earth 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:06.799
 life and culture but stumbled it is not and 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.840
 aliens perceive the message as 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.000
 declaration of war and attack the earth 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.630
 using models from the 80s arcade games 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.490
 years including snake pakmen 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.320
 and Donkey Kong and of course on earth 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.510
 team of gamers is going to her 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.310
 save know guys after watching were 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.410
 pretty mixed feelings because on 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.940
 My opinion is humor in the picture is very good 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.130
 Sandler for me personally right 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.440
 rehabilitated humor was unusual for 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.480
 an account of an absurd plot that allowed 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.400
 to be born many fresh interesting 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.440
 jokes in non-standard humor of course 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.060
 a huge plus of this picture but at the same time 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.340
 while watching you will understand 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.830
 what is happening on the screen is complete nonsense 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.200
 and this is a combination of good humor and and 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.360
 absurdity of what is happening gives rise to you 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.220
 in my head cognitive dissonance is in 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.230
 I personally sat in such feelings 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.940
 part of the film for me the picture seemed 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.130
 good until it appeared 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.140
 patman and then just cognitive 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.690
 dissonance intensify and in the end in general 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.000
 even humor did not save an atypical denouement 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.350
 just killed all the impressions it seems to me 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.150
 that the main problem is that 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.220
 writers did not have enough creativity on 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.170
 the second half of the film and the ending plus y 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.480
 Columbus himself could not play 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.220
 for all ages from the audience he is clearly not 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.990
 I got to the film just 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.390
 fits more for Americans because 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.880
 Donkey Kong gaming machines 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.740
 or pakman were their names and we 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.360
 the bulk knows only pak-man 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.770
 so among our Russian-speaking 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.570
 audience I think that only people 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.090
 somewhere between twenty and thirty 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.860
 may somehow imbued with nostalgia 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.510
 here's the rest just fucking off 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.520
 Seen at all very strange that not 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.680
 games such as tetris were chosen for 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.940
 destruction of the city though in short 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.010
 he is not maria 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.200
 because they are much closer to the world 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.660
 general plot I did not like a joke 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.459
 This yes for humor of course thanks in the picture 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.500
 besides humor i liked moral 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.660
 Sandlerâ€™s plotline component 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.670
 his friend is president the screenwriters are good 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.600
 showed by the example of sandler that man 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.280
 maybe at some point in life 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.260
 stop its development 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.150
 because of a small goal for 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.770
 about action and computer graphics on 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.660
 I have no action 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.670
 exciting speakers are not here but in 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.230
 In principle, she did not need to go there only 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.970
 one good point in which pakmen 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.680
 bites the wheelbarrow to the scene 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.660
 looked spectacular car really 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.910
 sawed in half but computer 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.140
 the graphics in the picture are very much for 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.910
 visual effects specialists 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.010
 the main problem was to make 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.930
 characters of 8-bit games are not too 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.940
 angular and pixel and just 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.500
 make them visually pleasing to 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.220
 they had an idea to solve this question 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.050
 shine characters from 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.790
 ruffle these pixels and smooth it out 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.080
 angles know in fact the name 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.730
 pixels do not match 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.680
 reality because three-dimensional 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.630
 a pixel is really called a voxel 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.790
 In principle, if you do not pay attention to 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.280
 nonsense you must pay tribute to some 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.050
 the scenes were really hard to implement 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.940
 and filmmakers are not embarrassed 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.130
 for example, very difficult to implement 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.780
 there was a fight with donkey kongom supervisor 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.700
 on visual effects specifically for 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.040
 this studied in the smallest detail of his 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.990
 movement and trajectory to maximize 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.940
 believable repeat rhythm speed 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.310
 movements to carry it out were 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.260
 erected structures against the background of a hrokomeka 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.150
 precision repetitive scenery games 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.700
 the largest was over 20 meters 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.340
 height and donkey kong was in the form 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.530
 huge x sign in the corner of the site to 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.000
 I had to shoot a sandler scene with friends 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.060
 constantly run and jump on platforms 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.980
 through imaginary falling barrels a chris 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.050
 Columbus gave him direction and 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.760
 right time shouted jump and they 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.070
 jumped in the general shooting they had 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.169
 funny that's for sure about acting 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.540
 Games are not and talk there five friends 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.880
 all the sidekick sandler he's just with all 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.100
 them in everyday life hanging out damn yes them 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.930
 generally do not care how to play though 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.910
 as they want they just have fun for 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.010
 the joke is their job 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.810
 Actually, many of them play well to me 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.640
 For example, I liked how Josh played 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.010
 reptile especially in the scene where he was yelling at 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.200
 military it was of course very cool i 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.390
 laughed almost to tears but more 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.700
 all of them are all amused by the sandler himself 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.650
 really man what's up with your face 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.960
 feeling that his perry was pricked by botox and 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.760
 face completely lost facial expressions he from 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.190
 the movie the movie walks with the same 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.260
 grimace seriously adam so mirror 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.510
 generally come up to train earlier 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.040
 sender somehow entered the image even in 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.570
 the same clicks with remote for life 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.490
 there is a cool scene in which he 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.810
 dying and his acting in it was 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.550
 just amazing 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.710
 and the last few films are 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.390
 feeling that preparing sandler for new 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.130
 role is that he goes to 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.830
 his room from corner to corner and talk 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.110
 I am a sucker I play a movie from a movie 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.360
 loser in every picture I'm gloomy 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.820
 the same face my pictures have collected 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.240
 more than three billion dollars and I am 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.370
 wrong and I'm a sucker and then bang I opened up and 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.650
 becoming a successful cool guy and 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.930
 I have a girlfriend and fame and 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.090
 cream recognition is all that love so much 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.600
 viewers who identify him with 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.310
 by myself 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.500
 i don't know guys i like adam 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.700
 sandler he has a sense of humor before 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.040
 like at least because he 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.940
 brilliant businessman and when they say that 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.830
 he's done for 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.290
 then it is very strange why does he enter 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.300
 the ten most highly paid 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.780
 actors of the world on a par with dicaprios and tom 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.610
 cruise 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.530

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.660
 with his participation were not very funny 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.010
 and some are not funny at all for example 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.200

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.940
 or mixed but with humor this 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.620

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.900

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.110
