well on anyway for this little demo I
put<00:02:23.110> down<00:02:24.690> some<00:02:25.690> stuff<00:02:26.050> here<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.380> have<00:02:27.330> actually

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330

put down some stuff here I have actually
um<00:02:28.770> carpet<00:02:29.770> deodorizer<00:02:30.310> which<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.760> really

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
um carpet deodorizer which is really

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.150 
um carpet deodorizer which is really
fine<00:02:31.980> fine<00:02:32.980> it's<00:02:33.990> fine<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:37.450> have<00:02:37.690> some

fine fine it's fine and I have some

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.010 
fine fine it's fine and I have some
Dorito<00:02:39.160> chips<00:02:39.459> down<00:02:39.640> there<00:02:39.880> yeah<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.810> lot<00:02:40.990> of

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
Dorito chips down there yeah a lot of

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.370 
Dorito chips down there yeah a lot of
vet<00:02:41.290> vacuum<00:02:42.070> demos<00:02:42.490> that<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.700> see<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:44.140> see<00:02:44.350> a

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
vet vacuum demos that I see you see a

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.990 
vet vacuum demos that I see you see a
lot<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.620> like<00:02:44.890> cereal<00:02:45.870> stuff<00:02:46.870> like<00:02:47.020> that's

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
lot of like cereal stuff like that's

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.430 
lot of like cereal stuff like that's
like<00:02:49.000> big<00:02:49.300> stuff<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.810> lot<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.200> people

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
like big stuff that a lot of people

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.920 
like big stuff that a lot of people
vacuum<00:02:50.860> which<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.130> fine<00:02:51.459> but<00:02:52.330> what<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.510> consider

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
vacuum which is fine but what I consider

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.020 
vacuum which is fine but what I consider
a<00:02:53.260> good<00:02:53.650> performance<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.220> vacuum<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.760> if

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
a good performance in the vacuum is if

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.870 
a good performance in the vacuum is if
it<00:02:55.390> picks<00:02:55.630> up<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.500> fine<00:02:56.860> fine<00:02:57.190> particles<00:02:58.230> so

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
it picks up the fine fine particles so

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.460 
it picks up the fine fine particles so
let's<00:03:00.880> get<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.270> it<00:03:01.300> shall<00:03:01.420> we<00:03:04.320> start<00:03:05.320> the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
let's get to it shall we start the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.699 
let's get to it shall we start the
vacuum<00:03:05.860> here<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:07.230> there's<00:03:08.230> an<00:03:08.350> on/off<00:03:08.680> switch

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
vacuum here and there's an on/off switch

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.910 
vacuum here and there's an on/off switch
right<00:03:09.010> here<00:03:09.370> which<00:03:09.550> is<00:03:09.580> red<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:11.590> lower<00:03:11.739> the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
right here which is red and to lower the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.290 
right here which is red and to lower the
vacuum<00:03:12.280> it's<00:03:12.400> right<00:03:12.580> down<00:03:12.760> here

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
vacuum it's right down here

00:03:13.300 --> 00:04:25.660 
vacuum it's right down here
so<00:03:14.130> let's<00:03:15.130> see<00:03:15.250> what<00:03:15.370> happens

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.290 

okay<00:04:26.670> so<00:04:26.730> as<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:27.240> can<00:04:27.330> see<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:28.620> got<00:04:29.580> everything

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
okay so as you can see it got everything

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.630 
okay so as you can see it got everything
the<00:04:31.110> dark<00:04:31.350> spots<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:31.740> see<00:04:31.770> my<00:04:32.100> carpet<00:04:32.520> or

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
the dark spots you see my carpet or

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.690 
the dark spots you see my carpet or
actually<00:04:33.000> uh<00:04:33.030> scenes<00:04:33.720> in<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:33.960> carpet<00:04:34.700> the

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
actually uh scenes in the carpet the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.880 
actually uh scenes in the carpet the
carpet<00:04:36.090> is<00:04:36.210> actually<00:04:36.870> kind<00:04:37.290> of<00:04:37.410> old<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.770> was

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
carpet is actually kind of old it was

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.220 
carpet is actually kind of old it was
here<00:04:38.130> before<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.910> moved<00:04:39.540> in<00:04:39.690> it's<00:04:39.810> just<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:40.020> big

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
right here you can there's a release

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.840 
right here you can there's a release
lever<00:04:56.730> you<00:04:57.420> just<00:04:57.600> push<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:57.990> down<00:04:58.140> like<00:04:58.170> this

lever you just push it down like this

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.060 
lever you just push it down like this
comes<00:04:59.850> out<00:04:59.970> like<00:05:00.150> that<00:05:02.570> and<00:05:03.680> it<00:05:04.680> got

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
everything I have to say the first time

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.150 
everything I have to say the first time
I<00:05:17.130> use<00:05:17.460> this<00:05:17.670> vacuum<00:05:18.350> what<00:05:19.350> happened<00:05:19.800> was<00:05:19.950> I

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
I use this vacuum what happened was I

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.970 
I use this vacuum what happened was I
actually<00:05:20.310> got<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.610> vacuum<00:05:21.150> from<00:05:21.710> Walmart<00:05:22.710> again

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
actually got a vacuum from Walmart again

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.690 
actually got a vacuum from Walmart again
and<00:05:23.850> I<00:05:24.390> went<00:05:24.570> against<00:05:25.490> basically<00:05:26.490> what<00:05:26.580> my

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
and I went against basically what my

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.970 
and I went against basically what my
family<00:05:27.090> is<00:05:27.150> about<00:05:27.300> four<00:05:27.630> years<00:05:27.810> and<00:05:28.170> I<00:05:28.770> went

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
family is about four years and I went

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.540 
family is about four years and I went
for<00:05:29.220> price<00:05:29.990> so<00:05:30.990> I<00:05:31.560> got<00:05:32.250> a<00:05:33.050> pistol<00:05:34.050> turbo<00:05:35.040> helix

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
for price so I got a pistol turbo helix

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.360 
for price so I got a pistol turbo helix
bagless<00:05:36.060> vacuum<00:05:36.540> and<00:05:37.470> I<00:05:38.010> thought<00:05:38.190> it<00:05:38.280> was

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
bagless vacuum and I thought it was

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.470 
bagless vacuum and I thought it was
doing<00:05:38.700> okay<00:05:39.980> so<00:05:40.980> it<00:05:41.520> but<00:05:41.790> I<00:05:41.820> just<00:05:42.060> didn't<00:05:42.330> like

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
doing okay so it but I just didn't like

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.290 
doing okay so it but I just didn't like
the<00:05:42.510> way<00:05:42.690> it<00:05:43.500> was<00:05:43.560> so<00:05:43.860> heavy<00:05:44.220> it<00:05:44.370> was<00:05:44.700> just<00:05:45.210> so

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
the way it was so heavy it was just so

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.740 
the way it was so heavy it was just so
hard<00:05:45.480> to<00:05:45.570> push<00:05:46.190> so<00:05:47.190> basically<00:05:47.700> what<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:48.030> did<00:05:48.690> was

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
hard to push so basically what I did was

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.680 
hard to push so basically what I did was
I<00:05:48.960> gave<00:05:49.020> a<00:05:49.110> one<00:05:49.380> final<00:05:49.770> vacuum<00:05:50.250> and<00:05:50.580> I<00:05:51.210> returned

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
I gave a one final vacuum and I returned

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.780 
I gave a one final vacuum and I returned
it<00:05:51.960> and<00:05:53.240> I<00:05:54.240> got<00:05:54.510> this<00:05:54.690> vacuum<00:05:54.960> and<00:05:55.440> I<00:05:56.160> set<00:05:56.520> it<00:05:56.640> up

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
it and I got this vacuum and I set it up

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.620 
it and I got this vacuum and I set it up
and<00:05:57.240> I<00:05:58.140> basically<00:05:59.130> went<00:05:59.520> over<00:05:59.730> the<00:05:59.820> same<00:06:00.150> area

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
and I basically went over the same area

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.840 
and I basically went over the same area
that<00:06:00.690> I<00:06:00.930> did<00:06:01.200> before<00:06:01.890> I<00:06:04.190> returned<00:06:05.190> the<00:06:05.370> Bissell

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
that I did before I returned the Bissell

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.110 
that I did before I returned the Bissell
vacuum<00:06:06.240> and<00:06:06.500> it<00:06:07.500> honestly<00:06:07.950> looked<00:06:08.220> clean<00:06:08.550> to
