00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
with pentatonic scales and blues scales

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.920 
with pentatonic scales and blues scales
just<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.270> kind<00:00:27.450> of<00:00:27.510> come<00:00:27.689> up<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:27.840> some

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.750 
just to kind of come up with some
different<00:00:27.960> licks<00:00:28.350> and<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:29.340> add<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.610> your

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
so this first lick here is basically

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.160 
so this first lick here is basically
just<00:00:35.240> a<00:00:37.910> pentatonic<00:00:38.910> shape<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.390> but

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
just a pentatonic shape like that but

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.330 
just a pentatonic shape like that but
throwing<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.590> some<00:00:40.739> notes<00:00:40.920> from<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.130> blues

little bit so here we go so this is just
a<00:00:50.600> pentatonic<00:00:51.600> lick<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.949> II<00:00:53.609> keep<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.600> mind

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
but making a little bit spicier if you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.130

in<00:01:30.290> there<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:31.010> flat<00:01:31.250> 5<00:01:36.160> you<00:01:37.160> know<00:01:37.250> just

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
in there the flat 5 you know just

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.100 
in there the flat 5 you know just
altering<00:01:38.150> that<00:01:38.240> one<00:01:38.420> note<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:38.780> there<00:01:41.110> creates

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
altering that one note in there creates

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.560 
altering that one note in there creates
a<00:01:42.260> cool<00:01:42.470> sound<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:43.370> just<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.940> know<00:01:43.970> adds<00:01:44.270> to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
a cool sound and just you know adds to

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.390 
a cool sound and just you know adds to
the<00:01:44.720> lick<00:01:45.260> that<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.470> may<00:01:45.620> you<00:01:46.100> don't<00:01:46.220> want<00:01:46.340> to

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
the lick that you may you don't want to

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.910 
the lick that you may you don't want to
be<00:01:46.460> familiar<00:01:46.550> with<00:01:53.200> however<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.440> want<00:01:54.650> so

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
be familiar with however you want so

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.980 
be familiar with however you want so
here's<00:01:55.790> that<00:01:55.880> same<00:01:56.060> lick<00:01:56.330> but<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.540> throw<00:01:56.869> the

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
here's that same lick but I throw the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:08.180 
here's that same lick but I throw the
flat<00:01:57.200> 5<00:01:57.410> in<00:01:57.560> there

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.840 

you<00:02:09.190> can<00:02:09.340> keep<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.580> flat<00:02:09.789> five<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.640> too

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
you can keep the flat five like that too

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:40.320 
you can keep the flat five like that too
if<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.090> want<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.980> another<00:02:39.250> thing<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.550> you

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
if you want so another thing that you

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.449 
if you want so another thing that you
can<00:02:40.420> do<00:02:40.570> with<00:02:40.690> pantyhose<00:02:41.050> just<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.650> mix<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.370> up

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
can do with pantyhose just to mix it up

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.949 
can do with pantyhose just to mix it up
is<00:02:42.640> instead<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:42.970> thinking<00:02:43.330> about<00:02:43.420> pentatonic

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
is instead of thinking about pentatonic

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.890 
is instead of thinking about pentatonic
scales<00:02:44.200> as<00:02:44.500> your<00:02:44.920> root<00:02:45.130> note<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:46.570> could<00:02:46.720> think

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
scales as your root note you could think

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.170 
scales as your root note you could think
about<00:02:46.930> them<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:48.430> know<00:02:48.519> moving<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.000> roots

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
about them you know moving the roots

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.090 
about them you know moving the roots
around<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.630> create<00:02:49.780> some<00:02:50.019> different<00:02:50.380> types<00:02:50.920> of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
around to create some different types of

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.030 
around to create some different types of
sounds<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:52.090> for<00:02:52.269> instance<00:02:52.570> I'm<00:02:53.290> thinking

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
sounds so for instance I'm thinking

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.880 
sounds so for instance I'm thinking
about<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.370> major<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.300> play<00:02:55.540> an<00:02:55.690> E<00:02:55.840> flat<00:02:56.230> minor

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
about a major and I play an E flat minor

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.280 
about a major and I play an E flat minor
pentatonic<00:02:57.310> scale<00:03:00.390> but<00:03:01.390> they<00:03:01.959> can<00:03:02.080> give<00:03:02.200> my

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
pentatonic scale but they can give my

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.890 
pentatonic scale but they can give my
based<00:03:02.560> on<00:03:02.709> his<00:03:02.830> ear

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:18.220 

I<00:03:07.390> can<00:03:08.390> get<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:08.599> cool<00:03:09.040> Lydian<00:03:10.040> sound

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:31.960 

so<00:03:19.230> slow

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.170 

and<00:03:32.870> what<00:03:32.990> that's<00:03:33.140> doing<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.560> I'm<00:03:34.550> getting<00:03:34.850> a

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
and what that's doing is I'm getting a

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.790 
and what that's doing is I'm getting a
minor<00:03:35.480> pentatonic<00:03:35.750> scale<00:03:36.290> but<00:03:36.440> it's<00:03:36.560> giving

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
minor pentatonic scale but it's giving

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.520 
minor pentatonic scale but it's giving
me<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:37.130> major<00:03:37.580> sound<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:39.110> would<00:03:39.290> be<00:03:39.410> like

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
me a major sound this would be like

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.630 
me a major sound this would be like
major<00:03:40.220> 7<00:03:40.670> on<00:03:41.300> e<00:03:41.690> my<00:03:43.780> major<00:03:44.780> second<00:03:45.310> my<00:03:46.310> third

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
major 7 on e my major second my third

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.940 
major 7 on e my major second my third
mm-hmm<00:03:47.510> by<00:03:47.900> sharp<00:03:48.230> for<00:03:48.500> giving<00:03:48.830> me<00:03:48.920> that

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
mm-hmm by sharp for giving me that

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.010 
mm-hmm by sharp for giving me that
Lydian<00:03:49.370> sound<00:03:52.030> six<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.570> then<00:03:53.660> back<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:53.930> the

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
Lydian sound six and then back to the

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.600 
Lydian sound six and then back to the
seventh<00:03:54.290> again<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:54.710> you<00:03:55.220> can<00:03:55.310> essentially

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
seventh again so you can essentially

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.980 
seventh again so you can essentially
thing<00:03:55.850> about<00:03:55.970> just<00:03:56.180> like<00:03:56.270> playing<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.630> Lydian

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
thing about just like playing a Lydian

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.200
