00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
aeration through it because of the heat

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.149 
aeration through it because of the heat
that's<00:01:12.930> come<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.380> through<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> double<00:01:14.010> boiler

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
that's come up through the double boiler

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.399 
that's come up through the double boiler
but<00:01:14.939> we'll<00:01:15.090> get<00:01:15.210> cracking<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.930> vinyl<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
but we'll get cracking on that vinyl and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.170 
but we'll get cracking on that vinyl and
we'll<00:01:16.560> show<00:01:16.740> how<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.220> we've<00:01:17.850> got<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
we'll show how to do that we've got the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.840 
we'll show how to do that we've got the
egg<00:01:18.450> yolks<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> bowl<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.610> quick

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
egg yolks in the bowl just a quick

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.760 
egg yolks in the bowl just a quick
little<00:01:21.330> thing<00:01:21.509> about<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:22.020> guys<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.560> you've

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
little thing about there guys if you've

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.679 
little thing about there guys if you've
got<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> eggs<00:01:23.250> warm<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.909> certainly<00:01:24.330> helps

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
got the eggs warm that certainly helps

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.410 
got the eggs warm that certainly helps
and<00:01:24.900> also<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.250> has<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.580> little<00:01:26.850> red<00:01:27.000> speck

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and also if it has the little red speck

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.080 
and also if it has the little red speck
in<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> get<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.799> out<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.460> will

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
in it get that out because that will

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.499 
in it get that out because that will
stop<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.170> from<00:01:31.350> rising<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.729> then<00:01:32.939> what<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.360> do

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
stop it from rising so then what we do

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.670 
stop it from rising so then what we do
is<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:33.840> add<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.320> sugar<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.960> we<00:01:36.960> firstly<00:01:37.439> just

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
is we add the sugar and we firstly just

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.510 
is we add the sugar and we firstly just
start<00:01:37.950> listing<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.549> away<00:01:39.770> make<00:01:40.770> sure<00:01:41.040> all

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520

yolk and it is a little bit thick
and<00:01:49.880> my<00:01:50.570> feet<00:01:50.840> before<00:01:51.020> we<00:01:51.259> add<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.560> masala<00:01:52.220> to

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
and my feet before we add the masala to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.120 
and my feet before we add the masala to
it<00:01:52.840> till<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.960> turn<00:01:54.140> of<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.409> double<00:01:54.530> boiler<00:01:54.830> on

colors changed and this is when we can

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.750 
colors changed and this is when we can
now<00:02:23.150> add<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.450> masala<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:28.370> we<00:02:28.459> start

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
now add the masala to it and we start

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.250 
now add the masala to it and we start
whisking<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.720> we'll<00:02:29.870> just<00:02:29.900> put<00:02:30.230> that

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
whisking it and we'll just put that

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.559 
whisking it and we'll just put that
right<00:02:30.560> over<00:02:30.739> there<00:02:31.190> give<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.819> heat<00:02:32.030> through

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
right over there give that heat through

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.090 
right over there give that heat through
the<00:02:32.690> mixing<00:02:32.989> allowed<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.560> rise<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.010> become

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
the mixing allowed to rise and become

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.220 
the mixing allowed to rise and become
fluffy<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:34.880> it's<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.239> great<00:02:35.600> we'll<00:02:35.989> do<00:02:36.110> that

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
fluffy and it's just great we'll do that

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.979

now<00:02:36.910> we're<00:02:37.910> on<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.120> bottom<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.720> double

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
now we're on the bottom the double

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.860 
now we're on the bottom the double
boiler<00:02:39.110> here<00:02:39.470> now<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.970> we've<00:02:41.299> got<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.690> heat

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
boiler here now and we've got the heat

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.539 
boiler here now and we've got the heat
under<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.530> we're<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.130> gonna<00:02:43.250> start

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
under and we're just gonna start

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:44.920 
under and we're just gonna start
whisking<00:02:43.760> it's<00:02:44.030> gonna<00:02:44.150> take<00:02:44.450> about<00:02:44.600> eight

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
whisking it's gonna take about eight

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.500 
whisking it's gonna take about eight
minutes<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:46.160> actually<00:02:46.489> do<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:47.120> since<00:02:47.390> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
minutes to actually do it since the
