00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
before and then the crime starts again

before and then the crime starts again
to<00:00:52.980> climb<00:00:53.280> back<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.539> important

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to climb back up the really important

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.689 
to climb back up the really important
thing<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.350> these<00:00:55.649> 10<00:00:55.949> games<00:00:56.190> carry<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
thing is that these 10 games carry a

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.389 
thing is that these 10 games carry a
really<00:00:57.149> big<00:00:57.360> plus<00:00:57.750> or<00:00:58.020> minus<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.590> your<00:00:58.710> MMR<00:00:59.160> or

really big plus or minus to your MMR or
your<00:00:59.489> matchmaking<00:00:59.940> rating<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:00.840> will

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
your matchmaking rating so they will

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.990

you<00:02:55.720> should<00:02:55.780> start<00:02:55.930> with<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.500> champion<00:02:57.040> now

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
you should start with that champion now

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.340 
you should start with that champion now
in<00:02:57.700> my<00:02:57.820> opinion<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:58.330> next<00:02:58.630> one<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.050> most

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
in my opinion this next one is the most

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.440 
in my opinion this next one is the most
important<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.280> that's<00:03:00.430> dragon<00:03:01.000> now<00:03:01.390> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
important and that's dragon now the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.600 
important and that's dragon now the
dragon<00:03:01.810> changed<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.170> lot<00:03:02.470> in<00:03:02.500> season<00:03:03.010> 5<00:03:03.280> but<00:03:03.550> the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
dragon changed a lot in season 5 but the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.460 
dragon changed a lot in season 5 but the
part<00:03:03.880> we're<00:03:04.030> thinking<00:03:04.390> about<00:03:04.480> now<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.170> the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
part we're thinking about now is the

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.440 
part we're thinking about now is the
fifth<00:03:05.740> time<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:06.130> take<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.610> it's<00:03:06.970> just<00:03:07.150> so

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
fifth time you take it it's just so

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.510 
fifth time you take it it's just so
important<00:03:08.200> if<00:03:08.380> you're<00:03:08.530> winning<00:03:08.950> it's<00:03:09.100> an<00:03:09.220> easy

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
important if you're winning it's an easy

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.520 
important if you're winning it's an easy
win<00:03:09.820> with<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.120> fifth<00:03:10.330> dragon<00:03:10.810> buff<00:03:11.020> and<00:03:11.200> if

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
win with the fifth dragon buff and if

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.290 
win with the fifth dragon buff and if
you're<00:03:11.650> losing<00:03:12.190> but<00:03:12.370> can<00:03:12.550> steal<00:03:12.910> or<00:03:13.090> take

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
you're losing but can steal or take

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.270 
you're losing but can steal or take
dragons<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.990> it's<00:03:14.110> an<00:03:14.200> easy<00:03:14.470> come<00:03:14.770> back<00:03:15.010> in

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
dragons and it's an easy come back in

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.980 
dragons and it's an easy come back in
all<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.000> games<00:03:16.209> I've<00:03:16.420> played<00:03:16.450> in<00:03:16.930> the

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
all the games I've played in the

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.050 
all the games I've played in the
preseason<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.920> don't<00:03:18.160> think<00:03:18.340> I've<00:03:18.459> ever<00:03:18.580> seen<00:03:18.850> a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
preseason I don't think I've ever seen a

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.120 
preseason I don't think I've ever seen a
team<00:03:19.360> with<00:03:19.570> Fire<00:03:19.780> Dragons<00:03:20.230> lose<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.470> fire<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
team with Fire Dragons lose a fire the

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.400 
team with Fire Dragons lose a fire the
buff<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.580> just<00:03:21.880> ridiculous<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:23.140> if<00:03:23.290> you're

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
buff is just ridiculous so if you're

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.650 
buff is just ridiculous so if you're
ever<00:03:23.470> stuck<00:03:23.769> on<00:03:24.340> what<00:03:24.580> you<00:03:24.670> should<00:03:24.850> do<00:03:25.030> next<00:03:25.300> if

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
ever stuck on what you should do next if

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.660 
ever stuck on what you should do next if
the<00:03:25.720> enemy<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.230> sitting<00:03:26.709> in<00:03:26.890> their<00:03:27.040> base<00:03:27.250> wave

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
the enemy is sitting in their base wave

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.250 
the enemy is sitting in their base wave
clearing<00:03:28.180> then<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.570> can<00:03:28.720> just<00:03:28.870> keep<00:03:29.050> taking

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
clearing then you can just keep taking

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.960 
clearing then you can just keep taking
dragons<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:30.040> eventually<00:03:30.640> you're<00:03:30.790> going<00:03:30.910> to

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
dragons and eventually you're going to

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.120 
dragons and eventually you're going to
win<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.209> game<00:03:31.239> anyway<00:03:31.840> now<00:03:32.530> this<00:03:32.650> next<00:03:32.860> one<00:03:33.100> is

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
win the game anyway now this next one is

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.590 
win the game anyway now this next one is
a<00:03:33.310> little<00:03:33.640> different<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.209> this<00:03:34.300> is<00:03:34.480> something

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
a little different and this is something

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.630 
a little different and this is something
I<00:03:34.870> personally<00:03:35.410> do<00:03:35.560> all<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.950> time<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.489> it's

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
I personally do all the time and it's

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.850 
I personally do all the time and it's
more<00:03:36.880> about<00:03:37.000> mind<00:03:37.420> games<00:03:37.540> now<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.320> have<00:03:38.620> no

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
more about mind games now you have no

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.800 
more about mind games now you have no
idea<00:03:39.220> what<00:03:39.430> ello<00:03:39.850> your<00:03:40.030> lane<00:03:40.209> opponent<00:03:40.480> was

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
idea what ello your lane opponent was

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.870 
idea what ello your lane opponent was
last<00:03:41.110> season<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.769> they<00:03:41.950> have<00:03:42.160> no<00:03:42.400> idea<00:03:42.550> what

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
last season and they have no idea what

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.910 
last season and they have no idea what
you<00:03:43.000> know<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.180> were<00:03:43.510> either<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:44.170> always<00:03:44.620> spend

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
you know you were either I always spend

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.380 
you know you were either I always spend
the<00:03:45.070> first<00:03:45.250> five<00:03:45.640> minutes<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.209> lane

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
the first five minutes of a lane

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.030 
the first five minutes of a lane
watching<00:03:46.840> them<00:03:46.989> just<00:03:47.290> watching<00:03:47.769> what<00:03:47.800> they<00:03:47.980> do

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
watching them just watching what they do

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.100 
watching them just watching what they do
and<00:03:48.489> that<00:03:48.820> gives<00:03:49.000> me<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.209> good<00:03:49.360> idea<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.780> how

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
and that gives me a good idea of how

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.259 
and that gives me a good idea of how
good<00:03:50.350> they<00:03:50.530> are<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:51.250> if<00:03:51.430> they<00:03:51.550> trade<00:03:51.940> really

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
good they are so if they trade really

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.180 
good they are so if they trade really
well<00:03:52.480> they<00:03:52.750> CS<00:03:53.140> really<00:03:53.440> well<00:03:53.620> then<00:03:53.980> it

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
well they CS really well then it

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.890 
well they CS really well then it
probably<00:03:54.459> means<00:03:54.760> they<00:03:55.030> will<00:03:55.180> higher<00:03:55.480> than<00:03:55.750> you

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
probably means they will higher than you

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.080 
probably means they will higher than you
or<00:03:56.080> around<00:03:56.380> your<00:03:56.680> level<00:03:57.070> last<00:03:57.280> season<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:57.910> you

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
or around your level last season and you

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.970 
or around your level last season and you
might<00:03:58.330> not<00:03:58.480> want<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.720> take<00:03:58.870> as<00:03:59.080> many<00:03:59.200> risks<00:03:59.350> if

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
might not want to take as many risks if

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.860 
might not want to take as many risks if
they<00:04:00.400> don't<00:04:00.640> trade<00:04:01.000> well<00:04:01.209> though<00:04:01.420> they<00:04:01.630> take

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
they don't trade well though they take

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.470 
they don't trade well though they take
dumb<00:04:02.200> fights<00:04:02.560> ACS<00:04:03.310> badly<00:04:03.880> then<00:04:04.180> they<00:04:04.360> will

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
dumb fights ACS badly then they will

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.150 
dumb fights ACS badly then they will
probably<00:04:04.720> lower<00:04:05.050> than<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.709> that's<00:04:05.860> when

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
probably lower than you and that's when

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.220 
probably lower than you and that's when
I<00:04:06.190> make<00:04:06.459> sure<00:04:06.489> I<00:04:06.910> go<00:04:07.090> aggressive<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:07.780> really

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
I make sure I go aggressive and really

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.960 
I make sure I go aggressive and really
show<00:04:08.410> them<00:04:08.620> on<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.860> better<00:04:09.010> player<00:04:09.310> now<00:04:09.850> these

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
show them on the better player now these

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.670 
show them on the better player now these
games<00:04:10.299> are<00:04:10.540> different<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.230> your<00:04:11.350> others

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
games are different to your others

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.229
