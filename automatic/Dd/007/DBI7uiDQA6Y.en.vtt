00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
a much less stressful task so it's so

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.039 
a much less stressful task so it's so
much<00:00:58.120> safer<00:00:58.300> aircraft<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:58.839> fly

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.899 

they're<00:01:05.680> girls<00:01:05.859> performing<00:01:06.340> fantastically

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
they're girls performing fantastically

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.480 
they're girls performing fantastically
out<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.179> sea<00:01:07.890> obviously<00:01:08.890> we<00:01:08.979> have<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.219> prior

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
out to sea obviously we have the prior

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.160 
out to sea obviously we have the prior

a<00:01:11.649> couple<00:01:12.100> of<00:01:12.189> years<00:01:12.340> ago<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:14.200> saw<00:01:14.500> then

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
a couple of years ago and we saw then

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.370 
a couple of years ago and we saw then
that<00:01:15.189> the<00:01:15.399> f-35<00:01:16.270> suited<00:01:16.750> this<00:01:16.869> environment

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
that the f-35 suited this environment

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.950 
that the f-35 suited this environment
very<00:01:17.560> well<00:01:17.789> what<00:01:18.789> we've<00:01:18.909> now<00:01:19.090> moved<00:01:19.270> on<00:01:19.509> to<00:01:19.750> is

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
very well what we've now moved on to is

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.100 
very well what we've now moved on to is
pushing<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.829> envelope<00:01:20.950> out<00:01:21.310> further

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
pushing the envelope out further

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.080 
pushing the envelope out further
carrying<00:01:23.110> internal<00:01:23.560> stores<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.369> flying<00:01:24.909> at

carrying internal stores and flying at
night<00:01:25.119> I'm<00:01:26.020> really<00:01:26.350> just<00:01:26.439> expanding<00:01:27.039> the

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
night I'm really just expanding the

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:28.260 
night I'm really just expanding the
envelope<00:01:27.429> to<00:01:27.579> make<00:01:27.729> sure<00:01:27.880> that<00:01:28.060> when<00:01:28.179> the

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
envelope to make sure that when the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.330 
envelope to make sure that when the
Marine<00:01:28.450> Corps<00:01:28.689> go<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.049> any<00:01:29.890> operating

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
Marine Corps go to any operating

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.730 
Marine Corps go to any operating
capability<00:01:31.000> they've<00:01:31.569> got<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.049> best

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
capability they've got the best

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.730 
capability they've got the best
available<00:01:33.630> operating<00:01:34.630> envelope<00:01:35.049> that<00:01:35.469> we<00:01:35.590> can

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
available operating envelope that we can

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.600 
available operating envelope that we can
give<00:01:35.890> them

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.649 

taking<00:01:40.509> off<00:01:40.600> with<00:01:40.840> with<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.619> weapon<00:01:41.979> load<00:01:42.189> is

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
taking off with with a weapon load is

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.910 
taking off with with a weapon load is
relatively<00:01:43.659> transparent<00:01:43.899> to<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.439> pilot<00:01:44.799> the

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
relatively transparent to the pilot the

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.590 
relatively transparent to the pilot the
acceleration<00:01:45.490> is<00:01:45.610> still<00:01:45.850> good<00:01:46.030> down<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.420> deck

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
acceleration is still good down the deck

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.070 
acceleration is still good down the deck
the<00:01:47.140> handling<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:47.710> all<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:47.950> same<00:01:48.159> so<00:01:49.080> whether

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
the handling is all the same so whether

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.660 
the handling is all the same so whether
you've<00:01:50.229> got<00:01:50.380> weapons<00:01:50.530> or<00:01:50.830> not<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.310> be<00:01:51.430> honest

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
you've got weapons or not to be honest

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
you've got weapons or not to be honest
it's<00:01:52.030> hard<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.360> tell

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.169 

I<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:56.189> initially<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> little<00:01:56.850> worried<00:01:57.119> about

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
I was initially a little worried about

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.990 
I was initially a little worried about
flying<00:01:57.570> at<00:01:57.719> night<00:01:57.750> with<00:01:58.170> my<00:01:58.399> harrier<00:01:59.399> legacy

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
flying at night with my harrier legacy

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.510 
flying at night with my harrier legacy
baggage<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.530> Harrier<00:02:01.799> was<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> much

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
baggage because the Harrier was a much

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.270 
baggage because the Harrier was a much
more<00:02:02.729> difficult<00:02:03.210> aircraft<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.810> fly<00:02:04.280> happily

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
more difficult aircraft to fly happily

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.370 
more difficult aircraft to fly happily
the<00:02:05.460> f-35<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:05.969> much<00:02:06.450> easier<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.020> definitely

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the f-35 is much easier it's definitely

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
the f-35 is much easier it's definitely
fifth<00:02:07.619> gen<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.149> every<00:02:09.149> respect<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
fifth gen in every respect and the the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.780 
fifth gen in every respect and the the
night<00:02:11.580> flying<00:02:11.910> was<00:02:12.239> was<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.629> breeze

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.600 

what<00:02:16.360> we're<00:02:16.510> seeing<00:02:16.689> is<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.430> aircraft's<00:02:18.430> much
