 presentation and hinted that it is a 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.030
 strong candidate for the tournament title of 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.989

 poor performance at home

 good header player shore 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.590
 and Ricardo Farias made an overflow by 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.289

 then in control went out to the goalkeeper 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.540
 team churre and he applied a little hat 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.140
 that made him scream goal to the fans of 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.140
 albo team 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.310
 you knew what was going to happen was going to 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.450
 make those goals today presents you 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.540
 the opportunity to take advantage of the maximum 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.550
 to not enter the court with the 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.230
 sure of being good 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.520
 things went well and they gave the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.440
 opportunity to be something olive in this 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.720
 line this party has been has been a 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.010
 little hard-fought back and forth to your opinion 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.810
 how have you seen the players of your 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.370
 team was in this very well 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.860
 physically you know they have the attitude 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.940
 the desire to get ahead as you see them 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.670
 What is your opinion of this party? 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.920
 Of course we are working hard 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.470
 our week and what better is this 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.970
 What is your vision for the 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.560
 next match to be held in the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.240
 city of Piura as you see the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.930
 players what is your project for that 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.420
 match when equal play equal and do 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.400
 respect the house not a typical party of 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.560
 cup but I think there is no surprise 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.140
 for nobody so when you team up 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.120
 Peru Cup match with no problem 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.430
 I think a fan that is always 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.500
 he wants his team not to win a team 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.010
 on court that wanted to give the best that 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.470
 could but happily worth the effort of 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.910
 we in our colors this is not 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.100
 things went better than the team 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.330
 rival professor the next match will 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.520
 will perform in our city in our 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.970
 house like what are your expectations 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.990
 for that day with insurance the party has 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.060
 it has to be played with the same 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.610
 intensity thinking that this still does not 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.500
 is defined we have 90 minutes left and 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.910
 we owe to that so we're going to 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.610
 take it with the greatest seriousness 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.640
 possible and to close the key well in 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.640
 home
