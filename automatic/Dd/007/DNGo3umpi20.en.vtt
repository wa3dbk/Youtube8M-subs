00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it was actually kind of funny that we

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.910 
about the stuff but you know going back
to<00:01:33.570> there<00:01:33.720> was<00:01:33.960> pretty<00:01:34.200> cool<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.409> mean<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.770> look

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
to there was pretty cool I mean to look

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.260 
to there was pretty cool I mean to look
at<00:01:35.009> all<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> stuff<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.430> they<00:01:35.670> had<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.880> show

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
at all the stuff that they had to show

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.569 
at all the stuff that they had to show
everything<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:37.079> really<00:01:37.650> liked<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.979> monuments

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
everything I really liked the monuments

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.890 
everything I really liked the monuments
I<00:01:38.670> think<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> lincoln<00:01:39.329> memorial<00:01:39.360> was

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
I think the lincoln memorial was

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.390 
I think the lincoln memorial was
probably<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.409> favorites<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.009> then<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.280> went

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
probably my favorites and then we went

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.039 
probably my favorites and then we went
to<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> Smithsonian<00:01:42.150> museums<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:42.659> well<00:01:42.840> those

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
to the Smithsonian museums as well those

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.230 
to the Smithsonian museums as well those
were<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.439> cool<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> got<00:01:45.210> to

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
were really cool and you know I got to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.550 
were really cool and you know I got to
look<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> artifacts<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.259> everything

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
look at all the artifacts and everything

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.499 
look at all the artifacts and everything
I<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.950> probably<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.520> Space<00:01:47.939> Museum<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
I like the probably the Space Museum the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.179 
I like the probably the Space Museum the
best<00:01:48.689> move<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.170> our<00:01:49.350> ride<00:01:49.590> simulators

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
best move on like our ride simulators

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.280 
best move on like our ride simulators

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
walked out into the hotel when they were

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.170 
walked out into the hotel when they were
checking<00:05:06.289> the<00:05:06.500> tape<00:05:06.680> and<00:05:06.800> he's<00:05:06.919> like<00:05:07.100> yeah<00:05:07.310> my

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
checking the tape and he's like yeah my

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.820 
checking the tape and he's like yeah my
knee<00:05:08.240> is<00:05:08.449> really<00:05:08.600> bloody<00:05:08.990> so<00:05:09.289> that<00:05:09.530> way<00:05:09.650> they

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
knee is really bloody so that way they

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.469 
knee is really bloody so that way they
figured<00:05:10.280> that<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.580> tape<00:05:10.910> broke<00:05:11.120> from<00:05:11.300> that

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
figured that the tape broke from that

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.600 
figured that the tape broke from that
instead<00:05:11.900> of<00:05:11.960> my<00:05:12.110> friends<00:05:12.560> breaking<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.520> when

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
instead of my friends breaking it when

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.250 
instead of my friends breaking it when
