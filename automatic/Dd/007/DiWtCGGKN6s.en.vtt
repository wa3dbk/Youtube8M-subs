00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 hi all guys today i am you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.350
 I'll tell you how to check the hall sensor on 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.769
 performance in the total year on delivery 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.820
 count such a thing with a magnet which 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.119
 give impulses to the switch so that 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.699
 already had an impact on the reels they're home 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.910
 Circle issued here I have two sensors 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.730
 Hall this workers this tee worker the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.220
 I bought today I will 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.289
 install well and decided to shoot a review 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.579
 Fu damn this vidos how to check 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.070
 him 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.410
 me here is a dude who I bought it all 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.360
 told how to check in general 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:45.079
 checked and yes about the bell imagine 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:49.200
 the code is being called and it's just called 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.420
 we connect by wires connect 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.309
 and should here such values ​​be 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.390
 what we were told everywhere in different ways 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.739
 shows the values ​​of these should be 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.949
 indicator 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:07.890
 working sensor hall that's working 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:11.189
 We connect to this device is silent 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.640
 there's nothing like that here is also 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.290
 checked by the resistance's Well 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.220
 yes icon when resistance icon 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.140
 again there is nothing by the way today so far 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.290
 twisting his fingers 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.520
 the vessels burst like that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.020
 could have been dirty could germs 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.020
 get into and fingers amputate 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.780
 Just kidding now also try on working 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.049
 sensors and here again resistance 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.079
 changing and what was read should be 03 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.520
 here it jumps but in short it is already something that is 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.170
 cottage sensor works shorter well that's all 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.130
 that is, just the usual about voiced right 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.439
 it rings up and see the value there 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.700
 or not all put the sensor now 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.469
 today I'll install all this I'll check 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.330
 He speaks type on simple not burn 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.350
 could 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.450
 there might be power surges but 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.910
 I like 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.240
 I checked whom he gave them away from 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.970
 13 to 14 no more no less well as necessary 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.440
 Overall, so maybe I just do not 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.600
 lucky lyrics 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.600
 well , all right
