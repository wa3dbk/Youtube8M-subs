awkward for you guys have it a small
screen<00:02:04.080> so<00:02:04.890> summer<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> rack<00:02:06.770> it's<00:02:07.770> going

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
screen so summer on the rack it's going

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.999 
screen so summer on the rack it's going
to<00:02:08.009> look<00:02:08.100> nice<00:02:08.280> at<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.550> end<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:08.910> video

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
to look nice at the end of the video

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.960 
to look nice at the end of the video
alright<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.570> next<00:02:12.600> code<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.380> for<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:14.040> Diablo

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
alright so the next code is for a Diablo

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.600 
alright so the next code is for a Diablo
trophy<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.590> moshe<00:02:19.590> sport<00:02:20.010> that's<00:02:20.340> easy

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.320 

it's<00:02:24.110> yeah<00:02:25.110> moshi<00:02:25.470> sport<00:02:25.980> or<00:02:26.190> Moshe's<00:02:26.760> porch

it's yeah moshi sport or Moshe's porch
whatever<00:02:27.840> 2<00:02:28.350> i'm<00:02:29.220> guessing<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:29.730> mostly

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
whatever 2 i'm guessing it's mostly

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.400 
whatever 2 i'm guessing it's mostly
sport<00:02:30.390> because<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.690> whole<00:02:30.840> theme<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.140> like

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
sport because the whole theme is like

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.760 
sport because the whole theme is like
sports<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.040> stuff<00:02:32.340> summer<00:02:33.120> nice<00:02:33.930> hot<00:02:34.500> weather
