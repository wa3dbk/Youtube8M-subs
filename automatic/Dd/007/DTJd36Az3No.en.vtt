00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello now we'll see in 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.410
 the glossy box men 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.639
 She has been with me for a while 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.559
 at home and I have not yet 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.150
 you look a bit 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.500
 what to do I still depend on the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.690
 involvement with boxing a bit 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.199
 afterwards if I have looked regularly 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.520
 to get it and with twins too 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.180
 Home is also difficult to catch up 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.460
 but that's how it gradually happens to me 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.849
 I hope I can do it 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.160
 at least endeavored and now also begins 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.290
 my trip time again i have one 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.329
 few appointments outside where I am then too 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.809
 time to drive away was recently in 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.160
 Sardinia 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.840
 there comes a little something 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.300
 Together, that's why you stop a bit 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.370
 slacking so I have since 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.960
 I tell you now in advance before 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.059
 I decided to look into this box 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.570
 unsubscribe GLOSSYBOX men 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.059
 My husband does not make you happy if he does 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.780
 So really reiterate 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.920
 also has no bock on it and therefore has 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.549
 he said darling 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.189
 Come let the glossybox be human and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.340
 I said darling 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.570
 okay what else should I say because you 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.880
 yes no box think if he is not bock 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.970
 has more on it is nonsense 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:23.430
 So no glossybox one more with me 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:26.189
 on the channel shame what to look's 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.000
 we waxman in the last class for me 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.790
 or 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.049
 for my husband now here it was about 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.049
 masculine in the autumn 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.820
 she smells very much after the game 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.170
 just now a mega hammer appears 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.899
 Box and my husband will be the ass 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.799
 bite that could I have so here 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:55.149
 we have such a pretty head 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:02:03.640
 advertising leaflet woman luna rossa an eau de 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:05.439
 toilet I am curious but quite good 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:14.260
 not really good believes that will mine 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:19.989
 man can we have just one 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.370
 energy shampoo that smells mariechen 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.080
 Well, that too can not be necessary 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.970
 use this is not typical men 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.079
 I would say that can also be woman 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.170
 use 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.910
 quite right here we have a shower gel 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.349
 So this time really a nice box 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.810
 so far no shaver in there is something 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.130
 value 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.390
 red line for men shower gel that was the 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.010
 fragrance that jumped towards me as to itself 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.190
 the box opened that was the typical 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.680
 shower gel smell the girl was immediately 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.420
 he smelled really good so me 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.389
 believe that my husband will like it too 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.540
 then maybe you are wrong 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.549
 decided the box shut 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.049
 styling is okay this is not 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.269
 necessarily what you use often 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.670
 so I'm probably more likely to 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.170
 for the tips and here we still have 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.310
 a hand cream and there will be my husband 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.840
 finally say oh again 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.980
 compete if it is not so much there 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.560
 Let's smell it, let's see 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.989
 I can not give it to myself 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.549
 now just a piece that I do not care 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.190
 that did not diminish those given away now 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.329
 But we feel good on quality 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.530
 then on the skin pulls too damn 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:30.700
 Quick on by delicious but with it 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.880
 up there with the not entirely the 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.870
 really good the whole box namely with it 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.989
 to make you happy 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.860
 Let's see if anyone knows your grandfather or 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.670
 so 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.569
 actually not that with now 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.310
 I did not want to say that's right now 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.989
 it may be a nice job for opas 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.670
 I like it 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.989
 but if not a little bit fits 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.420
 good is okay small cream shower still 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.980
 a shampoo and another eau de 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.390
 toilet that is is a small box 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.010
 really been a nice box 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.040
 So I think that was with one 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.810
 the best boxes I have seen 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.239
 too bad she was fired 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.280
 said nothing when it'm not 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.310
 Okay then we set the hall 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.889
 and thus I will show you in the future 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.269
 no more the glossybox men pleased me 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.940
 but stopped with a nice box too 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.470
 have that also has something and also has 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.000
 really nothing to do with the quality 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.240
 it remains the glossybox is on 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.740
 Good if I have the shaver in it 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.710
 You always have that with the boxes 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.419
 but otherwise she has me well 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.910
 I really liked this box 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:38.120
 nice and so I say for the last time 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.500
 at the glossybox mellon and we are 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.500
 then stop at other videos
