00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.870
 a long time we do not know about you and 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.379
 me because it's been a long time 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.760
 had understood 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.860
 so today I'm coming back to you 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.960
 for a particular subject I 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.219
 would like to react some sort of no 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.049
 clash because I'm someone from 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.390
 very kind and the very peaceful 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.119
 but if he could fuck his race 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.039
 so I'm going today to talk to you about 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.390
 cutting edge pornic who needs who comes the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.039
 singular masculine chain 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.150
 so today he has released a video 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.220
 it was someone I appreciate 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.650
 a lot because he always had 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.180
 a lot of talent a lot of humor and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.440
 we had the same passions as me 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.930
 they love phoenix world it's 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.149
 directional and all I would have loved a 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.250
 day spend an afternoon with him at 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.410
 read from the rail phoenix listened to one 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.940
 direction and all of them finally these ways where the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.839
 dream 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.890
 but he's an asshole because 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.350
 today he has released a video 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.460
 rare special in fact he makes us his 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.480
 day today tells us his 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.850
 day what I find quite 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.000
 commendable on his part unfortunately he 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.859
 we are talking about ramadan is actually there ay 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.519
 there he blamed something and I'm going 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.010
 return to it 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.420
 so yes I do not mind there are things 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.590
 unforgivable in the city â€‹â€‹on the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.159
 Ramadan is something very 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.360
 important 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.729
 it's something we can not 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.259
 to flout like that so yes okay he has 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.060
 have a snack at 10:30 am I accept 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.710
 I accept no concern about it is 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.330
 no problem he can eat at 10:30 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.490
 in the morning it does not matter he gets 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.289
 will catch up after united we will do another 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.450
 stuff I do not know but he can 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.890
 redo his day ok they eat from 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.630
 sausage at 4 am but they had 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.710
 hungry so this day of ramadan is not 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.490
 abandoned by cons he did some 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.020
 very serious thing 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.280
 I showed you the extract then 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.230
 look at this excerpt there but I 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.340
 know 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.460
 I know you noticed it like me 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.190
 yes no no no do not say anything I know 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.210
 that you know yes I know you know 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.260
 not what I know you know I 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.940
 know no yes you're right then yes 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.680
 there are things in life very serious 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.210
 so okay there are serious diseases 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.979
 there are people who are starving but 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.300
 there are things not to scorn and that 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.340
 it's very important when you make a 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.380
 couscous look good yes you are here 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.170
 you see the merguez must be in the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.490
 direction of the direction of the mecca and there 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.979
 that's not the case at all, so it's 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.420
 very serious male sir singular 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.619
 so I totally disagree 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.230
 with your video I ask you 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.820
 expressly a video deletion where 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.709
 you redo this couscous with a 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.370
 merguez in a good way because it's 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.800
 very serious 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.480
 many will have killed for that it's not 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.209
 very charlie at all it's not even 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.209
 charlie at all anyway his weeklies 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.540
 that's no it's inadmissible 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.280
 unacceptable 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.230
 so I request the deletion of this 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:40.870
