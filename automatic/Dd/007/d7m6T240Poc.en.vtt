00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:09.440
 hello all minecraft friends les 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:12.840
 Speak 6 and 6 on the 19th and today I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.390
 of the emeralds 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.160
 Well, I think that many people ask 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.260
 what are they for and all that first? 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.640
 I will explain anything 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.290
 the emeralds almost do not serve you 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.120
 you can only use them to do 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:35.790
 decorations as you can see here in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.390
 other blocks and here are blocks of 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.800
 emeralds 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.160
 decorations but can not do 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.460
 sword swords or something like that I think that 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.930
 if they want to do one of those things they should 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.370
 download a mode something without wherever 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.840
 but not only do they have to do 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.930
 decorations also helps you to 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.930
 change them with the villagers 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.420
 sorry 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.700
 this is more difficult now 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.600
 to shit 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.600
 here is the truth 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.600
 good you are 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.600
 now you go with a room of the town 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.420
 like that for example 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.420
 here he says 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.180
 what he can change you give him a 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.790
 Emerald change and he will give you cookies and 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.700
 if you do not want that, then repeat in front 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.549
 who can see here 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.329
 and then it changes but it's Texan has no 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.329
 more relevance 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.600
 and not only for that to say good 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.600
 Emeralds just change 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.160
 and these decorations 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.160
 well that's it for now 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.469
 I'm sorry if those 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.850
 water them or something like that but I think 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.040
 soon they will put the armors but 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.099
 good 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:35.480
 from 16 and 10 666 the 19th and here they 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:38.510
 teach the emeralds as fractions 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:44.859
 postdata if you wonder how I made a 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.859
 of these only put this 1 2 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.319
 4 and in the head and a pumpkin above and 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.989
 Are crated 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.230
 although they serve to defend you from 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.239
 monsters and other good is what I 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.810
 they counted the ones that surely it has 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.930
 tried 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.880
 but if your something hits them and they're going 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.099
 to attack you so try not to 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.650
 hit them I know they are very difficult to 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.549
 kill 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.260
 they are easy but they have a lot of life 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:19.640
 you take a long time 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.640
 good, goodbye 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.400
 not one more thing 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.819
 wonder how to find the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.460
 emeralds 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.430
 everyone can count on temples 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.820
 he asked himself in what temples as that is 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.790
 and you have to look for them there are only 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.570
 two types of temples look for example my 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.570
 fast 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.970
 they approach 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.110
 Welcome to the temple of the good sand 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.270
 this is a sand temple here is the 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.700
 only place where you can find the 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.060
 emeralds one is my one way is nothing 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.319
 is the temple is new this I stayed 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.430
 impressed when I found it 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.430
 and almost half 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.979
 here are some treasures have to 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.979
 look for him his person see place interest 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.840
 here 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:35.569
 well I more or less do not know well 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:38.169
 where are the treasures 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.169
 in which I believe 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.930
 good 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:06.340
 now I want to search but because these are 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:09.340
 the east east temples and a temple of 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.340
 jungle 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:15.100
 to the temples of jungles are you place a 

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:19.180
 bit harder to find 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:23.700
 not like that but good you can only find 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.650
 the emeralds here and 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.710
 well also like the diamonds below 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.130
 of the earth but it is more difficult since 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.130
 can 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.000
 since it is new and I think it is a 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.220
 little more difficult but it is not worth the 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.590
 worth looking for since it almost does not work 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.210
 at least touch that you feel a house of 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.490
 emeralds 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.000
 it looks but it is more difficult than 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.389
 find diamonds well now yes I already 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.389
 dismissal
