predominantly and strictly an old school
reggae<00:01:10.710> party<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.310> now<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:11.850> the

reggae party but now that you know the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.899 
reggae party but now that you know the
crowd<00:01:12.360> has<00:01:12.540> changed<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.930> much<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:14.580> music

has<00:01:15.060> changed<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.479> much<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.470> now<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
has changed so much so now it's like a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.039 
has changed so much so now it's like a
fusion<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.490> old<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.909> new<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.420> still

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
fusion of old and new I still

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.620 
fusion of old and new I still
predominantly<00:01:19.590> old<00:01:19.830> music<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.460> i<00:01:20.700> guess<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
predominantly old music but i guess the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.320 
predominantly old music but i guess the
staple<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.939> when<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.060> first

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
staple of it is just that when we first

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.700 
staple of it is just that when we first
started<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.750> were<00:01:24.869> kind<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> first<00:01:25.409> party

of<00:01:25.740> its<00:01:25.890> kind<00:01:26.159> being<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.909> i'm<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.210> your

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
of its kind being that i'm not your

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.870 
of its kind being that i'm not your
typical<00:01:27.900> atypical<00:01:28.350> reggae<00:01:28.890> DJ<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.850> know

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
typical atypical reggae DJ you know

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.600 
typical atypical reggae DJ you know
bandit<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> soca<00:01:30.960> DJ<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.710> impress<00:01:32.310> those<00:01:32.460> in

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
bandit is a soca DJ and impress those in

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.679 
bandit is a soca DJ and impress those in
the<00:01:32.700> wreckage<00:01:32.939> scene<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.390> three

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the wreckage scene so it was like three

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.030 
the wreckage scene so it was like three
different<00:01:34.020> ways<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.380> playing<00:01:34.560> reggae<00:01:34.799> music

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
different ways of playing reggae music

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.560 
different ways of playing reggae music
all<00:01:35.220> came<00:01:35.400> together<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.210> think<00:01:36.420> that's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
all came together and I think that's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.179 
all came together and I think that's
what<00:01:36.750> attracted<00:01:37.110> people<00:01:37.380> at<00:01:37.470> first<00:01:37.680> right<00:01:37.950> so

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
what attracted people at first right so

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.380 
what attracted people at first right so
it's<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.520> awfully<00:01:38.970> different<00:01:39.150> than

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
it's just like awfully different than

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.510 
it's just like awfully different than
everybody<00:01:39.600> else<00:01:39.930> press<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> will<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.220> bandit

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
everybody else press the will and bandit

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.819 
everybody else press the will and bandit
will<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.970> then<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.780> think<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> whole<00:01:43.470> party<00:01:43.710> is

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
will and then I think the whole party is

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.290 
will and then I think the whole party is
not<00:01:44.070> intimidating

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
not intimidating

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.780
