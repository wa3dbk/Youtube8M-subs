and metallics in there main reason is
this<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.570> exactly<00:01:42.990> why<00:01:43.200> because<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.740> color<00:01:44.009> like

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
this is exactly why because a color like

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.310 
this is exactly why because a color like
this<00:01:44.220> which<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.700> solid<00:01:45.149> color<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.079> had<00:01:46.290> a

this which is a solid color if I had a

this which is a solid color if I had a

bit of metallic left in that gun

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.270 
bit of metallic left in that gun
it<00:01:48.240> only<00:01:48.390> takes<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.840> tiny<00:01:49.079> little<00:01:49.439> amount<00:01:49.619> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
it only takes a tiny little amount to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.310 
it only takes a tiny little amount to
come<00:01:50.490> out<00:01:50.700> onto<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.360> solid<00:01:51.810> color<00:01:52.020> clear

come out onto this solid color clear

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.350 
come out onto this solid color clear
coat<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:53.130> don't<00:01:53.340> want<00:01:53.460> any<00:01:53.610> metallic<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.180> that

coat we don't want any metallic in that

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.090 
coat we don't want any metallic in that
because<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.780> got<00:01:55.049> no<00:01:55.079> metallic<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
because it's got no metallic in it and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.620 
because it's got no metallic in it and
you<00:01:56.250> could<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> couple<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.119> tiny<00:01:57.360> little

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
you could have a couple of tiny little

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.200 
you could have a couple of tiny little
specks<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.159> would<00:01:59.310> permeate<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
specks in that and it would permeate a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.760 
specks in that and it would permeate a
nice<00:02:00.420> car<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.110> would<00:02:01.409> ruin<00:02:01.619> it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
nice car like this that would ruin it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.340 
nice car like this that would ruin it
and<00:02:01.979> you'd<00:02:02.130> probably<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.850> again

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
and you'd probably have to do it again

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.800 
and you'd probably have to do it again
it<00:02:04.350> was<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:05.009> few<00:02:05.610> years<00:02:05.790> ago<00:02:05.939> maybe<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.450> good<00:02:06.600> five

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
it was a few years ago maybe a good five

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.150 
it was a few years ago maybe a good five
years<00:02:06.899> ago<00:02:07.229> now<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.530> started<00:02:08.009> running

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
years ago now I started running

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.830 
years ago now I started running
dedicating<00:02:08.879> clear<00:02:09.090> guns<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.569> wouldn't

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
dedicating clear guns and I wouldn't

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.449 
dedicating clear guns and I wouldn't
look<00:02:09.989> back<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.890> as<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.879> say<00:02:12.090> we've<00:02:12.450> got<00:02:12.720> some

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
look back but as I say we've got some

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.660 
look back but as I say we've got some
other<00:02:13.730> products<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:14.769> for<00:02:15.769> use<00:02:15.920> with<00:02:16.219> this<00:02:16.400> gun

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
other products you for use with this gun

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.550 
other products you for use with this gun
so<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.150> can<00:02:17.299> actually<00:02:17.420> see<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:18.019> it<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.349> an

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
so you can actually see that it is an

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.250 
so you can actually see that it is an
all-rounder<00:02:19.159> spray<00:02:19.430> gun<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.909> it<00:02:20.719> can<00:02:20.930> be<00:02:21.049> used

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
all-rounder spray gun and it can be used

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.530 
all-rounder spray gun and it can be used

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
for most applications so this is the

I personally like to set it up to but

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.160 
I personally like to set it up to but
get<00:06:31.760> the<00:06:31.910> gun<00:06:32.090> running<00:06:32.450> it<00:06:32.540> to<00:06:32.720> bar<00:06:32.990> which<00:06:33.110> is

get the gun running it to bar which is
29<00:06:33.530> psi<00:06:34.160> and<00:06:34.400> that<00:06:34.760> we<00:06:34.910> just

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
29 psi and that we just

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.200 
29 psi and that we just
run<00:06:35.290> really<00:06:35.650> nice<00:06:35.800> get<00:06:36.130> real<00:06:36.370> nice<00:06:36.610> factory

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.920 
run really nice get real nice factory
orange<00:06:38.020> peels<00:06:38.290> and<00:06:39.360> eliminate<00:06:40.360> the<00:06:40.510> chance<00:06:40.750> of

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
orange peels and eliminate the chance of

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.840 
orange peels and eliminate the chance of
having<00:06:41.140> it<00:06:41.350> run<00:06:41.620> off<00:06:41.920> and<00:06:42.160> if<00:06:42.310> you<00:06:42.400> have<00:06:42.550> it<00:06:42.670> too

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 
having it run off and if you have it too

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.430 
having it run off and if you have it too
low<00:06:43.120> it's<00:06:43.420> going<00:06:43.540> to<00:06:43.630> get<00:06:43.750> on<00:06:43.900> a<00:06:43.930> lot<00:06:44.170> thicker

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
low it's going to get on a lot thicker

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.110 
low it's going to get on a lot thicker
and<00:06:44.620> more<00:06:44.830> chance<00:06:45.310> with<00:06:45.550> having<00:06:45.820> the<00:06:45.910> paint

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
and more chance with having the paint

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.050 
and more chance with having the paint
build<00:06:46.360> up<00:06:46.570> in<00:06:46.720> areas<00:06:47.220> such<00:06:48.220> as<00:06:48.250> edges<00:06:48.850> and

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
build up in areas such as edges and

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.110 
build up in areas such as edges and
having<00:06:49.450> pay<00:06:49.660> runs<00:06:49.960> so<00:06:50.400> this<00:06:51.400> is<00:06:51.550> a<00:06:51.580> finished

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
having pay runs so this is a finished

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.880 
having pay runs so this is a finished
product<00:06:52.300> here<00:06:52.600> I<00:06:52.780> don't<00:06:52.990> have<00:06:53.290> a<00:06:53.410> video<00:06:53.650> of
