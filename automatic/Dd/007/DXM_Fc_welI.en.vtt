orange black and white I noticed that

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.170 
orange black and white I noticed that
the<00:02:51.320> mid-block<00:02:52.320> here<00:02:52.800> it's<00:02:53.460> actually<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:54.000> an

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the mid-block here it's actually like an

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.620 
the mid-block here it's actually like an
off-white<00:02:54.390> it's<00:02:55.050> not<00:02:55.290> really<00:02:55.530> white<00:02:55.920> white<00:02:56.190> um

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
that makes much sense it's not like a

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.510
