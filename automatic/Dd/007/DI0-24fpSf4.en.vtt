to<00:03:24.900> really<00:03:25.080> branch<00:03:25.320> out<00:03:25.650> he's<00:03:25.830> taking<00:03:26.130> no

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
to really branch out he's taking no

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.010 
to really branch out he's taking no
risks<00:03:26.730> he's<00:03:26.850> been<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.300> behind<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.810> ball

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
risks he's been in behind the ball

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.170 
risks he's been in behind the ball
taking<00:03:28.710> care<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.950> his<00:03:29.130> technique<00:03:29.550> defensively

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
taking care of his technique defensively

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.750 
taking care of his technique defensively
I<00:03:31.310> don't<00:03:32.310> think<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.580> will<00:03:32.700> be<00:03:32.760> one<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.030> his

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
I don't think this will be one of his

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.130 
I don't think this will be one of his
good<00:03:35.760> time<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.180> not<00:03:36.240> a<00:03:36.330> long<00:03:36.540> time<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:36.780> think<00:03:37.020> he

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
good time and not a long time I think he

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.380 
good time and not a long time I think he
wants<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.410> long<00:03:37.590> time<00:03:37.800> out<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.160> middle

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.880 

and<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.870> think<00:03:43.050> that's<00:03:43.200> exactly<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.740> way<00:03:43.860> he

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
and I think that's exactly the way he

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.410 
and I think that's exactly the way he
should<00:03:43.980> start<00:03:44.430> his<00:03:44.550> innings<00:03:44.850> there's<00:03:45.300> no

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
should start his innings there's no

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.120 
should start his innings there's no
doubt<00:03:45.660> there'll<00:03:45.900> be<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.050> consistency<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.980> his

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
doubt there'll be a consistency to his

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.830 
doubt there'll be a consistency to his
game<00:03:47.370> if<00:03:47.580> he<00:03:47.670> just<00:03:47.910> gives<00:03:48.090> himself<00:03:48.270> a<00:03:48.600> chance

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
game if he just gives himself a chance

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.250 
game if he just gives himself a chance
to<00:03:49.050> get<00:03:49.170> going<00:03:49.730> he<00:03:50.730> loves<00:03:51.660> playing<00:03:51.870> against

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
to get going he loves playing against

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.930 
to get going he loves playing against
