00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
transmission works on the fly is a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.790 
transmission works on the fly is a
little<00:00:23.880> hard<00:00:24.090> sometimes<00:00:24.300> they<00:00:24.630> get<00:00:24.750> stuck<00:00:24.810> so

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
little hard sometimes they get stuck so

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.339 
little hard sometimes they get stuck so
I'll<00:00:26.340> try<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.609> show<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.990> could<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.260> in

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
I'll try to show you what I could do in

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.470 
I'll try to show you what I could do in
this<00:00:28.470> video<00:00:28.710> hopefully<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:29.789> drive<00:00:30.119> and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
this video hopefully I can drive and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.690 
this video hopefully I can drive and
hold<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> camera<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.070> one<00:00:32.250> hand<00:00:32.460> so

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
hold on to the camera with one hand so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.970 
hold on to the camera with one hand so
let's<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:33.780> right<00:00:36.710> now<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.129> first<00:00:38.610> gear

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
let's see right now it's in first gear

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.860 
let's see right now it's in first gear
super<00:00:40.980> low<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.790> actually<00:00:42.120> locked<00:00:42.480> let<00:00:42.750> me

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
super low it's actually locked let me

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.619 
super low it's actually locked let me
turn<00:00:43.559> those<00:00:43.920> off<00:00:44.190> real<00:00:44.579> quick<00:00:47.420> that's<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
turn those off real quick that's the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.430 
turn those off real quick that's the
first<00:00:48.899> gear<00:00:49.260> right<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:50.989> pretty<00:00:51.989> torquey

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
first gear right there pretty torquey

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.170 
first gear right there pretty torquey
little<00:00:52.649> guy

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180
