 of the game and will adapt it to the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:21.100

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:24.310

 of murdering the staff of 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.260
 the place and more than anything is a super 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.230
 Notion honestly is a super 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.230
 notice that this game slows down are freddy 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.070
 is going to have an adaptation on the screen 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.070
 big 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.960
 I do not know was expected because it was the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.819
 brand more sincerely has marked a 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.610
 trend in the field of games of 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.590
 terror 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.399
 and more than anything if it has taken us several 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.410
 scares I do not deny that I played the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.330
 first I have not played anything else the first 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.020
 I have not had the opportunity to play the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.240
 2 or 3 but 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.270
 frame marks a trend in the field 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.390
 of the horror games very very very 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.930
 strong this game was fashionable and I think 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.230
 that the movie I think if they know it 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.590
 produce will have great success because 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.650
 we know that several games have 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.170
 have sent to the big screen this in 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.349
 the case of stanford speed 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.270
 it was ni for speed that was an adaptation 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.150
 to the big screen and did not have the success 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.250
 How good of a point seen from my point 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.020
 of sight did not have the success that I 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.280
 I hoped I expected more from the 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.560
 movie and other games other games have 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.220
 have been released to the big screen and not 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.980
 they have had success success but let's hope 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.190
 that this is not the exception because it is 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.590
 a game that scares you sincerely 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.269
 fear and says yes it deserves a 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.300
 adaptation to the big screen but 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:20.630
 good do you think that warner bros has 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:26.180
