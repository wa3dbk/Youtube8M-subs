00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.029
 first false priest to clean up well and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.560
 Then we hydrate with Greece it is 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.039
 left to start we go along 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.529
 leg 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.050
 then always back to the horse's head 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.609
 along one begins to go hand 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.340
 leg reported to the horse that we are going 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.969
 take his hoof then if he ever 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.100
 do not want to raise 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.750
 we saw a little bit with his shoulder 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.270
 against his to release 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.030
 weight and now it's gone 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.210
 so then we go on foot 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.960
 along the fork to remove the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.250
 bigger we do all the outside 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.719
 if ever his rooms in the middle of the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.690
 fork we go too but gently 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.850
 because it's sensitive and we end up 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.390
 the little brush and here we have a foot 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.440
 own 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.969
 now that the feet are clean on 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.409
 can go to the next step grease 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.180
 feet if your horse has feet 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.780
 blond like mine you have to use the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.549
 blonde greece 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.500
 he has black feet black greece 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.909
 in the summer when my hooves are rather 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.159
 we're going to use 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.600
 oil to moisturize and in winter if 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.100
 are wet and that the forks 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.950
 starts to rot we can spend a 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.659
 once a week tar of norway 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.130
 like that it's going to be a barrier against 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.229
 humidity we start by taking a 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.150
 little fat we pass on the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.750
 fork all the inside of the only 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.659
 we do not forget the short sides and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.390
 then the parish takes a little bit of 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.189
 fat did the outside we think 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.700
 good to do under the carcela hairs 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.619
 nuts horn 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.619
