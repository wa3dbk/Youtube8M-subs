00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.560
 The tack in heavy weather presents three difficulties. 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.269
 The first is to go up enough to the wind. 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:11.100
 In many cases, it seems impossible to close the mainsail sufficiently with the risk of capsizing. 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.000
 The second difficulty is that once facing the wind, the boat will quickly retreat, 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.370
 which will require reversing the direction of the rudders. 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.030
 The third difficulty is a significant risk of capsizing from behind 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.720
 while the boat moves back. 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.020
 So we are upwind, port tack. 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.829
 Being overpowered, it seems impossible to tuck the mainsail enough. 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.829
 We are therefore close to tight, and edge the mainsail as much as possible. 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.980
 As we are up close, we launch the tack by gently pushing 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.310
 the bar, without breaking the pace of the boat. 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.420
 It will be possible to finish tying the mainsail if necessary. 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.000
 When the jib is inflated against, it indicates that the boat is facing the wind. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.490
 It is then immediately necessary to shock the big sail. 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.920
 Immediately after, the boat retreats. 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.820
 This moment must be watched carefully. 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.880
 The front of the boat rises, it recedes on the water, and especially we feel that the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.369
 rudders tend to go to extreme positions. 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.329
 At this precise moment, it is necessary to reverse the rudders, that is to say to pull the bar. 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.810
 We will not pull the bar fully, to avoid getting the boat up, which could 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.330
 have it desalinated from behind. 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.359
 Then let the boat back and away from the wind. 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:08.020
 When the boat reaches a near-full position, the mainsail returns to 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.820
 to work although it is entirely shocked. 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.540
 The boat then stops backing up and starts moving forward. 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.440
 At this moment, you have to reverse the bar again, change sides and then resume 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.760
 the jib on the good tack, and finally we can gently tuck the grand'voile. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.780
 Here is the complete maneuver without comment.
