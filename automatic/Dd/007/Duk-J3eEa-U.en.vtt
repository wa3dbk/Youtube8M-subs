 capacitive 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.209

 brightness he has a good color rendition 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:22.520
 normal too 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:25.459
 and viewing angles makes the device work 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.239
 based on a processor with a clock frequency of 1 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.680
 thousand megahertz video processor also 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.480

 sgx531 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.060
 the amount of RAM is 512 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.860
 megabytes all together provides 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.830
 wonderful speeds 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.920
 operating systems and of course many 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:54.650
 games and applications are not top but still 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.980
 things work fine inside 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.380
 512 megabytes of memory of them certainly not 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.310
 all available to the user and not much on that 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.540
 that's enough 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.280
 thank god you can expand the volume to 32 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.040
 gigabyte using a memory card 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.269
 micro sd 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.320
 energy is provided by the battery 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.170
 capacity of 1400 milliampere hour which 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.180
 four hours talk time 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.959
 or 400 hours standby 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.390
 This is certainly not the highest rates 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.250
 but this is enough to 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.340
 enjoy phone work about 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.050
 one and a half days or two days of dependence 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.050
 from the way you load the device 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:43.180
 operating system android 2.3 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.470
 pleased with the convenience of ergonomics and 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.260
 lots of desktops on 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.850
 which can be placed swirls ki 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.880
 app and various widgets 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.450
 everything is very conveniently arranged all major 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.160
 functions 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:00.920
 handy pre-installed applications 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.610
 are present there is a rich set all 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:09.590
 for fun work and communication there 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:12.560
 social networking clients and so on in 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.959
 In general, everything is in place and even some 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.739
 There are toys and to download 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.350
 something else you can always go to google 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.530
 play and buy extra there 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.530
 applications 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.040
 music player is simple and convenient everything 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.220
 basic functions at hand 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.680
 there is also an equalizer and some 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.940
 additional effects like amplification 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.460
 bass and reverb included 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.530
 supplies there is a headset which of course 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.660
 produces not the best sound 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:52.430
 therefore, I recommend to buy something 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:55.490
 a better 3.2 megapixel camera make 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.550
 quite good shots for such a price 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.440
 categories of flash and autofocus of course 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.669
 but there are many 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.669
 various settings 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:13.190
 overall device aykyu 256 wog 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.590
 has a stylish design a nice screen and 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:20.009
 many functions work stably without 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.669
 any brakes so i will endure 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.560
 the verdict that this is a great stylish 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:29.400
 reliable communicator which I tell you 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.169
 I recommend to buy in more detail with 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.930
 device characteristics you can 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.539
