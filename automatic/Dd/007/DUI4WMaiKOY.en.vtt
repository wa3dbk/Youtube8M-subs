luck<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.840> what's<00:00:43.200> why<00:00:43.350> does<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.710> lets<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.980> fix

your<00:00:44.370> drawers<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.120> think<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.390> leads<00:00:45.539> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
your drawers and I think it leads to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.360 
your drawers and I think it leads to
just<00:00:45.870> more<00:00:46.020> fun<00:00:46.200> games<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.530> magic<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.980> it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
just more fun games of magic and it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.979 
just more fun games of magic and it
leads<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> great<00:00:47.879> limited<00:00:48.270> environment<00:00:48.570> so

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
leads to a great limited environment so

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.600 
leads to a great limited environment so
I'm<00:00:49.200> very<00:00:49.230> happy<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.829> Scryers<00:00:50.129> returning

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
it's total value you get to uses out of

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.399 
it's total value you get to uses out of
the<00:01:26.820> cards<00:01:27.150> pretty<00:01:27.479> much<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> time<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the cards pretty much all the time and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.710 
the cards pretty much all the time and
that's<00:01:29.250> why<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.700> kind<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.060> bit<00:01:30.450> over

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that's why it's kind of a bit over

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.980 
that's why it's kind of a bit over
costed<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.770> know<00:01:31.890> value<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.119> has<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.869> have

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
costed but you know value is has to have

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.749 
costed but you know value is has to have
a<00:01:34.020> cost<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.530> else<00:01:34.680> it'll<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.159> super<00:01:35.460> good

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
a cost or else it'll just be super good

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.940 
a cost or else it'll just be super good
and<00:01:36.000> I'm<00:01:36.450> speaking<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.810> value<00:01:37.200> monstrosity

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and I'm speaking of value monstrosity

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.190 
and I'm speaking of value monstrosity
the<00:01:37.979> other<00:01:38.189> big<00:01:38.610> ability<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.150> set<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.540> also

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the other big ability in the set is also

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.740 
the other big ability in the set is also
all<00:01:40.439> about<00:01:40.619> value<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.090> when<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.540> look<00:01:42.659> at

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
all about value so you when you look at

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.969 
all about value so you when you look at
monstrosity<00:01:43.200> usually<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.710> look<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
monstrosity usually you look at the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.830 
monstrosity usually you look at the
creature<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.729> already<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> good<00:01:45.479> vanilla

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
creature it's already a good vanilla

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.139 
creature it's already a good vanilla
creature<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:46.530> sometimes<00:01:47.399> not<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> villain<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
creature or sometimes not a villain it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.550 
creature or sometimes not a villain it
will<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.420> another<00:01:48.659> ability<00:01:48.899> but

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
will have another ability but

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590 
will have another ability but
monstrosity<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.340> always<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> bonus<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.240> top<00:01:51.270> of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
monstrosity is always a bonus on top of

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480 
monstrosity is always a bonus on top of
it<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.930> that's<00:01:52.259> why<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.439> monstrosity<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.220> always

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
it so that's why I monstrosity is always

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.370 
it so that's why I monstrosity is always
kind<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.729> kind<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.240> high<00:01:54.450> costed<00:01:54.990> ability

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
kind of kind of a high costed ability

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.050 
kind of kind of a high costed ability
because<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.310> creature<00:01:56.490> by<00:01:56.670> itself<00:01:56.880> is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
because the creature by itself is

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.280 
because the creature by itself is
already<00:01:57.360> good<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.780> when<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.079> pay<00:01:58.259> for

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
already good and when you pay for

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.410 
already good and when you pay for
monstrosity<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.310> get<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> great<00:01:59.820> bonus<00:02:00.030> out<00:02:00.299> of

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
monstrosity you get a great bonus out of

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.660 
monstrosity you get a great bonus out of
it<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.860> set<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.280> of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it and so you know this set because of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.429 
it and so you know this set because of
monstrosity<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.479> because<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> stow<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
monstrosity and because of the stow it

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.170 
monstrosity and because of the stow it
really<00:02:05.130> points<00:02:05.310> towards<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> set<00:02:06.000> that's

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
really points towards the set that's

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.449 
really points towards the set that's
about<00:02:06.390> value<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> long<00:02:07.229> game<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.890> I've

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
about value in the long game and I've

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.710 
about value in the long game and I've
read<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> couple<00:02:08.910> articles<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.509> looked<00:02:09.629> around

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
read a couple articles and looked around

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.150 
read a couple articles and looked around
the<00:02:09.899> way

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
the way

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.890 
the way
you<00:02:10.220> know<00:02:10.310> done<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.000> little<00:02:11.420> bit<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.690> my<00:02:11.870> own

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
you know done a little bit of my own

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.350 
you know done a little bit of my own
analysis<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.770> although<00:02:13.460> this<00:02:13.670> format<00:02:14.120> has<00:02:14.330> a

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
analysis and although this format has a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.330 
analysis and although this format has a
lot<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.690> two<00:02:15.020> drops<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.740> lot<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:15.920> common

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
lot of two drops and a lot of common

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.090 
lot of two drops and a lot of common
smaller<00:02:17.330> creatures<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:18.470> toughness<00:02:18.710> is

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
smaller creatures the toughness is

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.160 
smaller creatures the toughness is
always<00:02:19.610> higher<00:02:20.000> than<00:02:20.030> power<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.840> mean<00:02:21.140> not

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
always higher than power I mean not

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.650 
always higher than power I mean not
always<00:02:21.620> but<00:02:21.770> in<00:02:21.830> most<00:02:22.070> cases<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:23.570> know

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
always but in most cases it is you know

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.180 
always but in most cases it is you know
you<00:02:23.870> got<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.020> lot<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.200> like<00:02:24.320> one<00:02:24.560> threes<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.040> two

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
you got a lot of like one threes and two

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.040 
you got a lot of like one threes and two
threes<00:02:25.520> so<00:02:26.060> what<00:02:26.210> that<00:02:26.240> means<00:02:26.600> is<00:02:26.750> like

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
threes so what that means is like

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.690 
threes so what that means is like
although<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.560> have<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.980> play<00:02:28.130> low<00:02:28.340> drops<00:02:28.580> in

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
although you have to play low drops in

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.820 
although you have to play low drops in
this<00:02:28.820> format<00:02:29.180> there<00:02:29.930> will<00:02:30.110> be<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.290> lot<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.560> board

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
this format there will be a lot of board

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.980 
this format there will be a lot of board
stalls<00:02:31.100> so<00:02:31.460> any<00:02:31.760> format<00:02:32.150> where<00:02:32.390> though<00:02:32.510> our

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
stalls so any format where though our

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.960 
stalls so any format where though our
board<00:02:33.230> stalls<00:02:33.530> come<00:02:33.680> up<00:02:33.770> with<00:02:33.860> m14<00:02:34.370> you're

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
board stalls come up with m14 you're

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.640 
board stalls come up with m14 you're
going<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.150> be<00:02:35.360> looking<00:02:35.480> towards<00:02:35.840> evasion<00:02:36.440> and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
going to be looking towards evasion and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.130 
going to be looking towards evasion and
value<00:02:37.070> in<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.310> long<00:02:37.490> run<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.540> that's<00:02:38.870> why

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
value in the long run and so that's why

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.290 
value in the long run and so that's why
this<00:02:39.200> weekend<00:02:39.830> my<00:02:40.280> color<00:02:40.550> of<00:02:40.700> choice<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:41.060> going

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
this weekend my color of choice is going

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.590 
this weekend my color of choice is going
to<00:02:41.360> be<00:02:41.480> blue<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:42.470> blue<00:02:42.800> has<00:02:43.190> has<00:02:43.640> always<00:02:43.970> had<00:02:44.360> a

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
to be blue so blue has has always had a

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.180 
to be blue so blue has has always had a
vision<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.020> know<00:02:45.050> flying<00:02:45.410> as<00:02:45.560> blue<00:02:45.740> stain<00:02:45.980> and

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
vision you know flying as blue stain and

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.790 
vision you know flying as blue stain and
blue<00:02:46.580> has<00:02:46.760> always<00:02:47.180> had<00:02:47.300> value<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:48.320> sealed<00:02:48.590> in

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
blue has always had value in a sealed in

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.840 
blue has always had value in a sealed in
general<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.250> weekend<00:02:49.520> is<00:02:49.610> going<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.790> be

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
general this weekend is going to be

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.300 
general this weekend is going to be
sealed<00:02:50.420> as<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.630> slower<00:02:50.870> format<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:51.470> draft<00:02:51.770> so

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
sealed as a slower format that draft so

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.830 
sealed as a slower format that draft so
I<00:02:52.340> think<00:02:52.460> seal<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:53.000> going<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.210> have<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.660> better

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
I think seal is going to have the better

that's why I'm really keen for blue in

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.360 
that's why I'm really keen for blue in
this<00:03:26.300> format<00:03:26.630> in<00:03:27.170> addition<00:03:27.680> like<00:03:28.010> if<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:28.220> look

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
this format in addition like if you look

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.340 
this format in addition like if you look
around<00:03:28.459> just<00:03:28.790> like<00:03:28.940> blue<00:03:29.450> has<00:03:29.690> very<00:03:29.930> good

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
around just like blue has very good

around just like blue has very good
creatures<00:03:30.860> in<00:03:30.980> general<00:03:31.280> Nimbus<00:03:31.730> my<00:03:31.910> ad<00:03:32.120> isn't

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
creatures in general Nimbus my ad isn't

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.660 
creatures in general Nimbus my ad isn't
the<00:03:33.050> blue<00:03:33.290> bestow<00:03:33.709> creature<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.459> think

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
the blue bestow creature and I think

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.699 
the blue bestow creature and I think
it's<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.850> best<00:03:35.000> of<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.240> bunch<00:03:35.390> because

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
it's the best of the bunch because

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.350 
it's the best of the bunch because
evasion<00:03:36.709> is<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.370> most<00:03:37.520> important<00:03:37.940> thing<00:03:38.150> to

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
evasion is the most important thing to

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.360 
evasion is the most important thing to
bestow<00:03:38.720> on<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:39.050> creature<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:39.590> know<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:40.010> I

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
bestow on a creature you know and I

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.470 
bestow on a creature you know and I
think<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:40.670> very<00:03:40.790> worst<00:03:40.910> it's<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.300> three<00:03:41.450> minute

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
think the very worst it's a three minute

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.270 
think the very worst it's a three minute
to<00:03:41.780> two<00:03:41.930> flying<00:03:42.200> so<00:03:42.800> i'll<00:03:42.950> definitely<00:03:43.250> be

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
to two flying so i'll definitely be

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.710 
to two flying so i'll definitely be
picking<00:03:43.610> up<00:03:43.670> blue<00:03:43.850> this<00:03:44.000> weekend<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:44.480> i'll<00:03:44.600> be

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
picking up blue this weekend and i'll be

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.199 
picking up blue this weekend and i'll be
hoping<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.110> open<00:03:45.260> up<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.770> secondary<00:03:46.700> color<00:03:46.970> that

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
hoping to open up a secondary color that

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.720 
hoping to open up a secondary color that
has<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.420> good<00:03:47.959> amount<00:03:48.080> of<00:03:48.350> removal<00:03:48.890> probably<00:03:49.670> a

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
has a good amount of removal probably a

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.670 
has a good amount of removal probably a
black<00:03:50.000> black<00:03:50.420> has<00:03:50.660> some<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:50.959> decent<00:03:51.350> remove<00:03:51.560> of

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
black black has some a decent remove of

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.800 
black black has some a decent remove of
this<00:03:51.830> set<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.730> is<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:52.910> bit<00:03:53.180> overcast<00:03:53.600> it

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
this set it is a bit overcast it

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.020 
this set it is a bit overcast it
especially<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.320> common<00:03:54.620> removal<00:03:55.070> but<00:03:55.790> you

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
especially the common removal but you

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.430 
especially the common removal but you
know<00:03:56.120> because<00:03:56.510> this<00:03:56.630> format<00:03:57.050> should<00:03:57.260> be

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
know because this format should be

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.350 
know because this format should be
slower<00:03:57.739> with<00:03:58.040> board<00:03:58.280> stalls<00:03:58.520> over<00:03:58.940> costing

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
slower with board stalls over costing

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.810 
slower with board stalls over costing
doesn't<00:03:59.930> matter<00:04:00.080> as<00:04:00.290> much<00:04:00.320> so<00:04:01.190> yeah<00:04:01.340> blue

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
doesn't matter as much so yeah blue
