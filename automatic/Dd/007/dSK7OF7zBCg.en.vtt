00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
lot and I've been looking this up a lot

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.160 
lot and I've been looking this up a lot
but<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.800> could<00:02:29.430> not<00:02:29.550> find<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.940> way<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.480> look<00:02:30.990> at

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
but I could not find a way to look at

your eloah points so if you do know let
me<00:02:33.180> know<00:02:33.270> but<00:02:34.460> that<00:02:35.460> is<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.790> way<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
me know but that is the way that the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.890 
me know but that is the way that the
ranking<00:02:37.680> system<00:02:37.710> works<00:02:38.400> now<00:02:38.700> ways<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:39.720> could

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
ranking system works now ways you could

ranking system works now ways you could
rank<00:02:40.110> up<00:02:40.260> fast<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.980> definitely<00:02:41.580> Q<00:02:41.790> with<00:02:41.940> four

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
rank up fast is definitely Q with four

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.390 
rank up fast is definitely Q with four
of<00:02:42.270> your<00:02:42.420> friends<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:43.200> it's<00:02:44.010> better<00:02:44.220> if

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
rake up now another way you can do this

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.680 
rake up now another way you can do this
I<00:03:08.820> don't<00:03:09.300> really<00:03:09.570> it's<00:03:09.930> not<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.320> best<00:03:10.620> way<00:03:11.010> but

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
I don't really it's not the best way but

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.560 
I don't really it's not the best way but
you<00:03:12.690> definitely<00:03:12.810> can<00:03:13.170> solo<00:03:13.530> queue<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.570> try

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
and rank up that way but it's definitely

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.300 
and rank up that way but it's definitely
a<00:03:17.910> lot<00:03:17.970> easier<00:03:18.390> with<00:03:18.570> friends<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.320> everything
