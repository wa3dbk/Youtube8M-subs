00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
added traction you get you can really

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.920 
added traction you get you can really
just<00:00:25.529> rail<00:00:26.430> all<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.699> corners<00:00:27.150> just<00:00:27.689> because

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
just rail all the corners just because

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.689 
just rail all the corners just because
it's<00:00:28.080> bigger<00:00:28.289> weary<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:28.800> more<00:00:29.070> surface<00:00:29.490> area

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
it's bigger weary but more surface area

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.170 
it's bigger weary but more surface area
now<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> 29<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.590> feel<00:00:31.740> more<00:00:32.090> able<00:00:33.090> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
the terrain again with the bigger wheel

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.860 
the terrain again with the bigger wheel
it<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.960> feels<00:01:25.200> really<00:01:25.770> stable

the bike weight has reduced by over 300

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.700 
the bike weight has reduced by over 300
grams<00:01:31.260> but<00:01:31.850> stiffnesses<00:01:32.850> stay<00:01:33.180> there<00:01:33.480> so<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
grams but stiffnesses stay there so you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.230 
grams but stiffnesses stay there so you
know<00:01:34.800> when<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.040> power<00:01:35.310> out<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.550> saddle<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
know when you power out a saddle the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.170 
know when you power out a saddle the
bike<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.480> really<00:01:37.040> nimble<00:01:38.060> acceleration<00:01:39.060> is
