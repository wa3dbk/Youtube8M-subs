away<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.630> good<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.229> map

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
away and it is really good on this map

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.069 
away and it is really good on this map
because<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.340> keep<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.090> back<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.360> forth<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
because I keep going back and forth and

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.740 
because I keep going back and forth and
those<00:01:52.799> they'll<00:01:53.159> spawn<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.820> these<00:01:54.180> two<00:01:54.720> areas

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
those they'll spawn in these two areas

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.560 
those they'll spawn in these two areas
it'll<00:01:55.710> go<00:01:55.860> back<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.250> forth<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.299> keep

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
it'll go back and forth in and I keep

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.109 
it'll go back and forth in and I keep
going<00:01:57.780> back<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.140> forth<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:59.399> check<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.939> see<00:01:59.969> if

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
going back and forth to check to see if

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.030

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.750 
stuff like that so a big part about
staying<00:02:54.990> alive<00:02:55.140> in<00:02:55.470> my<00:02:55.590> warfare<00:02:56.010> 3<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.490> being

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
staying alive in my warfare 3 is being

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.060

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
able to go around the outside of maps

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.190 
able to go around the outside of maps
because<00:02:59.520> if<00:03:00.030> you're<00:03:00.180> not<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.660> great<00:03:00.900> player

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
because if you're not the great player

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.050 
because if you're not the great player
then<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.190> won't<00:03:02.340> be<00:03:02.400> able<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.670> win<00:03:02.760> as<00:03:02.940> many

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
then you won't be able to win as many

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.320 
then you won't be able to win as many
gunfights<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.750> flanking<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> very<00:03:04.860> good

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
gunfights and flanking is a very good

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.390 
gunfights and flanking is a very good
technique<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.360> get<00:03:06.690> kills<00:03:06.960> because<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.250> enemy
