00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.770
 and of course 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.410
 welcome to a video of baron field 4 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.410
 I am world 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.710
 is playing live a game of 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.199
 eradication on the taste map and what 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.029
 which I hope will be the first of many 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.240
 these chapters for this series that you 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.240
 want to call 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.890
 shoot when it's falling this is 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.210
 violate the Treaty of Geneva 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.060
 I want to call it play the fuck and I do not know 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.640
 activate the idea is that we're going to play 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.440
 goal of the game easier I walk in 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.120
 everything else and almost likes in baron 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.650
 field because then those who like 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.739
 of transistors and it's hard to do two 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.160
 things at once but I will try to 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.870
 play the goal live in the game and 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.250
 you later in the comments are going to 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.840
 correct all the things that you 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.030
 have added wrong for later 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.490
 talk and say do a little analysis 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.600
 if they are right then what 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.100
 I want to do is that in the next video 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.510
 I'm going to do a little analysis of the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.010
 things that you obviously say here 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.330
 I'm going to be editing a bit because 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.330
 these apples and chasms 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.510
 but here for example I'm 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.390
 is saying 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.960
 ok I go with my engineer class because 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.980
 there are many vehicles here 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.870
 I'm trying to find the enemies 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.940
 here and the reason is because I'm not 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.230
 really close to the pump because no 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.880
 I can go help the colleagues in the 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.130
 objective but what I can do is 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.330
 see them fall to my enemies around here 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.980
 because the zone is more or less 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.170
 where they fall on their parachutes and 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.660
 they try to get half a vein and go 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.660
 Then at least avoid 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.710
 when you have a thread hit hit market 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.290
 certainly when they ride with carbines or 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.510
 with engineer weapons and even 2 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.740
 km order 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.740
 the urns without desire 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.100
 there is good, this way comes out 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.390
 be very careful with studies 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.960
 long distance because with him there is no 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.960
 so much precision 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.650
 where is the bomb keep falling by 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.650
 near here 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.930
 I stay here because again not 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.970
 I'm near the pump I prefer the semi 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.970
 team manages to take it here I would be 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:41.390
 what they caught 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.390
 the sky in the sky someone shooting 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.950
 until I have the couple is 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.620
 shooting up 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.150
 that was that there is no informed 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.480
 to visit our service point or 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.480
 see them 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.500
 there 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.430
 I'm going to help this tank 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.390
 cuckoo 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.390
 and my god 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.549
 I need a doctor 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.440
 let's go doctor 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.790
 you are the bomb I will die because this bastard 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.790
 he wanted to help 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.599
 12 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.810
 two 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.350
 in this very clear 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.430
 only three 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.069
 written evolution 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.629
 a little crazy this is a little crazy and 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.629
 I'm fried, I'm fried 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.620
 you would have done this and the other good 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.909
 I managed to kill four, we're just going to 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.370
 I do not reprocess vehicles 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.790
 take up the antiaircraft but it's very 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.260
 no and I do not have anybody either 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.269
 second decision that is going to take I'm going to 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.080
 look for another group where there are more 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.080
 players 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.209
 with these 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.070
 in the end I did not change 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.070
 I'm going to go with this, I said 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.600
 good 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.150
 near the pump was not for that 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.880
 for four before appearing in the 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.830
 mates was I do not know the best thing to do 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.940
 for 2003 over here 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.390
 or 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.620
 in unemployment 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.620
 useless mate no 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.840
 and I'm almost shouted I have no ear today no 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.659
 I do not have to do 

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:11.159
 remember them the intention of the series 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.479
 that you put me down there 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.669
 comments they would have made in 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.919
 different circumstances and where else 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.080
 people agree with that next 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.379
 video we are going to make is profits 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.590
 everyone can criticize everything from where 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:27.600
 exposes or even everything he does 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.410
 I'm with a carbine up here 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.410
 It seems like it's a bad idea 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:42.460
 so it may be in a 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.200
 dangerous record dan I am very 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.600
 cautious especially because I step 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.550
 seeing the map map 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.860
 to try to catch them all 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.050
 falling the devil 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.000
 and here it came we do not have near then 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.969
 obviously in this time he has not left 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.710
 of 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:02.210
 show yourself where you are 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.210
 this will continue to be me 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.290
 the bombs that try to help 70 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.470
 meters now there is no game 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.940
 silvino missile 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.530
 now you do not have to be exactly 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.210
 stuck to the pump type because 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.220
 obviously all the micro knows where 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.320
 goes 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.320
 falling then if you do not take it 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.370
 and the commanders do their job 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.169
 and careful that they all fall by I'm going to 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:40.079
 try to clear the cons or not 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:43.029
 I did not like anything 

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:45.399
 well I think you could not do anything 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:46.959
 because I had not seen that vehicle until 

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:49.070
 that I did not have in front and then not 

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:52.720
 could I get back 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.720
 I am born again with my classmates 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.450
 from behind for on the other hand 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:06.080
 but what I told them, they arranged with the 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:09.710
 comrades is dangerous because 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.900
 because the one before was invulnerable 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.050
 to death for a little while but here 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.970
 now no longer 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.360
 now one is born and you are practically born to 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.360
 death 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.940
 and we won 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.520
 we want 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.020
 well it was a very fast game already 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.270
 you know put the comments that you 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.480
 What they would have done 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:40.740
 change it for the next game of 

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.740
 he wins and until next time
