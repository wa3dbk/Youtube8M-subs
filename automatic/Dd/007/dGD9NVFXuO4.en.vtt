00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
a completion there and they got the ball

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.170 
a completion there and they got the ball
good<00:00:19.680> field<00:00:19.920> position<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.090> so

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
good field position but it was just so

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.220 
good field position but it was just so

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
against my responsibility pallys we

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.410 
against my responsibility pallys we
tackle<00:00:29.880> well<00:00:30.000> up<00:00:31.610> and<00:00:32.610> defense<00:00:32.969> again<00:00:33.270> we

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
really disappointing is the way that the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650 
really disappointing is the way that the
last<00:00:40.770> couple<00:00:40.980> games<00:00:41.160> gurgaon's<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.360> need<00:00:42.540> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
last couple games gurgaon's that need to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.900 
last couple games gurgaon's that need to

effects<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:46.129> think<00:00:47.129> his<00:00:47.910> parents<00:00:48.090> say<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.570> we

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
effects I think his parents say that we

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.380 
effects I think his parents say that we
were<00:00:48.989> evaluating<00:00:49.530> every<00:00:50.129> every<00:00:50.760> component<00:00:51.090> of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
were evaluating every every component of

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.799 
were evaluating every every component of
it<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:53.820> know<00:00:53.910> every<00:00:54.149> step<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> way<00:00:54.570> out

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it you know every step of the way out

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.010 
it you know every step of the way out
like<00:00:55.199> there's<00:00:55.379> any<00:00:55.500> question<00:00:55.680> about<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:57.020> so

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
like there's any question about it so

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.630 
like there's any question about it so
