00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
so I'm back for the first time since I

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.269 
so I'm back for the first time since I
showed<00:00:02.520> you<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.620> mock-up<00:00:04.620> heads<00:00:04.890> and

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
showed you the mock-up heads and

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.980 
showed you the mock-up heads and
everything<00:00:05.460> like<00:00:05.730> that<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.480> realized<00:00:06.839> that

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
everything like that and I realized that

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.430 
everything like that and I realized that
did<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.259> didn't<00:00:07.740> show<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.429> mock-up<00:00:09.440> body

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
did I didn't show you a mock-up body

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.640 
did I didn't show you a mock-up body
pattern<00:00:11.099> for<00:00:11.490> Ralphie<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.139> what

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
pattern for Ralphie so this is what

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.450 
pattern for Ralphie so this is what
Ralphie's<00:00:14.099> body<00:00:14.460> was<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.089> look<00:00:15.240> like

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
Ralphie's body was going to look like

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.800 
Ralphie's body was going to look like
for<00:00:17.460> some<00:00:17.609> reason<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.090> mock-up<00:00:18.359> like

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
for some reason with this mock-up like

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.240 
for some reason with this mock-up like
the<00:00:18.990> way<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.109> patterned<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.890> should<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.220> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the way I patterned it it should have a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.689 
the way I patterned it it should have a
little<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.609> pooch<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.289> stomach<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.460> it

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
looks like from the front and then you

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.760 
looks like from the front and then you
turn<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.399> around<00:00:50.579> okay<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.930> white<00:00:52.260> this

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
turn it around okay now the white this

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.920 
turn it around okay now the white this
is<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.100> poly<00:00:53.340> foam<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> had<00:00:54.780> laying

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
is the poly foam that I had laying

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.959 
is the poly foam that I had laying
around<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.739> reason<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> inclusion<00:00:56.699> of

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
around the reason for the inclusion of

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.610 
around the reason for the inclusion of
the<00:00:57.059> poly<00:00:57.239> foam<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.899> I've<00:00:58.079> wanted<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the poly foam is that I've wanted the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.490 
the poly foam is that I've wanted the
back<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> little<00:00:59.940> bit<00:01:00.090> thicker<00:01:00.449> from<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
back to be a little bit thicker from the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.200 
back to be a little bit thicker from the
side<00:01:01.680> profile<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.399> wanted<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> look<00:01:03.030> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
side profile I wanted it to look a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.119 
side profile I wanted it to look a
little<00:01:03.420> thicker<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.260> there<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
little thicker so there you can see the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.399 
little thicker so there you can see the
little<00:01:05.339> pooch<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:06.030> there<00:01:06.210> boochi<00:01:07.140> boochi

the<00:01:17.610> body<00:01:17.759> shape<00:01:18.450> pattern<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.960> here<00:01:21.960> is

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
the body shape pattern and here is

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.390 
the body shape pattern and here is
Ralphie's<00:01:24.210> head<00:01:24.560> completed<00:01:25.590> well<00:01:26.220> not

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
Ralphie's head completed well not

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.420 
Ralphie's head completed well not
fleeced<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.630> furred<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:29.189> know<00:01:29.280> what<00:01:29.400> I

so<00:01:30.180> again<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> back<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.860> took<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
so again like what the back I took a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.010 
so again like what the back I took a
little<00:01:32.490> bit<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.700> poly<00:01:32.880> foam<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> built<00:01:33.780> up

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
little bit of poly foam and I built up

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
little bit of poly foam and I built up
the<00:01:34.290> back<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> head<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.820> wanted<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the back of the head because I wanted to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.969 
the back of the head because I wanted to
stand<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> little<00:01:36.900> more<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> eyes

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
stand up a little more so that the eyes

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.399 
stand up a little more so that the eyes
would<00:01:38.460> kind<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.759> look<00:01:38.909> right<00:01:39.320> when<00:01:40.320> they

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
would kind of look right when they

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.330 
would kind of look right when they
pointed<00:01:40.710> him<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:40.939> so<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:43.049> what<00:01:43.500> Ralphie

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
pointed him out so that is what Ralphie

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.719 
pointed him out so that is what Ralphie
ended<00:01:44.729> up<00:01:44.850> looking<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.520> see

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
ended up looking like and you can see

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.270 
ended up looking like and you can see
his<00:01:48.509> mouth<00:01:48.689> plate<00:01:49.049> everything<00:01:49.649> glued<00:01:50.070> in

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
his mouth plate everything glued in

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.510 
his mouth plate everything glued in
there<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:51.619> there's<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> poly<00:01:52.950> foam<00:01:53.040> as

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
there and there's the poly foam as

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.460 
there and there's the poly foam as
opposed<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.090> reticulated<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.020> there's

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
opposed to the reticulated and there's

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
opposed to the reticulated and there's
this<00:01:55.619> tongue<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.189> haven't<00:01:56.670> decided<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.119> this

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
this tongue I haven't decided on this

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.499 
this tongue I haven't decided on this
tongue<00:01:57.509> yet<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.469> um<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.149> it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
tongue yet but um I think I like it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.510 
tongue yet but um I think I like it
I<00:02:00.540> might<00:02:01.259> do<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> little<00:02:01.500> revision<00:02:02.070> before<00:02:02.490> I

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I might do a little revision before I
