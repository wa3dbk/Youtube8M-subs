00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
round mock draft first-round pick 19 I

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.560 
round mock draft first-round pick 19 I
have<00:00:53.010> Jonathan<00:00:53.520> Cooper<00:00:53.730> falling<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
have Jonathan Cooper falling to the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.910 
have Jonathan Cooper falling to the
Giants<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.379> would<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.590> an<00:00:55.680> ideal

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
Giants and this would be an ideal

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.250 
Giants and this would be an ideal
selection<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:56.969> Cooper<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> lot<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
selection I like Cooper a lot this is a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.720 
selection I like Cooper a lot this is a
guy<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.649> can't<00:00:58.710> give<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.160> versatility

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
guy that can't give you that versatility

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.880 
guy that can't give you that versatility
can<00:01:00.090> also<00:01:00.270> line<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.750> at<00:01:00.930> center<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.770> really

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
can also line up at center so you really

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.280 
can also line up at center so you really
get<00:01:02.100> two<00:01:02.340> positions<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.300> player<00:01:03.600> Cooper

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
get two positions with one player Cooper

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.960 
get two positions with one player Cooper
would<00:01:04.470> make<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> lot<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.010> sense<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> Giants

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
would make a lot of sense for the Giants

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
would make a lot of sense for the Giants
at<00:01:06.090> number<00:01:06.330> 19

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
look at what he brings to the table

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.030 
look at what he brings to the table
speed<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.420> athleticism<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.320> former<00:01:19.830> safety

safety<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.780> does<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.439> speed<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
athleticism to get around the edge I

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.180 
athleticism to get around the edge I
think<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.110> will<00:01:28.200> fit<00:01:28.380> nicely<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:29.039> that

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190

seven round mock draft again depth is

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.670 
seven round mock draft again depth is
the<00:03:21.390> key<00:03:21.570> for<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.870> Giants<00:03:22.200> they<00:03:22.260> don't<00:03:22.470> have<00:03:22.650> a

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
the key for the Giants they don't have a

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.680 
the key for the Giants they don't have a
lot<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:22.980> holes<00:03:23.310> but<00:03:23.490> they<00:03:23.610> do<00:03:23.670> have<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.270> lack<00:03:24.660> of

lot of holes but they do have a lack of
depth<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.680> think<00:03:25.920> guys<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.550> Jonathan

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
depth and I think guys like Jonathan

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.670 
depth and I think guys like Jonathan
Cooper<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.420> Alec<00:03:27.690> Ogletree<00:03:27.870> warrants

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
Cooper and Alec Ogletree warrants

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.410 
Cooper and Alec Ogletree warrants
starting<00:03:28.980> positions<00:03:29.370> from<00:03:29.490> day<00:03:29.730> one<00:03:30.030> there's

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
starting positions from day one there's

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.060 
starting positions from day one there's
that<00:03:30.690> talented<00:03:31.230> but<00:03:31.380> everywhere<00:03:31.740> else<00:03:31.800> I

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
that talented but everywhere else I

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.590 
that talented but everywhere else I
think<00:03:32.400> these<00:03:32.550> are<00:03:32.610> guys<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:32.940> can<00:03:33.300> contribute

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
think these are guys that can contribute

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.630 
think these are guys that can contribute
on<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.170> team<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.830> is<00:03:34.860> ready<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.280> make<00:03:35.520> a<00:03:35.550> run
