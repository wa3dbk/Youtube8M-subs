00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello very good everyone I'm Juan with 94 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.330
 how are you welcome to a new 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.890
 video a new tutorial tomahawk xaquín 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.769
 black ops 2 in the previous black ops 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.440
 I made one on many maps or I'll leave it 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.470
 in the description the list and here good 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.199
 I've been discovering new places 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.449
 I discovered them in private and that 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.640
 and we're going to start with the first one 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.400
 a very attentive vale we put ourselves in that 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.680
 wooden board where I have thrown the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.140
 ballistic knife we ​​throw up 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.270
 as high as we can and finally 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.250
 we hit the enemy and now let's see 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.770
 by the opposite camera to see what he sees 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.020
 enemy there we see that a rebound bounced 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.079
 imagined not this would be domain would have 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.050
 is it supposed to be a good team or not 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.280
 there would be six people taking the flag 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.219
 and there would be a lot more 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.590
 probability that if there is one and good 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.280
 here it is for the flag should there be 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.899
 to put in between the railing 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.990
 okay it's a bit more difficult but 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.270
 one 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.090
 many times the ropes of the 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.620
 exact site and finally right now 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.020
 let's see from the opposite camera and 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.590
 we see it mortal death chamber 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.260
 deadly change and good now for 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.360
 from the other side, bird, we're worth 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.460
 here next to the greenhouse and by 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.340
 above the background tree a little bit 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.080
 up agreement and finally here 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.380
 we see the death chamber as it 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.329
 right 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.770
 full if we have a little more water 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.170
 I would bounce with the car towards 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.490
 up well now from here attentive 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.520
 we take that corner of the shooter 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.939
 ballistic and we aim the highest at 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.579
 Garcia ce the top is difficult 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.079
 keep you can go a little bit towards the 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.880
 right left but as I say there is 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.619
 people eating the flag that is 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.530
 there is a very high probability of hitting 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.259
 of hitting with the tomahawk not here what 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.810
 curious and right I also want to give 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.920
 thank you very much to ball is worth or leave 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.880

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.670
 helped with the tutorial there we see 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.640
 as the commune throws impressive ball 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.470
 and well I hope you liked to give 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.179

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.220
 when you see that you have liked 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.739

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.940
