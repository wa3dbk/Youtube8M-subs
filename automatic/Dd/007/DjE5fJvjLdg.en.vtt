 solve this big question tasks plus 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.480
 offering the simulation exam of 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.570
 admission antioquia university 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.970
 the simulation exam of admission idea is 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.699
 composed of two evaluations or drills 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.250
 the simulation of logical reasoning and the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.910
 simulation of reading comprehension 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.880
 Each simulation consists of 40 questions from 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.890
 multiple choice single answer one 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.100
 90-minute time limit for 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.310
 solve the test the possibility of 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.990
 do the drill up to twice and one 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.780
 video feedback of the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.090
 questions that do not answer correctly 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.670

 standard where 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.280
 You will conduct a simulation of the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.920
 logical reasoning and a simulation of 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.170
 reading comprehension exam every 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.149
 simulacrum offers feedback on 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.460
 video of the questions that you do not answer 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.850
 correctly and you have the possibility of

 definitively you have access to 80 videos of 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.349
 Solved exercises and 80 questions 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.060
 Qualifiable all in one platform
