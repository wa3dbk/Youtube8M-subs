tell me about zinc here this is a
special<00:05:34.710> special<00:05:35.639> technology<00:05:36.360> zero<00:05:36.780> ink<00:05:37.080> so

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
special special technology zero ink so

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.409 
special special technology zero ink so
because<00:05:37.800> all<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:38.039> technologies<00:05:38.880> inside

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
because all the technologies inside

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.510 
because all the technologies inside
inside<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.139> paper<00:05:40.409> or<00:05:40.800> let's<00:05:41.070> say<00:05:41.190> inside

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
inside the paper or let's say inside

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.279 
inside the paper or let's say inside
film<00:05:41.849> you<00:05:42.090> know<00:05:42.120> this<00:05:42.360> is<00:05:42.479> a<00:05:42.510> you<00:05:42.840> know<00:05:42.960> if<00:05:43.169> you

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
film you know this is a you know if you

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.080 
film you know this is a you know if you
compare<00:05:43.680> what<00:05:43.830> we've<00:05:43.949> done<00:05:44.190> in<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.669> old<00:05:44.820> days

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
compare what we've done in the old days

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.570 
compare what we've done in the old days
there's<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.199> evolution<00:05:46.710> is<00:05:46.830> inside<00:05:47.280> these

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
there's the evolution is inside these

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.450 
there's the evolution is inside these
part<00:05:48.360> down<00:05:48.630> here<00:05:48.659> and<00:05:49.229> right<00:05:49.380> in<00:05:49.620> your<00:05:49.710> bag

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
part down here and right in your bag

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.189 
part down here and right in your bag
layers<00:05:50.909> yes<00:05:51.210> there's<00:05:51.449> something<00:05:51.930> there

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
layers yes there's something there

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.529 
layers yes there's something there
exactly<00:05:52.949> and<00:05:53.159> it<00:05:53.280> gets<00:05:53.610> pressed<00:05:54.000> into<00:05:54.300> these

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
exactly and it gets pressed into these

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.390 
exactly and it gets pressed into these
different<00:05:55.139> layers<00:05:55.500> here<00:05:55.919> and<00:05:56.070> is<00:05:56.190> how<00:05:56.340> the

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
different layers here and is how the

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.040 
different layers here and is how the
picture<00:05:56.760> developers<00:05:57.210> chemicals<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:57.960> now

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
picture developers chemicals and now

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.839 
picture developers chemicals and now
here<00:05:58.229> it's<00:05:58.320> all<00:05:58.560> inside<00:05:58.919> a<00:05:58.979> paper<00:05:59.250> so<00:05:59.669> the
