if<00:01:26.050> you<00:01:26.140> can<00:01:26.350> I<00:01:26.880> would<00:01:27.880> think

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.790 

we've<00:01:45.090> seen<00:01:45.330> zombies<00:01:45.930> right<00:01:46.230> we<00:01:46.410> haven't<00:01:46.530> seen

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
we've seen zombies right we haven't seen

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.150 
we've seen zombies right we haven't seen
vampires<00:01:47.990> werewolves<00:01:48.990> right<00:01:49.260> now<00:01:49.470> he's<00:01:49.860> going

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
vampires werewolves right now he's going

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.620 
vampires werewolves right now he's going
to<00:01:50.220> go<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.790> expected<00:01:53.210> but<00:01:54.210> maybe<00:01:54.360> that's<00:01:54.540> not

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
to go as expected but maybe that's not

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.830 
to go as expected but maybe that's not
so<00:01:54.810> bad<00:01:55.430> he's<00:01:56.430> not<00:01:56.460> doing<00:01:56.880> anything<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.720> put

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
so bad he's not doing anything to put

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.600 
so bad he's not doing anything to put
pressure<00:01:58.080> on<00:01:58.320> us

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.400 

and<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:07.330> just<00:02:07.390> means<00:02:07.690> he<00:02:07.990> doesn't<00:02:08.140> have<00:02:08.380> the

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
and it just means he doesn't have the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.390 
and it just means he doesn't have the
removal<00:02:08.890> for<00:02:09.240> something<00:02:10.240> more<00:02:10.950> impressive<00:02:11.950> we
