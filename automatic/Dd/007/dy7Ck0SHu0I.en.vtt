00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.349
 memorable he read the book yet not what 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.810
 he has at home because I do not have almost everything 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.140
 read but let me tell you it's a book 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.930
 that inspires her a lot in the way that 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.940
 He has expressed the things that they say 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.300
 I think we all have to buy it and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.610

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.120
 what would 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:51.290
 incredible and why 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.850

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.649

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.239

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.239

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.700
 cute cute pretty family 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.270
 of theme food is a boom in this 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.820
 moment 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.270
 is that you do not know but I was born in 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.270
 cañete 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.100
 I was born for you what happens 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.880
 with the Cubans here in Miami more 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.350
 the accent that we are going to do 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.350
 There fascinates me 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.950
 but for me I said it in there makes a 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.340
 minute 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.670
 but I carry it in my heart and it's not 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.490
 I have great friends in Peru 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.920
 for many years and for Peru I met 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.100
 Peru when nobody knew Peru because the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.060
 Peruvian had something that knew Europe 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.140
 He came to the United States but he 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.590
 ica 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.200
 for the jungle and quito I know peru 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.990
 like Cubans and like Cubans like 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.000
 the good Peruvians and let me tell you is 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.860
 a great country is a super country 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.230
 hospitable 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:15.290
 and the food you have to say you sorry 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.110
 I knew Peru when in very old times 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.720
 difficult that the egg had been caught 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.640
 the chicken had been caught and with everything and 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.500
 that brought out some spectacular meals 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.450
 because the Peruvian has a kitchen that 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.840
 It is the indigenous that of Peru and has everything 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.930
 what is European desserts and I 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.750
 fascinates but seeks to know machu picchu 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.330

 train a road by cañete and it's very 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.140
 interesting because he's using the 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.209
 people from there in the area and they are 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.870

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.560

 country and I travel a lot and I really 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.730
