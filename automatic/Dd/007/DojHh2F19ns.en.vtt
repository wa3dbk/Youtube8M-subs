00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.390
Can I ask you something?

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.520
I keep feeling like there's someone here.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.330
I can feel a presence.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.000
Sometimes I look behind but there's no-one there.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.570
It won't go away.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.240

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.170

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.210

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.140

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.640
1

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.080
I'm kablamo!

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.610
Okay, Omame, here.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.350
Yeah?
Okay, Omame, here.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.150
Roll it.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.920
Really?!
Roll it.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.280
Ok, come on!

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.900
Huh? What's that?

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.730
What is this?

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.700
You pull them out one at a time.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.980
Easy, right?

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.280
Okay, take a seat.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.310
Are you an idiot?

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.450
What is this even?

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.920
It's surprisingly...

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.120
It's not so bad pulling them one by one.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.590
This is so stupid.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.790
What?

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.330
It's just silly.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.230
Doesn't it hurt?

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.970
Yeah it hurts.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.880
Should this make me sleepy?

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.040
No!

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.010
Should we do this then?

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.150
This is better than tweezers!

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.290
Okay Megwin, I'll do it on 3, 2, 1.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.360

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.830
2

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.370
Dahara, you can go home now.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.530
Oh, are you leaving?

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.500
Yeah, Megwin, sorry but

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.540
I'm sleepy so I'm going home.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.980
Good luck Megwin.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.040
Megwin, you can do it!

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.380
Thank you.
Megwin, you can do it!

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.180
Don't lose!

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.250
How was the hair pulling?

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.580
We did a pretty good job.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.190
Wow, it's smooth!

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.820
Yeah.
Wow, it's smooth!
