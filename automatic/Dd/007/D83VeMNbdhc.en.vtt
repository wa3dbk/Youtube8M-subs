00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.580 

when<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:16.370> came<00:01:16.640> over<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:16.970> box<00:01:17.590> to

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
when this came over the box to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.410 
when this came over the box to
secondhand<00:01:19.210> else

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.990 

the<00:01:23.420> action<00:01:23.840> was<00:01:23.930> very<00:01:24.260> very<00:01:24.380> high<00:01:24.940> so<00:01:25.940> I've

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
the action was very very high so I've

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.140 
the action was very very high so I've
taken<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.330> action<00:01:26.630> write<00:01:26.780> down<00:01:28.360> only<00:01:34.150> my

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
taken the action write down only my

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.170 
taken the action write down only my
magnitude<00:01:35.600> just<00:01:36.490> don't<00:01:37.490> get<00:01:37.640> settle<00:01:38.030> at<00:01:38.150> the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
magnitude just don't get settle at the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:02:14.820 
magnitude just don't get settle at the
moment<00:02:06.280> into<00:02:07.280> my<00:02:07.550> normal<00:02:07.610> bass<00:02:08.149> amp<00:02:09.190> which<00:02:10.190> is

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.590 

basically<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.950> that's<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.519> virtually<00:02:20.300> flat

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
basically and that's it virtually flat

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.410 
basically and that's it virtually flat
with<00:02:21.290> none<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.739> filters<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:25.550> settings

i've<00:02:26.570> got<00:02:26.810> on<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:28.180> guitar<00:02:29.180> preamp<00:02:29.660> are<00:02:32.380> about

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
i've got on the guitar preamp are about

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.610 
i've got on the guitar preamp are about
50%<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.459> left<00:02:37.459> on<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.730> shape<00:02:38.620> slightly

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
50% to the left on the shape slightly

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.590 
50% to the left on the shape slightly
right<00:02:39.980> on<00:02:40.160> trouble<00:02:40.519> or<00:02:40.640> slightly<00:02:41.090> more<00:02:41.209> right

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
right on trouble or slightly more right

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.780 
right on trouble or slightly more right
on<00:02:41.630> mid<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.800> slightly<00:02:43.130> back<00:02:43.459> on<00:02:44.140> base<00:02:45.140> and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:03:18.210 

just<00:02:49.780> turn<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.349> you<00:02:50.409> sort<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.680> 50%<00:02:51.280> volume

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.420 

there's<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.300> really<00:03:19.870> nice<00:03:20.020> rounded<00:03:21.180> sound<00:03:23.340> if<00:03:24.340> I

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
there's a really nice rounded sound if I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:04:16.349 
there's a really nice rounded sound if I
take<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.730> phase<00:03:26.880> difference

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:25.750 

back<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.389> bit<00:04:17.630> so<00:04:18.130> very<00:04:19.130> very<00:04:19.250> nice<00:04:24.610> it's<00:04:25.610> also

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
back a bit so very very nice it's also

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:34.629 
back a bit so very very nice it's also
got<00:04:30.700> quite<00:04:31.700> useful<00:04:32.530> DLL<00:04:33.530> on<00:04:33.860> there<00:04:34.250> as<00:04:34.400> well<00:04:34.580> as

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
got quite useful DLL on there as well as

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.960 
got quite useful DLL on there as well as
a<00:04:34.730> Jack<00:04:34.910> output<00:04:35.419> so<00:04:36.230> you<00:04:36.290> can<00:04:36.590> plug<00:04:36.970> straight

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
a Jack output so you can plug straight

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.210 
a Jack output so you can plug straight
in
