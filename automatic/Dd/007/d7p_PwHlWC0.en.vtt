 tell you about this coming back with

 you probably already have it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.020
 there will be something for everyone 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.719
 on the other hand we get to hold on

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.379
 to talk about it again 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.670
 this is said and then other small 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.530
 news that you are told hydra while at 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.379
 long weeks and months ahead we 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.350
 will begin to dive into this lake you 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.570
 this ifa with one of the major themes 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.880
 is one of the big news of the 2012 ifa 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.170
 this is the google tv that arrive and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.170
 especially at the manufacturer sony 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.470
 discover the innovations of ifa with 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.470
 toshiba and the ultrabook 840 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.600
 so googletv and ben that's it 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:39.319
 it's this tiny box here behind 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.850
 we kind of little decoder and then 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.670
 this big remote big Thursday 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.290
 because 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.430
 finally in relation to her is 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.420
 almost as big as the case 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.100
 great but must say that he 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.119
 you still have to have a lot of 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.580
 features that's why she 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.520
 is pretty big his mouse integrated into 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.630
 does that's the touchpad that has 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.220
 obviously it's a remote from 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.259
 television and then he's a little 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.390
 keyboard behind because the purpose of the game 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.890
 is to go on the internet that is so 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.810
 the question we can ask ourselves 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.610
 it serves to have the whole universe 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.020
 google and internet on his telly because 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.190
 it makes you realize that surfing 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.440
 on the internet it is not necessarily very 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.660
 natural but that said the video 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.890
 today is at the heart of the web and the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.480
 saying to look at all the 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.730
 videos we watch on his computer 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.060
 on his TV it has a meaning exactly 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.880
 then five activists to arrive but 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.799
 now sony has a real speech a 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.110
 true explanation give us on what 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.250
 serves the ltv cup in a very simple way 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.170
 you have google chrome 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.019
 so the browser the famous browser 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.250
 google fully available 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.790
 all these features are 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.950
 available 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.220
 and this time so it opens up the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.540
 internet doors with a browser 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.620
 really adapted to the internet too 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.040
 powerful that you can see it on 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.780
 your pc 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.640
 so that's the first point so with 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.840
 the mouse the mouse glare and that's for 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.910
 so we have adapted the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.640
 remote control so the remote 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.760
 we wanted it to navigate 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.260
 with a touchpad to point the mouse 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.480
 as efficiently as possible 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.420
 and then for the searches we go back 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.030
 the remote control which duplex with 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.500
 backside an azerty keyboard that allows 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.420
 type these searches as on a 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.440
 classic keyboard so this is where 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.970
 it already brings two elements 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.079
 improvement over a TV 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.940
 usual connected the second point of 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.130
 change is the opening towards the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.900
 world of android apps 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.280
 so here we are we are con we 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.230
 are at the beginning of the history of 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.720
 applications not mobile them 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.269
 home apps some 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.250
 are going to be transferred from the mobile world to 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.790
 world of the house because they have a 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.349
 for example for example sense for 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.930
 mapping service for 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.030
 miscellaneous information services and 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.310
 various via the yellow pages for the site 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.480
 and that one of the best known is that 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.489
 can be very easily carried away it is 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.870
 an interest now I think he's going 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.579
 have to imagine what is done 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.689
 today in his living room and that 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.090
 could do better 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.069
 thanks to a TV connected to 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.530
 applications now she comes in 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.569
 effect in France installed television park 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.639
 plate has also evolved a lot since 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.930
 now there are 80% of French homes 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.329
 who have a flat TV 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.989
 so it seemed to us opportune 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.760
 not to revive a google tv in 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.549
 as such and but rather to imagine 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.349
 a box that can be attached to its 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.039
 many such is already installed at 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.039
 homes in French homes 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.330
 so here for the google tv version 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.039
 sony change of scenery there are others 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.020
 builders who are also 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.400
 google tv french yes to samsung 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.970
 and then also looked behind me 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.160
 behind us lg lg who proposes a 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.930
 googletv but with this particularity 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.580
 Jerome is that there is no case 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.979
 google in any case all the intelligence 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.050
 from google and so the processors and c 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.849
 is in the TV more need of 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.889
 housings there is a real TV there 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.940
 no longer a box like this one 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.139
 says a small box that can plug 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.639
 on a TV and then another 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.539
 particularity the remote control and that's it 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.680
 the remote control 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.780
 there you do not have 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.160
 in fact no mouse you do not have any 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.940
 touchpad was going to drive us 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.710
 directly transform the mouse into 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.490
 makes a little arrow that will appear 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.440
 on the television 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.110
 a bit like you know the wiimote of the 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.240
 nintendo wii simply you go 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.250
 pointing the remote control at your 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.750
 telly have a slider that will follow you 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.270
 it's very convenient for surfing by 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.860
 example to fill in text fields 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.020
 that's the rest we find the same 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.250
 thing a little keyboard essential good 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.289
 it comes out when and at what price 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.330
 so what about google tv 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.889
 sony version low it arrives late september 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.470
 to less than 100 euros on the other hand for 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.060
 that of lg and well no he will have to 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.130
 wait a little longer and we have no no 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.419
 the more the idea of ââprice is found 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.880
 tomorrow of course on the techno channel 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.030
 continue this ifa 2012 to tomorrow hi to 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.030
 all
