00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.690
 but 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.110
 he 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.279
 welcome to the beautician's channel 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.800
 no ultrasonic face cleaning on 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.869
 Today is one of the most 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.200
 popular and popular salon 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.539
 procedures but at the same time after 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.879
 ultrasonic cleaning can often 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.670
 hear the disappointed reviews of women 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.620
 who were unhappy with the result 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.830
 why it happens 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.110
 what is the difference between advertising promises 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.170
 beauty salons from real effects 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.690
 after this procedure and to whom and when 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.000
 it's worth doing an ultrasonic cleaning 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.289
 I will tell about all this in today's 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.559
 release 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.260
 Today on the Internet you can find a huge 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.090
 number of illiterate articles 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.850
 dedicated to ultrasonic face cleaning 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.789
 very often people write such articles 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.009
 which no relation cosmetology 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.200
 do not have therefore for lack of 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.960
 own practical experience and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.229
 they simply copy their knowledge 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.660
 words others illiterate articles and in 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.750
 As a result, you can meet on different sites 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.030
 the same loud promises for 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.640
 I will give just a few quotes 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.330
 from the Internet 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.539
 ultrasonic cleaning allows 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.110
 eliminate acne contaminated 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.360
 comedones and smooths wrinkles 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.479
 honor to stimulates collagen synthesis and 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.750
 hyaluronic acid and also often 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.289
 photo made supposedly before and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.880
 after the procedure looking at these photos 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.030
 I immediately have several 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.979
 questions where 10 minutes after 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.310
 ultrasonic cleaning gone 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.009
 stagnant and pigment spots why 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.369
 inflamed acne disappeared and so 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.399
 radically changed the complexion answer 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.750
 simple on the advertising picture 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.050
 presented photoshop effects 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.700
 but no ultrasonic cleaning like 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.099
 practicing beautician I can 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.129
 to say absolutely nothing 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.459
 this does not happen after the procedure 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.520
 this is unscrupulous advertising and simply 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.720
 consumer fraud but people who 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.610
 never did u 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.310
 separation-hand cleansing may well 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.320
 be born for such an advertisement therefore 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.570
 often after studying like 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.420
 information comes to woman confidence 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.820
 that ultrasonic cleaning will help her 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.060
 get rid of several problems at once 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.060
 from inflamed acne and comedones and 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.660
 from wrinkles and a woman goes salon 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.880
 beauty 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.510
 naturally do not get what you want 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.790
 result and remains dissatisfied to 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.010
 avoid such disappointments need 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.530
 clearly understand what is presented 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.410
 boulter sound cleaning what effects 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.709
 can be expected from this procedure and which ones 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.320
 not worth ultrasonic cleaning or 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.959
 ultrasonic peeling is gentle 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.790
 corneal exfoliation procedure 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.420
 which is performed using 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.700
 special ultrasonic spatula 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.220
 scrubber with ultrasonic cleaning 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.190
 skin is cleansed of dead cells as well 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.490
 minor pore contamination removed 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.820
 and there is a light micro-massage of the skin with 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.260
 using ultrasound waves 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.100
 the result of such purification is leveled 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.310
 skin micro-relief improves complexion and 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.269
 skin immediately gets smoother 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.080
 well-groomed and radiant look and now what not 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.150
 makes ultrasonic cleaning 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.930
 ultrasonic cleaning does not remove tight 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.760
 deep-seated greasy plugs remove 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.880
 dense comedones can only be using 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.220
 ultrasonic mechanical cleaning 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.769
 brushing does not remove sore acne 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.209
 moreover the presence of multiple 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.600
 sore elements is 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.820
 contraindication to 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.890
 ultrasonic cleaning and ultrasonic 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.790
 cleaning does not affect 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.109
 collagen and hyaluronic acid synthesis 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.040
 such a promise is just 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.979
 advertising move 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.710
 during this procedure, ultrasound 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.850
 wave does not even penetrate into the thickness of tissue 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.530
 but on the contrary reflected from the surface 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.470
 ultrasonic cleaning is just one of 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.240
 ways to cleanse the skin exist and 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.280
 other good methods and means 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.940
 cleansing 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.610
 skin in the cabin and home 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.910
 conditions just during the ultrasound 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.690
 peeling in the cabin is used 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.360
 professional cosmetics 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.430
 plus an ultrasonic scrubber what does 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.040
 salon procedure of course more 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.260
 effective therefore ultrasound 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.210
 cleaning can be recommended to anyone 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.910
 wants to clear small pores 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.730
 contaminations exfoliate dead cells and 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.980
 quickly improve the appearance of the skin 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.550
 this procedure is painless and takes 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:10.060
 about 40 minutes as it usually includes 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.710
 yourself also applying a special mask 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.919
 ultrasound peeling with parting 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.960
 lasts no more than ten minutes after 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.690
 the procedure does not leave any traces 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.700
 or skin flaking so 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.880
 ultrasonic cleaning can be done and 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.940
 on the eve of important events therefore if 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.370
 you have the opportunity and desire you can 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.669
 periodically one two three times a year 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.680
 do this ultrasound procedure 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.080
 cleaning can be done before 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.110
 mechanical cleaning of the face 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.060
 cleaning the same combined called 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.790
 ultrasound peeling can be done before important 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.070
 events when you want skin 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.789
 looked smooth and well groomed and makeup 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.010
 went to bed exactly and also when you 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.410
 for any reason, they have not cared for a long time 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:01.520
 skin and home treatments are not enough 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:04.910
 to quickly put the skin in order 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.000
 as well as ultrasound peeling can be used 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.860
 as an alternative to chemical peeling 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.070
 for example when you are planning a trip to 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.460
 sea ​​and chemical peels and you in this 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.320
 moment is contraindicated but if you don't have 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.210
 ultrasonic cleaning capabilities 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.820
 don't worry 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.500
 after all, ultrasonic peeling is only one of 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.050
 ways to cleanse the skin 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.640
 for example, I used to do periodically 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.880
 ultrasonic face peeling 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.430
 and lately I am not doing well 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.860
 I feel because using 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.919
 Now other means for cleansing and 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.980

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.560
 Chemicals that can be used as 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.190
 at home and salons 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.620
