00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
kit so that's not bad at all let's take

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.040 
kit so that's not bad at all let's take
a<00:00:19.320> look<00:00:19.590> inside<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:20.480> and<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.840> any

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
a look inside here and we have any

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.759 
a look inside here and we have any
typical<00:00:22.400> manuals<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.550> stuff<00:00:23.880> probably<00:00:24.769> go

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
typical manuals and stuff probably go

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.700 
typical manuals and stuff probably go
with<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.599> open<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.750> little<00:00:28.289> compartment

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
with that open this little compartment

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.690 
with that open this little compartment
up<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.670> you've<00:00:29.910> got<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.210> battery<00:00:30.900> charger<00:00:31.700> get

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
up and you've got a battery charger get

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.160 
up and you've got a battery charger get
the<00:00:32.820> battery<00:00:33.120> itself<00:00:35.180> includes<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.329> strap<00:00:36.750> and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the battery itself includes a strap and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.799 
the battery itself includes a strap and
I<00:00:37.440> think<00:00:37.649> those<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:37.860> strap<00:00:38.510> mounting<00:00:39.510> pieces

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
I think those are strap mounting pieces

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.700 
I think those are strap mounting pieces
and<00:00:40.320> then<00:00:41.100> an<00:00:41.670> AC<00:00:41.879> cord<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.719> I'm<00:00:43.200> like<00:00:43.379> you

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
and then an AC cord so this I'm like you

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.590 
and then an AC cord so this I'm like you
know<00:00:43.829> Canon<00:00:44.430> chargers<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.210> doesn't<00:00:45.480> have

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
know Canon chargers it doesn't have

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.319 
know Canon chargers it doesn't have
prongs<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.500> use<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.700> charging

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
prongs so you have to use the charging

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.459 
prongs so you have to use the charging
cable<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> big<00:00:50.129> fan<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:51.469> it's

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
cable there not a big fan of that it's

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.090 
cable there not a big fan of that it's

wanted something that was close to 50
and<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.489> approximately<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.479> 52<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.259> a

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
and this is approximately like 52 and a

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.820 
and this is approximately like 52 and a
half<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:10.890> millimeters<00:02:12.319> 35<00:02:13.319> no<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:16.050> really

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
half I think millimeters 35 no I really

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.000 
half I think millimeters 35 no I really

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
as well and the battery door doesn't

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.370 
as well and the battery door doesn't
close<00:02:50.670> by<00:02:51.090> itself<00:02:51.569> which<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.170> kind<00:02:52.349> of

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
close by itself which is kind of

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.240 
close by itself which is kind of
interesting<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.860> have<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.209> flick<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.390> back

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
interesting you have to flick that back

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
so there is the Fuji xt-1 with a 35 MLF

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.940 
so there is the Fuji xt-1 with a 35 MLF
point<00:03:01.110> 1.4<00:03:02.099> lens<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:04.110> aperture<00:03:04.590> ring<00:03:04.620> is

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.550 
point 1.4 lens and the aperture ring is
on<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.489> lens<00:03:05.670> itself<00:03:06.090> which<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.540> very<00:03:07.139> nice

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
on the lens itself which is very nice

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.680
