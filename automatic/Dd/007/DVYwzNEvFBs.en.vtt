there but nothing to write home about so
I<00:03:05.560> went<00:03:06.100> back<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.700> my<00:03:06.900> little<00:03:07.900> secret<00:03:08.440> location

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
I went back to my little secret location

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.910 
I went back to my little secret location
here<00:03:09.580> I'm<00:03:10.570> not<00:03:10.840> doing<00:03:11.110> any<00:03:11.260> crevice<00:03:11.770> in

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
anymore because I've run out of

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.110 
anymore because I've run out of
crevasses<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:14.020> do<00:03:14.580> but<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:17.310> decided<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.640> dig

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
crevasses to do but I decided to dig

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.210 
crevasses to do but I decided to dig
right<00:03:19.570> in<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.900> creek<00:03:20.200> itself<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:22.410> if<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.860> can

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
right in the creek itself and if you can

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.870 
right in the creek itself and if you can
see<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:26.050> edges<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.710> don't<00:03:26.920> know<00:03:27.040> if<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.550> Sun<00:03:27.760> is

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
see the edges I don't know if the Sun is

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.000 
see the edges I don't know if the Sun is
going<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.030> capture<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.630> so<00:03:29.380> I've<00:03:29.500> got<00:03:29.650> few

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
going to capture that so I've got few

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.330 
going to capture that so I've got few
bits<00:03:30.670> so<00:03:31.450> now<00:03:31.630> I'm<00:03:31.720> going<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:31.930> continue<00:03:32.410> in<00:03:33.010> my

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
bits so now I'm going to continue in my

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.570 
bits so now I'm going to continue in my
