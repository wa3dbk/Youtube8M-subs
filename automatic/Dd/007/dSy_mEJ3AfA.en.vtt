00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.720
 This is undoubtedly one of the most 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.879
 emblematic of the ww in all its 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.470
 story where finally after 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.690
 many years and in which the 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.270
 speculation was still growing finally 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.039
 ended in this one survivor series in the 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.050
 main event of said event 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.850
 when it seemed that the authority would win 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.190
 out of nowhere and received with a great 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.380
 ovation one of the stars more 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.590
 legendary of the extinct double cidob 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.170
 link came to the ww making its debut that 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.380
 it seemed impossible and at the same time dreamed the 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.030
 icon the veteran and future living room of the 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.809
 fame came to the largest company in the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.880
 sport entertainment this this video 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.010
 will reflect my reactions and my 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.070
 opinion in general regarding this 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.930
 greatest moment in the wwf for the truth 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.030
 I did not expect it even though it 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.920
 he said of rumors regarding his debut 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.020
 in the event of survivor series and 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.730
 it was also speculated about randy orton or 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.100
 of romÃ¡n rings to intervene in the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.020
 traditional struggle however when 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.360
 it seemed that triple h was coming out with the 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.250
 his music sounded and out of nowhere the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.590
 icon came out to the ring with applause and the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.370
 people screaming his name my reaction was 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.900
 same 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.520
 true a moment that left me without 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.010
 words and when he climbed into the ring to 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.860
 confront triple h I knew that things 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.810
 they were going to be serious and that's the way it was for an event 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.630
 that I thought I could not transcend but 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.120
 I was wrong now is the mystery of 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.400
 know what will make the wwf 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.110
 with sting the possibilities are 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.150
 infinite in these cases and with the 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.160
 absentee champion will be needed to 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.350
 legends of wrestling to give you weight 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.570
 to the roster that in these moments with the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.780
 Ascent of set rolling ambrosi team 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.400
 dolph ziggler for saying some examples 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.800
 sting up before survivor series 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.390
 it was limited to appearances in 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.030
 press conferences and 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.040
 presentation of the 2k game now with 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.960
 his debut in the company of the good bills 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.510
 his contract will be the format 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.460
 legend is to say few appearances already 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.020
 programmed in a period of time and 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.750
 maybe some fights at events 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.110
 important or important appearances 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.540
 as a royal rumble 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.880
 perhaps the greatest expectation would be to see it 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.920
 toughen up one last fight for 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.649
 the icon giving way to the question of 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.750
 who would be the rival we have the combat 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.610
 Fantasy of the undertaker against 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.010
 sting that will undoubtedly be the fight of 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.690
 times for two veterans besides being 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.540
 the last of both fighters and 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.100
 retire after a glorious career 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.930
 Other rumors indicate that you can go 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.490
 against jon fina for being the man 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.370
 important in the company 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.170
 we can not rule out triple h since 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.690
 it was the icon that cost them the power and 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.550
 the authority the truth is that there are few 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.130
 the worthy rivals for the icon 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.739
 leaving only the thin and 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.840
 triple h personally will stay 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.700
 better as a rival to the gravedigger who is 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.950
 team see that it is not the same as before 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.900
 and that now he's just a mortal being for 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.850
 that the gravedigger appears where he 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.209
 stay for the first time in wrestlemania 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.860
 being the fight of redemption of taker 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.380
 although both fighters are already in the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.060
 50 years and can not move as before 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.920
 at least they can give a 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.560
 worthy show in the house of the 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.750
 immortal 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.790
 I 'm sorry the video is too short 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.980
 even for my standards of doing 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.989
 videos but it was already said what you had 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.989
 to say in the video regarding the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.760
 appearance of the icon in the ww to which 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.680
