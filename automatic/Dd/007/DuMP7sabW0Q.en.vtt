00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.850
 Rhinoplasty 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.070
 the nose is fundamental in the 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.469
 composition of beauty and balance 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.500
 of the face to be in the center of 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.140
 face is the target of a lot of attention and 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.470
 alterations can have an impact on the 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.070
 self-esteem rhinoplasty has as 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.930
 goal to achieve facial harmony 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.869
 treating aesthetic alterations and 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.809
 functional nose alterations 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:42.070
 nasal can be of genetic origin or 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:44.140
 post traumatic anatomy of the nose the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.860
 The skin of the nose is supported 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.840
 internally by bone structures and 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.620
 cartilaginous on top 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.170
 we have the nasal bone in the middle part 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.730
 the cartilage of the septum with its expansion 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.190
 side 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.550
 at the bottom are the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.100
 salar cartilages 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.760
 in rhinoplasty, the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.560
 remodeling of bone structures and 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.960
 cartilaginous by means of reductions 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.440
 changes in the form or increase of their 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.259
 structures with that we can correct 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.570
 alterations in the back on the tip and 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.850
 in the width of the nose in addition to the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.650
 aesthetic issue surgery can 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.619
 correct also alterations 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.530
 respiratory each case is studied 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.229
 meticulously respecting the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.720
 racial and functional characteristics 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.680
 of each surgical technique 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.620
 in rhinoplasty the surgical technique 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.170
 used can be opened or closed in 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.630
 the open technique becomes a small 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.630
 incision that is hidden under 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.210
 the nasal tip instead in the technique 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.910
 closed the incision is made just 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.190
 on the inside of the nose in both 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.070
 techniques can be performed on 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.560
 treatment of the nasal ala depending on 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.869
 the need of each patient the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.540
 Incision is made on the laterals 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.300
 of the nose and the scars are left 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.820
 hidden in the nasal groove in some 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.459
 cases it may be necessary to use 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.060
 tampons in the nose that will be removed 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.250
 in a short time the scars mature and 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.070
 they are imperceptible with the step 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.890
 of time rhinoplasty improves the 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.480
 nasal aesthetics harmonizing the face and 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.810
 also improving the function 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.810
