it and then i set my descent speed by

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.799 
it and then i set my descent speed by
holding<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:40.820> brake<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:41.300> i'm<00:00:41.390> gonna<00:00:41.480> hold<00:00:41.720> a

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
holding the brake so i'm gonna hold a

holding the brake so i'm gonna hold a
breakdown<00:00:43.989> set<00:00:44.989> a<00:00:45.019> speed<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:45.710> i'm<00:00:45.800> gonna<00:00:45.949> let

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
breakdown set a speed and i'm gonna let

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.820 
breakdown set a speed and i'm gonna let
it<00:00:46.129> go<00:00:48.010> c'mon<00:00:49.010> man<00:00:49.190> that's<00:00:49.550> cool<00:00:49.790> that<00:00:50.000> speed

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
it go c'mon man that's cool that speed

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.680 
it go c'mon man that's cool that speed
then<00:00:51.830> i<00:00:51.920> can<00:00:52.100> leave<00:00:52.280> it<00:00:52.430> on<00:00:52.550> I<00:00:52.850> can<00:00:53.330> overwrite

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
then i can leave it on I can overwrite

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.410 
then i can leave it on I can overwrite
it<00:00:53.780> by<00:00:53.870> hitting<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.170> gas<00:00:54.290> co<00:00:54.699> just<00:00:55.699> go<00:00:56.000> forward
