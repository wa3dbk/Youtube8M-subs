00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.700
 Because of the four weaves added from the student side 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.570
 Team members 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.999
 Government was born 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:14.059
 We reproduced the sharpness of the constant struggle of the plan after weaving 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.880
 From last year's show that it's about to get stuck 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.550
 Imagine and named it compact and convenient to carry 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.669
 Was 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.069
 New 210 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.579
 Total length 4150 mm 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.390
 Field 42 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.590
 AXA 22 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.650
 Compact size with a weight of 200 grams and a length of 240 mm 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.700
 Will be 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.080
 The pitch of the song is in Nizhou 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.880
 Ananen 32 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.630
 The paved surface can be used properly with 42 mm at 2 mm. 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.890
 Aramey is 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.660
 There is a sense that it can be used for a variety of applications such as rot and odor and 7 aircraft 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.190
 among 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.720
 It is more beautiful than cutting it and holding it for fifty years 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.740
 We give priority to 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.700
 It is light and durable because it is made of aluminum die cast on site 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.000
 Because the elastomer resin of the grip part is done 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.250
 Even if you have a good grip and have a telecracy 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.750
 Angle adjustment of rice has become two stages 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.860
 Because you can also delay behind the normal angle 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.480
 Even when strangely similar points are likely to get in the way 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.940
 Easy to use and easy to work with 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.230
 Yokota is resistant to rust 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.400
 Durability due to electroless nickel alloy plating 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.330
 high 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.470
 Hasaki is wonderful because it has hadinpalace processing 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.030
 Sharpness lasts 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.440
 It is silent though it is attached about Any 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.000
 For added command that can be safely and easily detached with one official seal 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.280
 It is economical 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.869
 Managing the fold-in to take over the sharpness of the z-layer takin '210 is more 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.230
 Smoothly now 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.120
 Well, I am willing to cut diagonally in any direction, clean and fast 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.120
 I promise to finish 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:19.339
 A bit oversized 240 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.339
 We can cope with wider use 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.729
 Please try the real sharpness by all means 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.469
 I will surely be satisfied
