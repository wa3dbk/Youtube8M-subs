interesting a little bit of
personalization<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> obviously<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.579> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
personalization and it obviously it's a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.149 
personalization and it obviously it's a
gold<00:01:41.850> top<00:01:42.119> right<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:43.229> all<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> hardware<00:01:43.979> is

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
gold top right but all the hardware is

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.469 
gold top right but all the hardware is
black<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:46.320> back<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.860> also<00:01:47.729> black<00:01:47.939> too<00:01:48.210> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
black and the back is also black too so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.929 
black and the back is also black too so
you<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:49.229> really<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.280> signature<00:01:50.729> Joe
