00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.410
 since the first game has been this 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:08.800
 phrase in our mind which is it's 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.330
 but what does the truth mean? 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.900
 in the history of this horror game 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:17.050
 it can mean many things and here you 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.060
 I bring three theories that have been created from 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.050
 the possible meanings of this 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.050
 enigmatic phrase 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.550
 to begin I'll tell you this theory that 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.120
 created at the beginning when we only had 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.650
 an end that fredys this is that the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.180
 word was referring to that mike smith 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.590
 it would be the man who died 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.410
 possibly mangrove in his frontal lobe 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.600
 but this is completely annulled 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.180
 cannes to go the second game we gave ourselves 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.870
 mind that the bite had already been done 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.840
 before the first game is to say while 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.129
 he spent the second game for this reason 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.129
 completely canceled 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.760
 It tells us that the word it's me is 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.909
 accusingly reference to my if 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.250
 well in the first cancer game a 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.979
 hallucination that very constant has them 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.009
 as for example the hallucinations in the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.430
 office and the hallucinations that appears 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.490
 on the wall the word and all this we 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.890
 says mike may be the one who provoked 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.390
 the murders and the defects of the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:47.080
 animatronics and possibly this is the 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.869
 purple man why do I say it good 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.780
 if they look at the chest of the purple man 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.869
 in the second game they were something marillo 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.649
 it is possibly a plate of 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.649
 a security guard 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.560
 and finally we have the meaning of 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.980
 the guilt of the originator of the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.700
 bite is to say the animatronic that 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.110
 it caused the bite of 87 and like everything 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.090
 rumora let's go clear this was fulfilled 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.390
 mangle is the cause of the bite of 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.510
 87 good going back to the topic 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.700
 the phrase 'I am presented in this 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.320
 mysterious character called fun to 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.380
 mangle where ok when it reaches 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.470
 your office and it emits a static sound 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.640
 and listening very carefully we can hear 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.370
 that says smith doing apology that 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.990
 she caused the bite and confirming it 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.990
 with this sound 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.530

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.450
