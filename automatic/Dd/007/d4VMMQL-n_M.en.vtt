you cannot take out the battery okay now

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.929 
you cannot take out the battery okay now
to<00:00:25.270> the<00:00:25.450> HTC<00:00:25.989> the<00:00:26.680> HTC<00:00:26.710> is<00:00:27.369> very<00:00:27.579> similar<00:00:27.820> to

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
to the HTC the HTC is very similar to

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.450 
to the HTC the HTC is very similar to
the<00:00:28.060> Moto<00:00:28.300> G<00:00:28.689> well<00:00:29.290> it's<00:00:29.380> built<00:00:29.590> a<00:00:29.710> plastic<00:00:30.220> it

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
the Moto G well it's built a plastic it

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.819 
the Moto G well it's built a plastic it
does<00:00:30.610> not<00:00:30.759> feel<00:00:30.939> cheap<00:00:31.149> in<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.390> hand<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.619> main

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
does not feel cheap in the hand the main

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.020 
does not feel cheap in the hand the main
difference<00:00:32.860> is<00:00:33.309> that<00:00:33.370> you<00:00:33.579> can<00:00:33.730> take<00:00:33.880> the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
difference is that you can take the

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.240 
difference is that you can take the
battery<00:00:34.360> out<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.630> HTC<00:00:35.200> unlike<00:00:35.980> with<00:00:36.130> the

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
battery out the HTC unlike with the

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.090 
battery out the HTC unlike with the
Bounty<00:00:36.550> G<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.870> with<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.110> HTC<00:00:38.500> you<00:00:38.800> cannot

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
Bounty G but with the HTC you cannot

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.460 
Bounty G but with the HTC you cannot
customize<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.760> back<00:00:39.990> so<00:00:40.990> including

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
customize the back so including

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.830 
customize the back so including
everything<00:00:41.950> I<00:00:42.280> think<00:00:42.580> the<00:00:42.880> Moto<00:00:43.150> G<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.780> the

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
everything I think the Moto G and the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.500 
everything I think the Moto G and the
HTC<00:00:44.320> draw<00:00:44.650> in<00:00:44.890> build<00:00:45.100> quality<00:00:48.000> okay<00:00:49.000> larger

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
HTC draw in build quality okay larger

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.020 
HTC draw in build quality okay larger
size<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:50.050> HTC<00:00:50.440> is<00:00:50.770> bigger<00:00:51.040> than<00:00:51.400> the<00:00:51.460> Moto<00:00:51.700> G

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
size the HTC is bigger than the Moto G

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.080 
size the HTC is bigger than the Moto G
even<00:00:52.870> though<00:00:52.990> the<00:00:53.140> HTC<00:00:53.650> is<00:00:53.710> bigger<00:00:53.950> the<00:00:54.670> HTC

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
even though the HTC is bigger the HTC

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.180 
even though the HTC is bigger the HTC
has<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.450> smaller<00:00:55.780> screen<00:00:55.870> than<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.500> Moto<00:00:56.829> G

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
has a smaller screen than the Moto G

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.700 
has a smaller screen than the Moto G
this<00:00:58.000> if<00:00:58.240> the<00:00:58.390> cozy<00:00:58.690> as<00:00:58.780> is<00:00:58.930> buttons<00:00:59.320> off<00:00:59.530> the

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
this if the cozy as is buttons off the

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.290 
this if the cozy as is buttons off the
screen<00:00:59.980> unlike<00:01:00.340> the<00:01:00.460> Moto<00:01:00.640> G<00:01:00.940> where<00:01:01.150> their

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
screen unlike the Moto G where their

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.810 
screen unlike the Moto G where their
on-screen<00:01:01.630> the<00:01:02.590> advantages<00:01:03.250> of<00:01:03.280> having<00:01:03.460> the

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
on-screen the advantages of having the

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.429 
on-screen the advantages of having the
buttons<00:01:04.119> off<00:01:04.239> screen<00:01:04.600> is<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:05.049> means<00:01:05.290> the

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
buttons off screen is that means the

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.280 
buttons off screen is that means the
buttons<00:01:05.799> won't<00:01:06.009> take<00:01:06.220> up<00:01:06.369> any<00:01:06.549> space<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:08.170> with

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
buttons won't take up any space but with

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.840 
buttons won't take up any space but with
the<00:01:08.409> Moto<00:01:08.590> G<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.040> buttons<00:01:09.399> on<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.729> screen

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
the Moto G the buttons on the screen

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.819 
the Moto G the buttons on the screen
meaning<00:01:10.450> it<00:01:10.570> will<00:01:10.659> take<00:01:10.869> up<00:01:11.049> space<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.590> only

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829 
meaning it will take up space the only

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:13.560 
meaning it will take up space the only
advantage<00:01:12.100> is<00:01:12.400> when<00:01:12.610> watching<00:01:12.820> videos<00:01:13.330> you'll

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
advantage is when watching videos you'll

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.570 
advantage is when watching videos you'll
have<00:01:13.720> more<00:01:13.900> screen<00:01:14.200> space<00:01:14.229> this<00:01:15.190> is<00:01:15.250> why<00:01:15.550> i

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
have more screen space this is why i

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.240 
have more screen space this is why i
think<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.030> HTC<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:17.140> Moto<00:01:17.320> G<00:01:17.650> draw<00:01:18.010> in

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
think the HTC and the Moto G draw in

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.290 
think the HTC and the Moto G draw in

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
Android software I think the Moto G will

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.469 
Android software I think the Moto G will
run<00:01:44.200> faster<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.860> smoother<00:01:45.490> than<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.940> HTC

run faster and smoother than the HTC

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.080 
run faster and smoother than the HTC
this<00:01:47.110> is<00:01:47.290> why<00:01:47.440> i<00:01:47.470> think<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.040> Moto<00:01:48.250> G<00:01:48.580> winton

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
this is why i think the Moto G winton

if the HTC you can upgrade it unlike the
Moto<00:03:49.030> G<00:03:49.300> but<00:03:50.110> still<00:03:50.320> you're<00:03:50.470> only<00:03:50.620> paying

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
Moto G but still you're only paying

three<00:03:51.160> pounds<00:03:51.490> more<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:51.880> gain<00:03:52.180> extra<00:03:52.450> four

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
three pounds more to gain extra four

three pounds more to gain extra four
gigabytes<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.830> is<00:03:53.950> why<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.190> Moto<00:03:54.640> G

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
gigabytes that is why the Moto G

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:04.930 
gigabytes that is why the Moto G
wouldn't<00:03:55.300> in<00:03:55.420> price

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.630 

okay<00:04:05.390> now<00:04:05.750> overall<00:04:06.170> I<00:04:06.470> think<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.010> Moto<00:04:07.280> G<00:04:07.580> is

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
okay now overall I think the Moto G is

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.690 
okay now overall I think the Moto G is
better<00:04:07.910> than<00:04:08.210> the<00:04:08.300> HTC<00:04:08.810> Desire<00:04:09.580> 300c<00:04:10.580> has

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
better than the HTC Desire 300c has

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.880 
better than the HTC Desire 300c has
better<00:04:11.000> battery<00:04:11.090> life<00:04:11.480> better<00:04:12.260> specs<00:04:12.620> better

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
better battery life better specs better

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.300
