because I can't stand that that's one of

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.270 
because I can't stand that that's one of
the<00:02:25.390> most<00:02:25.540> annoying<00:02:25.870> things<00:02:26.080> especially<00:02:26.890> in

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
the most annoying things especially in

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.920 
the most annoying things especially in
the<00:02:27.370> summer<00:02:27.580> when<00:02:27.790> we<00:02:27.820> have<00:02:27.910> our<00:02:28.210> legs<00:02:28.420> showing

the summer when we have our legs showing
you<00:02:29.380> don't<00:02:29.560> want<00:02:29.710> to<00:02:29.770> have<00:02:29.890> like<00:02:30.070> super<00:02:30.520> smooth

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
you don't want to have like super smooth

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.970 
you don't want to have like super smooth
looking<00:02:31.300> legs<00:02:31.660> but<00:02:32.050> my<00:02:32.260> brains<00:02:32.500> run<00:02:32.800> all<00:02:32.950> over

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
looking legs but my brains run all over

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.340 
looking legs but my brains run all over
the<00:02:33.220> place<00:02:33.430> because<00:02:33.610> then<00:02:33.940> it's<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.720> just

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
the place because then it's like it just

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.690 
the place because then it's like it just
kind<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.560> like<00:02:35.770> defeats<00:02:36.070> purpose<00:02:36.460> in<00:02:36.580> my

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
kind of like defeats purpose in my

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.280 
kind of like defeats purpose in my
opinion<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.300> last<00:02:37.480> thing<00:02:37.630> about<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:37.990> is<00:02:38.110> if

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
opinion the last thing about it is if

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.990 
opinion the last thing about it is if
you<00:02:38.410> don't<00:02:38.680> want<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.190> enter<00:02:39.430> into<00:02:39.760> a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
you don't want to enter into a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.790 
you don't want to enter into a
subscription<00:02:40.720> service<00:02:40.750> if<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.380> is<00:02:41.500> not<00:02:41.740> your

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
subscription service if that is not your

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.980 
subscription service if that is not your
thing<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.520> can<00:02:42.820> purchase<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.390> blades<00:02:43.660> on<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
thing you can purchase the blades on the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.870 
thing you can purchase the blades on the
website<00:02:44.410> separately<00:02:44.950> without<00:02:45.100> signing<00:02:45.760> up

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
website separately without signing up

for<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.150> reoccurring<00:02:47.020> shipment<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:47.710> that's

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
for a reoccurring shipment so that's

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.230 
for a reoccurring shipment so that's
really<00:02:48.100> cool<00:02:48.340> too<00:02:48.550> for<00:02:48.760> those<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.090> who<00:02:49.180> are

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
really cool too for those of you who are

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.510 
really cool too for those of you who are
not<00:02:49.360> into<00:02:49.690> subscription<00:02:50.350> services<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:50.980> really

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
not into subscription services I really

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.370 
not into subscription services I really
like<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.850> they<00:02:51.970> have<00:02:52.150> both<00:02:52.330> options<00:02:52.630> this<00:02:53.170> is

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
like that they have both options this is

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.070 
like that they have both options this is
available<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.430> international<00:02:55.360> customers<00:02:55.570> as

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
available to international customers as

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.500 
available to international customers as
well<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.710> is<00:02:56.740> 995<00:02:57.580> a<00:02:57.820> month<00:02:58.000> just<00:02:58.210> because

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
well and it is 995 a month just because

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.270 
well and it is 995 a month just because
obviously<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:59.230> shipping<00:02:59.560> fee<00:02:59.710> is<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.890> little

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
obviously the shipping fee is a little

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.820 
obviously the shipping fee is a little
bit<00:03:00.400> more<00:03:00.670> but<00:03:01.240> still<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.380> going<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.680> run

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
bit more but still that is going to run

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.560 
bit more but still that is going to run
you<00:03:02.860> less<00:03:03.130> than<00:03:03.370> like<00:03:03.520> one<00:03:03.850> razor<00:03:04.120> at<00:03:04.450> the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
you less than like one razor at the

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.510 
you less than like one razor at the
drugstore<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.680> still<00:03:06.160> think<00:03:06.340> it's<00:03:06.460> an

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
drugstore so I still think it's an

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.680 
drugstore so I still think it's an
incredible<00:03:06.910> deal<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.240> you're<00:03:07.330> getting<00:03:07.420> five

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
incredible deal and you're getting five

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.180 
incredible deal and you're getting five
blades<00:03:07.960> without<00:03:08.320> making<00:03:08.620> this<00:03:08.770> intro<00:03:09.040> too

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
blades without making this intro too

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.710 
blades without making this intro too
much<00:03:09.310> longer<00:03:09.550> I<00:03:09.730> wanted<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.180> go<00:03:10.360> ahead<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.630> get

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
very very nice quality so what I do is I

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.420 
very very nice quality so what I do is I
start<00:04:28.930> from<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.139> bottom<00:04:29.259> and<00:04:29.620> work<00:04:30.099> all<00:04:30.310> the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
start from the bottom and work all the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.369 
start from the bottom and work all the
way<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.819> top<00:04:31.060> make<00:04:31.389> sure<00:04:31.419> you<00:04:31.810> don't<00:04:31.990> move

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:32.379 
way to the top make sure you don't move

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:33.869 
way to the top make sure you don't move
sideways<00:04:32.860> or<00:04:33.280> you<00:04:33.460> will<00:04:33.639> cut<00:04:33.849> yourself

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:33.879 
sideways or you will cut yourself

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.559 
sideways or you will cut yourself
literally<00:04:34.690> just<00:04:35.139> stay<00:04:35.470> in<00:04:35.740> one<00:04:36.120> smooth<00:04:37.120> stroke

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569 
literally just stay in one smooth stroke

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.270

from<00:04:37.810> bottom<00:04:38.139> to<00:04:38.169> top<00:04:38.319> don't<00:04:38.800> ever<00:04:39.039> go

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
from bottom to top don't ever go

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.089 
from bottom to top don't ever go
sideways<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:41.080> this<00:04:41.379> is<00:04:41.470> pretty<00:04:41.590> much<00:04:41.710> what<00:04:42.009> you

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
sideways so this is pretty much what you

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:44.430

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
over sensitive areas like your heel bone

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.420 
over sensitive areas like your heel bone
or<00:04:46.900> your<00:04:47.080> knee<00:04:47.259> or<00:04:47.440> whatever<00:04:47.530> just<00:04:48.039> go<00:04:48.190> with<00:04:48.400> a

or your knee or whatever just go with a

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.490 
or your knee or whatever just go with a
really<00:04:48.729> light<00:04:48.909> hand<00:04:48.940> be<00:04:49.539> super<00:04:49.990> super<00:04:50.139> gentle
