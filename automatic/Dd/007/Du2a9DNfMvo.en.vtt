00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.810
 good evening everyone 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:16.180
 My name is Shiroya, a member of the university's Fujimaki seminar 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:17.200
 Today is my graduation work jr East Japan 3 times will let me announce the design 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.210
 You will receive 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.750
 We wish best regards 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.890
 I assumed this work would be East Japan 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:31.150
 I'm designing a sign 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:36.120
 At first the side is something that conveys some kind of information such as a signed Aizu signboard 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.120
 It is like having you see this 3 systems 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.340
 Opportunity of production 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.930
 That the fact that the likes guide display and will do not you this was further clarity 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.100
 The reason is 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:54.160
 Let me introduce the flow of production 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:56.820
 First of all , I took photographs of signs throughout the country without regard to jr East Japan because of the collection of documents related to the situation 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.820
 I investigated 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:05.100
 Also whether the confusing's difficult to understand especially finely analyze the sign taken why 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:10.900
 I investigated 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:14.260
 You have about three times the design serving sake on the basis of the survey results 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.290
 We had various people verify by each measure 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.290
 Hmm 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:24.920
 Now introduce a maternity hospital that has actually been completed after trial production 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.920
 First of all we introduce some typical ones 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.900
 This is a sign of the station name, but as a feature of this design 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.120
 With the station number added 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.120
 Have you ever add a notation of the Korean 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.810
 The station numbers are defined in the super-introduction manual 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.090
 Next look at this too 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.159
 The current upper house is white background 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.750
 I made this a black background 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.640
 The reason is 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.620
 Produced for easy viewing in the dark underground passages of huge terminals such as Tokyo Station and Shinjuku Station 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.090
 is 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.390
 Two features are placed at the top of the route color 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.360
 The maternity clinic where you are currently seen is here 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:16.120
 For example 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:20.970
 You may inadvertently look at the No. 6 line line 7 when viewed participate in the green measure of Saikyo 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.970
 I have placed a color at the top to prevent this 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:30.200
 The third is to see the current mountain first 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:35.080
 It may be difficult to find the right daily routine daily routine when you look at the observation ceiling 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:41.160
 In order to avoid this, the characters are moved in the direction of the arrow 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.160
 In addition, we make middle and end line thick and finish from line 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:52.010
 I will introduce some more entry 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.010
 I created a sign design manual to define these signs . 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.330
 Both If this is to define a sign design 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:02.170
 I am making it to eliminate blur 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:06.210
 Definition N of character size of the color of the definition and the station number is in this 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.830
 Defines the ratio between English and Japanese 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.520
 Refer to the guidebook guidelines here for how to make these works. 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.780
 I will 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.290
 2 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:21.310
 It is the impression in the end of this production, but the first impression is 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:27.519
 Production has been advanced without any concern about the current horseman who was 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:31.540
 It becomes a form similar to Ketchi, is produced for production and shifts to a tool and becomes a similar form 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.590
 I was shocked that the current sign was devised quite 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.830
 This is my first impression 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.830
 Thank you for your attention .
