00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.840
 Hi, I 'm recently having a 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.360
 your navigating through the strong 4000 line 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.880
 with last year the court is tail 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.529
 analyze the almost all my books that 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.140
 are much more for the price 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.050
 we have as it hid more economical and 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.060
 but I think it 's 4 with five and we're going 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.840
 analyze and see if it is a good 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.359
 you 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.780
 in terms of dimensions and b you got 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.550
 keep the 4.5-inch aquarius screen 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.559
 is 4.5 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.420
 in this new model is slightly more 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.120
 what's more lighter xing 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.760
 even with a bigger battery for everything 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.830
 this is very easy to cross with one is not 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.540
 have been put there and 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.720
 are now more accessible with the pool 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.659
 bar at the right time on-screen function 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.489
 increase being lower than the function 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:58.040
 getting a little behind a lot of headphones this 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.239
 price however have more vivid colors 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.390
 that one of gold last year 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.699
 Together Copper Vadio Wide Vision 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.040
 It is not this quality difference 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.189
 image and pro day to day is more than 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.350
 sufficient to be more limited in the 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.390
 youtube videos for example and 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.090
 average consumption in general where the nautical 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.979
 has a little less definition 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.570
 sound is to see that you have opted for 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.210
 keep the speaker below which is a 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.499
 element higher than the previous one but 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.509
 in terms of quality there is not much 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:28.729
 difference in this regard would be better to have 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.469
 the front speaker, for example 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.509
 The motorcycle style has two speakers 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.369
 creating a much more 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.369
 when watching a video or playing a video 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.499
 game lakeside indications of a 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.240
 5 megapixel camera with a large 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:43.280
 opening what is great 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.439
 when pretending also has a flash what is 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.740
 very unusual but can be useful in 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.289
 low-light environments behind the camera 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.469
 8 megapixels and is a bit better than 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.929
 to 44 in two years last year is 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:59.479
 close to the quality of nex 5 while 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.420
 videos are only in high definition and 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.319
 I will not speak in general is within 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.500
 is expected from this price range inside 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.330
 with the latest android 5.19 pop and 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.370
 has some extra features that 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.560
 Beijing implemented as two work 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.870
 the screen off 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.310
 the ability to add and remove 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.650
 Sunday afternoon how to change your 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.900
 layout and other functionality 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.580
 What are the permissions when 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.250
 we can define punishments by 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.080
 practical application - for example was 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.090
 This is my mission. 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.650
 location but as I have no interest 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.450
 in book 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.130
 another option is to always let go 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.069
 ask why facebook instead 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.720
 wants to accelerate our profession and at home 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.269
 civilization are primitive times like 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.550
 blocking this is very useful already 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.709
 missing on android and this so that it stays 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.580
 available producers in the next version 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.780
 but there are 4.5 already there and it's great 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.569
 that they have made an effort to 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.580
 implement this in terms of performance 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.620
 has collectively weak components and 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.170
 police applications have been around for some time 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.390
 open and I went say a little lower than 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.530
 ip8 made for example that we do not use 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.019
 cent 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.660
 however for the applications of the day 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.760
 day social networks and most hutu etc 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.540
 for this issue of society goes from 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.760
 partnership and games reached more 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.920
 demanding for such a level of graphics 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.840
 below the ideal even because the very 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.420
 screen resolution is low what is 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.640
 expected increase in price but the 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.970
 simpler games that are mostly not 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.920
 will have any problem with the battery 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.739
 steve kay much with it in the text then 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.410
 a very intensive transition day with 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.500
 15 hours wifi 8 and a half hours until day care 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.750
 two hours ps and one hour of calls 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.389
 putting on top of typhoons with more 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.639
 autonomy alongside the bike is that in the 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:53.870
 50 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:55.970
 the aquarium 104.5 has 4g mobile internet and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.769
 is dual yes which means that you can have 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.769
 two different numbers and employees 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.510
 simultaneously in the same forum the sporting 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.280
 even memory cards to expand 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.519
 the 8 GB of storage 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.650
 the price is 150 euros 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.440
 We will also briefly review the 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.600
 chords in 5 rather superior and this 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.190
 also more expensive so write the 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.200
 channel so as not to lose the next 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.150
 daughters 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.910
 In conclusion this sees that it is great for the 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.550
 day to day because it is not easy to use as 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.330
 there would be extraordinary and a camera 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.330
 sufficient performance 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.129
 I am and it is not faster this morning. 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.139
 price and will be a clear g engine also has 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:39.259
 its advantages that can see more 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.719
 late in the analysis and you stayed 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.580
 convinced with this pec or were 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:46.039
 seeing something improved the sound 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.990
 the landing on the screen was on the feet 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.669
 your opinions in the comments to 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.349
 know what they think of this strategy in the 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.870
 iraq grow up and leave a thank-you 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.300
 to the team in the tests of this court 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.460
 Pay and thank you for this 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.319
 month videos started do not forget if 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.969
 sign to stay for all 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.969
 news until the next day
