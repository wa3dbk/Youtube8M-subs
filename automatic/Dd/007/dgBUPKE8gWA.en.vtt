crickets or anything that you feed them

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.580 
crickets or anything that you feed them
during<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.240> about<00:02:48.240> 12<00:02:48.630> once<00:02:48.959> or<00:02:49.080> twice<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.320> week

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
during the about 12 once or twice a week

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.490 
during the about 12 once or twice a week
I<00:02:49.910> mean<00:02:50.910> if<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.150> skip<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.600> once<00:02:51.810> it'll<00:02:52.050> nothing

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
I mean if you skip it once it'll nothing

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.220 
I mean if you skip it once it'll nothing
that'll<00:02:52.739> happen<00:02:53.510> but<00:02:54.510> overall<00:02:54.870> they're

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
that'll happen but overall they're

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.280 
that'll happen but overall they're
really<00:02:55.709> great<00:02:55.860> pets<00:02:56.360> both<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.570> them<00:02:57.690> are<00:02:57.750> but

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
really great pets both of them are but

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.530 
really great pets both of them are but
for<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.220> beginner<00:02:59.580> pet<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.030> would<00:03:00.390> more<00:03:00.840> likely

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
for a beginner pet I would more likely

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.910 
for a beginner pet I would more likely
there's<00:03:03.540> different<00:03:03.959> reasons<00:03:04.320> for<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.770> because

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
there's different reasons for it because

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.190 
there's different reasons for it because
bearded<00:03:05.760> dragons<00:03:06.090> can<00:03:06.450> take<00:03:06.630> up<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.930> lot<00:03:07.140> of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
bearded dragons can take up a lot of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.090 
bearded dragons can take up a lot of
space<00:03:07.650> because<00:03:08.180> they<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.540> would<00:03:10.350> use<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.890> would

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
space because they I would use I would

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.800 
space because they I would use I would
probably<00:03:12.090> be<00:03:12.570> better<00:03:13.470> if<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:14.130> use<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.810> 55

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
probably be better if you use a 55

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.570 
probably be better if you use a 55
gallon<00:03:16.110> which<00:03:17.040> does<00:03:17.370> take<00:03:17.580> up<00:03:17.610> a<00:03:17.910> lot<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.150> space

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
gallon which does take up a lot of space

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.479 
gallon which does take up a lot of space
but<00:03:20.580> leopard<00:03:20.910> geckos<00:03:21.390> only<00:03:21.900> need<00:03:22.140> 20<00:03:22.950> gallon

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
but leopard geckos only need 20 gallon

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.180 
but leopard geckos only need 20 gallon
for<00:03:23.910> 2<00:03:24.150> 10<00:03:25.110> gallon<00:03:25.500> for<00:03:25.650> one<00:03:25.830> would<00:03:25.980> be

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
for 2 10 gallon for one would be

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.949 
for 2 10 gallon for one would be
perfectly<00:03:26.820> fine<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:29.299> that's<00:03:30.299> about<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.630> for

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
perfectly fine so that's about it for

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.190 
perfectly fine so that's about it for
them<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.610> if<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:33.390> want<00:03:33.600> something<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.080> you

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
them and if you want something that you

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.500 
them and if you want something that you
want<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.470> handle<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:35.100> would<00:03:35.250> go<00:03:35.730> along<00:03:36.030> with<00:03:36.390> the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
want to handle I would go along with the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.100 
want to handle I would go along with the
bearded<00:03:36.840> dragon<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:38.209> that's<00:03:39.209> about<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.510> so

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110
