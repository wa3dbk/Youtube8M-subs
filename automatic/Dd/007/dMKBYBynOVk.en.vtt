00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:16.720
 the rdf i just installed a new transformer to allow 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.939
 at the photovoltaic power plant of the party yesterday on the common plugs 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.150
 to provide green electricity 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.960
 on the communal network of flies 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.419
 works carried out without power outage for the inhabitants of 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:31.159
 plugs 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.339
 thanks to this intervention of the peace teams 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120
 we will commission a photovoltaic power plant 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.340
 of 72 kilos acts 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.780
 and percent 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.070
 it is necessary for erdf 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.810
 to replace the transformer that powers the village of the first 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.810
 track today we are in mouchamps 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.399
 and the transformer and well today is no longer enough 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.930
 to evacuate the electricity produced by this photovoltaic plant 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.370
 to the extent that the customers 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.620
 m installed in the village could not consume 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
 all the electricity produced by this plant 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.180
 the intermediary actually made it necessary to adapt the network by changing our 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.250
 consumer 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.730
 so that this electricity produced here at the 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.780
 fence 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.390
 8This conveys 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.649
 in the network 20000 volts and suddenly be consumed by customers 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.280
 we will install elsewhere on the commune 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.280
 so the site will last about an hour and a half 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.180
 carve them out by teams 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.490
 they work live on the network 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.830
 and so this 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.290
 they avoid cutting five hundred customers that day the commune of 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.290
 Mouchan 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.070
 e intervention dtsp a plus for the calls had remained buy there 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.300
 Well, you can conserve food for 500 customers 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.520
 normally would have been but the time of the shipyard 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.960
 the VendÃ©e is the first department in the region for 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.679
 projects 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.680
 photovoltaic connections 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.090
 indeed in January 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.790
 nearly 1500 electricity producers photo your film on 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.189
 has already been connected 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.829
 greedy mans on photovoltaics solar energy 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.319
 e since% and especially the year 2009 with the rates them and redemption 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.469
 interesting 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.209
 aperam 8% and to have a lot of construction sites and projects 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.219
 both projects go on farm buildings a few worries me 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.680
 it corresponds quite to the clean energies a little long the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.799
 grenelle of the environment imposes on us 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.309
 and I think that day 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.919
 it can be a solution 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.919
 on the bottom the photovoltaic a solution 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:44.559
 the purpose of these buildings 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.249
 gold in solar panels 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.989
 we had to go out in the cold that we must take advantage 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:49.720
 It was hard
