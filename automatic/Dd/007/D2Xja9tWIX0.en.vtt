smallest lte-advanced multimode modem so

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.459 
smallest lte-advanced multimode modem so
I<00:00:10.349> asked<00:00:10.769> what<00:00:11.160> do<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.370> have<00:00:11.519> here<00:00:12.230> yeah<00:00:13.230> so

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
I asked what do we have here yeah so

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.990 
I asked what do we have here yeah so
here<00:00:13.679> we<00:00:13.830> have<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.190> smallest<00:00:14.549> algae

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
here we have the smallest algae

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.050 
here we have the smallest algae
multimode<00:00:15.480> modem<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.220> we<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.369> different

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
multimode modem and we have different

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.710 
multimode modem and we have different
reference<00:00:18.750> designs<00:00:19.140> here<00:00:19.609> so<00:00:20.609> one<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.600> have

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
reference designs here so one we have

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.080 
reference designs here so one we have
here<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.740> more<00:00:23.100> really<00:00:23.430> smallest<00:00:23.850> one

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
here is this more really smallest one

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.710 
here is this more really smallest one
which<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.390> 28<00:00:25.170> x<00:00:25.439> 28<00:00:25.920> millimeter<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.269> that's<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
which is 28 x 28 millimeter so that's a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.099 
which is 28 x 28 millimeter so that's a
very<00:00:27.960> optimized<00:00:28.710> size<00:00:29.519> solution<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
very optimized size solution and it

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.799 
very optimized size solution and it
consists<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.859> fully<00:00:32.180> multimode<00:00:33.180> platform

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
consists of the fully multimode platform

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.830 
consists of the fully multimode platform
so<00:00:34.110> including<00:00:34.380> five<00:00:34.829> modes<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.840> supporting

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
so including five modes and supporting

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.940 
so including five modes and supporting

small very fast and very power efficient

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.210 
small very fast and very power efficient
also

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.330 

we<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.880> a<00:00:47.910> second<00:00:48.390> version<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:49.190> which<00:00:50.190> is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
we have a second version here which is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.270 
we have a second version here which is
based<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> same<00:00:51.000> m7<00:00:51.570> 450<00:00:52.020> platform<00:00:52.530> that's

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
based on the same m7 450 platform that's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.430 
based on the same m7 450 platform that's
a<00:00:53.400> little<00:00:53.520> bit<00:00:53.760> larger<00:00:53.910> that's<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.630> m2<00:00:55.080> form

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
a little bit larger that's the m2 form

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.150 
a little bit larger that's the m2 form
factor<00:00:55.860> which<00:00:56.310> is<00:00:56.340> an<00:00:56.730> industry<00:00:57.120> standard<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
factor which is an industry standard and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.730 
factor which is an industry standard and
has<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> mini<00:00:59.760> PCI<00:01:00.210> Express<00:01:00.570> connector<00:01:00.990> which

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
has a mini PCI Express connector which

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.549 
has a mini PCI Express connector which
goes<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.040> standards<00:01:02.970> lots<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.540> laptops<00:01:04.230> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
goes into standards lots of laptops and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.370 
goes into standards lots of laptops and
tablets<00:01:05.130> and<00:01:05.660> since<00:01:06.660> this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.260> bit

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
tablets and since this is a little bit

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.340 
tablets and since this is a little bit
larger<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.910> can<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.300> much<00:01:09.780> more<00:01:09.810> bands

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
larger and we can have much more bands

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.300 
larger and we can have much more bands
on<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.080> also<00:01:13.530> includes<00:01:13.920> them

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
on this one so this also includes them

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.110 
on this one so this also includes them
GS<00:01:14.640> my<00:01:15.210> pant<00:01:15.480> and<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.290> lot<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.740> number<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.490> LTE

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
GS my pant and a lot of number of LTE

bands

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.740 

then<00:01:21.650> I<00:01:21.920> can<00:01:22.280> show<00:01:22.490> us<00:01:22.790> a<00:01:22.970> little<00:01:23.120> bit<00:01:23.360> here

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
then I can show us a little bit here

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.520 
then I can show us a little bit here
based<00:01:24.590> on<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.950> small<00:01:25.250> modem<00:01:26.180> year<00:01:26.510> what<00:01:27.440> the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
based on the small modem year what the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.030 
based on the small modem year what the
different<00:01:27.860> components<00:01:28.040> are<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:29.890> what<00:01:30.890> we

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
different components are and what we

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.800 
different components are and what we
have<00:01:31.160> here<00:01:31.370> is<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.610> baseband<00:01:32.060> section<00:01:32.510> and

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
have here is the baseband section and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.250 
have here is the baseband section and
here<00:01:33.380> we<00:01:33.470> have<00:01:33.590> two<00:01:33.740> RF<00:01:34.100> section<00:01:34.810> so<00:01:35.810> what<00:01:36.110> we

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
here we have two RF section so what we

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.930 
here we have two RF section so what we
see<00:01:36.440> on<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.620> basement<00:01:36.800> section<00:01:37.430> is<00:01:37.640> the

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
see on the basement section is the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.530 
see on the basement section is the
digital<00:01:38.780> baseband<00:01:39.170> Isaac<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:40.730> the<00:01:41.300> flash

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
digital baseband Isaac and the flash

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.750 
digital baseband Isaac and the flash
memory<00:01:42.910> and<00:01:43.910> on<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.570> RF<00:01:44.870> section<00:01:45.320> we<00:01:46.100> have<00:01:46.130> one

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
memory and on the RF section we have one

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.000 
memory and on the RF section we have one
that's<00:01:46.940> very<00:01:47.300> important<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:48.020> single<00:01:48.680> RF

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
that's very important a single RF

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.340 
that's very important a single RF
transceiver<00:01:49.640> which<00:01:50.390> can<00:01:50.660> handle<00:01:50.990> also<00:01:51.260> the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
transceiver which can handle also the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.280 
transceiver which can handle also the
carrier<00:01:51.680> gation<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.150> allows<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.780> stay

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
carrier gation so that allows to stay

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.130 
carrier gation so that allows to stay
small<00:01:54.650> in<00:01:54.830> size<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:55.430> keep<00:01:56.330> also<00:01:56.540> low<00:01:56.840> power

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
small in size and keep also low power

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.690 
small in size and keep also low power
consumption<00:01:57.590> when<00:01:57.890> we<00:01:58.070> do<00:01:58.190> with<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.400> carrier

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
consumption when we do with the carrier

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.750 
consumption when we do with the carrier
gation<00:01:59.200> then<00:02:00.200> we<00:02:00.350> have<00:02:00.470> here<00:02:00.770> two<00:02:01.220> front<00:02:01.610> end

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
gation then we have here two front end

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.720 
gation then we have here two front end
modules<00:02:02.150> 1-4<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.140> main<00:02:03.620> path<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.280> one<00:02:04.520> for

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
modules 1-4 the main path and one for

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.570 
modules 1-4 the main path and one for
the<00:02:04.790> diversity<00:02:05.450> path<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:06.170> such<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.040> front<00:02:07.430> end

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
the diversity path and such a front end

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.260 
the diversity path and such a front end
module<00:02:08.020> includes<00:02:09.020> several<00:02:09.890> bands<00:02:10.270> duplexer

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
module includes several bands duplexer

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.140 
module includes several bands duplexer
and<00:02:11.510> filters<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.160> allows<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.700> optimize

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
and filters so that allows to optimize

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.590 
and filters so that allows to optimize
for<00:02:14.180> on<00:02:14.690> size<00:02:15.520> then<00:02:16.520> over<00:02:16.670> here<00:02:16.820> we<00:02:17.060> have<00:02:17.390> two

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
for on size then over here we have two

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.560 
for on size then over here we have two
multimode<00:02:18.560> power<00:02:18.920> amplifier<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.330> again

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
multimode power amplifier so that again

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.840 
multimode power amplifier so that again
combines<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.620> power<00:02:21.650> amplifier<00:02:22.010> function

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
combines the power amplifier function

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.740 
combines the power amplifier function
for<00:02:23.030> several<00:02:23.390> bands<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.180> case<00:02:26.420> we

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
for several bands and in this case we

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.190 
for several bands and in this case we
have<00:02:26.930> here<00:02:27.489> another<00:02:28.660> section<00:02:29.660> here<00:02:29.900> for<00:02:30.170> a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
have here another section here for a

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.530 
have here another section here for a
separate<00:02:30.770> power<00:02:31.220> amplifier<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.000> duplexer

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
separate power amplifier and duplexer

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.750 
separate power amplifier and duplexer
for<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.810> band<00:02:33.020> seven<00:02:33.410> which<00:02:33.739> is<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.010> high<00:02:34.430> band

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
for the band seven which is a high band

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.570 
for the band seven which is a high band
so<00:02:35.060> 2.6<00:02:35.720> gigahertz<00:02:36.080> band

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
so 2.6 gigahertz band

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.440 
so 2.6 gigahertz band
so<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> short<00:02:38.780> overview<00:02:38.960> of<00:02:39.560> our

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
so this is a short overview of our

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.270 
so this is a short overview of our
multimode<00:02:41.450> solution<00:02:41.960> in<00:02:42.200> very<00:02:42.530> small<00:02:42.650> form

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
multimode solution in very small form

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.930 
multimode solution in very small form
