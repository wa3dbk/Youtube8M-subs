scroll up to the top this is 1080p and

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.309 
scroll up to the top this is 1080p and

when I went to 2 times slow motion which

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.640 
when I went to 2 times slow motion which
was<00:03:05.650> 60<00:03:06.130> frames<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.459> second<00:03:06.819> I<00:03:07.470> expected<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.590> to

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
was 60 frames a second I expected it to

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.539 
was 60 frames a second I expected it to
be<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.010> same<00:03:09.330> because<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:11.769> camera<00:03:12.130> phone<00:03:12.310> can

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
be the same because the camera phone can

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.340 
be the same because the camera phone can
do<00:03:12.760> 1080<00:03:13.450> at<00:03:14.049> 60<00:03:14.290> frames<00:03:15.220> per<00:03:15.400> second<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.840> it

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
do 1080 at 60 frames per second so it

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.140 
do 1080 at 60 frames per second so it
should<00:03:17.650> just<00:03:17.680> record<00:03:18.220> at<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:18.459> rate<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.970> play

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
should just record at this rate and play

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.680 
should just record at this rate and play
it<00:03:19.299> back<00:03:19.450> at<00:03:19.690> half<00:03:19.900> speed<00:03:20.430> but<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.519> doesn't<00:03:21.820> it

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
it back at half speed but it doesn't it

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.130 
it back at half speed but it doesn't it
records<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.430> 720<00:03:25.200> 60<00:03:26.200> frames<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.620> second<00:03:27.010> and

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
records that 720 60 frames a second and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.490 
records that 720 60 frames a second and
then<00:03:29.140> when<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.590> jump<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:31.079> 120<00:03:32.079> frames<00:03:32.230> per

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
then when you jump to 120 frames per

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.300 
then when you jump to 120 frames per
second<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.579> scales<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.209> down<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:35.280> 360<00:03:36.280> P<00:03:37.049> and

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
second it scales it down to 360 P and

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.270 
second it scales it down to 360 P and
then<00:03:39.310> when<00:03:39.430> you<00:03:39.519> go<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:40.410> 240<00:03:41.410> frames<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.889> second

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
then when you go to 240 frames a second

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.750 
then when you go to 240 frames a second
it's<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:43.269> same<00:03:43.480> resolution<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:45.190> played<00:03:45.459> back

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
it's the same resolution but played back

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.170 
it's the same resolution but played back
at<00:03:46.120> 15<00:03:46.720> frames<00:03:46.900> per<00:03:47.139> second<00:03:47.620> instead<00:03:47.980> of<00:03:48.100> 30<00:03:49.500> so

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
at 15 frames per second instead of 30 so

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.910 
at 15 frames per second instead of 30 so
if<00:03:52.180> you're<00:03:52.359> going<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.540> be<00:03:52.600> shooting<00:03:52.780> at<00:03:53.170> one

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
if you're going to be shooting at one

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.900 
if you're going to be shooting at one
half<00:03:54.130> speed<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:55.540> should<00:03:55.720> actually<00:03:55.870> shoot<00:03:56.319> at

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
half speed you should actually shoot at

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.309 
half speed you should actually shoot at
1080<00:03:57.910> 60<00:03:58.299> P<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.160> then<00:04:00.160> edit<00:04:00.459> it

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
1080 60 P and then edit it

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.490 
1080 60 P and then edit it

in a video editor to slow it down to 30
frames<00:04:05.859> per<00:04:06.100> second<00:04:06.549> so<00:04:06.700> you<00:04:07.480> maintain<00:04:07.630> the

that means when you jump from 1080p at
