00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.299
 ok let's talk about overweight and 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.030
 obesity and I have always said that this 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.560
 topic is very important because most 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.100
 of people buy our products 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.100
 precisely because he wants to lose weight 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.140
 and anyone who manages well what 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.220
 overweight and obesity as it has 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.440
 be 80 or 90 percent of the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.970
 problems solved by the products 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.160
 so they have to put a lot 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.650
 attention to this to this to that 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.360
 training point number 1 the weight 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.730
 body that depends on the weight 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.440
 of the body on which depends number one of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.500
 the amount of water we have in the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.760
 body number two the amount of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.019
 bones number three the amount of 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.970
 muscle and number four of the amount 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.159
 of fat that we have in the body is 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.280
 say any of these four things 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.199
 that are modified be water be bones 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.830
 I say the bones usually do not 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.050
 they modify but if muscle or fat 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.450
 the weight goes up or the weight goes down 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.930
 example the water truth in general we are 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.530
 60 percent water the children the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.840
 babies as well as I have a 75 for 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.340
 hundred 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.200
 truth, look, man has more something 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.609
 that women have 60 percent of 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.960
 water and the woman has only 50% 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:35.210
 I understood why men are more 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.490
 water 2 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.869
 and if the woman has more fat present at 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.869
 you because they are for slippery not 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.119
 One liter of water is equal to one kilogram of 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.670
 weight that means that if you lose 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:54.420
 One liter of water automatically you lose 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.979
 one kilo you recover that water and you recover 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.920
 the kilo countries where many people 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.310
 cheats because for example this is going to 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.220
 start the scale before peeing 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.600
 true and then pee says down there 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.149
 yes, because to the bladder, more or less 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.280
 you finish half a liter of water then 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.950
 That half liter is not fat 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.620
 since water one day you get dehydrated 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.069
 and apparently low in weight is not 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.459
 true then says here the changes of 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.050
 quick weight is to say on the same day 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.000
 that the morning weighed more so much and in the 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.190
 night weights so much especially at 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.740
 women varies a lot this 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.140
 or from one day to the next they are almost 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.030
 always due to water pressures from 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.850
 body and not so much fat 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.959
 rather the changes in the muscle 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:46.740
 basically they are that slow and very slow 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.380
 raise a kilo on all who do 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.420
 this bodybuilders and now it's going to go up 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.760
 a kilo sometimes costs a month two 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.670
 months three months go up a kilo of 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.880
 muscle and lower it more or less is 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.370
 slowly also true the changes in 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.440
 fat are also very slow and also 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.230
 a person who was fattening a 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.850
 kilo of fat per week is going up 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.769
 very fast 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.290
 through that I was losing weight 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.180
 kilo of fat per week would say today that 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.019
 is happening to you or is it more like that 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.790
 chopped down true right here 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.530
 there is a leaf that is the first 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.990
 you should see those who 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.670
 have 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:33.330
 what is the use of the calculation of the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.680
 body mass index true because no 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.180
 it's nothing more than grabbing a person and 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.000
 put on a style scale and you're 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.150
 You're skinny 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.190
 the weight does not really say how are you there 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.030
 that determine the fat ratio 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.070
 muscle and for that I'm going to ask you 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.410
 that they are following is truth leaflet 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.080
 the little leaf says up calculations 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.530
 body mass index in kilos and then 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.120
 is in the body mass index in 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:04.459
 pounds is true how it is calculated first 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.670
 true to do the calculation for kilos 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.010
 and centimeters what we get is to know 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.410
 how much 4000 of the person and then 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.330
 according to what he says he takes away is 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.900
 we multiply stature by stature another 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.930
 The fact that the person weighs truth gives me 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.990
 170 then we put 170 and what 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.110
 multiply by 170 and that will give us 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.110
 what a factor 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:35.340
 and then we start the person and 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:39.139
 we divide what weighs between the factor 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:43.470
 and that gives you the imc which means that 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:46.080
 true body mass index but that 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.900
 it's a manual calculation we're going to do that 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.930
 the person had a current weight of 65 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.169
 kilos and 'twitter' a stature of 1.70 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.849
 so what we do 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:00.849
 we multiply about 70 by about 70 in 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.849
 2.89 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:09.880
 and then we divide the 65 between 2.89 and 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:13.180
 is going to give us that person's imc 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:17.190
 The little leaf is almost at the end 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.780
 between 70 is this and below in the leaflet 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.150
 there is the table 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.650
 what it means I say 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.530
 tablet more or less hang from the shoulder 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.419
 but this is a little different because 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.740
 this is what you get for the calculation 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:36.000
 manual what does that mean if I do not 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.990
 I have a drone I could do this calculation 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.220
 and more or less know how the person is 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.020
 could because the shoulder does not have 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.780
 many years of existing in the world before 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.120
 all the doctors did that with a 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.540
 calculation similar to this one and with nutritionists 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.580
 and that kind of people can then the 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.280
 calculation in pounds 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.720
 this is a little bit more complicated because 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.370
 the calculation is made structure of 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.840
 structure but structure for that 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.710
 height forgiveness but in inches 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:10.860
 then this normally in the usa 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.880
 I met when half was 58 that 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.950
 it means that they are 5 feet 8 inches 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.380
 then those feet that you have to 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:24.120
 turn them into inches then says here 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:28.470
 is equal to that 12 inches 4 feet to 48 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:33.150
 inches 5 feet to 60 inches and because 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:36.390
 is 4 out of 4 to 7 because it is what is more 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:40.910
 or less people have say I in 10,000 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:44.270
 like 5 859 but I'm really high the 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:47.070
 people who ask for measures only 4 feet no 43 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.160
 so what do we do we take everything out 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.530
 inches and then we multiply 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.110
 inches, height in inches 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:58.410
 we take the factor equal the weight of the 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.720
 person in pounds truth and we do the 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.580
 operation but look, there is a factor that 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.830
 it is already determined that what the 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.950
 person weighs in pounds we multiply 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:10.280
 by 703 who knows why 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:14.070
 and now if we take the weight of the person 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:18.000
 and then the weight is divided between the 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:19.680
 factor true and this can be a 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.400
 calculation for example not the person weighs 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:30.620
 154 pounds for 703 gives us 10 82 62 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:34.080
 weigh let's suppose 67 2000 67 inches 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:38.759
 then we do the calculation 67 by 67 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:43.009
 gives us 44 89 and then we divide the 10 82 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:46.729
 72 80 and 44 89 and attack us 

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:48.589
 the imc of that person 

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:52.870
 why this that is right now and 

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:52.870
 it would be that global truth
