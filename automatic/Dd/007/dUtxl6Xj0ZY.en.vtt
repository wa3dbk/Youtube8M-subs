00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
have pulled his penis out on stage in

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.900 
have pulled his penis out on stage in
Miami<00:03:52.890> because<00:03:53.100> if<00:03:53.280> he<00:03:53.370> did<00:03:53.550> he<00:03:53.670> would<00:03:53.820> have

tripped so I guess that's the final
ultimate
