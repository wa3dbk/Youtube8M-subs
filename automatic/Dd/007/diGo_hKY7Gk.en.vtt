00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.460 

wanted<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.610> do<00:00:59.760> two<00:01:00.120> layers<00:01:00.330> so<00:01:00.540> for<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> first

wanted to do two layers so for the first

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.700 
wanted to do two layers so for the first
layer<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.040> focus<00:01:02.820> more<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.150> just<00:01:03.600> laying<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
layer I focus more on just laying the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.609 
layer I focus more on just laying the
colors<00:01:05.100> down<00:01:05.369> onto<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> surface<00:01:06.329> by<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.320> way

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
colors down onto the surface by the way

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.720 
colors down onto the surface by the way

this color is called I read a good book

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.830 
this color is called I read a good book
and<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:13.020> number<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> 2<00:01:13.860> 1/4<00:01:14.370> C<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.030> actually<00:01:15.510> got

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and the number is 2 1/4 C I actually got

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.530 
and the number is 2 1/4 C I actually got
this<00:01:16.050> bottle<00:01:16.440> of<00:01:16.530> nail<00:01:16.680> polish<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.460> $0.99<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540

I really love the red color

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.330 
I really love the red color
I<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.300> add<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.510> really<00:01:21.960> nice<00:01:22.560> pop<00:01:23.010> to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
I think it's add a really nice pop to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.380 
I think it's add a really nice pop to
the<00:01:23.460> bottom<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.850> my<00:01:24.000> shoes<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:26.640> way<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.150> brush

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.280 
the bottom of my shoes the way the brush
in<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:28.620> nail<00:01:28.920> polish<00:01:29.130> bottles<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.290> design

in this nail polish bottles is design

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.020 
in this nail polish bottles is design
actually<00:01:31.650> worked<00:01:32.130> very<00:01:32.280> well<00:01:32.550> to<00:01:32.880> my

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
actually worked very well to my

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.840 
actually worked very well to my
advantage<00:01:33.380> is<00:01:34.380> large<00:01:34.799> enough<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.310> me<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
advantage is large enough for me to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.180 
advantage is large enough for me to
cover<00:01:36.120> a<00:01:36.299> large<00:01:36.600> area<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.830> also<00:01:38.010> very

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
cover a large area but it's also very

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.660 
cover a large area but it's also very
flexible<00:01:39.120> so<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.380> very<00:01:40.650> precise<00:01:41.159> around

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
flexible so I can be very precise around

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.660 
flexible so I can be very precise around
the<00:01:41.880> edge<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.440> shoes<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.640> I

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the edge of the shoes you can see that I

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.240 
the edge of the shoes you can see that I
don't<00:01:44.820> really<00:01:45.299> use<00:01:45.630> any<00:01:45.990> painter<00:01:46.620> tapes<00:01:46.979> or

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
don't really use any painter tapes or

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.270 
don't really use any painter tapes or
anything<00:01:47.510> so<00:01:48.510> when<00:01:48.960> I'm<00:01:49.080> done<00:01:49.350> painting<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
anything so when I'm done painting the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.120 
anything so when I'm done painting the
first<00:01:50.670> layer<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.930> first<00:01:52.200> shoe<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.799> move

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
first layer on the first shoe and move

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.920 
first layer on the first shoe and move
on<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> second<00:01:53.940> one<00:01:53.970> before<00:01:54.299> coming<00:01:54.900> back

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
on to the second one before coming back

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.130 
on to the second one before coming back
and<00:01:55.409> put<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.830> second<00:01:56.280> layer<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
and put the second layer to it

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.480 
and put the second layer to it
especially<00:01:58.140> allow<00:01:58.619> some<00:01:58.890> time<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
especially allow some time for the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.660 
especially allow some time for the
Polish<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.210> dry

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.780 

this<00:02:05.570> is<00:02:05.810> believe<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.650> or<00:02:06.710> not<00:02:06.860> pretty<00:02:07.280> fun<00:02:07.549> and

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
this is believe it or not pretty fun and

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:25.180 
this is believe it or not pretty fun and
relaxing<00:02:08.509> try<00:02:09.050> it

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.980 

so<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.850> what<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.210> shoes<00:02:27.450> look<00:02:27.750> like

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
so this is what the shoes look like

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.260 
so this is what the shoes look like
after<00:02:28.500> two<00:02:28.860> coats<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.430> nail-polish<00:02:29.850> is

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
after two coats of the nail-polish is

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.960 
after two coats of the nail-polish is
actually<00:02:31.110> about<00:02:31.530> one<00:02:31.920> third<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.610> bottle

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
actually about one third of the bottle

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.830 
actually about one third of the bottle
