start<00:01:14.189> off<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.430> very<00:01:14.580> subtle<00:01:15.000> patterns<00:01:15.390> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
start off with very subtle patterns and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.450 
start off with very subtle patterns and
mix<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.900> with<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.140> different<00:01:16.290> colors<00:01:16.830> okay

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
mix it with like different colors okay

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.090 
mix it with like different colors okay
so<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.210> top<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.750> perfect<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:19.890> tell

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
so this top is perfect as you can tell

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.770 
so this top is perfect as you can tell
it<00:01:20.189> kind<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.580> looks<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> basic<00:01:21.479> black

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
it kind of just looks like a basic black

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.260

these will be perfect with that you and

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.149 
these will be perfect with that you and
I<00:01:45.840> used<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.439> scared<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.979> color

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
I used to be really scared of color

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.100 
I used to be really scared of color
blocking<00:01:47.460> but<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> kind<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> got<00:01:48.780> used<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.049> it

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
blocking but I kind of got used to it

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.660 
blocking but I kind of got used to it
and<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.619> all<00:01:49.740> depends<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> colors

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
and I think it all depends on the colors

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.520 
and I think it all depends on the colors
that<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.939> mix<00:01:51.149> together<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.229> that

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
that you mix together so I think that

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.260 
that you mix together so I think that
these<00:01:52.710> wedges<00:01:53.009> would<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.490> perfect<00:01:54.000> with<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
these wedges would be perfect with the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.940 
these wedges would be perfect with the
color<00:01:54.479> jeans<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.259> always<00:01:55.409> go<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.649> wedges

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
color jeans and I always go for wedges

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.950 
color jeans and I always go for wedges
instead<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.520> heels<00:01:56.729> because<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.420> don't<00:01:57.840> really

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
instead of heels because I don't really

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.999 
instead of heels because I don't really
like<00:01:58.200> heels<00:01:58.409> because<00:01:58.649> they're<00:01:58.799> very

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
like heels because they're very

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.620 
like heels because they're very
uncomfortable<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.149> wear<00:02:00.360> them<00:02:00.450> sometimes

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
uncomfortable so I wear them sometimes

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.749 
uncomfortable so I wear them sometimes
but<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.170> prefer<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.829> wedges<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.640> that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
but I prefer the wedges and I think that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.969 
but I prefer the wedges and I think that
this<00:02:02.880> color<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:03.990> complements<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.680> jeans

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
this color really complements the jeans

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.140 
this color really complements the jeans
perfect

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
perfect

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.680 
perfect

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.970 
you want to try it on yes so share said
that<00:02:12.810> she<00:02:12.960> needed<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.320> little<00:02:13.470> bit<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.770> help

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
that she needed a little bit of help

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.040 
that she needed a little bit of help
mixing<00:02:14.400> colors<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.970> patterns<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.540> her<00:02:15.660> outfit

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
mixing colors and patterns in her outfit

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.110 
mixing colors and patterns in her outfit
and<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.470> really<00:02:16.860> liked<00:02:17.070> this<00:02:17.280> first<00:02:17.490> outfit<00:02:17.940> cuz

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
and I really liked this first outfit cuz

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.760 
and I really liked this first outfit cuz
I<00:02:18.210> think<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.510> does<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.810> really<00:02:18.990> well<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.470> think

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
I think it does that really well I think

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.920 
I think it does that really well I think
the<00:02:20.070> lace<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.850> black<00:02:21.120> top<00:02:21.420> kind<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.780> gives

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the lace on the black top kind of gives

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.110 
the lace on the black top kind of gives
it<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.110> nice<00:02:22.290> pattern<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.980> then<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.850> color

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
it a nice pattern and then the color

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.940 
it a nice pattern and then the color
jeans<00:02:24.510> look<00:02:24.720> absolutely<00:02:25.110> gorgeous<00:02:25.470> with<00:02:25.800> this

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
jeans look absolutely gorgeous with this

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.590 
jeans look absolutely gorgeous with this
outfit<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.880> think<00:02:27.060> because<00:02:27.180> she's<00:02:27.420> so

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
outfit and I think because she's so

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.660 
outfit and I think because she's so
petite<00:02:27.780> skinny<00:02:28.290> jeans<00:02:28.590> look<00:02:28.860> great<00:02:29.400> on<00:02:29.430> her

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
petite skinny jeans look great on her

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.970 
petite skinny jeans look great on her
figure<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.570> also<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.380> we<00:02:31.560> kind<00:02:31.830> of

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
figure and I also like that we kind of

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.440 
figure and I also like that we kind of
encourage<00:02:32.340> her<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.610> color-block<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.150> little

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
encourage her to color-block a little

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.300 
encourage her to color-block a little
bit<00:02:33.540> more<00:02:33.750> by<00:02:33.960> adding<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.560> cool<00:02:34.740> wedges<00:02:35.130> that

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
bit more by adding the cool wedges that

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.250 
bit more by adding the cool wedges that
we<00:02:35.430> put<00:02:35.610> without<00:02:35.790> fit<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.660> love<00:02:36.900> outfit
