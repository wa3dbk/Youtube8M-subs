00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.670
 good evaluation because we are here in 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.379
 a new video and well then this time 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.910
 I bring a boxing of several things that I 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.039
 I bought and such for the channel and good 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.020
 Well, I wanted to teach them. 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.759
 first of all it's going to be a command that 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.230
 has caught Xbox that teaches it by 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.060
 twitter the other day and people said that 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.070
 is the one that has bought the most, but 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.900
 as you see is not that it is a control of xbox 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.820
 but that but it has microsoft control 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.980
 for windows and such that is a command 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.070
 of xbox for the computer we could 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.930
 say okay since lately I have 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.500
 a lot of computer games but 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.470
 what happens that I want to record but between 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.210
 It's hard for me to start working 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.860
 record on the computer since it's more 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.390
 complicated than console consumption before 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.880
 you play you play for the catcher there 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.010
 is between that and that I have to 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.839
 play with the keyboard 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.280
 I'm too lazy 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.739
 buy educating to play with 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.750
 mandolin I do not know what I feel like more 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.239
 to record the truth is that I feel like playing 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.699
 and record of pc preses or keyboard and 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.560
 that gives me a lot of stick then I prefer 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.810
 play with command like as of all the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.340
 life has been doing and then nothing 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.430
 obviously this is not going to play 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.100
 online games on the computer from the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.659
 they go with a keyboard and 14 fuck good 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.560
 Well, to play online games, yes, 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.110
 I prefer the console 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.539
 this I will use it because it is not going to play something 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.460
 against random or online but that is 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.490
 with friends that are not white the duty 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.920
 So then, see if I can get rid of him 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.010
 the sticks of mushrooms that my mother fuck 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.540
 not good but has dominated 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.730
 to see why another sticker had 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.360
 recharged the cardboard and thinking about opening it 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.360
 Let's see 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.740
 about more lives stickers jobs 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.630
 and well, there are three things that 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.080
 I want to teach first adding on this 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.080
 after 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.600
 to my brother 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.850
 once now here 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.940
 with xavi this 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.290
 and this will be to reinstall it in the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.579
 computer and I do not have disk drives and 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.579
 take off my diapers as I can 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.650
 let's say this 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.020
 ok you ask me for cable because it happened 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.560
 of buying a battery-powered remote that I do not know 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.010
 Why it is flatter and look better 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.810
 or simply adding from usb has 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.340
 here a lot of cable the truth 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.620
 not very long but good too 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.860
 and here we have possibly a command of 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.160
 xbox so it comes well adapted with 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.010
 the disk closed in the computer and such and 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.510
 nothing then the truth quite comfortable I 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.569
 just use play controls but well 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.099
 of xbox either is not that it is so 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.959
 difficult is worth it I control it more or less 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.549
 so then to remove to play at 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.860
 computer with this I will spend some 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.420
 four to upload them to the second channel and 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.040
 that I have some games I have a hundred and 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.019
 I say games now because they have happened to us 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.400
 and I have many that I would like to play 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.860
 if such and some will rise the second 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.019
 channel some it does not come out in plan 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.670
 fun with friends with the first channel 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.280
 also and well well here you have 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.810
 basically the command for the computer 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.329
 that I got caught to be able to play 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.900
 record and all that I'm going to leave it here 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:31.310
 Well, here we have the book and such is not 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.340
 very important if it was not following 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.069
 here we have a command for the wii vale 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.540
 because I want to play because 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.740
 example when I come now I hope with my 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.320
 sister 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.820
 or good with more people because maybe it comes 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.230
 does not want to play or whatever it is for 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.430
 to be able to play two people so that 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.140
 true that it is a game that is very 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.090
 entertaining that I love to play 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.040
 online as you already know how to build up 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.070
 to the channel and such but well then I like 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.250
 play with two people the truth work 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.200
 very funny so I need a command and 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.750
 Well, I'm going to open it here and 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.340
 that you see, they have wrapped a little more 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.470
 it's the truth 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.720
 but good 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.280
 to doubt forever amazon 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.280
 buy all things by amazon 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.480
 inside the cables yes 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.850
 this ball is shorter 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.040
 for Perez it's wireless is worth this 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.030
 it would be just to load it then here 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.030
 we have the command of the wii 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.050
 ie looking 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.249
 what difference and who puts the lever 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.409
 there are buttons because we are going 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:53.959
 practically the same from behind is 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:05:01.489
 practically the same rt are also 

00:04:53.959 --> 00:05:04.279
 equal to all of them then it's worth here 

00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:06.289
 we have the command of the wii the truth that 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:09.619
 it's pretty comfortable is practically 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:12.949
 like how the xbox is worth and nothing 

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:16.369
 Well, here you see that he has a battery and Carlos 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.049
 since it's wireless around here you're 

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:19.999
 can assign the controls has been added 

00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:22.099
 goals here we have the controls to see 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:23.709
 is that we are quite comfortable 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:27.750
 there is no place to run that guide the 

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:29.910
 it would have to be that good if it's comfortable 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.310
 so nothing then here we have your command 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.660
 of the wii to play with friends and upload 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.650
 videos and the truth is that pretty 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.020
 cool 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.150
 then the last little thing that we have 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.710
 I've got two, but one is for 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.400
 a million words you're worth to us 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.580
 we have caught that good is a hard drive 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.750
 what is called ssd is worth what advantages 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.030
 this hard drive the truth that they are 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.370
 quite expensive that's why it only catches us 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.389
 120 gigas as you will see one for me and another 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.389
 for brass ter as I said 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.520
 what is characteristic of the 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.990
 hard disks because they are hard disks of 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.900
 high speed what does this mean 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.020
 For example, not only have we not 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.939
 bought to put it on the computer and 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.469
 we will assign it for all 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.689
 important programs and the system 

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:16.729
 windows the windows 7 surely I 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:20.150
 I installed what we're going to put in here 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:22.490
 It is worth for what then I am going to have 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.469
 on my computer the normal hard drive that 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.599
 has a theme to put in there all 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:28.430
 the videos all the things all the 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.810
 thumbnails all the things that go 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.240
 making youtube what in the other 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.710
 great all the games where that and this 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.659
 I'm going to reserve it to get 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.370
 the operating system the most 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.770
 important that I use as sony vegas the 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.690
 photoshop and all that to go a lot 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.370
 faster because like I said a disk 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.860
 hard high speed then it's 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.150
 rather more expensive but it has that 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.650
 when I put the operating system here 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.690
 I must do computers that will 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.250
 start much faster because it's going to 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.680
 run the programs much faster 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.479
 will render much faster if I put 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.430
 there the video files all that and 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.510
 well then 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.490
 basically sexual so that the 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.260
 computer work me much faster 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.490
 nothing more goals as the operating system 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.050
 everything is going to be much more fluid 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.820
 computer will have much more speed 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.680
 at the time of starting and all that and good 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.270
 Well to be youtuber is an advantage 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.280
 pretty big that all those functions 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.470
 of important programs because the 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.820
 do at a high speed so nothing 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.340
 it's worth after, it's just that 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.040
 here you are going to put someone to 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.810
 that you finally see all things 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.040
 that I 've got caught and well 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.270
 just do to teach it and 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.620
 we have informed you that yes 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.260
 like to be taught all these little things 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:34.880
 when I bought it and such and nothing 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:37.050
 well here you have it here right here 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.580
 here you have already we have three new 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.310
 tools for the channel that are going to 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.690
 give therefore a speed and therefore a better 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.610
 management and some better videos for the 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.960
 channel in some aspects 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.490
 so he spent the prices that he has 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.930
 cost to be sent where live 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.710
 favorites and until next time 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.710
 bye
