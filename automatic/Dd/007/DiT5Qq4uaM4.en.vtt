00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.259
 but this is one of the president's first essays 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.729
 in the second act of the Swan Lake 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.079
 with alexander shadows 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.269
 the former technician as the ebro valley 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.489
 It's a law that I learned in Leningrad 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.970
 dom that is dominating for 25 years 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.539
 gold reserve this trial 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.539
 You can know what I look for in a good couple 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.080
 Height is very important 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.980
 but the proportion is more 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.850
 it seems as if we were 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 well I'm rather low 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.340
 but proportionally appropriate for a tall dancer like sasha 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.490
 he is very sensitive 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.300
 I feel like in tickets 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.910
 watch the video the movement and at the same time so I find 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.480
 engineer 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.600
 I have the thermal feeling with one finger is enough to put me in balance 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 2 can 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.420
 slowly 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.950
 I am not here 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.290
 and that with a little more slowly 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.100
 let him show his back 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.960
 with a little bit this movement comes in May 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.740
 behind 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.080
 check and music please the last time 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.970
 a little more to the left now too much 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.670
 here very sad commented 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.670
 from here it is very difficult and so it happened with me 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.000
 something that I have to move 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.040
 I think I have to move like this 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.440
 that's better 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.590
 it's better 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.590
 it is easier 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.159
 congo 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.999
 some couples have some strength 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:53.069
 physically they are perfect and can elevate the dancer very high 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.519
 but when you lower it if you do not control your weight as she descends 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.519
 the dancer seems clumsy and heavy 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:06.599
 it is not very important as a high stowaway the dancer or the height or quoted if not 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.039
 how to control your weight and those that are gravid as you go down 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.079
 do not drop the weight once 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.349
 have to keep holding my body while destiny 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.349
 still helping in terms of direction 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.219
 the following address 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.219
 so I feel comfortable and comfortable 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.719
 no no no no 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.799
 a 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:54.469
 only the more than a thousand couples are completely safe 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.019
 but I need a partner that we never require what I can not move 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.289
 we have to give the feeling that 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:03.369
 that something is by myself 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:06.369
 that he does not handle me 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:14.229
 You have to press your hands gently on my waist without pressing 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.279
 that gives me a sense of security 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.309
 of correct balance 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:22.919
 and at the same time there has to be a distance between the dancer and her partner 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.330
 already very close 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.189
 so that they can move freely with the top of the 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:34.189
 torso 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:45.439
 recorded
