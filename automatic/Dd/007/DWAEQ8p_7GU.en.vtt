00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.280
 U 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.139
 to 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:26.619
 Yes, you guys have been able to solve the problems of the pre-fair espt 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.290
 Because this time is the first time, how is the composition of the whole lecture 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.130
 I'm telling you if it's there or what its characteristics are. 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.140
 Every day you are preparing so hard, you will be tested on a feature called est . 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.760
 Let's take a look at that. 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.379
 I will also tell you how to get ready for this time. 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.720
 I'm headed over. 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.580
 Overall, this shows that the course is giving a key strategy scores by John Part 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.780
 We are aiming 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.589
 What should consider whether scores go up once the various commitments secrets 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.129
 I saw it. 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:02.019
 I will pass on all of you generously. 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.800
 Now and then, the party * Exercise problem Take a look at each of the 6 questions per lecture 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.360
 Will 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.870
 And since you've signed up on good issues, 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:16.180
 Maybe you can get everything you want . 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:19.780
 I will look at the two issues, not one of them. 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.230
 Sometimes this is because you will be content that it opposed 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.880
 There will be a lot of help when you're ready . 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:32.440
 Now, as I continued to say , 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:36.820
 Probably because it exposes the problems daetdeon questions to you will tell your offering 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.810
 I think that this is the most effective way for you to prepare. 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.680
 Try 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.670
 As you prepare for this lecture, what do you want to do? 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.650
 I saw it. 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.550
 The most important thing is to analyze what problems have emerged in the test so far 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.560
 I guess. 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:57.610
 So how do you sort out the good spelling problems and how 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.020
 I have a strategy to see if I can get a high score. 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:06.750
 You also pushes us a little more upright Please enter your ears 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.489
 jsp called second test but know, because the timepiece is ready 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.470
 It consists of nine parts. 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:19.150
 And the number of problems will solve 14 problems and 30 minutes. 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:23.140
 I do not have time to prepare myself and answer. 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:28.569
 When the video is finished Can you just need to start Answers 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:32.650
 There is a limited response time who you are you ready for this reason usually 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.390
 It is Jesus who is the most important speaking test ever . 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.220
 You can think of it. 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:43.150
 Because you can not instantly think what to do with the answer 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:47.200
 And now you have enough thinking about the anticipated problem. 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.930
 This problem may come out, but I am prepared to answer 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.400
 I'll have to do it normally. 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.900
 So let's just briefly explain the parts that are being watched this time . 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.330
 Let's give it a try. 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:04.630
 Question 5 of 60 indeyo quest ends when you answer the questioner cloth of Jesus and you 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:09.670
 It is such a very simple question to be able to 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.600
 What personal information in question also contribute my experience these information's also hard to come 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.570
 I do not. 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:19.120
 How to look too short because the simple problem is worse, finishing errors 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.360
 You should be careful that you can. 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.670
 There's no time for preparation. 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:31.570
 And with the Jesus Screening City Hall Parties, the two questions will be summed up and ten seconds 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:35.970
 It is a principle to answer each time 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:41.980
 Okay, so how do we get into this party's party? 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:47.980
 I need to clarify Jesus and old age from the beginning. 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:53.110
 English speak Korean in order to talk a little bit dalrayo is an introduction to its first 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:58.090
 The next important thing to do is to come to the conclusion. 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:01.180
 English doegoyo not you think I'm grading into whether the thing Jesus wants 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:06.070
 Well, once you get that clear, 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.790
 You know that English is a two-part ceremony. 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.280
 You have to. 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:16.600
 For Release 2 seniors not clearly gave to express their opinions is important then 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.080
 The part is over.Another explanation for that is that you can do it now . 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.080
 Do not forget it
