00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
flat 6 flat 13 then the first string

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.860 
flat 6 flat 13 then the first string
open<00:00:34.809> is<00:00:35.050> your<00:00:35.170> flat<00:00:35.410> to<00:00:35.680> your<00:00:35.920> flat<00:00:36.130> 9<00:00:36.870> so

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
open is your flat to your flat 9 so

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.630 
open is your flat to your flat 9 so
we're<00:00:37.990> back<00:00:38.170> to<00:00:38.230> that<00:00:38.410> altar<00:00:38.800> dominant

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
we're back to that altar dominant

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.050 
we're back to that altar dominant
situation<00:00:41.070> now<00:00:42.070> you<00:00:42.130> can<00:00:42.340> see<00:00:42.580> that<00:00:42.730> I've<00:00:42.850> also

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
situation now you can see that I've also

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.590 
situation now you can see that I've also
included<00:00:43.360> a<00:00:44.190> little<00:00:45.190> chart<00:00:45.520> where<00:00:45.820> we<00:00:45.970> look<00:00:46.480> at

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
included a little chart where we look at

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.560 
included a little chart where we look at
the<00:00:46.690> notes<00:00:46.930> in<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.230> cord<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.940> scale<00:00:49.210> degrees

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
the notes in the cord what scale degrees

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.440 
the notes in the cord what scale degrees
they<00:00:49.840> are<00:00:49.990> and<00:00:50.530> then<00:00:51.370> by<00:00:51.760> color-coding<00:00:52.120> you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
they are and then by color-coding you

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.030 
they are and then by color-coding you
can<00:00:52.600> clearly<00:00:52.810> see<00:00:53.110> how<00:00:53.290> you<00:00:53.350> add<00:00:53.650> the<00:00:53.890> other

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
can clearly see how you add the other

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.950 
can clearly see how you add the other
notes<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.579> for<00:00:54.760> whatever<00:00:55.150> scalar<00:00:55.570> scales

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
notes to for whatever scalar scales

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.740 
notes to for whatever scalar scales
you're<00:00:56.079> going<00:00:56.200> to<00:00:56.260> play<00:00:56.410> against<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:58.180> any<00:00:58.480> time

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
you're going to play against so any time

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.360 
you're going to play against so any time
we've<00:00:58.989> had<00:00:59.140> one<00:00:59.320> of<00:00:59.380> these<00:00:59.440> altered<00:00:59.860> dominance

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
we've had one of these altered dominance

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.250 
we've had one of these altered dominance
by<00:01:00.640> nature<00:01:01.060> of<00:01:01.150> this<00:01:01.270> chord<00:01:01.720> we<00:01:02.110> have<00:01:02.230> a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
by nature of this chord we have a

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.900 
by nature of this chord we have a
natural<00:01:02.680> fifth<00:01:03.010> right<00:01:03.370> there<00:01:03.520> on<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.640> fifth

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
natural fifth right there on the fifth

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.240 
natural fifth right there on the fifth
string<00:01:04.500> that's<00:01:05.500> always<00:01:05.740> going<00:01:05.829> to<00:01:05.920> clash<00:01:06.220> with

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
string that's always going to clash with

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.969 
string that's always going to clash with
super<00:01:06.790> Locrian<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:08.200> couple<00:01:08.439> other<00:01:08.620> altered

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
super Locrian and a couple other altered

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.430 
super Locrian and a couple other altered
dominant<00:01:09.370> scale<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.960> know<00:01:11.080> you<00:01:11.140> have<00:01:11.409> a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
dominant scale so you know you have a

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.840 
dominant scale so you know you have a
situation<00:01:11.680> where<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:12.250> might<00:01:12.400> want<00:01:12.640> to<00:01:12.729> delete

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
situation where you might want to delete

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.540 
situation where you might want to delete
that<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:13.810> truly<00:01:14.110> stay<00:01:14.440> in<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:15.100> key<00:01:15.310> now<00:01:15.490> I

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
that to truly stay in the key now I

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.730 
that to truly stay in the key now I
showed<00:01:15.820> you<00:01:15.940> some<00:01:16.120> situations<00:01:16.690> where<00:01:16.870> we

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
showed you some situations where we

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.390 
showed you some situations where we
would<00:01:17.890> enhance<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:19.090> dominant<00:01:19.690> flavor<00:01:20.400> by

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
would enhance that dominant flavor by

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.950 
would enhance that dominant flavor by
putting<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.790> fourth<00:01:22.060> string<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:22.570> underneath

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
putting the fourth string and underneath

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.450 
putting the fourth string and underneath
your<00:01:23.049> index<00:01:23.409> finger<00:01:23.680> bar<00:01:23.890> they<00:01:24.159> gave<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:24.370> the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
your index finger bar they gave you the

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.480 
your index finger bar they gave you the
flat<00:01:24.670> 7<00:01:25.060> so<00:01:25.180> then<00:01:25.330> your<00:01:25.860> 4th<00:01:26.860> string<00:01:27.159> ended<00:01:27.400> up

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
flat 7 so then your 4th string ended up

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.210 
flat 7 so then your 4th string ended up
being<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.729> flat<00:01:27.970> 7<00:01:28.530> they<00:01:29.530> could<00:01:29.710> do<00:01:29.860> this<00:01:30.040> on

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
being a flat 7 they could do this on

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.550 
being a flat 7 they could do this on
this

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
this

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.249

this particular voicing but i'm going to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.710 
this particular voicing but i'm going to
show<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.500> another<00:01:34.829> variation<00:01:35.390> if<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.570> want

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
show you another variation if you want

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.359 
show you another variation if you want
to<00:01:36.810> get<00:01:36.899> rid<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> fifth<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.649> together<00:01:37.920> and

you're<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.329> dominant

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
for soloing over this i would suggest

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.559 
for soloing over this i would suggest
just<00:02:21.770> go<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.040> play<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.550> flat<00:02:22.849> minor<00:02:23.120> pentatonic

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
just go and play a flat minor pentatonic

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.320 
just go and play a flat minor pentatonic
over<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.380> flat<00:02:24.800> minor<00:02:25.040> chord<00:02:25.489> or<00:02:26.620> Dorian

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
over the a flat minor chord or Dorian

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.640 
over the a flat minor chord or Dorian
orale<00:02:31.480> now<00:02:32.480> all<00:02:32.660> these<00:02:32.810> scales<00:02:33.110> are<00:02:33.290> charted

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
orale now all these scales are charted

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.020 
orale now all these scales are charted
out<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.040> can<00:02:34.160> find<00:02:34.430> what<00:02:34.580> scale<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:34.880> want

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
out so you can find what scale you want

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.949 
out so you can find what scale you want
to<00:02:35.090> fit<00:02:35.239> over<00:02:35.270> there<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.600> we're<00:02:35.690> gonna<00:02:35.780> play<00:02:35.930> a

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
to fit over there and we're gonna play a

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.780 
to fit over there and we're gonna play a
medium<00:02:36.770> tempo<00:02:37.540> prove<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:40.280> then<00:02:40.430> when<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.550> go<00:02:40.760> up

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
medium tempo prove and then when I go up

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.400 
medium tempo prove and then when I go up

going to play the super Locrian mode and

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.090 
going to play the super Locrian mode and

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
remember that the super Locrian mode is

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.340 
remember that the super Locrian mode is
mode<00:02:52.340> 7<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.060> melodic<00:02:53.540> minor<00:02:53.720> that's<00:02:54.140> the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
mode 7 of the melodic minor that's the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.199 
mode 7 of the melodic minor that's the
one<00:02:54.709> way<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.890> see<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:55.940> have<00:02:56.180> your

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
one way to see it so you have your

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.150 
one way to see it so you have your
scales<00:02:56.630> all<00:02:56.840> plotted<00:02:57.260> out<00:02:59.709> it<00:03:00.709> would<00:03:00.830> be<00:03:00.920> wise

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
scales all plotted out it would be wise

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.979 
scales all plotted out it would be wise
for<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.700> see<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.209> a-flat<00:03:02.600> minor

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
for you to see the a-flat minor

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.229 
for you to see the a-flat minor
pentatonic<00:03:03.590> scale<00:03:04.100> in<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.310> same<00:03:04.519> vicinity<00:03:04.850> so

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
pentatonic scale in the same vicinity so

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.190 
pentatonic scale in the same vicinity so
that<00:03:05.930> would<00:03:06.080> be<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.260> fifth<00:03:06.620> string<00:03:06.830> group<00:03:08.200> if

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
that would be the fifth string group if

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.420 
that would be the fifth string group if
you<00:03:09.410> do<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.650> blues<00:03:15.100> so<00:03:16.100> i'll<00:03:16.190> go<00:03:16.280> ahead<00:03:16.310> and

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
you do the blues so i'll go ahead and

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.309 
you do the blues so i'll go ahead and
diagram<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.060> diagram<00:03:17.630> goes<00:03:17.810> out<00:03:17.989> for<00:03:18.230> this

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
diagram the diagram goes out for this

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.009 
diagram the diagram goes out for this
particular<00:03:18.500> example<00:03:19.660> let's<00:03:20.660> just<00:03:20.840> play

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
particular example let's just play

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.030 
particular example let's just play
against<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.470> now<00:03:21.560> i'm<00:03:21.620> going<00:03:21.709> to<00:03:21.799> play<00:03:21.920> the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
against it now i'm going to play the

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.729 
against it now i'm going to play the
chords<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.640> you<00:03:23.359> should<00:03:23.540> practice<00:03:23.739> soloing

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
chords and you should practice soloing

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.620 
chords and you should practice soloing
over<00:03:24.829> this<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.579> i'm<00:03:26.060> going<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.209> use<00:03:26.390> this

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
over this and i'm going to use this

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.520 
over this and i'm going to use this
structure<00:03:27.109> because<00:03:27.859> if<00:03:27.980> we<00:03:28.100> use<00:03:28.340> an<00:03:28.720> e-form<00:03:29.720> we

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
structure because if we use an e-form we

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.080 
structure because if we use an e-form we
have<00:03:30.650> at<00:03:30.739> natural<00:03:31.130> fit<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.519> doesn't<00:03:31.820> impart

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
have at natural fit that doesn't impart

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.340 
have at natural fit that doesn't impart
the<00:03:32.269> flavor<00:03:32.299> and<00:03:32.630> we<00:03:32.780> actually<00:03:33.019> have<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.170> note

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
the flavor and we actually have a note

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.870 
the flavor and we actually have a note
that<00:03:33.500> doesn't<00:03:33.769> fit<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.100> i<00:03:34.130> suggest<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:34.579> also

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
that doesn't fit and i suggest you also

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.699 
that doesn't fit and i suggest you also
try<00:03:35.150> this<00:03:35.420> back<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:36.109> those<00:03:36.260> other<00:03:36.440> two

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
try this back on those other two

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.000 
try this back on those other two
situations<00:03:37.370> which<00:03:38.120> were<00:03:38.359> be<00:03:38.720> flat<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.709> flat

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
situations which were be flat and a flat

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.770 
situations which were be flat and a flat
where<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.370> had<00:03:40.579> an<00:03:40.760> altered<00:03:41.390> dominant

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
where you had an altered dominant

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.270 
where you had an altered dominant
situation<00:03:42.290> using<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.620> super<00:03:42.799> Locrian<00:03:43.250> mode

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
situation using the super Locrian mode

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.250 
situation using the super Locrian mode
that<00:03:43.700> way<00:03:43.760> everything<00:03:43.940> lines<00:03:44.239> up<00:03:44.480> so<00:03:45.049> here<00:03:45.230> we

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
that way everything lines up so here we

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.350 
that way everything lines up so here we
go
