00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.580
 Sobriety and its armor nature 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.830
 hates a vacuum so someone has to 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.740
 continue the fight but that would matter 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.740
 the armor harold shapiro gent of dénia 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.540

 Air Force pilot who fought 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.110
 in vietnam and there he meets tony after 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.360
 that he creates the armor when 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.970
 escape from danger rod and it becomes the 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.130
 personal pilot Tony Over 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.590
 time their first encounter is passed to 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.390
 designated conflict of being tony 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.770
 manages to recover and created a new 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.200
 nickname armor 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.910
 century for its red scheme with silver 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.520
 used for the first time in the armors 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.899
 with it faces obed hay stein 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.970
 who has built an armor called 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.080
 fix on hose with the planes that you 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.070
 stole to star 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.280
 also beat stein and this one 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.490
 this was a bittersweet ending for his 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.170
 next great adventure is arnold words in 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.180
 this story stars discovers that several 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.119
 villains in armor have stolen his 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.010
 technology and decides to destroy it what 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.619
 get in big trouble with the 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.080
 American government and with his best friend 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.640
 the america captain with him activate the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.220
 armor that the guards use 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.250
 the pressure called robot and the armors 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.360
 of the commands of this war this 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.780
 ends when the American government 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.320
 sends to fire fire to arrest hernán in 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.850
 true 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.730
 these armor clashes with 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.190
 armor tend to be so tired I know 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.820
 they want to emulate the medieval tournaments 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.260
 but 50 years of the same is too your 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.270
 next conflict is more internal than 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.480
 almost outside one of its many 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.940
 angry lovers after their abandonment 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.290
 shoot him and leave him for time this 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.180
 makes them depend a lot on their armor 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.740
 since he refuses to use a chair 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.870
 wheels or in your case a wheelchair 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.670
 time later toni manages to recover his 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.610
 movement as it accomplishes good we can 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.230
 spend hours talking times just tell them 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.670
 that this involves the creation of a 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.860
 microchip that he puts on his spine 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.660
 dorsal to be able to achieve its movement 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.880
 that pretends to be dead a few months 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.860
 while he recovers during this time 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.980
 body takes control of stark 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.130
 enterprises and use the nickname armor 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.690
 war machine get on and create 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.250
 specifically for him two stories 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.100
 very important in the saga of iron man 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.760
 they are extremis and mia 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.080
 favorite board and before 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.690
 ask if I 'm not going to jump 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.060
 history of the crossing where the 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.370
 villain and they know they have to go 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.740
 to the past to look for a tony star 16 years 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.080
 to bring it to the present good but the 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.220
 present of the avengers but the future 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.960
 from him to be the present or the future and 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.220
 I also refuse to talk about ge over the 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.980
 world 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.780
 when we're not going to talk about that in 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.060
 extremis from warren ellis and say 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.440
 tony stark I discovered that all the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.240
 technology that is getting inside 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.400
 the armor is slowing it down and 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.840
 This causes heavy loses several tony 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.460
 fights against a terrorist is 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.240
 using a new technology called 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.890
 extremis that makes him a superhuman to 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.630
 day of the series tone uses this same 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.730
 technology to become one with your 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.520
 armor and in that way be able to beat 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.350
 the evils unfortunately in his 50 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.350
 years of existence ironman has not had 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.520
 many representations in other media 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.830
 had an appearance in the caricature to 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.540
 times for oranges amazing friends and 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.280
 super fan caricature in the 90s is 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:32.070
 as part of the action marvel now 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.509
 this caricature that used pity at the end 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.979
 fortunately in 2008 for the 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.960
 distributors with heart and pictures 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.330
 they take a great risk producing the 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.180
 sand movie with a little director 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.340
 known jon rauch and starred by a 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.460
 an actor whom the public had forgotten 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.139
 Robert Downey in June was undoubtedly a 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.030
 great risk but everything had an end 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.250
 happy with this movie he turned to the 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.139
 highest grossing the summer was the 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.289
 highest grossing until it came out dark 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:02.229
 knight nobody won anybody donates 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.030
 Not only did they have great success with 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.310
 the movie but they also used it to 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.210
 launch the cinematic universe of marvel 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.140
 something you want has not been able to match 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.750
 something very curious about the personification 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.760
 by Tony Stark and Iron Man Robert Downey 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.889
 junior is the sense of humor and 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.629
 irreverence with the boot 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.509
 that part of the characterization of 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:25.819
 tourists is total invention of downing and 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.810
 honestly it is something very accepted since 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:30.050
 the character in the comics is 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.240
 incredibly boring and more if 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.490
