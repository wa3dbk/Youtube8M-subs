for today I'd like to give you just an
overview<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.140> base<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:15.619> that<00:01:15.650> if<00:01:15.920> you're<00:01:16.430> a

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
overview of the base so that if you're a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.010 
overview of the base so that if you're a
beginner<00:01:16.700> or<00:01:17.000> relative<00:01:17.420> beginner<00:01:17.689> you<00:01:17.840> really

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
beginner or relative beginner you really

beginner or relative beginner you really
start<00:01:18.229> to<00:01:18.259> understand<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.890> instrument<00:01:19.310> how

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
start to understand the instrument how

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.760 
start to understand the instrument how
its<00:01:19.670> put<00:01:19.880> together<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:20.360> why<00:01:20.990> it's<00:01:21.470> put

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
its put together and why it's put

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.260 
its put together and why it's put
together<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.159> way<00:01:22.280> it<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.460> this<00:01:23.000> is<00:01:23.120> really

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
together the way it is this is really

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.540 
together the way it is this is really
important<00:01:23.659> because<00:01:23.690> as<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.230> bass<00:01:24.500> player<00:01:24.550> sound

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
important because as a bass player sound

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.490 
important because as a bass player sound
is<00:01:25.820> one<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.060> our<00:01:26.150> primary<00:01:26.480> contributions<00:01:27.290> to<00:01:27.470> a

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
is one of our primary contributions to a

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.460 
is one of our primary contributions to a
band<00:01:27.740> sound<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.460> time<00:01:28.730> a<00:01:28.760> good<00:01:29.150> time<00:01:29.210> feel<00:01:29.780> and

band sound and time a good time feel and
if<00:01:30.680> you're<00:01:30.800> on<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.920> session<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.550> sad<00:01:31.790> of

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
if you're on a session and the sad of

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.219 
if you're on a session and the sad of
your<00:01:32.030> base<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.210> happening<00:01:32.810> you're<00:01:33.140> already

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
your base is happening you're already

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.590 
your base is happening you're already
fifty<00:01:33.680> percent<00:01:33.950> there<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.180> base<00:01:35.330> I've<00:01:35.479> got

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
fifty percent there so the base I've got

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.570 
fifty percent there so the base I've got
in<00:01:35.690> my<00:01:35.780> hands<00:01:35.960> today<00:01:36.130> this<00:01:37.130> is<00:01:37.250> one<00:01:37.430> of<00:01:37.460> the

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
in my hands today this is one of the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.250 
in my hands today this is one of the
earliest<00:01:37.909> designs<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.390> bass<00:01:38.540> guitars<00:01:38.900> and

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
earliest designs of bass guitars and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.840 
earliest designs of bass guitars and
this<00:01:39.500> instrument<00:01:40.070> was<00:01:40.130> made<00:01:40.310> in<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.460> mid<00:01:40.670> 60s

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
this instrument was made in the mid 60s

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.260 
this instrument was made in the mid 60s
and<00:01:41.330> in<00:01:42.260> fact<00:01:42.560> this<00:01:42.710> design<00:01:43.159> in<00:01:43.520> its<00:01:43.970> primary

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
and in fact this design in its primary

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.050 
and in fact this design in its primary
form<00:01:44.659> came<00:01:44.870> out<00:01:44.990> in<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.110> 1950s<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.040> then<00:01:46.760> as

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
form came out in the 1950s and then as

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.590 
form came out in the 1950s and then as
it<00:01:47.240> developed<00:01:47.720> into<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:48.080> 1960s<00:01:49.210> we<00:01:50.210> see<00:01:50.420> that

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
it developed into the 1960s we see that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.000 
it developed into the 1960s we see that
two<00:01:51.020> pickups<00:01:51.470> became<00:01:52.370> quite<00:01:53.210> often<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.540> norm

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
two pickups became quite often the norm

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.560 
two pickups became quite often the norm
and<00:01:55.010> you<00:01:55.100> can<00:01:55.250> see<00:01:55.430> there's<00:01:55.640> a<00:01:55.700> some<00:01:56.150> controls

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
and you can see there's a some controls

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.539 
and you can see there's a some controls
here<00:01:56.870> as<00:01:57.140> well<00:01:57.890> which<00:01:58.100> we're<00:01:58.220> going<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.400> talk

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
here as well which we're going to talk

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.039 
here as well which we're going to talk
about<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:59.030> let's<00:01:59.060> actually<00:01:59.330> start<00:01:59.510> to<00:01:59.690> look<00:01:59.900> at

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
about so let's actually start to look at

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.680 
about so let's actually start to look at
this<00:02:00.170> base<00:02:00.409> in<00:02:00.590> some<00:02:00.770> more<00:02:00.860> detail<00:02:01.450> so<00:02:02.450> first

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
this base in some more detail so first

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.420 
this base in some more detail so first
of<00:02:02.840> all<00:02:02.900> we<00:02:03.110> can<00:02:03.380> see<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.650> is<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.860> 4-string

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
of all we can see this is a 4-string

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.430 
of all we can see this is a 4-string
bass<00:02:04.600> even<00:02:05.600> today<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.990> fourth<00:02:06.229> string

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
bass even today the fourth string

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.289

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
players believe the force you really has

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.780 
players believe the force you really has
to<00:02:14.290> kind<00:02:15.290> like<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.560> best<00:02:15.739> sound<00:02:16.040> certainly<00:02:16.700> on

to kind like the best sound certainly on

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.490 
to kind like the best sound certainly on
the<00:02:16.909> lower<00:02:17.090> string<00:02:17.390> on<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.540> E<00:02:17.569> string<00:02:17.989> we're

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
the lower string on the E string we're

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.660 
the lower string on the E string we're
going<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.680> talk<00:02:18.799> about<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:19.099> more<00:02:19.159> to<00:02:19.519> in

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
going to talk about that more to in

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.970 
going to talk about that more to in
comparison<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.200> let's<00:02:21.379> look<00:02:21.439> at<00:02:21.590> how<00:02:21.680> its<00:02:21.860> put

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
comparison so let's look at how its put

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.830 
comparison so let's look at how its put
together<00:02:22.129> and<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.910> components<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.480> make<00:02:23.720> up

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
together and the components that make up

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.230 
together and the components that make up
a<00:02:23.959> bass<00:02:24.110> guitar<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:25.580> let's<00:02:25.760> have<00:02:25.849> a<00:02:25.940> look<00:02:25.970> at

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
a bass guitar so let's have a look at

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.650 
a bass guitar so let's have a look at
the<00:02:26.330> individual<00:02:26.750> components<00:02:26.900> of

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
the individual components of

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.350 
the individual components of
typical<00:02:27.990> bass<00:02:28.170> guitar<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.790> working<00:02:30.060> for<00:02:30.270> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
typical bass guitar so working for the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.040 
typical bass guitar so working for the
bottom<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.810> base<00:02:31.400> we<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.520> see<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.900> is

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
bottom of the base we can see this is

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.840 
bottom of the base we can see this is
what<00:02:34.110> we<00:02:34.230> call<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.440> bridge<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.700> where

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
what we call the bridge this is where

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.180 
what we call the bridge this is where
the<00:02:35.940> strings<00:02:36.240> attached<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.740> bottom<00:02:37.920> of

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the strings attached to the bottom of

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.280 
the strings attached to the bottom of
the<00:02:38.400> body<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.000> instrument<00:02:39.050> this<00:02:40.050> can<00:02:40.260> be

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
the body of the instrument this can be

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.420 
the body of the instrument this can be
made<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.650> steel<00:02:41.070> brass<00:02:41.990> even<00:02:42.990> aluminum<00:02:43.440> brass

made of steel brass even aluminum brass

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.950 
made of steel brass even aluminum brass
remains<00:02:44.790> pretty<00:02:45.000> popular<00:02:45.240> because<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.720> also

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
remains pretty popular because it also

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.840 
remains pretty popular because it also
had<00:02:46.050> an<00:02:46.170> added<00:02:46.500> benefit<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.130> adding<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.760> little

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
had an added benefit of adding a little

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.850 
had an added benefit of adding a little
weight<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.480> bottom<00:02:48.780> section<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.800> the

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
weight to the bottom section of the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.990 
weight to the bottom section of the
instrument<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:50.310> also<00:02:50.520> helps<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
instrument this also helps the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.430 
instrument this also helps the
instrument<00:02:51.330> not<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.540> be<00:02:51.600> neck<00:02:51.810> heavy<00:02:52.080> and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
instrument not to be neck heavy and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.870 
instrument not to be neck heavy and
generally<00:02:52.950> speaking<00:02:53.340> neck<00:02:53.640> heavy

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
generally speaking neck heavy

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.400 
generally speaking neck heavy
instruments<00:02:54.360> attended<00:02:54.720> till<00:02:54.900> towards<00:02:55.290> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
instruments attended till towards the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.170 
instruments attended till towards the
floor<00:02:55.580> can<00:02:56.580> make<00:02:56.730> your<00:02:56.850> life<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.030> little

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
floor can make your life a little

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.090 
floor can make your life a little
difficult<00:02:57.660> because<00:02:57.750> as<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.050> play<00:02:58.380> your<00:02:58.890> hand

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
difficult because as you play your hand

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.890 
difficult because as you play your hand
is<00:02:59.310> having<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.580> support<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.180> instrument<00:03:00.660> so

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
is having to support the instrument so

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.230 
is having to support the instrument so
if<00:03:01.560> an<00:03:01.740> instrument<00:03:02.160> balance<00:03:02.490> as<00:03:02.640> well<00:03:02.670> it's

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
if an instrument balance as well it's

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.400 
if an instrument balance as well it's
again<00:03:03.510> something<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.840> look<00:03:03.960> for<00:03:04.200> when<00:03:04.320> you

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
again something to look for when you

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.650 
again something to look for when you
first<00:03:04.620> trying<00:03:04.920> out<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> base<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:06.360> here's<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
first trying out a base so here's the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.400 
first trying out a base so here's the
bridge<00:03:07.160> we<00:03:08.160> can<00:03:08.280> see<00:03:08.660> within<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.870> bridge<00:03:10.110> we

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
bridge we can see within the bridge we

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.750 
bridge we can see within the bridge we
have<00:03:10.560> saddles<00:03:11.040> these<00:03:11.250> are<00:03:11.370> called<00:03:11.490> saddle

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
have saddles these are called saddle

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.090 
have saddles these are called saddle
tees<00:03:12.060> individual<00:03:12.690> sections<00:03:13.110> here<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
tees individual sections here and the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.610 
tees individual sections here and the
string<00:03:14.340> sits<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.910> saddle<00:03:15.180> now<00:03:15.720> bridge

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
string sits on the saddle now bridge

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.980 
string sits on the saddle now bridge
designs<00:03:17.040> vary<00:03:17.400> but<00:03:18.390> this<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.720> fairly

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
designs vary but this is a fairly

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.630 
designs vary but this is a fairly
typical<00:03:19.080> design<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.010> you'll<00:03:20.100> notice<00:03:20.310> there

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
typical design and you'll notice there

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.880 
typical design and you'll notice there
are<00:03:20.760> grooves<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:22.080> saddle<00:03:22.470> with<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.620> string

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
are grooves in the saddle with a string

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.320 
are grooves in the saddle with a string
actually<00:03:23.190> sits<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:23.700> it's<00:03:23.790> important<00:03:24.240> the

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
actually sits and it's important the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.820 
actually sits and it's important the
string<00:03:24.570> kind<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.810> anchor<00:03:24.990> see<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.350> solid<00:03:25.710> these

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
string kind of anchor see a solid these

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.110 
string kind of anchor see a solid these
other<00:03:26.070> strings<00:03:26.280> don't<00:03:26.490> move<00:03:26.670> around<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
other strings don't move around and the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.260 
other strings don't move around and the
spacing<00:03:27.420> alters<00:03:27.810> as<00:03:27.960> you<00:03:28.050> play<00:03:29.270> moving

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
spacing alters as you play moving

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.560 
spacing alters as you play moving
further<00:03:30.510> up<00:03:30.750> we<00:03:31.010> have<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.040> pickups<00:03:32.570> very

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
further up we have the pickups very

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.460 
further up we have the pickups very
important<00:03:33.900> these<00:03:34.020> are<00:03:34.140> effectively

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
important these are effectively

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.410 
important these are effectively
microphones<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.160> pick<00:03:35.250> up<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.459> sound<00:03:35.700> from

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
microphones and pick up the sound from

microphones and pick up the sound from
the<00:03:36.480> strings<00:03:37.010> very<00:03:38.010> important<00:03:38.459> we<00:03:38.520> have<00:03:38.640> two

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
the strings very important we have two

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.730 
the strings very important we have two
on<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.209> base<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.810> we'll<00:03:40.230> look<00:03:40.350> at<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.560> sound

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
on this base and we'll look at the sound

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.190 
on this base and we'll look at the sound
of<00:03:40.860> those<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.220> second<00:03:41.990> next<00:03:42.990> of<00:03:43.080> these

of those in a second next of these

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.170 
of those in a second next of these
they're<00:03:44.130> what<00:03:44.250> we<00:03:44.280> call<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.550> control<00:03:44.910> plate

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
they're what we call the control plate

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.180 
they're what we call the control plate
on<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:45.780> base<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.320> control<00:03:46.680> plate<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.100> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
on this base the control plate is on the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.010 
on this base the control plate is on the
top<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.610> instrument<00:03:48.000> on<00:03:48.120> some<00:03:48.510> basis<00:03:48.870> the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
top of the instrument on some basis the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.510 
top of the instrument on some basis the
control<00:03:49.350> plate<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.680> mounted<00:03:50.040> from<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.280> rear

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
control plate is mounted from the rear

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.560 
control plate is mounted from the rear
which<00:03:50.790> I'll<00:03:50.970> show<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.209> on<00:03:51.360> another

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
which I'll show you on another

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.199 
which I'll show you on another
instrument<00:03:51.980> now<00:03:52.980> on<00:03:53.250> this<00:03:53.640> particular<00:03:53.910> base

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
instrument now on this particular base

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.630 
instrument now on this particular base
is<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.510> classic<00:03:54.990> design<00:03:55.320> we<00:03:56.190> have<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.340> volume

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
is a classic design we have a volume

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.300 
is a classic design we have a volume
volume<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.050> master<00:03:58.440> tone<00:03:58.620> control<00:03:59.070> and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
volume and a master tone control and

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.280 
volume and a master tone control and
next<00:03:59.610> to<00:03:59.700> that<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.060> input<00:04:00.209> jack<00:04:00.630> where<00:04:01.200> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
next to that the input jack where the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.870 
next to that the input jack where the
guitar<00:04:01.590> cable<00:04:01.950> actually<00:04:02.220> goes<00:04:02.370> into<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.730> body

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
guitar cable actually goes into the body

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.699 
guitar cable actually goes into the body
of<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.090> base<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:04.020> obviously<00:04:04.230> this<00:04:04.380> takes<00:04:04.620> the

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
of the base and obviously this takes the

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.240 
of the base and obviously this takes the
sound<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.940> your<00:04:06.030> amplifier<00:04:06.830> now<00:04:07.830> if<00:04:08.070> we<00:04:08.220> look

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
sound to your amplifier now if we look

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.560 
sound to your amplifier now if we look
at<00:04:08.550> this<00:04:08.640> let's<00:04:08.880> just<00:04:09.060> get<00:04:09.180> an<00:04:09.390> understanding

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
at this let's just get an understanding

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.720 
at this let's just get an understanding
of<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.140> basic<00:04:10.260> controls<00:04:10.830> here<00:04:11.070> a<00:04:11.280> lot<00:04:11.670> of

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
of the basic controls here a lot of

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.100 
of the basic controls here a lot of
students<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.270> mine<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:12.540> I've<00:04:12.600> talked<00:04:12.900> for

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
students of mine and I've talked for

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.470 
students of mine and I've talked for
almost<00:04:13.350> 20<00:04:13.800> years<00:04:13.830> now<00:04:14.070> it's<00:04:14.970> surprising<00:04:15.390> when

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
almost 20 years now it's surprising when

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.880 
almost 20 years now it's surprising when
they<00:04:15.540> come<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.810> me<00:04:15.900> for<00:04:16.020> a<00:04:16.080> lesson<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.650> lot<00:04:16.859> of

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
they come to me for a lesson a lot of

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.050 
they come to me for a lesson a lot of
people<00:04:17.070> aren't<00:04:17.280> really<00:04:17.459> familiar<00:04:17.609> with<00:04:17.910> the

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
people aren't really familiar with the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.030 
people aren't really familiar with the
controls<00:04:18.480> on<00:04:18.660> their<00:04:18.750> instrument<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.290> it

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
controls on their instrument and it

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.530 
controls on their instrument and it
sounds<00:04:20.220> like<00:04:20.370> such<00:04:20.609> an<00:04:20.760> obvious<00:04:21.120> thing<00:04:21.299> but

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
sounds like such an obvious thing but

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.390 
sounds like such an obvious thing but
people<00:04:22.230> really<00:04:22.380> aren't<00:04:22.770> always<00:04:23.010> aware<00:04:23.190> of

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
people really aren't always aware of

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.409 
people really aren't always aware of
that<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.850> should<00:04:24.000> really<00:04:24.120> get<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.390> know

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
that and you should really get to know

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.270 
that and you should really get to know
your<00:04:24.750> base<00:04:24.960> know<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.500> controls<00:04:25.890> on<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.160> know

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
your base know the controls on it know

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.560 
your base know the controls on it know
the<00:04:26.400> sounds<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:26.910> can<00:04:27.000> call<00:04:27.270> from<00:04:27.480> the

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
the sounds you can call from the

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.570 
the sounds you can call from the
instrument<00:04:27.990> on<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.770> basic<00:04:29.160> instrument<00:04:29.520> like

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
instrument on a basic instrument like

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.700 
instrument on a basic instrument like
this<00:04:29.730> which<00:04:29.940> is<00:04:30.060> what<00:04:30.210> we<00:04:30.300> call<00:04:30.450> passive<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:31.290> has

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
this which is what we call passive I has

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.070 
this which is what we call passive I has
no<00:04:31.919> battery<00:04:32.430> powered<00:04:32.850> circuitry<00:04:33.720> in<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:33.870> it's

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
no battery powered circuitry in it it's

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.730 
no battery powered circuitry in it it's
just<00:04:34.470> all<00:04:35.040> on<00:04:35.280> board<00:04:35.520> no<00:04:35.850> battery<00:04:36.240> in<00:04:36.300> here<00:04:36.740> the

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
just all on board no battery in here the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.620 
just all on board no battery in here the
controls<00:04:38.130> are<00:04:38.220> relatively<00:04:38.640> simple<00:04:39.120> in<00:04:39.330> this

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
controls are relatively simple in this

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.519 
controls are relatively simple in this
case<00:04:39.840> we<00:04:40.740> have<00:04:40.860> volume

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:41.529 
case we have volume

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.219 
case we have volume
for<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:42.009> front<00:04:42.279> pickup<00:04:42.779> volume<00:04:43.779> for<00:04:43.929> the<00:04:43.959> back

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
for the front pickup volume for the back

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.239 
for the front pickup volume for the back
pickup<00:04:44.679> and<00:04:44.889> a<00:04:45.549> tone<00:04:45.819> control<00:04:46.439> now<00:04:47.439> sometimes

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:48.249 
pickup and a tone control now sometimes

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:49.949 
pickup and a tone control now sometimes
these<00:04:48.699> pickups<00:04:49.089> will<00:04:49.209> be<00:04:49.329> referred<00:04:49.599> to<00:04:49.629> as<00:04:49.839> the

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:49.959 
these pickups will be referred to as the

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:51.659 
these pickups will be referred to as the
bridge<00:04:50.229> pickup<00:04:50.679> now<00:04:50.949> as<00:04:51.219> you<00:04:51.249> know<00:04:51.459> this<00:04:51.609> is

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
bridge pickup now as you know this is

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.369 
bridge pickup now as you know this is
the<00:04:51.909> bridge<00:04:52.149> obviously<00:04:52.719> the<00:04:52.839> bridge<00:04:53.049> pickup

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:53.379 
the bridge obviously the bridge pickup

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.739 
the bridge obviously the bridge pickup
is<00:04:53.499> closest<00:04:54.009> to<00:04:54.069> the<00:04:54.219> bridge<00:04:54.459> and<00:04:54.759> this<00:04:55.419> pickup

00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:55.749 
is closest to the bridge and this pickup

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:56.939 
is closest to the bridge and this pickup
is<00:04:55.869> referred<00:04:56.169> to<00:04:56.199> as<00:04:56.319> the<00:04:56.529> neck<00:04:56.769> pickup

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
is referred to as the neck pickup

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.609 
is referred to as the neck pickup
because<00:04:57.519> it's<00:04:57.999> closest<00:04:58.509> to<00:04:58.509> the<00:04:58.689> neck<00:04:58.899> of<00:04:59.559> the

00:04:59.609 --> 00:04:59.619 
because it's closest to the neck of the

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:02.429 
because it's closest to the neck of the
base<00:05:00.089> now<00:05:01.089> let's<00:05:01.479> um<00:05:01.599> listen<00:05:01.749> how<00:05:01.989> each<00:05:02.139> pickup

00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:02.439 
base now let's um listen how each pickup

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:05.129 
base now let's um listen how each pickup
sounds<00:05:02.919> first<00:05:03.459> of<00:05:03.609> all<00:05:03.699> assist<00:05:04.269> them<00:05:04.389> to<00:05:04.569> just

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
sounds first of all assist them to just

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:12.869 
sounds first of all assist them to just
the<00:05:05.259> back<00:05:05.469> pick<00:05:05.679> up<00:05:05.829> the<00:05:05.949> bridge<00:05:06.129> pickup<00:05:11.879> you

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
the back pick up the bridge pickup you

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.099 
the back pick up the bridge pickup you
can<00:05:12.999> see<00:05:13.149> it's<00:05:13.299> got<00:05:13.359> a<00:05:13.419> kind<00:05:13.599> of<00:05:13.689> punchy

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:14.109 
can see it's got a kind of punchy

00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:18.569 
can see it's got a kind of punchy
slightly<00:05:14.379> mid-range<00:05:14.829> eat<00:05:15.039> own<00:05:17.369> now<00:05:18.369> this

slightly mid-range eat own now this

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:25.090 
slightly mid-range eat own now this
isn't<00:05:18.759> the<00:05:18.909> front<00:05:19.239> pickup<00:05:19.509> just<00:05:19.779> on<00:05:19.899> its<00:05:20.019> own

it's going to Whoopi a fatter sound a

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.240 
it's going to Whoopi a fatter sound a
little<00:05:28.610> more<00:05:28.790> old-school<00:05:29.060> perhaps<00:05:30.190> now<00:05:31.190> we

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
little more old-school perhaps now we

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.740 
little more old-school perhaps now we
can<00:05:31.430> combine<00:05:31.610> both<00:05:31.940> pickups<00:05:32.270> together<00:05:32.600> how

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
can combine both pickups together how

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.690 
can combine both pickups together how
listen<00:05:33.020> to<00:05:33.080> this<00:05:33.200> this<00:05:33.740> is<00:05:33.860> both<00:05:34.070> pickups<00:05:34.400> turn

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
listen to this this is both pickups turn

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:41.920 
listen to this this is both pickups turn
full-on<00:05:40.300> see<00:05:41.300> again<00:05:41.600> it's<00:05:41.780> like<00:05:41.870> a

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
full-on see again it's like a

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.150 
full-on see again it's like a
combination<00:05:42.170> used<00:05:42.620> to<00:05:42.680> go<00:05:42.770> that<00:05:42.920> kind<00:05:43.040> of

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
combination used to go that kind of

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.950 
combination used to go that kind of
old-school<00:05:43.510> fairness<00:05:44.510> but<00:05:44.690> now<00:05:44.810> a<00:05:44.840> little

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
old-school fairness but now a little

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.200 
old-school fairness but now a little
more<00:05:45.080> top-end<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:45.770> seeing<00:05:46.010> to<00:05:46.220> the<00:05:46.250> sound<00:05:46.580> now

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
more top-end and seeing to the sound now

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.870 
more top-end and seeing to the sound now
again<00:05:47.480> the<00:05:47.660> tone<00:05:47.900> control<00:05:48.260> plays<00:05:48.500> a<00:05:48.530> lot<00:05:48.770> of

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
again the tone control plays a lot of

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.070 
again the tone control plays a lot of
importance<00:05:49.880> in<00:05:50.030> this<00:05:50.180> let's<00:05:50.510> check<00:05:50.660> it<00:05:50.780> out<00:05:50.870> so

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
importance in this let's check it out so

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.570 
importance in this let's check it out so
I'm<00:05:51.170> still<00:05:51.380> keeping<00:05:51.530> both<00:05:51.800> pickups<00:05:52.130> full<00:05:52.430> on

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
I'm still keeping both pickups full on

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.130 
I'm still keeping both pickups full on
first<00:05:53.330> of<00:05:53.420> all<00:05:53.480> I'm<00:05:53.600> going<00:05:53.690> to<00:05:53.780> have<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:53.930> tone

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
first of all I'm going to have the tone

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.840 
first of all I'm going to have the tone
control<00:05:54.500> wound<00:05:54.740> full<00:05:55.070> open<00:05:55.430> so<00:05:55.580> this<00:05:55.730> gives

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
control wound full open so this gives

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.590 
control wound full open so this gives
you<00:05:56.000> all<00:05:56.120> the<00:05:56.270> high<00:05:56.480> end<00:05:56.690> of<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:57.080> spectrum

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.790 

it's<00:06:02.600> an<00:06:02.720> enormous<00:06:03.140> difference<00:06:03.440> when<00:06:03.530> I<00:06:03.590> open

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
it's an enormous difference when I open

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.400 
it's an enormous difference when I open
that<00:06:03.830> all<00:06:04.040> the<00:06:04.100> way<00:06:04.250> up<00:06:07.900> you<00:06:08.900> can<00:06:09.020> see<00:06:09.170> both<00:06:09.290> a

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
that all the way up you can see both a

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.410 
that all the way up you can see both a
little<00:06:09.530> zing<00:06:09.920> and<00:06:10.100> click<00:06:10.460> to<00:06:10.820> the<00:06:10.910> sound<00:06:11.180> you

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
little zing and click to the sound you

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.060 
little zing and click to the sound you
can<00:06:11.450> really<00:06:11.630> hear<00:06:11.780> the<00:06:11.900> noise<00:06:12.110> of<00:06:12.380> the<00:06:12.710> strings

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
can really hear the noise of the strings

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.070 
can really hear the noise of the strings
on<00:06:13.220> the<00:06:13.250> metal<00:06:13.490> frets<00:06:13.880> here<00:06:14.120> now<00:06:14.720> if<00:06:14.840> I<00:06:14.900> want

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
on the metal frets here now if I want

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.190 
on the metal frets here now if I want
this<00:06:15.200> back<00:06:15.700> that<00:06:16.700> top<00:06:16.970> end<00:06:17.150> decreases<00:06:17.840> as<00:06:18.110> I

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
this back that top end decreases as I

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.410 
this back that top end decreases as I
turn<00:06:18.500> this<00:06:18.620> control<00:06:19.010> anti-clockwise<00:06:19.640> check

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 
turn this control anti-clockwise check

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.240 
turn this control anti-clockwise check
it<00:06:20.570> out<00:06:21.370> I<00:06:22.370> move<00:06:22.850> it<00:06:23.030> back<00:06:23.830> and<00:06:24.830> then<00:06:25.100> all<00:06:25.220> the

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
it out I move it back and then all the

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.720 
it out I move it back and then all the
way<00:06:25.340> back<00:06:25.900> it's<00:06:26.900> a<00:06:26.960> darker<00:06:27.440> sound<00:06:27.680> and<00:06:28.340> this<00:06:28.580> is

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
way back it's a darker sound and this is

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.950 
way back it's a darker sound and this is
really<00:06:28.880> important<00:06:29.240> to<00:06:29.300> understand<00:06:29.720> you<00:06:29.900> know

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
really important to understand you know

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.240 
really important to understand you know
that<00:06:30.050> the<00:06:30.230> importance<00:06:30.650> of<00:06:30.680> these<00:06:30.800> controls

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
that the importance of these controls

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.830 
that the importance of these controls
individually<00:06:31.910> and<00:06:32.210> how<00:06:32.330> they<00:06:32.450> can<00:06:32.480> shape<00:06:32.810> your

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
individually and how they can shape your

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.960 
individually and how they can shape your
sound<00:06:33.400> and<00:06:34.400> we're<00:06:34.490> going<00:06:34.610> to<00:06:34.670> look<00:06:34.730> at<00:06:34.820> that

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
sound and we're going to look at that

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.000 
sound and we're going to look at that
moral<00:06:35.390> so<00:06:35.600> as<00:06:35.810> I<00:06:36.200> play<00:06:36.350> the<00:06:36.380> 5-string<00:06:36.890> bass

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
moral so as I play the 5-string bass

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.400 
moral so as I play the 5-string bass
later<00:06:37.280> on<00:06:37.430> to<00:06:37.610> in<00:06:37.730> the<00:06:37.820> session<00:06:38.230> so<00:06:39.230> these<00:06:39.350> are

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
later on to in the session so these are

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.780 
later on to in the session so these are
your<00:06:39.530> volume<00:06:39.890> controls<00:06:39.920> and<00:06:40.490> your<00:06:40.580> tone

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
your volume controls and your tone

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.180 
your volume controls and your tone
control<00:06:41.090> whatever<00:06:41.270> base<00:06:41.540> you<00:06:41.690> have<00:06:42.100> it's<00:06:43.100> very

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
control whatever base you have it's very

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.070 
control whatever base you have it's very
likely<00:06:43.580> will<00:06:43.820> have<00:06:44.000> some<00:06:44.270> configuration<00:06:45.050> that

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
likely will have some configuration that

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.660 
likely will have some configuration that
bears<00:06:45.560> some<00:06:45.740> resemblance<00:06:45.860> to<00:06:46.280> that<00:06:46.310> volume

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
bears some resemblance to that volume

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.390 
bears some resemblance to that volume
controls<00:06:47.210> tone<00:06:47.570> controls<00:06:48.080> and<00:06:48.410> as<00:06:48.950> we<00:06:49.100> see<00:06:49.310> on

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
controls tone controls and as we see on

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.860 
controls tone controls and as we see on
the<00:06:49.490> 5-string<00:06:49.940> bass<00:06:50.090> sometimes<00:06:50.600> you'll<00:06:50.780> have

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
the 5-string bass sometimes you'll have

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.540 
the 5-string bass sometimes you'll have
a<00:06:50.930> battery-powered<00:06:51.410> circuit<00:06:52.190> which<00:06:52.370> will

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
a battery-powered circuit which will

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.770 
a battery-powered circuit which will
give<00:06:52.670> you<00:06:52.760> even<00:06:52.910> more<00:06:53.120> control<00:06:53.510> over<00:06:53.540> your

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
give you even more control over your

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.840 
give you even more control over your
sound<00:06:54.820> now<00:06:55.820> let's<00:06:56.000> move<00:06:56.150> further<00:06:56.390> up<00:06:56.570> the<00:06:56.660> bass
