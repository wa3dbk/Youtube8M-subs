00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
what I tried to do was I tried to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.010 
what I tried to do was I tried to
compensate<00:01:16.400> by<00:01:16.700> making<00:01:16.730> smaller<00:01:17.300> braids<00:01:17.630> and

compensate by making smaller braids and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.110 
compensate by making smaller braids and
thinking<00:01:18.320> I<00:01:18.409> can<00:01:18.590> wrap<00:01:18.800> wrap<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.790> around<00:01:19.880> their

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120
