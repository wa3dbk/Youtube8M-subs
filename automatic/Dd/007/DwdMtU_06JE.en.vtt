00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.720

around<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.849> block<00:02:52.150> okay<00:02:53.150> let's<00:02:53.660> go<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:04.730> may

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
around the block okay let's go you may

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.080 
around the block okay let's go you may
think<00:03:05.120> that<00:03:05.300> because<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.900> has<00:03:06.080> very<00:03:06.319> big<00:03:06.470> rims

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
think that because it has very big rims

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.440 
think that because it has very big rims
it's<00:03:08.090> not<00:03:08.330> smooth<00:03:08.720> driving<00:03:09.580> but<00:03:10.580> actually

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
it's not smooth driving but actually

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.900 
it's not smooth driving but actually
it's<00:03:11.690> very<00:03:11.780> very<00:03:12.200> unstable

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.910 

and<00:03:15.090> there's<00:03:15.300> no<00:03:15.480> difference<00:03:15.930> between<00:03:16.020> a

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
and there's no difference between a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.250 
and there's no difference between a
smaller<00:03:17.510> alloy<00:03:18.510> or<00:03:19.260> not<00:03:20.810> most<00:03:21.810> important

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
smaller alloy or not most important

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.400 
smaller alloy or not most important
thing<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.740> that<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.400> looks<00:03:23.610> much<00:03:24.000> much<00:03:24.410> better

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410
