00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
love the designs these two blocks of

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.509 
love the designs these two blocks of
wood<00:00:13.110> for<00:00:13.320> instance<00:00:13.710> one<00:00:13.889> black<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.219> one

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
wood for instance one black and one

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.939 
wood for instance one black and one
brown<00:00:15.210> wood<00:00:15.509> actually<00:00:16.170> clocks<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.830> when

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
brown wood actually clocks and when

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.640 
brown wood actually clocks and when
they're<00:00:17.130> tapped<00:00:17.609> they<00:00:18.570> display<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.410> green

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
they're tapped they display one green

they're tapped they display one green
and<00:00:19.920> one<00:00:19.980> red<00:00:20.369> LEDs<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:22.020> one<00:00:22.260> they<00:00:22.560> show<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and one red LEDs and one they show the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.410 
and one red LEDs and one they show the
time<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> short<00:00:23.730> time<00:00:24.060> later<00:00:24.180> they

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
time and then the short time later they

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.029 
time and then the short time later they
show<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.810> temperature<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.529> all<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.859> month

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039

first and then the temperature and then

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.060 
first and then the temperature and then
they<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.630> silence<00:00:28.560> they<00:00:28.740> switch<00:00:28.980> off<00:00:29.130> again

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.229 

and<00:00:35.070> win<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> switched<00:00:35.489> off<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.969> come<00:00:36.120> on

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
and win the switched off to come on

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.880 
and win the switched off to come on
again<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.570> course<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.170> cannot<00:00:37.469> see<00:00:37.649> them<00:00:37.800> in

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
again of course you cannot see them in

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.350 
again of course you cannot see them in
look<00:00:38.010> at<00:00:38.129> those<00:00:38.280> are<00:00:38.430> fleetly<00:00:38.850> blank-faced

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
look at those are fleetly blank-faced

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.030 
look at those are fleetly blank-faced
like<00:00:39.540> all<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> other<00:00:39.899> blank<00:00:40.170> faces<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.829> fact

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
like all the other blank faces in fact

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.799 
like all the other blank faces in fact
you<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.910> hidden<00:00:42.090> behind<00:00:42.239> there<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:42.719> it

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you know it's hidden behind there but it

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.600 
you know it's hidden behind there but it
sounds<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.260> well<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:44.280> looks<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
sounds so well that what looks like a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.479 
sounds so well that what looks like a
block<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.969> wood<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:46.170> Island<00:00:46.559> or<00:00:46.710> black

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
block of wood and it's Island or black

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.760 
block of wood and it's Island or black
wood<00:00:47.700> there<00:00:47.940> becomes<00:00:48.840> suddenly<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.260> meaningful

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
wood there becomes suddenly a meaningful

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.880 
wood there becomes suddenly a meaningful
clock<00:00:50.340> very<00:00:50.969> nice<00:00:51.120> idea<00:00:51.649> acoustic<00:00:52.649> quite

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
clock very nice idea acoustic quite

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.130 
clock very nice idea acoustic quite
sensitive<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.940> tap<00:00:54.180> or<00:00:54.449> talk<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.809> they'll

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
sensitive and a tap or talk and they'll

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.270 
sensitive and a tap or talk and they'll
perform<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.550> I'd<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.539> these<00:00:57.690> very<00:00:57.930> well

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
perform so I'd like these very well

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.040 
perform so I'd like these very well
another<00:00:59.280> item<00:00:59.520> which<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.149> other<00:01:00.899> examples

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
another item which I have other examples

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.689 
another item which I have other examples
of<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.739> nicest<00:01:01.920> I've<00:01:02.129> come<00:01:02.309> across<00:01:02.399> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
of this is the nicest I've come across I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.920 
of this is the nicest I've come across I
think<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.840> stapler<00:01:04.320> stapler<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:06.510> idea<00:01:06.780> is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
think is a stapler stapler the idea is

think is a stapler stapler the idea is
you<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.170> piece<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.409> paper<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:07.830> two<00:01:08.189> pieces

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
you have a piece of paper or two pieces

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.030 
you have a piece of paper or two pieces
of<00:01:08.520> paper<00:01:08.670> which<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.939> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> join<00:01:09.360> together

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
of paper which you want to join together

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.500 
of paper which you want to join together
you<00:01:11.040> put<00:01:11.220> them<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> jaws<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> stapler

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
you put them in the jaws of the stapler

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.940 
you put them in the jaws of the stapler
and<00:01:12.689> there's<00:01:12.900> no<00:01:13.049> staples<00:01:13.290> there's<00:01:13.650> no<00:01:13.740> backup

squeeze hard put it on the side you

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.090 
squeeze hard put it on the side you
finally<00:01:18.600> got<00:01:18.750> an<00:01:18.840> extraordinary<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.530> range<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
finally got an extraordinary a range of

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.730 
finally got an extraordinary a range of
a<00:01:20.189> little<00:01:20.670> sort<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.600> arrow<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.200> been<00:01:22.350> cut

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
a little sort of arrow that's been cut

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
a little sort of arrow that's been cut
through<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.310> tucked<00:01:23.549> underneath<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.299> it

through and tucked underneath and it

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.359 
through and tucked underneath and it
holds<00:01:24.810> several<00:01:25.650> bits<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.920> paper<00:01:26.009> together

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
holds several bits of paper together

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.850 
holds several bits of paper together
quite<00:01:26.610> nicely<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.360> there's<00:01:28.080> no<00:01:28.259> swarf<00:01:28.650> or

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
quite nicely and there's no swarf or

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.469 
quite nicely and there's no swarf or
anything<00:01:29.070> left<00:01:29.280> over<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.700> end<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.210> they

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
anything left over at the end so they

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.510 
anything left over at the end so they
