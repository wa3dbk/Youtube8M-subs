00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 good afternoon, greet you again 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.910
 your friend if i will expose garmin and in this 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.189
 I will show you how to repair 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.050
 the email of a device 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.259
 huawei in this case I'm doing 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.119
 with the 610 huawei but good too 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.970
 it works for the huawei and 300 and 320 and 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.590
 220 and it seems to me that for 200 what 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.500
 first thing they have to do is 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.199
 download a file that I leave in the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.420
 link of the description a second 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.890
 download this mobile application with 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.120
 cultures that are good 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.690
 to make the superuser request 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.940
 and well, as we continue once 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.730
 open this application let's go to the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.820
 option where it says restore copy email 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.489
 emt here 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.170
 and well the file should be left in 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.809
 the root of the sd of the external sd though 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.710
 in this here they will appear in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.150
 reset email from sd card 2 of 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.080
 preference as I commented there 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.420
 save now I have it in 1 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.960
 but so that there are no errors in the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.260
 externally and only at the root that you 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.480
 they will give you select and they will tell you 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.700
 reset email from sd card good you 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.200
 they accept and once they give 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.420
 to accept 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.790
 they will leave 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.900
 they will ask you to restart the computer what 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.900
 they do without any problem 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.250
 After restarting the device you 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.740
 it's good before forgiveness they have to 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.329
 check the email they had and then 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.329
 Check the email they now have 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.940
 this serves when 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.560
 your phone says only calls from 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.090
 emergency right now good 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.670
 unfortunately I do not have a chip, I know 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.710
 do since this method does not release it 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.800
 it only changes the email but it does not 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.369
 free your device in this case I will 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.220

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.720

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.660
 Y 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.649
 well this is very very easy very 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.649
 simple as they saw it 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.770
 and I was telling you if your device is telcel 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.770
 will only start again with 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.140
 telcel if they put some chip in another 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.850
 carrier will not work again good 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.010
 they will not ask for the code 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.920
 unlocking for the release of the equipment 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.430

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.450

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.930

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:48.310
 call they download it from the Pleistocene and 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.470
 remember the backup file is in 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.530

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.510
