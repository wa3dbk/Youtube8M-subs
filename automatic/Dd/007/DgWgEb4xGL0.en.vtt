4:01 EGR flow insufficient I will show

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.070 
4:01 EGR flow insufficient I will show
you<00:00:20.189> what<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.029> problem<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.539> these<00:00:21.779> it's

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
you what is the problem with these it's

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.920 
you what is the problem with these it's
a<00:00:22.170> common<00:00:22.410> problem<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> v6<00:00:23.720> Honda<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
a common problem on a v6 Honda and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.259 
a common problem on a v6 Honda and
Acuras<00:00:26.090> it's<00:00:27.090> not<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.630> EGR<00:00:28.410> valve<00:00:29.029> it's<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
Acuras it's not the EGR valve it's the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600 
Acuras it's not the EGR valve it's the
intake<00:00:30.720> manifold<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.470> gets<00:00:31.890> clogged<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.399> over

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
intake manifold it gets clogged up over

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.850 
intake manifold it gets clogged up over
there<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.329> I'll<00:00:33.480> remove<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> intake<00:00:34.260> manifold

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
there so I'll remove the intake manifold

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.270 
there so I'll remove the intake manifold
and<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:35.790> show<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.149> where<00:00:36.450> exactly<00:00:37.280> it

and I will show you where exactly it
clogs<00:00:38.700> up<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:40.010> intake<00:00:41.010> off<00:00:41.300> right<00:00:42.300> there<00:00:42.420> on

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
clogs up the intake off right there on

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.049 
clogs up the intake off right there on
the<00:00:42.570> floor<00:00:42.809> I'll<00:00:43.770> show<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.100> what<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.820> need<00:00:44.940> to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
can see this thing right here it's all

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.470 
can see this thing right here it's all
clogged<00:00:49.379> up<00:00:49.590> what<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.300> like

clogged up what you do is just get like
brake<00:00:51.989> fluid<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.530> air<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.550> clean<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.000> up

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
brake fluid and air and clean that up

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.080 
brake fluid and air and clean that up
over<00:00:54.390> there<00:00:55.190> also<00:00:56.190> blow<00:00:56.370> everything<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.879> far

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
over there also blow everything out far

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.810 
over there also blow everything out far
of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> EGR<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.530> that's<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.010> thing<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.219> got

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
of the EGR so that's the thing that got

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.660 
of the EGR so that's the thing that got
clogged<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.270> also<00:01:01.879> on<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> intake<00:01:03.449> manifold

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
clogged up also on the intake manifold

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.310 
clogged up also on the intake manifold
this<00:01:05.670> thing<00:01:05.970> right<00:01:06.119> here<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.390> also<00:01:06.659> clogged<00:01:07.140> up

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
this thing right here is also clogged up

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.109 
this thing right here is also clogged up
we'll<00:01:07.680> clean<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.310> I'll<00:01:08.369> show<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.549> how

the<00:02:04.710> common<00:02:05.220> prom<00:02:05.430> with<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> EGR

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
the common prom with the EGR

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.110 
the common prom with the EGR
insufficient<00:02:07.920> flow<00:02:08.130> as<00:02:08.570> you<00:02:09.570> can<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:09.929> huge

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
insufficient flow as you can see huge

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.479 
insufficient flow as you can see huge
huge<00:02:12.120> chunks<00:02:12.690> are<00:02:12.810> coming<00:02:13.080> out<00:02:13.280> some<00:02:14.280> brake

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
huge chunks are coming out some brake

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.040 
huge chunks are coming out some brake
cleaner<00:02:14.760> I'll<00:02:15.090> show<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.330> how<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.540> can<00:02:15.780> clean

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
cleaner I'll show you how you can clean

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.720 
cleaner I'll show you how you can clean
it<00:02:16.610> first<00:02:17.610> what<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.239> did<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:19.830> kind<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.220> pried<00:02:20.550> it

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
it first what I did is kind of pried it

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.390 
it first what I did is kind of pried it
all<00:02:20.850> out<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.150> there<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.739> spray<00:02:23.070> brake

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
all out of there it can spray brake
