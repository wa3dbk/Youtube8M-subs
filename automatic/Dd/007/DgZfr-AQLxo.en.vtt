00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
BK to take the position but since they

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.600 
BK to take the position but since they
were<00:03:34.110> already<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.590> deep<00:03:34.799> in<00:03:35.040> this<00:03:35.190> position

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610

they<00:03:35.879> just<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.510> learn<00:03:36.690> for<00:03:36.870> any<00:03:37.640> but

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
they just to learn for any but
