00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.080
 Android tutorial and today we're going to 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.440
 teach how to root devices 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.170
 xperia 2011 and 2012 that we are going to get 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.550
 with this we will be able to eliminate 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.070
 pre-installed factory applications 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.320
 we will also be able to free space and 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.360
 have administrator rights in 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.310
 our device how to know if we use 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.350
 root we go to our drawer 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.480
 applications and if we have installed the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.030
 super giuseppe application is because 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.060
 we are light if we are not yet you 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.780
 we invite you to keep watching this video 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.780
 good we start 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.680
 good in the first step we're going to 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.230
 configurations we go to applications 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.180
 and we activate the font box 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.550
 unknown 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.030
 now the development and we activate 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:11.060
 debug usb next thing we're going to 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.420
 to do is connect the usb cable to our 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.420
 mobile 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.840
 once connected we go to the bar 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.909
 of notifications 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.070
 we put you in connected mode 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.960
 transfer media 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.960
 and we put the first action 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.430
 in the second step what we should do 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.740
 is to download a very tool 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.409
 important with which we are going to root 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.369
 our phones for that we are going to copy 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.799
 the link we go to an explorer and 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.130
 we paste the link now we press 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.590
 enter and it will lead us directly to 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.110
 an official forum of aces or pers 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.870
 this page is very safe so do not 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.570
 they have to worry about 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.140
 we go down and in the part where it says 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.930
 download new links let's click 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.100
 this file is immediately going to 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.100
 start downloading 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.860
 now we have to mark a small 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.710
 error that could not download 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.500
 correctly this is because the 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.140
 antivirus do not recognize this file as 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.600
 a threat but it's totally safe 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.100
 so they do not have to worry about what 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.350
 what we are going to do now is go to 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.120
 our antivirus and we're going to 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.120
 deactivate for a couple of hours 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.130
 we give you to accept 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.130
 and we download the file again 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.730
 now we have to wait for it to 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.730
 unload 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.790
 and when you download it, we click on 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.980
 the little arrow 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.260
 and select save 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.680
 now it will have been saved in our 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.680
 computer 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.500
 as you see here we already have the file that 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.480
 we just downloaded and what we're going to 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.939
 do now is create a folder in the 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.269
 desk that says tool for 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.269
 lotear 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.190
 and we are going to take the downloaded file what 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.530
 we are going to cut and we are going to stick it inside 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.640
 from this folder now we click on 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.160
 right and extract here 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.290
 are going to create the files a folder 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.110
 and a file ending in dot bytes 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.150
 we click on that file as you see the 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.730
 cell phone has always been connected 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.670
 now we press center and the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.830
 routing process 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.050
 and now we must wait for the process 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.470
 I finished 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.170
 it takes very little 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.210
 and at the end of this process our 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.210
 mobile is going to restart 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.150
 if more appear some pictures only the 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.150
 we close 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.740
 and our phone will already be restarting 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.260
 here in this picture it appears that 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.930
 press a key to continue and 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.520
 we press enter 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.060
 now our mobile is already 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.060
 turning on 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.110
 once it starts the cell we 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.210
 we go to our application drawer and 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.340
 verify that we have installed the 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.750
 top application 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.910
 this means that we already have 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.700
 administrator rights in our 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.620
 mobile device in a few days 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.080
 We will show how to root the version of
