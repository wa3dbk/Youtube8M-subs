 which is in this area of ​​the map is worth here 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.480
 specifically near the airport 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.190

 For I will explain what good 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.240
 you will have to do in the case of 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.400
 get one of these as the country 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.340
 worth a doubling again and again 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.200
 until you get 10 and fill it and it 's the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.060
 garage so in a free way it's worth 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.440

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.540
 that you do not have much money and so on 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.670

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.890
 we have to do is take one of these 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.640

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.780
 same the friend and precisely now 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.910
 we do not need it worth what you are going more 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.320
 go ahead in what moment we need and 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.090
 well first of all say also that 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.530
 this video has helped me pay for what 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.880
 which should go thanks and good 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.430
 you will have your channel in the description 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.080
 to your life so you will have it there and 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.470
 Well, what we are going to do now is 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.540
 catch and bust five of these 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.670
 vehicles is worth but five that 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.220
 they are on the same line, I'm worth 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.290
 I give advice to blow them and not 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.500
 have to have police and other things 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.360
 you take out the vehicle you hit a c4 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.490
 and you go to the garage and inside the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.740
 garage is where you have to burst what 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.990
 ok and so you will avoid that you 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.700
 put the stars and if for some 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.500
 chance they put you some star of 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.300
 police do not worry how are you 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.770
 inside our garage then price that 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.150
 it is removed and you go back to take a 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.400
 vehicle and that's how you see the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.900
 moment now I have just skipped a 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.910
 police star but nothing happens 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.620
 because as I leave, the police are not 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.030
 near me or anything or I can enter 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.770
 quietly to my house 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.450
 good as you see , we are already bursting 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.430
 all vehicles in the same row 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.950
 it's worth remembering that they have to be from a 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.780
 same row 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.430
 it does not matter whether it's from the left or the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.410
 right but you have to burst the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.140
 five cars that are in one of 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.599
 the two sides of the garage good as a 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.459
 Once you finish finished this good 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.920
 I will explain a little bit what we have 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.220
 what to do now for good if you look 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.920
 in front I have also sun king vale 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.360
 but I really tried to do it with 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.800
 the others that were a little cheaper 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.290
 which is what I told you not to buy and 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.049
 what is the sw but as I have seen that no 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.060
 it works because I had to buy from 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.739
 you are x he is also why you see here 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.930
 that change colors that are not 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.400
 same as before and well what you see is 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.860
 that we are driving inside 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.200
 our garage moving the car up 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.819
 the opposite is worth for it as 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.260
 You see our friend has to do us 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.790
 have to do the following here is 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.650
 where our friend comes in action 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.030
 we ride in the vehicle he 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.250
 you have to open the passenger door 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.349
 he opens the passenger door and does not 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.579
 mounts voucher and what you have to do 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.410
 what your friend has to do is 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.120
 start running towards the 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.500
 door and as you can see the car is going to 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.209
 move is worth you do not have to 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.940
 speed up or anything else if not the car 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.739
 is going to be taken out of the garage simply 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.580
 you ride and go driving the car to 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.710
 put them all 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.660
 in front as you see more or less in the 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.790
 approximate sites where they are going to 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.010
 find where the 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.630
 vehicles that we've busted that like 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.580
 you will remember we have broken a row 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.800
 whole well then we have to put them 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.530
 more or less more or less does not need 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.780
 six exact in the positions where they go 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.340
 to go those cars that are in the insurance 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.900
 right now because as you will remember the 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.210
 we have burst like today we have here 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.890
 the five cars that were in this 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.390
 we have passed them and face 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.370
 This way, it is not necessary for the 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.350
 put diagonally or anything and good 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.000
 now I will explain what would be the 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.440
 open the door and not mount what is it 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.060
 which is making our friend us 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.580
 we take the triangle and we give it 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.380
 quickly to the joystick down and 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.360
 As you can see, he moves away from the door 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.340
 mounts and nothing else the only thing that you will have 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.080
 what to do if you were the friend who is 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.850
 helping then you start running as well as 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.860
 you see me running towards the door 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.170
 and the car is going to start returning 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.760
 that's why I say that you use lapitz here 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.070
 in the xl because this vehicles and that 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.350
 they allow you to move although you seem curious 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.000
 which is the largest one moves while 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.470
 that the other one that I told you that I was wrong 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.800
 and I had to go back to buy the ones that is 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.910
 the sw that does not work does not let you move 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.650
 the good 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.960
 we move away we get to 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.450
 shelter and call the insurance to go 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.980
 asking for all those vehicles that we have 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.110
 burst that as you can see we have five 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.550
 ok we ask the first one and usually the 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.080
 first he always tells us that he 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.670
 leave in the deposit we must mutual not 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.650
 do you worry now what we do 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.920
 is to ask for the second one when we lose 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.570
 the second you will see that the bug already starts 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.690
 it depends how you put the vehicles and so 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.580
 you place them in a very good way 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.170
 the bug is going to last more or less 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.940
 here as you can see it has lasted a little 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.700
 well, we keep asking 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.620
 these vehicles we ask for another one to 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.540
 sure as you know we are going to ask for another and 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.370
 in this unfortunately we have not 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.110
 got the book because the first 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.210
 move has moved me one of the cars 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.650
 but now in the third that is the 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.260
 third is always going to expire now 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.030
 you will see already the piece of bogado that 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.980
 is going to stick as you see me to look at what 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.230
 tornado that is being mounted here from 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.240
 car the truth is that it is flippant and still 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.280
 so it has not lasted me all the time 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.720
 that I would have liked but I tell you that 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.430
 if you try this you can get to 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.750
 get things 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.580
 very good and even I got to see 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.010
 pull on the map and the whole truth is that 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.540
 it's an exaggerated and good thing 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.970
 As you can see, I was walking around here 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.670
 seeing the destruction when suddenly it 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.530
 he made another small boom and 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.210
 well, as I tell you to try what 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.820
 you will see that he is very very handsome 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.500
 surely some will come out 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.140
 awesome bullock to others a little 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.460
 less and more but everything is to prove it like this 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.810
 that nothing friends I hope that I have 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.820
 liked today's video do not forget 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.860

 goodbye 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.530
 five are the most convulsive
