technology that you weren't sure of yeah
that<00:01:57.840> must<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.229> hurt<00:01:58.439> now<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.280> comparison

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
that must have hurt now in comparison

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.039 
that must have hurt now in comparison
$20<00:02:01.049> was<00:02:01.320> around<00:02:02.299> $20<00:02:03.299> back<00:02:03.450> then<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.780> should

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
$20 was around $20 back then I should

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.300 
$20 was around $20 back then I should
say<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.259> 1972

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
say in 1972

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.680 
say in 1972
is<00:02:05.600> about<00:02:06.860> $100<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.099> change<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:09.090> today's

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
is about $100 and change in today's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.900 
is about $100 and change in today's
money<00:02:09.989> inflates<00:02:10.679> up<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.009> about<00:02:11.160> $100<00:02:11.760> and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
money inflates up to about $100 and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.130 
money inflates up to about $100 and
change<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.330> would<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.510> been<00:02:12.599> much<00:02:12.780> more

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
change that would have been much more

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.930 
change that would have been much more
palatable<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:14.160> could<00:02:14.400> see<00:02:14.550> why<00:02:14.670> Ralph

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
palatable so I could see why Ralph

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.150 
palatable so I could see why Ralph
wanted<00:02:15.330> them<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.540> sell<00:02:15.720> for<00:02:15.930> only<00:02:16.020> 20<00:02:16.410> bucks<00:02:16.590> so

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
wanted them to sell for only 20 bucks so

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.190 
wanted them to sell for only 20 bucks so
yeah<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.120> mean<00:02:18.300> actually<00:02:18.690> if<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.840> think<00:02:19.110> about

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
yeah I mean actually if you think about

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.370 
yeah I mean actually if you think about
it<00:02:19.500> back<00:02:19.860> then<00:02:20.130> having<00:02:21.120> 300,000<00:02:21.930> units<00:02:22.050> sold

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
it back then having 300,000 units sold

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.960 
it back then having 300,000 units sold
at<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.709> high<00:02:22.920> asking<00:02:23.190> price<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.819> actually

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
at that high asking price is actually

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.570 
at that high asking price is actually
pretty<00:02:24.510> impressive<00:02:25.020> if<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.590> really<00:02:25.860> wrap

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
pretty impressive if you really wrap

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.500 
pretty impressive if you really wrap
your<00:02:26.790> mind<00:02:26.970> around<00:02:27.060> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
your mind around it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.360 
your mind around it

up<00:03:05.100> with<00:03:05.280> videogames<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:06.090> mean<00:03:06.239> yeah<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:06.989> is

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
up with videogames I mean yeah this is

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.900 
up with videogames I mean yeah this is
the<00:03:07.260> guy<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.950> grandfather<00:03:08.310> or<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
the guy this is the grandfather or the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.300 
the guy this is the grandfather or the
guy<00:03:09.090> who<00:03:09.150> created<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.530> first<00:03:10.800> home<00:03:11.130> video

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
guy who created the first home video

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.580 
guy who created the first home video
game<00:03:11.459> console<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:12.209> if<00:03:12.300> he<00:03:12.450> didn't<00:03:12.810> someone

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
game console but if he didn't someone

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.220 
game console but if he didn't someone
else<00:03:13.739> eventually<00:03:14.220> would<00:03:14.340> have<00:03:14.489> stepped<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.970> I

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
else eventually would have stepped in I

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.770 
else eventually would have stepped in I
guess<00:03:16.230> so<00:03:16.530> yeah<00:03:16.890> there's<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.549> chance<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.420> think

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
guess so yeah there's a chance but think

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.810 
guess so yeah there's a chance but think
about<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.200> let's<00:03:19.380> go<00:03:19.530> back<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.070> 70s<00:03:20.549> okay

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
about it let's go back to the 70s okay

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.380 
about it let's go back to the 70s okay
nineteen<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:22.380> early<00:03:22.739> 70s<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:23.850> go<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.180> an
