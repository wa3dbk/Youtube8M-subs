00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.310
 Let's get out of here the bigger picture that 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.310
 would have 

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:14.260
 Look, we can just paint a person. 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.010

 I thought the other is rather striking a pose 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.050
 But I do not think it's the way we're going. 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.640
 rush the camera here to see the painting 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:03:00.680
