00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.669
 and when the cold season comes and the snow falls outside 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.250
 are the copies of a very corporate PC 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.499
 again increasingly found in the wild 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:13.659
 the caretaker 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.309
 the janitor wanted a start and hardly trusting 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:22.209
 who have come to terms with sim cards Stiegenhaus end meets 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.169
 the typical bone 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.149
 or humming noise 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.619
 even more dangerous is the encounter with the careless off of 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:31.519
 bicycles 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:32.490
 anchor 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.019
 or at a different disregard of house rules the dark Joseph is the one 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.119
 from the International Caretaker Research Center in Cambridge 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.160
 where does a remix of one of her sons come from? they are disillusioned 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.840
 Diffusers sent in the stairwell and the response of the janitor 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.650
 ill 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.570
 The meeting had a scandal this picture is free over 50 deposited 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.220
 Now we do not have another extension to speak out 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.350
 In the East, demonstrators are innate to us 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.350
 because most copies are in the basement 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.750
 but despite this genetic defect against the nothing 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.520
 which is in the higher floors foot 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.220
 because they are welcome the janitors are strikingly strong 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.050
 pronounced 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.270
 even in the dark night hours 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.180
 take home the house residents late at night 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.780
 or house fires were visitors 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.630
 In addition, however, must not be forgotten in the end, this 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.320
 genus 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.390
 especially in the cold winter months 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.920
 because as reliable as the cock in the country 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.710
 The janitor awakens the townspeople as long before dawn 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.100
 penetrating reputation of his outgoing 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.870
 and this sound of scratching the circles over crunching gravel 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.649
 finally belongs just as approaching Christmas time 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.200
 the lovely production 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.200
 freshly baked langosch 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.990
 when the cold season comes and 3
