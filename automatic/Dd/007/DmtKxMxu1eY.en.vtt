00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:03.509
 In this video I want to show the editing of this image 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.510
 First I activate a pressure chamber org the highlight Kipping 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.650
 that the red glowing areas indicate overexposed parts 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.079
 the financiers so the exposure and used repair sprinkler 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.310
 to correct this overexposure 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.990
 afterwards for when I weigh the pipette laps on the g for the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.439
 White balance 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.140
 Now, slightly increase the contrast below 50 picture afterwards 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.539
 Photoshop 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.430
 As a first step, I duplicated the plane for the rectification of the objective 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.810
 distortion 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.210
 I use the Park Inn BT Lenz 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.360
 and correct the tons or pillows of Farmiga feeding 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.960
 then I use the free tool and the perspective 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.210
 To correct this I first like the whole area 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.740
 become the perspectives 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.310
 Tool off 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.960
 and target the lines about the same way as the dashing lines to the photo 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.090
 see are 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.190
 if I draw the lines into a middle handle I can see if 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.020
 my perspective selection is right 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.580
 I correct this now so that the rescue of the striking building fits 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.080
 on the left side, I have the first start a little better 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.120
 hinbekommen 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.310
 the whole thing now a bit into it 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.820
 In doing so, I orient myself to the essential features of the building 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.600
 visible 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.720
 want to show well 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.930
 I can either click topfit now or click on the hook above and the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.720
 Exemption is completed 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720
 Unfortunately, the building is screwed together very strong 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.380
 to correct that for taller I first the work surface up 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.410
 namely by 50 percent relative that is half the current height 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.590
 top added 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.720
 Now really Gaumont Tel one can use the transforming tool the whole 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.160
 scale vertically 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.100
 to achieve my appealing result 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.299
 because I have not worked precisely enough before, the picture is still one 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.550
 Way and borrowed as the first route guidance years on the side of one 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.680
 put it in the middle and then activate the pay back 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.680
 I find even more striking guides added 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:11.540
 and can now 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.540
 with the initially also points of the distorted tool 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.399
 correct my little mistake from earlier on a little better 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.869
 Of course, it would have been better if I had friends leave the subject 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:26.869
 Perspective had taken care right 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.329
 I now use a black and white adjustment layer and reduce the 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.930
 Share of the Blue Channel «, which gives a nice contrasting picture 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.809
 instead, its mode switches to soft light 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.899
 By doing so I have this very radiant effect with which they have one 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.899
 take striking and well demarcated wanted 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:47.399
 I now add a hue saturation level 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.470
 and Allah the Blue Canary 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.410
 whose saturation I reduce to achieve a steel blue effect in the sky 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.309
 I change Martin Pfarr threaten so far more like something 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.180
 Now for you, another cat is adding curve to us as an adjustment plane and 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.039
 Lower the middle area 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.109
 then I want the course says stuff 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.969
 and here for the second course specification 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.599
 I place the front and have on the black and they with the radial 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.749
 run from bottom to top 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.769
 so that the effect of the adjustment plane is more on the area of ​​the sky 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.589
 limited 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:27.069
 «What we find unpleasant in this intermediate state now is that the grass 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.629
 and are relatively dark and gray are the judges black and white 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.179
 Attitude level back and associations share the greens and the money 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.419
 to make it a little more juicy brighter by changing the brightness of the 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.489
 black and white change here 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.650
 to make the architecture a little cleaner for you one 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.099
 Continue driving and saturation 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.879
 Accidents the yellows outside their saturation I subsequently clear 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.749
 to reduce 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:56.119
 "I now also increase the range of the selected color 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.119
 to the left are red and to the right in the green area 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.119
 Now I use a nice big brush 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.559
 and cling the lawns from this hue saturation to change 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:08.100
 out 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.019
 with the result that the shadows are left in the picture 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.019
 are now horrible and thus become much less dirty 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.120
 then I will take everything out and copier it down to a level 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.120
 into another level at the top 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.150
 I now use the maritime stage to better highlight the structures and to do so 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.599
 I use and create must clarify 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.150
 Normally, this filter is set so that the stronger Latif 

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.539
 high and the radius is very low 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.409
 I think that I am always a nice highlight of the small details 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.259
 and recognized caused 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.869
 I use a very large radius with a very small thickness 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.419
 around the details of the architecture for example the window frames altogether 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.069
 To emphasize that one sees best in the before-after-comparison and that also on the 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.069
 best in the once common view 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:02.489
 then I still use the selective Schaaf subscription period 

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:06.319
 with a very small radius and there is higher and stronger and the 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.319
 to improve fine details and edge sharpness 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.270
 With that, the work is almost complete. I use that one last time 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.860
 cut tool around the composition or its cut still 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.860
 to improve something 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.580
 Again, I can confirm by double-clicking the exemption 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.610
 after accidents, however, on that the grassy area in the lower right in the 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.949
 Corner a little out of place, I search times in the area 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.789
 and associations then copy the stamp 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.860
 press the old post to pick up the source and then brush the 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.529
 existing gg plates 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:46.529
 over this little grass out of step you can still see 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.069
 that looks at first glance already halfway okay 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.869
 but I was a bit imprecise so I take the source here now 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:59.650
 again at the pulpit or fugue 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.650
 and try to trace something more closely 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.490
 but this is the ugly repetition of a pattern 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.590
 noticeable so I now that Politkovskaya stuff failures 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:13.939
 Make a selection according to the perspective here and at 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.299
 Pressed Alt key these Querfugen you but once removed from the selection 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.470
 with Come and See Uncommon v I insert this plate again and move 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.309
 she along the airline 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:26.490
 and the result looks better 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.909
 now really two more times fulfilled by the picture isolated from 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.080
 by presenting user interface 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.849
 thanks for the attention and until next time
