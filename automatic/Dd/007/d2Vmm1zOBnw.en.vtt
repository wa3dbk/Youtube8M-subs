so<00:00:02.010> we've<00:00:02.190> got<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.370> quite<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> lovely<00:00:04.430> 620<00:00:05.430> tea

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
so we've got a quite a lovely 620 tea

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.310 
so we've got a quite a lovely 620 tea
reef<00:00:07.740> aquarium<00:00:08.280> here<00:00:08.870> it's<00:00:09.870> got<00:00:09.990> very<00:00:10.230> good

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
reef aquarium here it's got very good

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.419 
reef aquarium here it's got very good
water<00:00:10.590> flow<00:00:11.269> which<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.420> always<00:00:12.570> good<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.900> see

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
water flow which is always good to see

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.710 
water flow which is always good to see
um<00:00:14.429> it's<00:00:14.820> run<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.179> canister<00:00:15.690> as<00:00:15.809> well<00:00:16.049> and

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
um it's run on a canister as well and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.170 
um it's run on a canister as well and
it's<00:00:18.720> also<00:00:18.810> got<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> chiller<00:00:19.760> so<00:00:20.760> certainly

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
it's also got a chiller so certainly

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.960 
it's also got a chiller so certainly
ticking<00:00:21.539> all<00:00:21.630> those<00:00:21.840> boxes<00:00:22.310> it's<00:00:23.310> got<00:00:23.699> way<00:00:23.939> too

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
ticking all those boxes it's got way too

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.170 
ticking all those boxes it's got way too
much<00:00:24.330> contact<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.109> substrate<00:00:25.820> so<00:00:26.820> this

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
much contact with the substrate so this

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.849 
much contact with the substrate so this
tanks<00:00:27.449> gonna<00:00:27.539> get<00:00:27.750> react<00:00:28.109> with<00:00:28.349> scaped<00:00:28.650> and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
tanks gonna get react with scaped and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.339 
tanks gonna get react with scaped and
put<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.160> points<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:30.269> basically<00:00:30.660> try<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:30.960> raise

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
put on points to basically try and raise

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.459 
put on points to basically try and raise
all<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.390> rocks<00:00:33.390> off<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.809> substrate<00:00:34.320> to

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
all of the rocks off the substrate to

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.290 
all of the rocks off the substrate to
minimize<00:00:34.800> contact<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> substrate<00:00:35.790> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
minimize contact with the substrate and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.880 
minimize contact with the substrate and
that's<00:00:36.660> particularly<00:00:37.050> important<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.710> this

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
that's particularly important with this

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.549 
that's particularly important with this
very<00:00:38.160> fine<00:00:38.460> sand<00:00:38.969> because<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> very<00:00:40.260> fine

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
very fine sand because the very fine

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.260 
very fine sand because the very fine
sand<00:00:40.920> tends<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.399> go<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.670> knocks<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.030> quicker

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
sand tends to go and knocks it quicker

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.479 
sand tends to go and knocks it quicker
because<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> oxygen<00:00:43.350> can't<00:00:43.739> get<00:00:43.920> into<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.219> now

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
because the oxygen can't get into it now

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.639 
because the oxygen can't get into it now
the<00:00:45.180> main<00:00:45.660> problem<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.260> aquarium

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the main problem with this aquarium

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.090 
the main problem with this aquarium
right<00:00:46.770> now<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.280> him<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> damsel<00:00:49.500> trap<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
right now is him so the damsel trap is

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.709 
right now is him so the damsel trap is
something<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.430> talk<00:00:50.640> about<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:51.000> all<00:00:51.120> my<00:00:51.210> DVDs

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
something I talk about on all my DVDs

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.529 
something I talk about on all my DVDs
and<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:53.070> damsel<00:00:53.280> trap<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.850> basically<00:00:54.270> where

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and the damsel trap is basically where

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.880 
and the damsel trap is basically where
you<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.899> quite<00:00:55.050> an<00:00:55.199> aggressive<00:00:55.320> fish

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
you get it quite an aggressive fish

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.470 
you get it quite an aggressive fish
that's<00:00:56.129> put<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.399> early<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> piece<00:00:57.210> and

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that's put in early on in the piece and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.750 
that's put in early on in the piece and
he<00:00:58.050> pretty<00:00:58.199> much<00:00:58.289> terrorizes<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> new<00:00:59.550> fish

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
he pretty much terrorizes the new fish

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.760 
he pretty much terrorizes the new fish
that<00:00:59.969> are<00:01:00.059> put<00:01:00.180> into<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> aquarium<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
that are put into the aquarium so the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.179 
that are put into the aquarium so the
new<00:01:01.920> fish<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.340> were<00:01:02.489> put<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.989> there.put<00:01:03.989> in

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
new fish that were put in there.put in

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.620 
new fish that were put in there.put in
predictably<00:01:05.189> stressed<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.479> get

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
predictably stressed and they get

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.109 
predictably stressed and they get
constantly<00:01:07.229> picked<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.650> by<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.220> little

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
constantly picked on by a little

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.899 
constantly picked on by a little
resident<00:01:09.540> damsel<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> damsel<00:01:11.460> needs<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
resident damsel so the damsel needs to

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.700 
resident damsel so the damsel needs to
be<00:01:12.030> removed<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.900> case<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> tank<00:01:13.560> is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
be removed so in this case the tank is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.649 
be removed so in this case the tank is
going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.340> taken<00:01:14.670> apart<00:01:14.760> it's

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
going to have to be taken apart it's

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.570 
going to have to be taken apart it's
going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> nice<00:01:16.409> opportunity<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.250> redo

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
going to be a nice opportunity to redo

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.810 
going to be a nice opportunity to redo
the<00:01:17.729> rocks<00:01:18.650> I'm<00:01:19.650> also<00:01:19.890> suggesting<00:01:20.310> that

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the rocks I'm also suggesting that

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.200 
the rocks I'm also suggesting that
better<00:01:21.780> lights<00:01:22.140> are<00:01:22.409> considered<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
better lights are considered so with the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.640 
better lights are considered so with the
tank<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> lighting<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> way<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.560> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
tank with the lighting the way it is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.140 
tank with the lighting the way it is
which<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.860> just<00:01:26.009> some<00:01:26.280> power<00:01:26.490> compact<00:01:26.909> lights

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
which is just some power compact lights

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.990 
which is just some power compact lights
if<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.590> low<00:01:28.890> light<00:01:29.159> corals<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
if we just have low light corals at the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.960 
if we just have low light corals at the
bottom<00:01:30.710> things<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.159> leathers<00:01:32.729> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
bottom things like your leathers and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.380 
bottom things like your leathers and
karelas<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.840> things<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.229> go<00:01:34.860> well<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.390> any

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
karelas and things do go well and any

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.080 
karelas and things do go well and any
non-photosynthetic<00:01:37.140> corals<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.400> try<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
non-photosynthetic corals and try and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.270 
non-photosynthetic corals and try and
move<00:01:39.270> any<00:01:39.740> photosynthetic<00:01:40.740> corals<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
move any photosynthetic corals to the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.530 
move any photosynthetic corals to the
top<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:43.380> should<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.860> fine<00:01:44.540> but

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
top and it should all be fine but

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.980 
top and it should all be fine but
improving<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.470> light<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.700> always<00:01:48.479> going

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
improving the light is just always going

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.630 
improving the light is just always going
to<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.170> amazing<00:01:49.439> things<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.100> far<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.430> reef

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
to do amazing things as far as a reef

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.969 
to do amazing things as far as a reef
aquarium<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.149> concerned<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.740> you've<00:01:52.860> got

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
aquarium is concerned and if you've got

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.859 
aquarium is concerned and if you've got
a<00:01:53.009> good<00:01:53.280> LED<00:01:53.759> system<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.299> definitely<00:01:54.689> not

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
a good LED system it's definitely not

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.870 
a good LED system it's definitely not
going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.290> cheap<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:55.920> absolutely

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
going to be cheap but it's absolutely

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.050

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
worth its weight in gold when you see it

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.999 
worth its weight in gold when you see it
the<00:02:00.060> performance<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.020> LED<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.710> new<00:02:01.860> LED

also encourage a coral and algae and
there's<00:02:34.980> quite<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.190> lot<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.490> rare<00:02:35.700> puffers<00:02:36.120> in

there's quite a lot of rare puffers in
this<00:02:36.390> tank<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.620> important<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:38.160> to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
this tank and it is important just to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.860 
this tank and it is important just to
watch<00:02:38.460> them<00:02:38.670> with<00:02:38.820> corals<00:02:39.240> because<00:02:39.390> they<00:02:39.630> can

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
watch them with corals because they can

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.380 
watch them with corals because they can
you<00:02:40.050> put<00:02:40.200> some<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.620> corals<00:02:40.980> probably<00:02:41.970> not

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
you put some of the corals probably not

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.760 
you put some of the corals probably not
too<00:02:42.600> prone<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.110> ones<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.350> are<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.620> here

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
too prone to the ones that are in here

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.080 
too prone to the ones that are in here
at<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.010> moment<00:02:44.160> but<00:02:44.460> that's<00:02:44.670> just<00:02:44.880> something

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
at the moment but that's just something

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.110 
at the moment but that's just something
to<00:02:45.210> also<00:02:45.720> keep<00:02:45.960> an<00:02:46.080> eye<00:02:46.200> on<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.970> some<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
to also keep an eye on and some of the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.630 
to also keep an eye on and some of the
corals<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.630> little<00:02:48.900> bit<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.110> recession

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
corals have a little bit of a recession

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.290 
corals have a little bit of a recession
so<00:02:50.640> we're<00:02:50.850> going<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.300> do<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.080> coral<00:02:52.770> dip<00:02:53.090> in<00:02:54.090> a

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
so we're going to do a coral dip in a

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.140 
so we're going to do a coral dip in a
product<00:02:54.540> like<00:02:54.750> either<00:02:55.130> bright<00:02:56.130> wells<00:02:56.370> Medi

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
product like either bright wells Medi

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.530 
product like either bright wells Medi
coral<00:02:57.570> or<00:02:58.230> revive<00:02:58.710> something<00:02:59.190> like<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.640> the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
coral or revive something like that the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.910 
coral or revive something like that the
corals<00:03:00.840> will<00:03:00.930> definitely<00:03:01.320> benefit<00:03:01.680> from<00:03:01.740> a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
corals will definitely benefit from a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.880 
corals will definitely benefit from a
bit<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.840> bit<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.990> dip<00:03:04.200> just<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.560> knock<00:03:04.740> off

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
bit of a bit of a dip just to knock off

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.500 
bit of a bit of a dip just to knock off
any<00:03:05.040> bacterial<00:03:05.610> infection<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.210> they<00:03:06.300> may

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
any bacterial infection that they may

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.450 
any bacterial infection that they may
have<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:08.250> all<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.270> all<00:03:09.390> it's<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:10.460> beautiful

have so all in all it's a beautiful
little<00:03:11.640> tank<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.320> it's<00:03:13.320> very<00:03:13.740> close<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.490> being

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
little tank and it's very close to being

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.110 
little tank and it's very close to being
a<00:03:14.820> spectacular<00:03:15.630> little<00:03:15.870> tank
