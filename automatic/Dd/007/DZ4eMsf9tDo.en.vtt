00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello people with you mouse and this is the first 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.350
 crash test transmission issue where we will 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.929
 test for strength 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.110
 technique from our game and in this release 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.570
 our hero will be mouse legend of the world of tanks 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.560
 remember those times when there was only 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.500
 only three tanks of level 10 730 of which 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.330
 now pt level 9 and the mouse whose 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.330
 then there were three thousand 200 hp 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.630
 oh well tell me who is the main enemy 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.910
 mouse on the open cards that the balance is well 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.190
 yes almost certainly it is ortho 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.440
 how are we going to do a crash test all 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.510
 very easy take the mouse pounding it on 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.090
 slide in prokhorovka deliver shine 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.730
 and swap hp okay joke for real 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.570
 In fact, we want to check 15 hits art 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.059
 what level can the mouse endure for 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.329
 We have done several tests for this. 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.399
 test number one we took 15 art of the second 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.140
 level by the way it is worth noting that we 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.059
 there were no specific criteria about 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.949
 nation throughout the test 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.320
 but as for the mouse it is on it 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.270
 fully deflated type shane 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.090
 and gold first aid kit with fire extinguisher 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.680
 fan set and wet 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.680
 ammo but just in case 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.110
 endured even without a single 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.260
 damage only paint scratched 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.930
 go to the second test here already 15 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.600
 Level 3 art may not sound so threatening 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.360
 but there is a threat to the health of the mouse again 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.190
 we put everyone in the circle mouse center 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.920
 shoot and again stood true lost 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.380
 with 201 health opened up for moloso 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.510
 pennies go to the third test 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.580
 the third test as you probably already 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.420
 guessed it was simple in principle 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.480
 will art 4 level eat stand up as 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.150

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.920

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.190

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.750
 thousands of hepe not demolished 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.980

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.670
 the power of the mouse test number 5 art of the sixth 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.470
 level 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.720
 reintroducing into a geometric shape 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:51.770

 level needed to destroy 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.360
 one whole mouse may have been necessary 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.490
 put all the art in one row before him 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.320
 so they shot him in the forehead then 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.090
 him and chances were more like you
