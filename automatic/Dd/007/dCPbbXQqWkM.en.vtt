00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
so this is the same operating system

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.690 
so this is the same operating system
with<00:00:10.290> same<00:00:10.590> user<00:00:10.800> interface<00:00:11.219> running<00:00:11.610> on

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
with same user interface running on

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.240 
with same user interface running on
tablets<00:00:12.150> just<00:00:12.599> using<00:00:12.900> interface<00:00:13.170> scales<00:00:14.099> or

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
tablets just using interface scales or

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.070 
tablets just using interface scales or
cells<00:00:14.460> now<00:00:14.610> beautifully<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.719> new<00:00:15.839> form

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
cells now beautifully to this new form

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.200 
cells now beautifully to this new form
factor<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:17.070> one<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.550> additional<00:00:18.000> things

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
factor so one of the additional things

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.480 
factor so one of the additional things
we<00:00:18.330> added<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.750> tablet<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.170> multi-user<00:00:19.650> so

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
we added to the tablet is multi-user so

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.540 
we added to the tablet is multi-user so
the<00:00:20.960> temple<00:00:21.960> often<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.260> used<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.830> family

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
to do something else and that's what the

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.490 
to do something else and that's what the
side<00:01:49.340> stage<00:01:49.640> just<00:01:49.850> for<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:50.570> bun<00:01:50.780> too<00:01:50.960> because

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
side stage just for a bun too because

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.770 
side stage just for a bun too because
it's<00:01:51.679> this<00:01:51.979> place<00:01:52.250> another<00:01:52.970> appt<00:01:53.240> next<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.659> it

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
it's this place another appt next to it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.529 
it's this place another appt next to it
almost<00:01:54.229> as<00:01:54.440> overlay<00:01:54.890> over<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:56.030> media<00:01:56.330> player

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
almost as overlay over this media player

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.190 
almost as overlay over this media player
so<00:01:56.720> for<00:01:56.810> example<00:01:56.869> when<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.229> want<00:01:57.409> now<00:01:57.649> on<00:01:58.490> launch

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
so for example when I want now on launch

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.230 
so for example when I want now on launch
notepads<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.440> shows<00:02:01.069> it<00:02:01.220> as<00:02:01.280> an<00:02:01.399> overlay<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:02.000> can

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
notepads it shows it as an overlay I can

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.180 
notepads it shows it as an overlay I can
