00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
center from the top point at the center

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.510 
center from the top point at the center
using<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.550> center<00:00:57.210> line<00:00:57.949> to<00:00:58.949> the<00:01:01.520> quarter

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
using the center line to the quarter

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.940 
using the center line to the quarter
line<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:02.969> made<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.840> should<00:01:07.170> have

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:22.780 
it like this next you want to fold this
corner<00:01:15.680> half<00:01:16.700> do<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:18.140> half<00:01:19.140> angle<00:01:20.840> bisector

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
corner half do a half angle bisector

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.920 
corner half do a half angle bisector
just<00:01:23.790> fold<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.509> half

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
just fold it in half

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.700 
just fold it in half
really<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.759> then<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.909> want<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> fold<00:01:27.710> the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
left side across the edge of the paper

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.140 
left side across the edge of the paper
like<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:38.119> say<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.970> want

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
to do the angle bisector again and fold

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.539 
to do the angle bisector again and fold
to<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> left<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:49.520> then<00:01:50.520> you

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
out of 12 of the pieces put together you

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.449 
out of 12 of the pieces put together you
need<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.920> want<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.340> make<00:03:49.549> like<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:50.090> triangle<00:03:51.019> of
