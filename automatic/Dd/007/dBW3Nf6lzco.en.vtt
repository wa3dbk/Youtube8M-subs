00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.980
 has sunk I am playing that is that someone who wants it to be 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.310
 these threats 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.660
 and that your children of becerril and that is the negative side would be to lower the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.560
 volume 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.560
 with almost everything is negative india is not positive 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.100
 kept the sd type 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.710
 in which life seems to have passed him by 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.270
 although I would like to be 20 years old again 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.040
 is the idol of the club 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.150
 but I was going to have an extraordinary occasion 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.150
 in the Balearic Islands could go back clockwise 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160
 is 17 years old 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.010
 in a second 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.640
 uncertain times are represented groups of adolescents 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.610
 is the opportunity to take action 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.890
 but to do it well 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.740
 maybe the institute of 122 and 50 meters 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.440
 they wanted to enroll my son 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.250
 xico df agencies that it was not worth it anymore 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.250
 I think we're going to come out of the closet 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.130
 and again because you do not need support 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.000
 he has returned to class 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 but I am hungry 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.910
 and again comes into play for people is more 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.660
 how did you become a very tragic institution? 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.800
 that helps 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.210
 in 2009 massimino and good 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.040
 because you go out with the cnt controls the little 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.620
 quito 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.650
 will have one last chance 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.530
 I do not do it for me 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.370
 for clear lesson here 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.590
 to get it right he finished 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.590
 it was equalized on youtube it was seen that he gave you a review 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.579
 and the system presents 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:05.570
 when you are young 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.169
 what seems the end of the world 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.309
 but is not 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.309
 it's just the beginning 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:17.699
 since it produces 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.999
 today the basketball team 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.529
 also admits that the deficit has been easy 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:24.529
 smart 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.909
 than these professionals etc 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.090
 '17 again'
