cleaver all right so first of all let's
go<00:00:24.930> into<00:00:25.380> our<00:00:26.390> shapes<00:00:27.949> and<00:00:28.949> then<00:00:29.189> we're<00:00:29.460> going

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
go into our shapes and then we're going

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.510 
go into our shapes and then we're going
to<00:00:29.640> choose<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.150> rectangle<00:00:31.099> and<00:00:32.099> get<00:00:32.340> this

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520

corners scroll down in your we're going

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.899 
corners scroll down in your we're going
to<00:01:25.890> fillet<00:01:26.549> right<00:01:27.450> here<00:01:28.310> nice<00:01:29.310> thing<00:01:29.610> called

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
to fillet right here nice thing called

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.649 
to fillet right here nice thing called
fillet<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:31.400> then<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.909> actually<00:01:33.119> want<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
fillet and then we actually want it to

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.760 
fillet and then we actually want it to
fillet<00:01:36.710> 19.0<00:01:38.180> then<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.450> hit<00:01:39.570> enter<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
fillet 19.0 then just hit enter on the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.039 
fillet 19.0 then just hit enter on the
keyboard<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.490> voila<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:44.009> now<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.520> a

keyboard and voila you now have a

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.310 
keyboard and voila you now have a
rounded<00:01:46.049> corner<00:01:46.790> next<00:01:47.790> step<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.509> we're

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
rounded corner next step here is we're

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.649 
rounded corner next step here is we're
going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.710> actually<00:01:50.070> take<00:01:52.040> our<00:01:53.090> spline<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
going to actually take our spline and

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.569 
going to actually take our spline and
we're<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> extrude<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:59.630> let's<00:02:00.630> go<00:02:00.810> with

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
we're going to extrude it let's go with

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:08.389 
we're going to extrude it let's go with
three<00:02:02.579> point<00:02:02.909> oh<00:02:05.630> alright<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.009> then<00:02:08.009> after

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
three point oh alright and then after

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.600 
three point oh alright and then after
that<00:02:08.450> convert<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:10.440> editable<00:02:11.220> poly

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that convert it to the editable poly

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.850 
that convert it to the editable poly
either<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.599> do<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:12.810> by<00:02:13.020> right-clicking

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
either you can do this by right-clicking

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.600 
either you can do this by right-clicking
or<00:02:14.070> just<00:02:14.340> go<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.850> polygon<00:02:15.830> modeling<00:02:16.830> and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
or just go to the polygon modeling and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.110 
or just go to the polygon modeling and
then<00:02:17.940> click<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:18.480> convert<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.140> poly<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.910> does

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
then click on convert to poly it does

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.930 
then click on convert to poly it does
the<00:02:21.240> same<00:02:21.270> thing<00:02:22.310> all<00:02:23.310> right<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:23.730> we're

the same thing all right and then we're
going<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.120> select<00:02:24.330> couple<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.050> these<00:02:25.260> vertices

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
going to select couple of these vertices

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.040 
going to select couple of these vertices
here<00:02:26.310> now<00:02:26.790> i'm<00:02:26.970> going<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.150> scroll<00:02:27.480> into<00:02:27.900> my

here now i'm going to scroll into my

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.190 
here now i'm going to scroll into my
left<00:02:28.880> view<00:02:29.880> port<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.870> i<00:02:30.900> can<00:02:31.370> isolate<00:02:32.370> these

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
left view port so i can isolate these

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.790 
left view port so i can isolate these
vertices<00:02:34.200> i<00:02:34.740> want<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:37.080> make<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.440> into<00:02:37.770> like

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
vertices i want it to make it into like

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.670 
vertices i want it to make it into like
a<00:02:38.010> blade<00:02:38.550> kind<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.030> shape<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:40.260> I'm<00:02:40.320> just<00:02:40.500> going

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
a blade kind of shape so I'm just going

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.060 
a blade kind of shape so I'm just going
to<00:02:40.770> push<00:02:41.130> them<00:02:41.400> back<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.620> while<00:02:43.620> we<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:44.010> a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
to push them back and while we have a

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.430 
to push them back and while we have a
sharpened<00:02:44.940> blade<00:02:46.310> totally<00:02:47.310> awesome<00:02:47.700> right

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
sharpened blade totally awesome right

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.410 
sharpened blade totally awesome right
alright<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.680> then<00:02:49.890> after<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.459> we<00:02:51.030> are<00:02:51.060> going

going<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.140> make<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.640> box<00:03:00.770> so<00:03:01.770> go<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.550> create

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
going to make a box so go to the create

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.420 
going to make a box so go to the create
tab<00:03:03.230> go<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.260> geometry<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.580> box<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:08.190> course

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
tab go to geometry and box and of course

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.560 
tab go to geometry and box and of course
we're<00:03:08.610> going<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.790> make<00:03:08.880> this<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.360> top

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
we're going to make this in the top

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.340 
we're going to make this in the top
viewport<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:14.310> about<00:03:14.550> right<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.000> then

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
viewport it's about right and then

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:29.440 
viewport it's about right and then
adjust<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.830> parameters<00:03:21.620> 32<00:03:22.620> for<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.100> length

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:38.750 

212<00:03:30.830> for<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.190> width<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:37.489> we're<00:03:38.489> just<00:03:38.610> going

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
212 for the width and we're just going

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.390 
212 for the width and we're just going
to<00:03:38.970> turn<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.360> height<00:03:39.600> up<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.810> eight<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:43.400> we

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
to turn the height up to eight and we

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.930 
to turn the height up to eight and we
need<00:03:44.549> some<00:03:44.820> segments<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.570> there<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:46.410> help

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
need some segments in there to help

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.009 
need some segments in there to help
adjust<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.540> roundness<00:03:48.959> at<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.380> edge<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:51.019> the

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
adjust the roundness at the edge of the

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.270 
adjust the roundness at the edge of the
handle<00:03:53.600> so<00:03:54.600> five<00:03:55.110> five<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.980> seven<00:03:56.700> and

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
handle so five five and seven and

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.510 
handle so five five and seven and
converts<00:03:59.280> poly

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.270 

and<00:04:03.510> then<00:04:04.050> what<00:04:04.290> we're<00:04:04.440> going<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.620> do<00:04:04.830> is<00:04:05.070> we're

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
and then what we're going to do is we're

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.430 
and then what we're going to do is we're
going<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.430> move<00:04:06.500> some<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:09.440> vertices

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
going to move some of the vertices

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.850 
going to move some of the vertices
around<00:04:14.660> make<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:15.840> look<00:04:16.110> a<00:04:16.260> bit<00:04:16.440> more<00:04:16.470> knife

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
around make it look a bit more knife

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.970 
around make it look a bit more knife
like<00:04:17.100> art<00:04:17.370> first<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:18.090> all<00:04:18.270> I<00:04:18.300> gotta<00:04:18.890> all<00:04:19.890> right

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
like art first of all I gotta all right

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.410 
like art first of all I gotta all right
now<00:04:20.130> we're<00:04:20.310> going<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.459> move<00:04:20.549> some<00:04:20.970> vertices

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
now we're going to move some vertices

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:30.100 
now we're going to move some vertices
around<00:04:25.340> start<00:04:26.340> off<00:04:26.550> in<00:04:26.790> the<00:04:26.910> top<00:04:27.120> viewport

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.300 

move<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.560> around<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:33.200> will<00:04:34.200> end<00:04:34.380> up<00:04:34.560> looking

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
move it around so it will end up looking

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.850 
move it around so it will end up looking
a<00:04:35.430> bit<00:04:35.460> more<00:04:35.880> curved<00:04:38.360> yeah<00:04:39.360> that<00:04:39.900> gives<00:04:40.590> us<00:04:40.800> a

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
a bit more curved yeah that gives us a

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:52.820 
a bit more curved yeah that gives us a
nice<00:04:41.130> curve<00:04:41.460> there<00:04:49.190> some<00:04:50.190> of<00:04:50.610> those<00:04:51.650> let's<00:04:52.650> go

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
nice curve there some of those let's go

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.850 
nice curve there some of those let's go
with<00:04:54.020> these<00:04:55.020> top<00:04:55.470> three<00:04:55.920> here<00:04:56.630> actually<00:04:57.630> these

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
with these top three here actually these

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.230 
with these top three here actually these
these<00:04:58.860> top<00:04:59.160> four<00:05:00.890> very<00:05:01.890> to<00:05:02.130> see<00:05:02.340> this<00:05:02.850> would<00:05:03.060> be

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
these top four very to see this would be

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.180 
these top four very to see this would be
the<00:05:03.420> point<00:05:03.600> in<00:05:03.750> time<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.260> go<00:05:04.560> ahead<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:04.890> work

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
the point in time to go ahead and work

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.170 
the point in time to go ahead and work
in<00:05:05.550> your<00:05:06.000> perspective<00:05:06.780> viewport<00:05:07.940> so<00:05:08.940> you<00:05:09.030> can

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
in your perspective viewport so you can

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.980 
in your perspective viewport so you can
make<00:05:09.660> your<00:05:10.200> selections<00:05:10.890> easier<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.780> we're

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
make your selections easier and we're

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.750 
make your selections easier and we're
just<00:05:13.200> going<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:14.120> move<00:05:15.120> these<00:05:15.420> a<00:05:15.810> bit<00:05:16.550> move<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.730> a

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
just going to move these a bit move it a

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.250 
just going to move these a bit move it a
bit<00:05:17.940> on<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.600> bottom<00:05:19.200> as<00:05:19.380> well<00:05:20.960> to<00:05:21.960> give<00:05:21.990> us

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
bit on the bottom as well to give us

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:31.080 
bit on the bottom as well to give us
kind<00:05:22.440> of<00:05:22.620> a<00:05:22.740> softer<00:05:23.400> edge

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:40.780 

already

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.690 

alright<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:42.350> once<00:05:42.680> we're<00:05:43.010> done<00:05:43.340> with<00:05:43.400> that

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
alright and once we're done with that

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.830 
alright and once we're done with that
and<00:05:44.360> we<00:05:44.780> get<00:05:45.020> it<00:05:45.640> to<00:05:46.640> the<00:05:47.060> amount<00:05:47.390> of<00:05:47.540> curve

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
and we get it to the amount of curve

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.280 
and we get it to the amount of curve
that<00:05:48.200> we<00:05:48.560> wish<00:05:48.950> to<00:05:48.980> have<00:05:49.340> their<00:05:49.810> go<00:05:50.810> ahead<00:05:51.080> and

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
that we wish to have their go ahead and

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.810 
that we wish to have their go ahead and
go<00:05:52.070> to<00:05:52.130> the<00:05:52.340> modifier<00:05:52.790> list<00:05:53.860> go<00:05:54.860> down<00:05:55.160> scroll

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
go to the modifier list go down scroll

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:03.370 
go to the modifier list go down scroll
down<00:05:55.850> here<00:05:56.000> to<00:05:56.450> measure<00:05:56.840> smooth<00:06:01.600> and<00:06:02.600> we're

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
down here to measure smooth and we're

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:12.220 
down here to measure smooth and we're
going<00:06:03.500> to<00:06:03.560> go<00:06:03.800> with<00:06:04.090> three<00:06:05.090> iterations<00:06:11.230> all

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
going to go with three iterations all

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.070 
going to go with three iterations all
right<00:06:12.440> and<00:06:12.740> then<00:06:13.700> we're<00:06:14.150> going<00:06:14.270> to<00:06:14.330> repeat

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
right and then we're going to repeat

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:25.990 
right and then we're going to repeat
this<00:06:15.140> process<00:06:21.850> over<00:06:22.850> here<00:06:23.270> on<00:06:23.450> the<00:06:24.290> blade<00:06:25.000> part

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
this process over here on the blade part

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.980 
this process over here on the blade part
of<00:06:26.240> the<00:06:26.450> knife<00:06:26.600> and<00:06:30.430> the<00:06:31.430> reason<00:06:32.390> for<00:06:32.600> this<00:06:32.720> I

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
of the knife and the reason for this I

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.740 
of the knife and the reason for this I
believe<00:06:33.260> is<00:06:33.740> that<00:06:34.340> when<00:06:35.300> you're<00:06:35.480> chopping

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
believe is that when you're chopping

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.290 
believe is that when you're chopping
through<00:06:36.200> stuff<00:06:36.560> you<00:06:37.550> have<00:06:37.700> to<00:06:37.760> have<00:06:38.030> a<00:06:38.060> certain

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
through stuff you have to have a certain

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.000 
through stuff you have to have a certain
amount<00:06:38.750> of<00:06:39.640> iteration<00:06:40.640> or<00:06:41.770> whatever<00:06:42.770> that<00:06:42.860> is

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
amount of iteration or whatever that is

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:49.180 
amount of iteration or whatever that is
called<00:06:43.400> that<00:06:44.030> chef's<00:06:45.020> call<00:06:45.380> it<00:06:46.150> so<00:06:47.150> that<00:06:48.190> your

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
called that chef's call it so that your

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.790 
called that chef's call it so that your
food<00:06:49.430> doesn't<00:06:49.850> get<00:06:50.000> stuck<00:06:50.270> to<00:06:50.510> the<00:06:50.630> knife

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
food doesn't get stuck to the knife

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.100 
food doesn't get stuck to the knife
quite<00:06:51.800> as<00:06:51.950> easily<00:06:52.540> so<00:06:53.540> we're<00:06:53.720> going<00:06:53.840> to<00:06:53.930> take

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
quite as easily so we're going to take

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.040 
quite as easily so we're going to take
