what<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.170> turned<00:01:46.440> into<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.510> think<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> same

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
what we turned into and I think the same

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.170 
what we turned into and I think the same
is<00:01:49.320> true<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.040> culture<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:51.000> also

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
is true of this culture I have also

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.390 
is true of this culture I have also
found<00:01:51.540> myself<00:01:51.810> pulling<00:01:52.230> away<00:01:52.440> from<00:01:52.800> this

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
found myself pulling away from this

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.790 
found myself pulling away from this
culture<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.330> caring<00:01:54.810> about<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.110> outcome

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
culture and not caring about the outcome

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.630 
culture and not caring about the outcome
because<00:01:56.760> I<00:01:57.740> think<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> same<00:01:59.070> thing<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.340> true

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
because I think the same thing is true

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.120 
because I think the same thing is true
this<00:02:00.210> culture<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.960> country<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.560> American

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
this culture the country the American

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.850 
this culture the country the American
country<00:02:02.670> was<00:02:02.820> given<00:02:03.180> great<00:02:03.450> gift<00:02:04.320> it

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
country was given great gift it

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.280 
country was given great gift it
developed<00:02:05.730> great<00:02:05.940> gifts<00:02:06.300> on<00:02:06.510> its<00:02:06.720> own<00:02:06.900> at<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
developed great gifts on its own at the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.740 
developed great gifts on its own at the
beginning<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:07.980> I<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.149> squandered

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
beginning and I think we squandered

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.040 
beginning and I think we squandered
these<00:02:10.170> these<00:02:10.560> ideals<00:02:11.130> these<00:02:11.550> noble<00:02:12.060> purposes

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
these these ideals these noble purposes

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.080 
these these ideals these noble purposes
and<00:02:13.230> ideals<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.800> we<00:02:14.040> began<00:02:14.460> with

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and ideals that we began with

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.210 
and ideals that we began with
and<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:16.620> went<00:02:16.860> off<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.340> track<00:02:18.440> because<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.739> the
