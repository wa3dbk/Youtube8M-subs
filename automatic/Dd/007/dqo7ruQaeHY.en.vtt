okay<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.630> causes<00:01:18.900> them<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> make<00:01:19.470> their

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
okay and that causes them to make their

of<00:01:22.740> course<00:01:23.450> some<00:01:24.450> would<00:01:24.600> say<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.810> has<00:01:24.930> some

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
of course some would say it has some

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.499 
of course some would say it has some
similarities<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.520> market<00:01:27.090> at<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> time

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
similarities to the market at the time

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.910 
similarities to the market at the time
when<00:01:27.659> people<00:01:27.840> were<00:01:28.020> getting<00:01:28.229> involved<00:01:28.619> in

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
when people were getting involved in

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.980 
when people were getting involved in
those<00:01:29.040> sort<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.369> schemes<00:01:29.700> we've<00:01:29.909> seen<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.450> rapid

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
those sort of schemes we've seen a rapid

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.980 
those sort of schemes we've seen a rapid
escalation<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:32.070> them<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:33.270> property<00:01:33.689> prices

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
escalation of them of property prices

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.550 
escalation of them of property prices
and<00:01:34.530> yields<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.579> low<00:01:35.759> how<00:01:36.570> different<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and yields a low how different do you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.140 
and yields a low how different do you
think<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.340> time<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.850> any<00:01:38.970> other

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
think it is this time to any other

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.359 
think it is this time to any other
cycles<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.200> you've<00:01:40.470> seen<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.250> only

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
cycles that you've seen the only

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.450 
cycles that you've seen the only
difference<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.990> taken<00:01:43.350> longer

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
difference now is that it's taken longer

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
difference now is that it's taken longer
at<00:01:44.460> what's<00:01:44.670> gone<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.270> longer<00:01:45.450> than<00:01:45.600> one

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
at what's gone on for longer than one

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.870 
at what's gone on for longer than one
would<00:01:46.290> expect<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.700> these

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
would expect right and we have these

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.580 
would expect right and we have these
extremely<00:01:48.450> low<00:01:48.689> interest<00:01:49.020> rates<00:01:49.229> would<00:01:49.380> seem

extremely low interest rates would seem

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.800 
extremely low interest rates would seem
to<00:01:49.680> be<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:49.979> forever<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.810> deflation

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
to be here forever we have a deflation

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.870 
to be here forever we have a deflation
effectively<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.409> many<00:01:52.590> cases<00:01:53.009> yeah<00:01:53.280> house

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
effectively in many cases yeah house

it'll<00:02:03.719> slow<00:02:03.990> down<00:02:04.020> right<00:02:04.680> not<00:02:05.369> going<00:02:05.520> to

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
it'll slow down right not going to

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.580
