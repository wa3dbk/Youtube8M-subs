a label on this ultimate survival

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.950 
a label on this ultimate survival
technologies<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:25.910> it's<00:00:26.150> a<00:00:26.300> great<00:00:26.509> light<00:00:26.750> it's

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
technologies and it's a great light it's

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.050 
technologies and it's a great light it's
taken<00:00:27.289> us<00:00:27.380> about<00:00:27.560> five<00:00:27.859> years<00:00:28.220> to<00:00:28.400> develop<00:00:28.550> it

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
taken us about five years to develop it

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.300 
taken us about five years to develop it
but<00:00:29.509> it's<00:00:29.689> an<00:00:29.779> LED<00:00:30.230> light<00:00:30.470> so<00:00:31.009> you<00:00:31.070> get

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
but it's an LED light so you get

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.270 
but it's an LED light so you get
longevity<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.150> the<00:00:32.240> battery<00:00:32.599> to<00:00:32.900> it<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:34.100> neat

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
longevity to the battery to it the neat

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.580 
longevity to the battery to it the neat
thing<00:00:34.490> about<00:00:34.520> it<00:00:34.790> it's<00:00:35.150> water<00:00:35.420> activated<00:00:36.080> so

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
thing about it it's water activated so

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.770 
thing about it it's water activated so
you<00:00:36.680> simply<00:00:37.160> put<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:37.490> in<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.610> water<00:00:37.790> it<00:00:38.180> turns

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
you simply put it in the water it turns

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.530 
you simply put it in the water it turns
itself<00:00:39.230> on<00:00:39.500> or<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:40.610> could<00:00:40.790> do<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.060> manually

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
itself on or you could do it manually

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.840 
itself on or you could do it manually
might<00:00:42.410> simply<00:00:42.860> push<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.280> button<00:00:43.610> and<00:00:43.760> it

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
might simply push the button and it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.060 
might simply push the button and it
turns<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.330> stroke<00:00:44.720> push<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.740> button<00:00:45.980> again

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
turns to a stroke push the button again

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.940 
turns to a stroke push the button again
and<00:00:46.460> it<00:00:46.550> turns<00:00:46.580> to<00:00:46.910> a<00:00:47.060> solid<00:00:47.570> light<00:00:47.780> now<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.620> lot

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
and it turns to a solid light now a lot

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.650 
and it turns to a solid light now a lot
of<00:00:49.100> other<00:00:49.250> companies<00:00:49.490> have<00:00:49.910> similar<00:00:50.360> lights

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
of other companies have similar lights

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.210 
of other companies have similar lights
but<00:00:50.990> I<00:00:51.020> don't<00:00:51.260> think<00:00:51.440> they<00:00:51.560> do<00:00:51.620> all<00:00:52.010> those

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
but I don't think they do all those

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.040 
but I don't think they do all those
functions<00:00:52.820> is<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:53.030> right<00:00:53.390> that's<00:00:53.840> correct

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
functions is that right that's correct

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.800 
functions is that right that's correct
you'd<00:00:54.560> have<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:54.800> buy<00:00:54.980> each<00:00:55.280> separate<00:00:56.270> light<00:00:56.480> to

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
you'd have to buy each separate light to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.720 
you'd have to buy each separate light to
get<00:00:56.990> those<00:00:57.230> different<00:00:57.650> functions<00:00:58.130> what<00:00:58.550> we've

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
get those different functions what we've

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.820 
get those different functions what we've
done<00:00:58.940> is<00:00:59.120> combined<00:00:59.660> the<00:01:00.410> three<00:01:00.680> different

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
done is combined the three different

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.160 
done is combined the three different
lights<00:01:01.220> into<00:01:01.610> one<00:01:01.790> light<00:01:02.030> okay<00:01:02.630> so<00:01:02.690> let<00:01:02.960> me<00:01:02.990> get

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
lights into one light okay so let me get

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.160 
lights into one light okay so let me get
this<00:01:03.200> straight<00:01:03.850> it<00:01:04.850> has<00:01:05.089> water<00:01:05.360> activation

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
this straight it has water activation

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.590 
this straight it has water activation
right<00:01:06.530> correct<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:07.310> has<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.600> manually

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
right correct it has a manually

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.660 
right correct it has a manually
activated<00:01:09.020> strobe<00:01:09.410> that's<00:01:09.860> correct<00:01:10.160> and<00:01:10.490> it

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
activated strobe that's correct and it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.240 
activated strobe that's correct and it
has<00:01:10.910> a<00:01:10.940> manually<00:01:11.720> activated<00:01:12.250> long-term

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
has a manually activated long-term

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.610 
has a manually activated long-term
steady<00:01:13.850> light<00:01:14.120> that's<00:01:14.510> correct<00:01:14.870> that's<00:01:15.320> the

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
steady light that's correct that's the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.920 
steady light that's correct that's the
uniqueness<00:01:16.010> of<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.520> light<00:01:16.730> it's<00:01:17.300> all<00:01:17.540> three

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
uniqueness of the light it's all three

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.990 
uniqueness of the light it's all three
built<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.500> one<00:01:18.680> one<00:01:19.340> of<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.580> things<00:01:19.820> that

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
built in the one one of the things that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.520 
built in the one one of the things that
the<00:01:20.090> search-and-rescue<00:01:20.390> professional<00:01:21.290> sell

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
the search-and-rescue professional sell

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.899 
the search-and-rescue professional sell
us<00:01:21.680> is<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:21.980> they<00:01:22.100> want<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.400> have<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.520> strobe

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
us is that they want to have a strobe

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.510 
us is that they want to have a strobe
light<00:01:22.940> for<00:01:23.420> long-range<00:01:23.800> detection<00:01:24.800> but<00:01:25.220> for

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
light for long-range detection but for

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.160 
light for long-range detection but for
short<00:01:25.790> ranges<00:01:26.210> especially<00:01:26.810> if<00:01:26.900> you're<00:01:27.020> in<00:01:27.110> a

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
short ranges especially if you're in a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.690 
short ranges especially if you're in a
helicopter<00:01:27.530> they<00:01:27.830> want<00:01:28.010> a<00:01:28.100> steady<00:01:28.370> light

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
helicopter they want a steady light

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.920 
helicopter they want a steady light
because<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.270> strobe<00:01:29.540> lights<00:01:29.720> too

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
because the strobe lights too

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.110 
because the strobe lights too
distracting<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.130> light<00:01:31.370> accomplishes

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
distracting so this light accomplishes

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.850 
distracting so this light accomplishes
both<00:01:32.330> of<00:01:32.510> those<00:01:32.659> functions<00:01:33.020> that's<00:01:33.320> correct

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
both of those functions that's correct

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.770 
both of those functions that's correct
do<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:34.580> think<00:01:34.729> about<00:01:34.909> it<00:01:35.060> too<00:01:35.210> Chuck<00:01:35.479> I<00:01:35.510> meant

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
do you think about it too Chuck I meant

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.170 
do you think about it too Chuck I meant
to<00:01:35.930> show<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.260> we<00:01:36.890> put<00:01:37.130> rubber<00:01:37.340> straps<00:01:37.820> on<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
to show you we put rubber straps on the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.690 
to show you we put rubber straps on the
side<00:01:38.420> some<00:01:39.170> of<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.320> lights<00:01:39.650> out<00:01:39.920> there<00:01:40.190> don't

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
side some of the lights out there don't

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.430 
side some of the lights out there don't
have<00:01:40.909> anything<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.510> if<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:41.659> had<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.840> big<00:01:42.110> thick

have anything and if you had a big thick

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.800 
have anything and if you had a big thick
glove<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:43.310> would<00:01:43.490> happen<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.030> be<00:01:44.270> easier<00:01:44.659> to

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
glove it would happen it be easier to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.899 
glove it would happen it be easier to
slip<00:01:45.049> out<00:01:45.290> Scott<00:01:46.100> how<00:01:46.280> long<00:01:46.310> do<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.700> batteries

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
slip out Scott how long do the batteries

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.300 
slip out Scott how long do the batteries
last<00:01:47.330> on<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:47.630> new<00:01:47.750> store<00:01:48.049> of<00:01:48.140> light<00:01:48.290> it<00:01:49.100> runs

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
last on the new store of light it runs

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.090 
last on the new store of light it runs
about<00:01:49.460> 27<00:01:50.240> hours<00:01:50.360> so<00:01:51.110> it's<00:01:51.260> about<00:01:51.440> five<00:01:51.710> times

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
about 27 hours so it's about five times

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.250 
about 27 hours so it's about five times
the<00:01:52.430> average<00:01:52.850> light<00:01:53.120> on<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.390> market<00:01:53.750> today<00:01:53.870> so

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
the average light on the market today so

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.200 
the average light on the market today so
it's<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.680> really<00:01:54.920> good<00:01:55.280> life<00:01:55.490> now<00:01:55.909> does<00:01:56.060> this

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
it's a really good life now does this

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.850 
it's a really good life now does this
use<00:01:56.390> some<00:01:56.630> custom<00:01:57.110> battery<00:01:57.440> that's<00:01:57.620> very

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
use some custom battery that's very

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.859 
use some custom battery that's very
expensive<00:01:58.400> to<00:01:58.520> replace<00:01:58.760> you<00:01:59.360> could<00:01:59.510> use<00:01:59.690> your

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
expensive to replace you could use your

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.719 
expensive to replace you could use your
standard<00:02:00.110> double-a<00:02:00.770> batteries<00:02:01.310> or<00:02:01.670> the

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
standard double-a batteries or the

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.000 
standard double-a batteries or the
lithium<00:02:02.390> battery

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
lithium battery

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.220 
lithium battery
so<00:02:03.160> both<00:02:03.760> batteries<00:02:04.300> work<00:02:04.480> fine<00:02:04.780> but<00:02:05.080> the

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
so both batteries work fine but the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.890 
so both batteries work fine but the
great<00:02:05.440> thing<00:02:05.470> about<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:06.130> it's<00:02:06.490> led<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.600> new

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
great thing about it it's led the new

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.740 
great thing about it it's led the new
technology<00:02:08.740> so<00:02:09.369> it's<00:02:09.550> got<00:02:09.700> longevity<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.630> the

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
technology so it's got longevity to the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.480 
technology so it's got longevity to the
lights<00:02:10.960> you<00:02:11.620> know<00:02:11.740> one<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.130> things<00:02:12.310> that's

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
lights you know one of the things that's

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.550 
lights you know one of the things that's
really<00:02:12.550> impressive<00:02:13.240> is<00:02:13.390> LEDs<00:02:14.110> used<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.470> be

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
really impressive is LEDs used to be

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.500 
really impressive is LEDs used to be
these<00:02:14.680> little<00:02:14.740> feeble<00:02:15.220> things<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.970> wouldn't

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
these little feeble things that wouldn't

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.150 
these little feeble things that wouldn't
light<00:02:16.630> up<00:02:16.780> anything<00:02:17.020> take<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.680> look<00:02:17.920> at<00:02:18.040> how

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
light up anything take a look at how

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.490 
light up anything take a look at how
bright<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.240> really<00:02:19.540> amazing<00:02:20.380> and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
bright this is it is really amazing and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.440 
bright this is it is really amazing and
one<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.220> tricks<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.640> they<00:02:21.850> use<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.270> they

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
one of the tricks that they use is they

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.960 
one of the tricks that they use is they
leave<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.960> LED<00:02:23.380> on<00:02:23.620> for<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.010> longer<00:02:24.460> period<00:02:24.520> of

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
leave the LED on for a longer period of

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.420 
leave the LED on for a longer period of
time<00:02:25.240> so<00:02:25.540> your<00:02:25.990> eye<00:02:26.020> actually<00:02:26.680> sees<00:02:26.950> more

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
time so your eye actually sees more

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.670 
time so your eye actually sees more
light<00:02:27.790> really<00:02:28.750> an<00:02:28.870> impressive<00:02:29.110> technology

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
light really an impressive technology

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.850 
light really an impressive technology
