we're<00:02:33.389> talking<00:02:33.870> Norway<00:02:35.329> but<00:02:36.329> I<00:02:36.659> think<00:02:37.319> what

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
we're talking Norway but I think what

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.530 
we're talking Norway but I think what
happens<00:02:37.829> is<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.159> fish<00:02:38.370> come<00:02:38.670> all<00:02:38.909> rushing<00:02:39.420> to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
happens is the fish come all rushing to

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.069 
happens is the fish come all rushing to
the<00:02:39.659> shore<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:41.060> they<00:02:42.060> died<00:02:42.359> and<00:02:42.780> then<00:02:42.959> of

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
the shore and they died and then of

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.520 
the shore and they died and then of
course<00:02:43.109> and<00:02:43.590> we're<00:02:43.920> frozen<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:45.239> don't<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.439> know

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
course and we're frozen I don't you know

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.409 
course and we're frozen I don't you know
anyway<00:02:47.220> here's<00:02:47.430> what<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.760> let's<00:02:48.209> see<00:02:48.299> what

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.000 
anyway here's what the let's see what
the<00:02:48.510> scientists<00:02:49.049> think<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.409> mean<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.590> can<00:02:49.859> tell

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
the scientists think I mean I can tell

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.470 
the scientists think I mean I can tell
you<00:02:50.099> from<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.340> biblical<00:02:50.549> standpoint<00:02:51.000> I'd<00:02:51.329> go

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
you from a biblical standpoint I'd go

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.199 
you from a biblical standpoint I'd go

in the sea will die we're not there yet

but<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:21.720> apocalyptic<00:03:22.530> plagues<00:03:23.129> are

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
but the apocalyptic plagues are

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.960 
but the apocalyptic plagues are
definitely<00:03:24.209> taking<00:03:24.419> place<00:03:24.930> around<00:03:25.639> the<00:03:26.639> globe

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
definitely taking place around the globe

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.360 
definitely taking place around the globe
and<00:03:27.239> they<00:03:27.569> were<00:03:27.840> prophesied<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.979> the<00:03:29.220> Bible
