well we get the thermal take chaser mk1

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.839 
well we get the thermal take chaser mk1
which<00:00:27.630> you'll<00:00:27.840> see<00:00:28.019> right<00:00:28.170> over<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.849> which

which you'll see right over here which
is<00:00:30.000> what<00:00:30.150> my<00:00:30.300> computer<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:30.869> set<00:00:31.140> up<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.489> that's

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
is what my computer was set up in that's

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.260 
is what my computer was set up in that's
gonna<00:00:32.640> be<00:00:32.899> being<00:00:33.899> modded<00:00:34.440> very<00:00:34.739> shortly<00:00:35.270> so

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
gonna be being modded very shortly so

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.389 
gonna be being modded very shortly so
for<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.540> interim<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.730> needed<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.820> find<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.149> case

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
for the interim I needed to find a case

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:50.200 
for the interim I needed to find a case
that<00:00:41.399> could<00:00:41.879> house<00:00:43.640> all<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:45.000> my<00:00:45.180> hardware

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
we just set up the liquid cooling loop

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.619 
we just set up the liquid cooling loop
here<00:00:53.850> time<00:00:54.149> running<00:00:54.450> for<00:00:54.600> about<00:00:54.750> an<00:00:54.870> hour

down<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.610> loop<00:01:54.850> is<00:01:55.060> simply<00:01:55.840> distilled<00:01:56.380> water

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
down the loop is simply distilled water

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.970 
down the loop is simply distilled water
there<00:01:57.700> will<00:01:57.790> be<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.910> silver<00:01:58.330> coil<00:01:58.780> in<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.800> help

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
there will be a silver coil in to help

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
color to get a little bit darker than it

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.580 
color to get a little bit darker than it
is<00:02:16.030> now

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
is now

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.600
