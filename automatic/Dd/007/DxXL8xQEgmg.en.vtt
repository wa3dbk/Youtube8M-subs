okay<00:00:02.520> so<00:00:02.580> when<00:00:02.969> do<00:00:03.179> we<00:00:03.239> not<00:00:03.659> perform<00:00:04.470> a

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
okay so when do we not perform a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.640 
okay so when do we not perform a
procedure<00:00:04.770> turn<00:00:05.660> well<00:00:06.660> this<00:00:07.230> section<00:00:07.560> is

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:07.650 
procedure turn well this section is

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.799 
procedure turn well this section is
pretty<00:00:08.040> well<00:00:08.160> described<00:00:08.519> in<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.700> aim<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.240> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
pretty well described in the aim of the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.220 
pretty well described in the aim of the
Federal<00:00:10.289> Aviation<00:00:10.410> Regulations<00:00:10.919> and<00:00:12.230> there

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
Federal Aviation Regulations and there

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.959 
Federal Aviation Regulations and there
is<00:00:13.379> really<00:00:13.619> no<00:00:13.949> acronym<00:00:14.489> or<00:00:14.610> anything<00:00:14.759> to

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
is really no acronym or anything to

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.150 
is really no acronym or anything to
describe<00:00:15.329> it<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.690> let's<00:00:15.900> try<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.560> put<00:00:17.039> an

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
describe it so let's try to put an

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.580 
describe it so let's try to put an
acronym<00:00:17.790> first<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.870> see<00:00:19.020> if<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.260> remember

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
acronym first to see if you can remember

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.800 
acronym first to see if you can remember
it<00:00:19.830> more<00:00:19.980> easily<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:21.180> acronym<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.780> sharp<00:00:22.710> TP

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
it more easily the acronym is sharp TP

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.070 
it more easily the acronym is sharp TP
the<00:00:24.810> S<00:00:25.020> stands<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:25.890> straight<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.930> you<00:00:27.930> would

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the S stands for straight in you would

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.380 
the S stands for straight in you would
not<00:00:28.350> do<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> procedure<00:00:29.070> turn<00:00:29.370> if<00:00:29.850> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
not do a procedure turn if the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.880 
not do a procedure turn if the
controller<00:00:30.780> at<00:00:30.990> some<00:00:31.200> point<00:00:31.470> said<00:00:31.710> for

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
example 757 Delta Poppa cleared straight

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.630 
example 757 Delta Poppa cleared straight
in<00:00:35.429> for<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> ILS<00:00:36.179> runway<00:00:36.600> 2<00:00:37.050> 3<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.739> general<00:00:38.399> you

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
in for the ILS runway 2 3 in general you

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.009 
in for the ILS runway 2 3 in general you
would<00:00:38.760> receive<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.179> straight<00:00:39.569> and<00:00:39.719> approach

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
would receive a straight and approach

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.829 
would receive a straight and approach
when<00:00:40.559> you're<00:00:40.859> close<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.429> 30<00:00:41.850> degrees<00:00:41.940> from<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
when you're close to 30 degrees from the

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.450 
when you're close to 30 degrees from the
final<00:00:43.109> approach<00:00:43.319> course<00:00:43.350> your<00:00:43.890> own<00:00:44.039> heading

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
final approach course your own heading

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.799 
final approach course your own heading
and<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> final<00:00:44.999> approach<00:00:45.149> course<00:00:45.210> are<00:00:45.659> within

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and the final approach course are within

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.869 
and the final approach course are within
30<00:00:46.079> degrees<00:00:46.379> that's<00:00:46.859> generally<00:00:47.550> when<00:00:47.729> you

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
30 degrees that's generally when you

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.479 
30 degrees that's generally when you
receive<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.600> straight-in<00:00:49.440> approach<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:50.370> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
receive a straight-in approach but it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.219 
receive a straight-in approach but it
could<00:00:50.640> happen<00:00:50.789> at<00:00:51.059> any<00:00:51.179> point<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:51.870> obviously

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
could happen at any point but obviously

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:53.959 
could happen at any point but obviously
you're<00:00:52.379> gonna<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.889> to<00:00:53.039> be<00:00:53.159> quite<00:00:53.460> aligned

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
you're gonna have to be quite aligned

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.509 
you're gonna have to be quite aligned
with<00:00:54.569> the<00:00:54.659> final<00:00:54.929> approach<00:00:55.079> course<00:00:55.370> you<00:00:56.370> might

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
with the final approach course you might

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.419 
with the final approach course you might
be<00:00:56.699> holding<00:00:57.179> in<00:00:57.389> lieu<00:00:57.800> sometimes<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:59.190> shown

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
be holding in lieu sometimes like shown

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.189 
be holding in lieu sometimes like shown
here<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> figure<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.569> holding

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
here in the figure you would be holding

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.250 
here in the figure you would be holding
and<00:01:01.409> once<00:01:02.159> the<00:01:02.309> controller<00:01:02.729> says<00:01:03.089> cleared<00:01:03.929> for

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and once the controller says cleared for

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.320 
and once the controller says cleared for
the<00:01:04.379> approach<00:01:04.650> your<00:01:05.129> next<00:01:05.520> leg<00:01:05.760> inbound<00:01:06.180> you

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the approach your next leg inbound you

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.580 
the approach your next leg inbound you
would<00:01:06.450> proceed<00:01:06.690> straight<00:01:07.230> in<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
would proceed straight in for the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.370 
would proceed straight in for the
approach<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.250> you're<00:01:09.120> doing<00:01:09.510> an<00:01:09.810> arc<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
approach if you're doing an arc of the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.350 
approach if you're doing an arc of the
amine<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:11.010> you're<00:01:11.190> doing<00:01:11.340> an<00:01:11.460> art<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.880> final

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
amine if you're doing an art to final

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.910 
amine if you're doing an art to final
you<00:01:12.510> would<00:01:12.630> obviously<00:01:13.050> continue<00:01:13.500> straight<00:01:13.800> in

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
you would obviously continue straight in

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.320 
you would obviously continue straight in
once<00:01:14.190> you<00:01:14.340> reach<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.700> final<00:01:14.940> approach<00:01:15.120> fix

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
once you reach the final approach fix

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.270 
once you reach the final approach fix
again<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.020> assumes<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.100> have

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
again this assumes that you have

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.010 
again this assumes that you have
received<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.060> approach<00:01:18.270> clearance<00:01:18.780> if

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
received the approach clearance if

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.580 
received the approach clearance if
you're<00:01:20.010> being<00:01:20.280> radar<00:01:21.030> vector<00:01:21.480> the<00:01:22.170> controller

you're being radar vector the controller

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.980 
you're being radar vector the controller
will<00:01:22.980> usually<00:01:23.370> vector<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.480> final

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
will usually vector you to final

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.740 
will usually vector you to final
sometimes<00:01:25.890> during<00:01:26.160> training<00:01:26.760> it<00:01:27.330> might<00:01:27.600> be

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
sometimes during training it might be

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.190 
sometimes during training it might be
beneficial<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.410> be<00:01:28.860> vectored<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.910> a<00:01:30.660> procedure

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
beneficial to be vectored to a procedure

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
beneficial to be vectored to a procedure

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
approach course if it says on it

no<00:01:58.500> PT<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.159> obviously<00:01:59.760> means<00:01:59.970> do<00:02:00.300> not<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
no PT it obviously means do not do a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.210 
no PT it obviously means do not do a
procedure<00:02:01.230> turn<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.800> would<00:02:02.010> proceed

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
procedure turn so you would proceed

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.960 
procedure turn so you would proceed
straight<00:02:02.730> in

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
straight in

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
performing a teardrop procedure is a

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.150 
performing a teardrop procedure is a
mandatory<00:02:07.390> course<00:02:07.780> reversal<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.979> is

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
mandatory course reversal and it is

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.770 
mandatory course reversal and it is
required<00:02:09.640> for<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.880> approach<00:02:10.180> and<00:02:10.510> it's

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
required for the approach and it's

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.410 
required for the approach and it's
already<00:02:11.500> if<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.740> want<00:02:12.160> kind<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.120> procedure

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
already if you want kind of a procedure

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.990 
already if you want kind of a procedure
turn<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.470> you're<00:02:14.980> already<00:02:15.100> doing<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.850> procedure

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
turn so you're already doing a procedure

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.090 
turn so you're already doing a procedure
turn<00:02:16.390> it's<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:17.080> it's<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.380> teardrop<00:02:17.740> instead

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
turn it's just it's a teardrop instead

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.400 
turn it's just it's a teardrop instead
of<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.250> normal<00:02:18.700> procedure<00:02:18.910> turn<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.630> finally

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
of a normal procedure turn and finally

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.700 
of a normal procedure turn and finally
timed<00:02:21.070> approaches<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.990> explained<00:02:23.440> later

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
timed approaches this is explained later

timed approaches this is explained later
on<00:02:24.070> when<00:02:24.400> we<00:02:24.520> explain<00:02:24.820> ATC<00:02:25.270> procedures<00:02:25.810> on<00:02:26.020> our

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
on when we explain ATC procedures on our

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.770 
on when we explain ATC procedures on our
courses<00:02:26.740> but<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.790> timed<00:02:28.030> approach<00:02:28.390> is

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
courses but the timed approach is

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.110 
courses but the timed approach is
something<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.740> would<00:02:29.920> do<00:02:30.100> what<00:02:30.610> for

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
something that you would do what for

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.990 
something that you would do what for
example<00:02:31.510> Sun<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.930> fun<00:02:32.200> or<00:02:32.550> Oshkosh<00:02:33.550> whenever

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
all of these cases you do not do a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.100 
all of these cases you do not do a
