this often prompts the UFO people to

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.850 
point out how absurd and arrogant it is
to<00:01:30.329> claim<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.530> can't

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
to claim that just because we can't

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.660 
to claim that just because we can't
solve<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.189> problem

aliens couldn't solve it either well
this<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.759> true<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.750> perfectly<00:01:37.170> valid

this is true it's a perfectly valid
argument<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.939> not<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.200> convincing

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.319 
eliminates many of the problems relating
to<00:01:55.829> life<00:01:56.460> support<00:01:56.700> time<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.840> supplies<00:01:58.380> but

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
to life support time and supplies but

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.120 
to life support time and supplies but
what's<00:02:00.329> even<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.750> million<00:02:01.200> times<00:02:01.500> easier<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
what's even a million times easier and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.920 
what's even a million times easier and
cheaper<00:02:02.159> than<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.090> send<00:02:03.509> radio

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
cheaper than that is to send radio

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.709 
cheaper than that is to send radio
signals<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:05.310> bother<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.880> travel<00:02:06.329> at<00:02:06.509> all

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
signals and not bother to travel at all

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.839 
signals and not bother to travel at all
if<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.590> aliens<00:02:07.979> chose<00:02:08.310> what<00:02:08.729> is

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
if the aliens chose what is

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.969 
if the aliens chose what is
exponentially<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.959> most<00:02:10.170> difficult<00:02:10.770> way<00:02:10.920> to

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
exponentially the most difficult way to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.979 
exponentially the most difficult way to
visit<00:02:11.340> us<00:02:11.459> would<00:02:12.090> they<00:02:12.239> really<00:02:12.480> have<00:02:12.750> used

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
visit us would they really have used

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.670 
visit us would they really have used
that<00:02:13.170> offer<00:02:13.349> too

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that offer too

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.729 
that offer too
to<00:02:14.099> do<00:02:14.250> something<00:02:14.549> so<00:02:14.909> stupid<00:02:14.969> if<00:02:15.719> they<00:02:16.349> have

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
to do something so stupid if they have

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.589 
to do something so stupid if they have
done<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.340> they<00:02:17.849> didn't<00:02:18.150> leave<00:02:18.269> us<00:02:18.299> any

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
done so they didn't leave us any

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.380 
done so they didn't leave us any
evidence<00:02:19.049> which<00:02:19.469> means<00:02:19.680> they<00:02:20.069> blew<00:02:20.340> it

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
evidence which means they blew it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.300 
evidence which means they blew it
hopefully<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.659> civilization<00:02:22.500> advanced<00:02:23.040> enough

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
to visit us is advanced enough to have

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.819 
to visit us is advanced enough to have
put<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.739> little<00:02:25.980> more<00:02:26.310> thought<00:02:26.340> into<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.409> so<00:02:28.409> are

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
put a little more thought into it so are

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.089 
put a little more thought into it so are
we<00:02:29.189> alone<00:02:29.489> almost<00:02:30.150> certainly<00:02:30.870> not<00:02:31.439> but

there's<00:02:32.609> a<00:02:32.700> good<00:02:33.000> chance<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.450> almost<00:02:33.870> all

there's a good chance that almost all
