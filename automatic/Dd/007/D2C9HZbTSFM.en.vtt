the<00:02:31.390> entire<00:02:31.870> Florida<00:02:32.320> Keys<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:33.390> I'm<00:02:34.390> not

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
the entire Florida Keys so I'm not

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.660 
the entire Florida Keys so I'm not
really<00:02:34.870> buying<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.500> as<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.620> great<00:02:35.950> driving<00:02:36.340> road

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
really buying it as a great driving road

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.400 
really buying it as a great driving road
it's<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.880> very<00:02:37.030> scenic<00:02:37.329> road<00:02:37.690> but<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.200> don't

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
it's a very scenic road but I don't

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.020 
it's a very scenic road but I don't
think<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.650> really<00:02:38.769> benefits<00:02:39.459> from<00:02:39.610> having<00:02:39.940> a

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.410 
think it really benefits from having a
fun<00:02:40.239> car

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
fun car

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.500

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
and driving a fun car in a fun road

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.210 
and driving a fun car in a fun road
you're<00:02:44.720> probably<00:02:45.020> not<00:02:45.470> gonna<00:02:45.650> be<00:02:45.800> in<00:02:45.890> sixth

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
you're probably not gonna be in sixth

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.309 
you're probably not gonna be in sixth
gear<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.610> whole<00:02:46.760> time<00:02:47.030> at<00:02:47.270> 50<00:02:47.569> miles<00:02:47.750> an<00:02:47.959> hour

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
that's essentially what the entire trip

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
each of them fifty cars means there's a

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.890 
each of them fifty cars means there's a
slow<00:03:01.459> enough<00:03:01.760> thing<00:03:02.170> so

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
slow enough thing so

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.059 
slow enough thing so
that's<00:03:05.900> what<00:03:06.080> makes<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.440> drive<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.739> little

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
that's what makes the drive a little

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.309 
that's what makes the drive a little
less<00:03:07.220> pleasant<00:03:07.790> there<00:03:08.450> isn't<00:03:08.840> much<00:03:09.049> to<00:03:09.290> look

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
less pleasant there isn't much to look

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.430 
less pleasant there isn't much to look
at<00:03:09.620> on<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.950> way<00:03:10.069> down<00:03:10.900> poor<00:03:11.900> on<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.110> way<00:03:12.260> back

for<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.799> matter<00:03:12.980> but<00:03:13.370> when<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:13.730> get<00:03:13.909> to

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
for that matter but when you get to

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.670 
for that matter but when you get to
those<00:03:14.180> overwater<00:03:14.780> areas<00:03:15.290> where<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.530> can

those overwater areas where you can

those overwater areas where you can
actually<00:03:15.920> see<00:03:16.430> like<00:03:16.670> through<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.599> water<00:03:17.870> and

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
actually see like through the water and

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.170 
actually see like through the water and
almost<00:03:18.379> the<00:03:18.680> sandbars<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.760> boats<00:03:19.970> and

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
the jet skis that's what's really nice

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.380 
the jet skis that's what's really nice
that's<00:03:22.400> what<00:03:22.459> you're<00:03:22.640> gonna<00:03:22.760> remember<00:03:23.090> from

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
that's what you're gonna remember from

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.080 
that's what you're gonna remember from
this<00:03:23.569> drive<00:03:23.870> but<00:03:24.620> definitely<00:03:25.190> nothing<00:03:25.940> that

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
this drive but definitely nothing that

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.710 
this drive but definitely nothing that
involves<00:03:26.690> having<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.170> bring<00:03:27.319> an<00:03:27.470> exotic<00:03:27.709> car

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720

involves having to bring an exotic car
now<00:03:29.720> probably<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.349> most<00:03:30.379> famous<00:03:30.739> stretch<00:03:31.220> of

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
now probably the most famous stretch of

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.100 
now probably the most famous stretch of
road<00:03:31.579> is<00:03:31.760> what<00:03:31.909> we're<00:03:32.030> coming<00:03:32.209> up<00:03:32.420> on<00:03:32.599> to<00:03:32.900> now

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
road is what we're coming up on to now

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.890 
road is what we're coming up on to now
is<00:03:33.610> seven<00:03:34.610> mile<00:03:34.819> bridge<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.599> don't<00:03:35.750> know<00:03:35.840> if

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
is seven mile bridge I don't know if

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.509 
is seven mile bridge I don't know if
it's<00:03:36.019> actually<00:03:36.410> seven<00:03:36.739> miles<00:03:36.950> long<00:03:37.099> or<00:03:37.400> not

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
it's actually seven miles long or not

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.759 
it's actually seven miles long or not
I'll<00:03:37.670> actually<00:03:38.060> tick<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.510> off<00:03:38.629> and<00:03:38.870> see<00:03:39.079> but

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
I'll actually tick it off and see but

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.920 
I'll actually tick it off and see but
that<00:03:40.220> was<00:03:40.370> made<00:03:40.819> famous<00:03:41.030> by<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.359> couple<00:03:41.840> of

that was made famous by a couple of
movies<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.410> think<00:03:42.440> fast<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:42.980> furious<00:03:43.459> shot

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
movies I think fast and furious shot

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.640 
movies I think fast and furious shot
there<00:03:43.879> once<00:03:44.150> I'm<00:03:44.750> pretty<00:03:44.989> sure<00:03:45.230> Arnold

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
there once I'm pretty sure Arnold

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.960 
there once I'm pretty sure Arnold
Schwarzenegger<00:03:46.010> definitely<00:03:46.549> shot<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.819> movie

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
Schwarzenegger definitely shot the movie

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.460 
Schwarzenegger definitely shot the movie
with<00:03:47.180> Jamie<00:03:47.450> Lee<00:03:47.599> Curtis<00:03:47.629> there<00:03:48.109> dangling

let's go experience it this is this is

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.470 
let's go experience it this is this is
essentially<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.459> one<00:03:55.609> that<00:03:55.819> you're<00:03:55.970> expected

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.480 

so<00:04:41.570> I'm<00:04:41.690> not<00:04:41.900> sold<00:04:42.230> on<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.530> drive<00:04:42.800> obviously

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
so I'm not sold on the drive obviously

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.760 
so I'm not sold on the drive obviously
it's<00:04:43.640> pretty<00:04:43.700> scenic<00:04:44.240> but<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:45.200> scenic<00:04:45.530> drive

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
it's pretty scenic but the scenic drive

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.430 
it's pretty scenic but the scenic drive
doesn't<00:04:46.070> equal<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.550> good<00:04:46.760> drive<00:04:47.110> if<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.200> look

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
doesn't equal a good drive if you look

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.350 
doesn't equal a good drive if you look
at<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.980> trip<00:04:49.340> we<00:04:49.460> took<00:04:49.490> in<00:04:49.760> to<00:04:49.880> Monument

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
at the trip we took in to Monument

at the trip we took in to Monument
Valley<00:04:50.390> Utah<00:04:51.020> a<00:04:51.170> few<00:04:51.380> years<00:04:51.590> ago<00:04:51.740> very<00:04:52.640> very

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
Valley Utah a few years ago very very

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.270 
Valley Utah a few years ago very very
scenic<00:04:53.420> but<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.200> road<00:04:54.350> surface<00:04:54.620> wasn't<00:04:55.160> very

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
scenic but the road surface wasn't very

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.670 
scenic but the road surface wasn't very
good<00:04:55.520> so<00:04:55.820> you're<00:04:55.970> sort<00:04:56.240> of<00:04:56.390> risking<00:04:57.350> your<00:04:57.500> life

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
good so you're sort of risking your life

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.860 
good so you're sort of risking your life
over<00:04:57.950> 120<00:04:58.790> miles<00:04:59.000> an<00:04:59.210> hour<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.480> that<00:04:59.540> doesn't

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
over 120 miles an hour and that doesn't

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.260 
over 120 miles an hour and that doesn't
really<00:04:59.990> make<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:00.290> great<00:05:00.500> Drive<00:05:00.800> so<00:05:01.550> anyway<00:05:02.150> if

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
really make the great Drive so anyway if

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.610 
really make the great Drive so anyway if
I<00:05:02.360> had<00:05:02.450> to<00:05:02.510> put<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.690> number<00:05:02.960> great<00:05:03.169> on<00:05:03.350> and<00:05:03.530> I'd

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
I had to put the number great on and I'd

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.080 
I had to put the number great on and I'd
probably<00:05:03.800> give<00:05:04.040> it<00:05:04.070> a<00:05:04.220> three<00:05:04.430> out<00:05:04.460> of<00:05:04.610> ten

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
probably give it a three out of ten

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.880 
probably give it a three out of ten
only<00:05:05.660> because<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.990> speed<00:05:06.260> limits<00:05:06.590> are<00:05:06.710> low

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
only because the speed limits are low

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.159 
only because the speed limits are low
it's<00:05:07.610> one<00:05:07.910> or<00:05:08.060> two<00:05:08.090> lanes<00:05:08.450> most<00:05:08.780> of<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:08.990> time

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
it's one or two lanes most of the time

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.840 
it's one or two lanes most of the time
there's<00:05:09.440> always<00:05:09.710> traffic<00:05:10.130> because<00:05:10.520> it's<00:05:10.700> not

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
there's always traffic because it's not

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.060 
there's always traffic because it's not
like<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.200> secondary<00:05:12.200> road<00:05:12.470> it's<00:05:12.650> a<00:05:12.740> primary
