 if christine michels from mountains &amp; sea 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.650
 Most hotels have nothing to do with it 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.900
 relaxed to do as a product manager 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.300

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.240
 Traveled to hypo hollywood for that 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.249
 the proximity of the green park and of course 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.890

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:34.070

 the hypo hollow lodge starting point for 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.510
 Safari adventure in the Kruger National Park 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.730

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.120
 check safety and to do so 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.550
 it is also one of our standards 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.140
 just be us to the customer 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.239
 not only feel obliged to travel 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.339
 then sell the quality 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.160
 and to offer the security 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.080
 which the customer expects from us 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.120
 straight to work for the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.310
 christine has more to come today 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.740
 hotels and lodges on your list 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.780
 the control does not start at the pool 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.820
 just have to be clean but also 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.250
 numerous safety regulations too 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.720
 Emma is one of the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.880
 managers and leads the 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.770
 exceptional guests through the facility 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.290
 even if you are different from the earlier ones 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.790
 Examinations knows the checklist will be without 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.040
 Abhanded 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.320
 Of course, ambiance and comfort are the 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.450
 facility very important cleanliness and 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.280
 hygiene fire protection and safety 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.520
 But you have to look closely 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.520
 took 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.240
 so all that gives a round picture where 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.790
 one can also say 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.700
 a hotelier takes care of his 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.130
 facilities or else it is like that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.900
 a bit a laissez faire and then 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.890
 you have to be very strict and very 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.890
 Be careful 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.420
 the marking of flight paths of 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.700
 condition of fire extinguishers and hydrants 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.770
 Brandmeldern is by christine michels 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.030
 checked and precisely logged too 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.560
 if we have some of the local ones 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.230
 Devices in Germany only 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.020
 very rarely look effective and 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.530
 Fail- safe is the fire bell on 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.530
 every case 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:46.200
 Next, the random will be the 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:47.670
 room the lodge inspected we have 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.980
 much understanding that the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.080
 usually us theirs 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.209
 want to show the very best room 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.459
 but we'll go that way too 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.110
 I just spontaneously say that 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.940
 but now that would be there in the back 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.940
 see and not always the best 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.210
 even if comfort and equipment on 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.709
 at first glance the problems persuade 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.709
 are often in the details 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.190
 Christine seems very critical but 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.180
 happy with what she sees 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.500
 of course also at 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.500
 hotel manager emma 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.740
 now 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.030
 or 2 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.310
 Of course, it's wonderful for the customers 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.259
 if you have such an open terrace 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.449
 when you're so close to the natural off 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.069
 but here we have the hotelier 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.840
 say that there are no children here 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:19.000
 should be accommodated 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.610
 there is just too open or one 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.710
 child could crawl through this 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.199
 there is still the restaurant on the 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.729
 list and here christine builds 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.729
 Michel is a stumbling block 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:43.669
 Of course I know that without us 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.050
 Health certificate not in one 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.659
 kitchen is allowed to go 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:06:09.710
 and there too, the employee has a lot 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:06:15.069
 Well reacted as a conclusion for this test 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.960
 today I would say 95 points we are 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.969
 mostly with all aspects 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.099
 satisfied except for a few small things 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:24.080
 which of course we have to mention and 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.469
 work with these partners too 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.150
 have to balustrade like for example 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:32.120
 a terrace not for children 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.800
 are suitable or we wish us 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.830
 that signage when it comes to 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.400
 Safety is also in German 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.490
 be designed 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.990
 that's not why we say it 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.710
 we would take the lodge out of the 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.029
 program 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.069
 but if we have a good one here 

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:48.050
 see cooperation with these 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:50.060
 we also know that 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.300
 our guests are well looked after 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.699
 That's what counts for the end 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.460
 guests of mountains &amp; sea should spend their holidays 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:02.289
 without ifs and buts completely carefree the 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.289
 be the most beautiful time of the year
