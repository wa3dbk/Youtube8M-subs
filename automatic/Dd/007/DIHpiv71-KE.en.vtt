00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello to you Artem in this video I 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.540
 tell you how you can use your 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.980
 On and device as usb flash drives very 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.290
 it is often necessary to transfer 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.599
 some files on the device without having 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.759
 removable disk or usb drive 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.599
 of course dressing is suitable for this 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.210
 never better 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.400
 however, there are several ways that 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.350
 have their pros and cons and so for 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.760
 first way we need iphone 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.980
 ipad and ipod touch 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.480
 not necessarily with a jailbreak on it 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.890
 need to install any file 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480
 manager from appstore 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.830
 of course call them file 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.110
 managers can be a stretch 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.809
 because without cl the break of the application is not 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.820
 give access to the file system however 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.129
 they allow you to store any type of file 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.540
 and transfer them to the device after 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.250
 installation of any such program 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.600
 It is necessary to connect the device to 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.940
 computer via cable 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.430
 go to the application section and scroll 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.469
 the very bottom there you will see the general section 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.629
 files there need to drag 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.160
 the data we need after this 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.079
 press the sync button 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.760
 and wait for the end of the process when we 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.859
 need to copy these files from 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.539
 devices we also need yusb 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.720
 cable and computer with installed 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.430
 aytyuns program most file 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.280
 managers from the appstore allow 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.270
 view standard file types 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.400
 for example you can listen 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.790
 music song view picture 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.659
 video or even open office documents 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.909
 for example in this program there is 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.380
 ability to work with archives and everything 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.650
 the data we dumped through 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.939
 the computer will be in a special folder 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.860
 The disadvantages of this method are as follows. 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.170
 First, we always need to have 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.310
 handy cable and secondly a computer with 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.630
 of items specified application 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.430
 The following method is slightly different from 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.290
 the previous one will also need it 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.479
 any device jailbreak on which 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.960
 not mandatory and you will need file 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.850
 manager 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.770
 however, not any application from the appstore 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.970
 only the one that can work with 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.369
 web interface 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.710
 to connect to folder a and device 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.140
 you must enter the ip address of the device 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.790
 online or local address which 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.159
 will be displayed in the program itself 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.649
 so you can using any browser 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.540
 drop any files on the device or 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.730
 upload them from there 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.680
 note that the computer and your 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.070
 clothes must be in one wifi 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.229
 network 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.090
 when you come to a friend and want 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.920
 sharing files with him is enough 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.070
 will connect to his home network 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.040
 open browser on any computer 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.530
 enter the address from the application and download 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.690
 necessary data file managers with 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.730
 web interface webstory quite a lot 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.800
 find them will not be difficult 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.050
 The application comes in both paid and 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.120
 free quite sane functionality 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.170
 as you can see for this method we do not 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.000
 need to use 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.290
 aytyuns we don't need a cable for 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.810
 connect to computer 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.270
 However, there is a prerequisite for Wi-Fi 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.250
 network in this way as in the previous 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.900
 we have the bonus of being able 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.200
 view all files that 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.330
 application compatibility for third 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.600
 ways we need an account in 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.370
 any cloud file storage and 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.770
 accordingly the application for it on 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.510
 your device to download any 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.970
 data on it is enough to put them in 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.680
 cloud in any way convenient for you 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.230
 for example through a computer application 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.120
 or just through the client browser 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.890
 most cloud storage applications 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.230
 also allow you to view 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.120
 the most common types of files 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.670
 you can transfer them to others 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.310
 devices send by mail as well 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.260
 saves for offline use when 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.000
 all the simplicity of this method arise 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.920
 certain difficulties if necessary 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.230
 share file with another person 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.750
 will have to either send him a link to 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.930
 downloading data from the cloud either 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.000
 send them by email 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.830
 if on your iphone ipad or ipod touch 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.660
 jailbreak installed then you 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.459
 There are additional opportunities for 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.590
 use dress as 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.670
 removable disk 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.709
 using any third-party file 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.519
 the manager is great here itunes for example 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.610
 iphone box 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.560
 oh ace or even peppy help and you can 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.630
 upload any files to any folder 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.180
 just like it happens with any 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.610
 removable storage for this method 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.230
 need a file manager on each 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.060
 from computers to the one from which we 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.799
 We will download and on which 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.470
 subsequently have to upload data 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.299
 You will also need a cable on the device. 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.170
 quick apple file must be installed 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.540
 can do it 2 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.180
 the disadvantages of the method should be attributed 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.560
 the difficulty of viewing data at the very 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.299
 dress for this for you 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.609
 on woo file manager ai file 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.650
 to simplify access to the device and 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.980
 get rid of the need to wear with 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.840
 by myself 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.850
 cable can use 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.070
 wirelessly for this on 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.930
 computer must be set to any 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.870
 sftp application 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.160
 connections such as cyber 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.230
 duck that we used for 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.530
 installation sitting when it was not stable 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.690
 pangu exploit and a when connected 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.260
 specify ip address of the device in the network 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.210
 we enter the login root and the password elfin after 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.160
 connections we can copy any 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.200
 data from both the device and on it 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.150
 for this method will require 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.389
 install a small supplement from sitting 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.010
 called about nss oven for the next 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.380
 ways we will also use 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.570
 jailbreak extension sitting called 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.979
 pvn tuns 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.870
 after installing this extension when 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.700
 connecting device computer he 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.919
 recognized as a regular removable disk 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.200
 you can copy any data to 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.060
 him and all the audio files that will be 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.639
 placed in a special folder will fall 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.840
 standard application music have this 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.630
 There are several significant ways 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.030
 cons first is the price of expansion 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.410
 hacked versions of tweak no 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.539
 need to use on computer 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.910
 windows operating system only 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.130
 unfortunately gusto this extension is not 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.320
 the last method for 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.419
 owners and device with jailbreak this 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.270
 extension called hands yuizbi 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.580
 after installing tweak is necessary in its 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.680
 parameters choose which part of the memory 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.990
 devices we give away under removable 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.760
 drive it will be separated from the common 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.560
 your memory and device and 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.750
 formatted specifically to 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.810
 recognized as a flash drive for 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.310
 increase of more than 120 megabytes for 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.830
 removable disk need to buy 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.510
 write a tweak license in the comments 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.940
 which way did you like the most 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.300
 as well as other data transfer options 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.700
 on 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.750
 and device leave likes add 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.639
 videos to favorites and the same 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.440
 subscribe to the channel with you was artem 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.440
 especially for apples bye
