why in a movie called boyhood is the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.830 
why in a movie called boyhood is the

interesting<00:01:05.250> question<00:01:05.700> indeed<00:01:06.140> perhaps<00:01:07.140> it's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
interesting question indeed perhaps it's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.469 
interesting question indeed perhaps it's
the<00:01:07.500> lack<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.680> competition<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.820> category

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the lack of competition in this category

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
the lack of competition in this category
perhaps<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.439> respect<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.159> an<00:01:11.220> actress

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
perhaps it's respect for an actress

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.460 
perhaps it's respect for an actress
willing<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.060> highlight<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> aging<00:01:13.049> process

on<00:01:13.619> screen<00:01:13.979> something<00:01:14.640> most<00:01:14.970> actresses<00:01:15.360> try

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
on screen something most actresses try

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.260 
on screen something most actresses try
to<00:01:15.869> hide<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.619> perhaps<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.610> Academy<00:01:18.060> just

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
to hide and perhaps the Academy just

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.969 
to hide and perhaps the Academy just
wants<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.720> something<00:01:19.049> nice<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.229> an<00:01:19.590> R<00:01:19.740> ket
