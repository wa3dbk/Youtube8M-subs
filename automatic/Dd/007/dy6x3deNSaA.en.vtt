00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
started as this piece of lexan which is

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.090 
started as this piece of lexan which is
pretty<00:01:06.119> amazing<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:07.049> able<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.290> get<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
pretty amazing to be able to get the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.300 
pretty amazing to be able to get the
look<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.610> one-to-one<00:01:09.200> 911<00:01:10.200> down<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.010> once

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
look of that one-to-one 911 down to once

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.510 
look of that one-to-one 911 down to once
110<00:01:12.090> scale<00:01:12.360> model<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.159> we<00:01:14.159> were<00:01:14.310> talking

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
110 scale model and we were talking

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.300 
110 scale model and we were talking
earlier<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.450> simply<00:01:16.189> reducing<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
earlier it's not simply reducing the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.310 
earlier it's not simply reducing the
numbers<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> 110<00:01:19.110> scale

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
numbers so that you can get a 110 scale

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.130 
numbers so that you can get a 110 scale
so<00:01:19.500> tell<00:01:20.100> me<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> little<00:01:20.430> bit<00:01:20.549> Scott<00:01:20.850> how<00:01:21.140> you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
so tell me a little bit Scott how you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.870 
so tell me a little bit Scott how you
get<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:23.130> piece<00:01:23.720> to<00:01:24.720> look<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> 911<00:01:25.729> okay

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
get this piece to look like a 911 okay

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.600 
get this piece to look like a 911 okay
well<00:01:27.210> basically<00:01:27.390> first<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.310> scale<00:01:29.310> down<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
well basically first we scale down the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.770 
well basically first we scale down the
original<00:01:30.509> car<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.770> 10<00:01:32.189> scale<00:01:32.520> drawing<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
original car to a 10 scale drawing and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.990 
original car to a 10 scale drawing and
then<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.650> kind<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.130> superimpose<00:01:35.850> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
then from there kind of superimpose it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
then from there kind of superimpose it
on<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.329> chassis<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.079> what<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.290> would<00:01:37.380> would

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
on a chassis to see what it would would

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.560 
on a chassis to see what it would would
look<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> then<00:01:38.939> from<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.450> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
look like and then from there we have to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.810 
look like and then from there we have to
tweak<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.320> actually<00:01:40.979> fit<00:01:41.220> our<00:01:41.340> chassis

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
tweak it to actually fit our chassis

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.819 
tweak it to actually fit our chassis
lengthwise<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.780> widthwise<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.619> there's<00:01:43.770> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
lengthwise and widthwise so there's a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.819 
lengthwise and widthwise so there's a
little<00:01:44.070> bit<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> taking<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:46.110> original<00:01:46.350> car

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
little bit of a taking the original car

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.469 
little bit of a taking the original car
and<00:01:47.070> massaging<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.939> fit<00:01:48.119> our<00:01:48.240> chassis

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and massaging it to fit our chassis

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.590 
and massaging it to fit our chassis
keeping<00:01:49.380> all<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.590> characteristics<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:51.570> that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
keeping all the characteristics so that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.170 
keeping all the characteristics so that
it<00:01:51.840> looks<00:01:52.079> exactly<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.740> 911<00:01:53.130> gt3<00:01:53.970> even

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it looks exactly like a 911 gt3 even

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.389 
it looks exactly like a 911 gt3 even
though<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.630> bit<00:01:54.810> marked<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.590> little

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
though it's a little bit marked a little

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.760 
though it's a little bit marked a little
bit<00:01:56.520> more<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.630> most<00:01:57.869> people<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.290> look<00:01:58.530> at

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
bit more but to most people that look at

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
bit more but to most people that look at

one side first

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.949 
one side first
and<00:02:34.560> then<00:02:35.280> getting<00:02:35.519> that<00:02:35.610> look<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.569> know<00:02:36.660> just

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
copying it over for the body and then

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.850 
copying it over for the body and then
the<00:02:42.360> separate<00:02:42.690> pieces<00:02:42.870> are<00:02:43.170> basically<00:02:43.590> made

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
the separate pieces are basically made

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.059 
the separate pieces are basically made
from<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.760> inside<00:02:45.299> so<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.709> get<00:02:46.860> like

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
from the inside so that we can get like

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.270 
from the inside so that we can get like
a<00:02:47.130> like<00:02:47.730> almost<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.150> female<00:02:48.599> mold<00:02:48.870> out<00:02:49.049> of<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.349> so

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
a like almost a female mold out of it so

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.190 
a like almost a female mold out of it so

that you're going to fry a ESC batteries
I'm<00:05:07.900> not<00:05:08.080> sure<00:05:08.260> which<00:05:08.530> battery<00:05:09.070> it<00:05:09.160> comes<00:05:09.400> with

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
but the batteries that you can get can

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.820 
but the batteries that you can get can
be<00:05:11.650> upgraded<00:05:11.890> so<00:05:12.760> much<00:05:13.690> like<00:05:13.930> a<00:05:13.960> real<00:05:14.320> Cup<00:05:14.590> car

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830

if you want to spend more money on a

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.020 
if you want to spend more money on a
bigger<00:05:17.230> battery<00:05:17.470> stronger<00:05:18.250> battery<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:18.850> can

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
bigger battery stronger battery it can

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.090 
bigger battery stronger battery it can
go<00:05:19.150> faster<00:05:19.600> this<00:05:20.260> car<00:05:20.500> out<00:05:20.680> of<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:20.890> box

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
go faster this car out of the box

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.969 
go faster this car out of the box
probably<00:05:21.400> does<00:05:21.610> about<00:05:21.730> 22<00:05:22.240> miles<00:05:22.479> an<00:05:22.630> hour<00:05:22.979> you

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
probably does about 22 miles an hour you

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.219 
probably does about 22 miles an hour you
can<00:05:24.220> upgrade<00:05:24.490> the<00:05:25.060> batteries<00:05:25.750> you<00:05:26.200> can

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
can upgrade the batteries you can

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.730 
can upgrade the batteries you can
upgrade<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:27.130> motors<00:05:27.610> and<00:05:27.910> it<00:05:28.510> will<00:05:28.630> run<00:05:28.870> as

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
upgrade the motors and it will run as
