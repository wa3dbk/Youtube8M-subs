were a little more efficient because

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.719 
were a little more efficient because
they<00:01:03.170> didn't<00:01:03.379> eat<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.649> big<00:01:03.829> squash<00:01:04.100> bugs<00:01:04.429> yeah

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
and with the bug light I know in the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.640 
and with the bug light I know in the
past<00:02:29.030> I've<00:02:29.330> seen<00:02:29.600> that<00:02:29.870> they've<00:02:30.080> killed<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.500> lot

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
of elm leaf beetle at night and the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.760 
of elm leaf beetle at night and the
chickens<00:02:32.810> just<00:02:32.840> love<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.230> come<00:02:33.260> eat<00:02:33.560> those

chickens just love to come eat those
beetles<00:02:34.190> they<00:02:34.460> do<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.030> toads<00:02:35.330> come<00:02:36.020> out

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
beetles they do and the toads come out

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.570 
beetles they do and the toads come out
at<00:02:36.290> night<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.500> come<00:02:36.800> out<00:02:36.950> here<00:02:36.980> at<00:02:37.250> night<00:02:37.280> when

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
at night I come out here at night when

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.860 
at night I come out here at night when
they're<00:02:37.730> on<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.180> toads<00:02:38.420> nowhere<00:02:38.840> that

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
they're on and the toads nowhere that

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.080 
they're on and the toads nowhere that
seem<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.980> know<00:02:40.130> where<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.400> bug<00:02:40.580> lights<00:02:40.850> are

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
seem to know where the bug lights are

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.640 
seem to know where the bug lights are
because<00:02:41.450> when<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.750> bugs<00:02:41.990> fall<00:02:42.260> if<00:02:42.470> they're

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
because when the bugs fall if they're

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.370 
because when the bugs fall if they're
partially<00:02:43.340> paralyzed<00:02:44.060> or<00:02:44.360> whatever<00:02:45.170> they

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
partially paralyzed or whatever they

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.530 
partially paralyzed or whatever they
scoop<00:02:46.160> them<00:02:46.370> up<00:02:46.430> pretty<00:02:46.640> quick<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.180> your

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
scoop them up pretty quick so your

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.850 
scoop them up pretty quick so your
integrated<00:02:47.900> pest<00:02:48.020> management<00:02:48.110> actually<00:02:48.740> is<00:02:48.830> a

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
integrated pest management actually is a

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.680 
integrated pest management actually is a
little<00:02:48.950> bit<00:02:49.070> of<00:02:49.190> integrated<00:02:49.700> farming<00:02:49.910> the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
little bit of integrated farming the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.750 
little bit of integrated farming the
animals<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.530> plants<00:02:51.800> together<00:02:52.220> for<00:02:52.730> a

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
animals and the plants together for a

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.270 
animals and the plants together for a
synergistic<00:02:53.420> effect<00:02:53.720> that's<00:02:54.110> right<00:02:54.440> yeah<00:02:55.010> it

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
synergistic effect that's right yeah it

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.550 
synergistic effect that's right yeah it
works<00:02:55.820> for<00:02:56.000> me<00:02:56.060> now<00:02:56.750> do<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.020> years<00:02:57.290> where

overwhelmed yeah if you have an
infestation<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.220> can't<00:03:04.760> be<00:03:04.820> controlled

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
infestation and it can't be controlled

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.360 
infestation and it can't be controlled
same<00:03:06.020> way<00:03:06.170> like<00:03:06.410> with<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.620> fit<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.040> if<00:03:07.130> you<00:03:07.220> got

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
same way like with a fit is if you got

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.440 
same way like with a fit is if you got
the<00:03:08.500> ladybugs<00:03:09.500> there<00:03:09.850> they'll<00:03:10.850> control<00:03:11.300> them

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
the ladybugs there they'll control them

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.720 
the ladybugs there they'll control them
to<00:03:11.540> an<00:03:11.630> extent<00:03:12.050> but<00:03:12.200> if<00:03:12.350> it's<00:03:12.530> an<00:03:12.740> epidemic<00:03:13.190> why

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.100 
say you gotta weigh the good in the bad
and<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.120> got<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.390> give<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.540> little<00:03:26.720> take<00:03:27.080> a

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
and you got to give a little take a

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.460 
and you got to give a little take a
little

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
little

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.390 
little
and<00:03:27.590> that's<00:03:27.739> why<00:03:27.860> some<00:03:28.070> people<00:03:28.160> have<00:03:28.370> a

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
and that's why some people have a

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.040 
and that's why some people have a
problem<00:03:28.550> with<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.850> bug<00:03:28.970> lights<00:03:29.239> because<00:03:29.840> it's

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
problem with the bug lights because it's

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.140 
problem with the bug lights because it's
also<00:03:30.230> indiscriminate<00:03:31.070> right<00:03:31.550> they'll<00:03:31.820> kill

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
also indiscriminate right they'll kill

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.580 
also indiscriminate right they'll kill
whatever<00:03:32.600> comes<00:03:32.870> by<00:03:33.080> there<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.440> lace

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
whatever comes by there and the lace

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.110 
whatever comes by there and the lace
wings<00:03:33.830> are<00:03:34.040> one<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.280> our<00:03:34.370> beneficials<00:03:34.940> which

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
wings are one of our beneficials which

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.759 
wings are one of our beneficials which
are<00:03:35.239> very<00:03:35.390> much<00:03:35.540> attracted<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.410> bug<00:03:36.560> light

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
are very much attracted to the bug light

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.560 
are very much attracted to the bug light
so<00:03:36.920> people<00:03:37.160> need<00:03:37.280> to<00:03:37.310> be<00:03:37.400> aware<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.880> there

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
so people need to be aware that there

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.670 
so people need to be aware that there
are<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:39.050> positive<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.620> negative

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
are the positive and the negative

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.280 
are the positive and the negative
aspects<00:03:40.430> here<00:03:40.700> that's<00:03:41.510> very<00:03:41.750> true<00:03:41.989> but<00:03:42.019> I've

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
aspects here that's very true but I've

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.890 
aspects here that's very true but I've
never<00:03:42.530> seen<00:03:42.800> a<00:03:42.830> praying<00:03:43.160> mantis<00:03:43.489> or<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:43.910> ladybug

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
probably in a lot of situations even

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
probably in a lot of situations even
though<00:03:56.959> it<00:03:57.050> kills<00:03:57.200> some<00:03:57.410> of<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.530> good<00:03:57.590> guys

your plant Disease Control

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.539 
your plant Disease Control
well<00:04:08.300> I<00:04:08.920> yeah<00:04:10.600> especially<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:12.549> plant

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
well I yeah especially the plant

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.130 
well I yeah especially the plant
diseases<00:04:13.910> that<00:04:14.090> are<00:04:14.239> carried<00:04:14.510> by<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.660> insects

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
diseases that are carried by the insects

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.259 
diseases that are carried by the insects
definitely<00:04:16.130> control<00:04:16.459> there<00:04:16.700> but<00:04:17.120> they

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
definitely control there but they

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.420 
definitely control there but they
airborne<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.930> know<00:04:18.049> on<00:04:18.260> soil<00:04:18.769> borne<00:04:19.010> spores

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
airborne you know on soil borne spores

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.909 
airborne you know on soil borne spores
why<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:20.060> doubt<00:04:20.690> if<00:04:20.810> it<00:04:20.930> does<00:04:21.080> much<00:04:21.320> for<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.650> but

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
why I doubt if it does much for that but

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.800 
why I doubt if it does much for that but
any<00:04:22.430> any<00:04:22.789> little<00:04:23.150> bit<00:04:23.270> helps

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
any any little bit helps

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.450 
any any little bit helps
we<00:04:24.110> like<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.289> consider<00:04:24.620> that<00:04:24.830> an<00:04:24.950> integrated

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
we like to consider that an integrated

we like to consider that an integrated
pest<00:04:25.820> man

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
pest man

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.010
