quite<00:00:25.029> amazing<00:00:25.929> the<00:00:26.740> fact<00:00:26.949> is<00:00:27.160> that<00:00:27.220> it<00:00:27.519> is

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
quite amazing the fact is that it is

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.320 
quite amazing the fact is that it is
different<00:00:28.179> to<00:00:28.839> the<00:00:29.369> speed<00:00:30.369> and<00:00:30.640> but<00:00:31.000> you<00:00:31.150> need

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
different to the speed and but you need

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.030 
different to the speed and but you need
to<00:00:31.480> drive<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.810> car<00:00:31.990> really<00:00:32.230> fast<00:00:32.320> to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
to drive the car really fast to

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.260 
to drive the car really fast to
understand<00:00:33.490> these<00:00:33.580> improvements<00:00:34.000> and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
understand these improvements and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.880
