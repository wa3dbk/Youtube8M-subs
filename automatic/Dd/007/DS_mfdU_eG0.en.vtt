moves basically I I switched it up on my
second<00:00:35.520> ride<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> little<00:00:35.940> bit<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.270> try<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
second ride a little bit to try the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.720 
second ride a little bit to try the
screw<00:00:36.960> around<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.230> his<00:00:37.469> four<00:00:37.710> pastor<00:00:38.219> pass

that<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.280> basically<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.420> lots<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.290> tricky

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that but basically it's a lots of tricky

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.090 
that but basically it's a lots of tricky
we<00:00:43.680> lost<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> car<00:00:44.250> wheels<00:00:44.600> just<00:00:45.600> lots<00:00:45.870> of

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
we lost the car wheels just lots of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.410 
we lost the car wheels just lots of
generally<00:00:47.100> easy<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.579> high<00:00:47.700> scoring<00:00:48.030> moves<00:00:48.180> to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
generally easy but high scoring moves to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.000 
generally easy but high scoring moves to
really<00:00:48.600> keep<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.170> simple<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.829> get<00:00:49.950> him

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
really keep it simple and I can get him

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.430 
really keep it simple and I can get him
over<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> every<00:00:50.430> time<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.270> at<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> end<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
over to every time and at the end of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.410 
over to every time and at the end of
your<00:00:52.590> second<00:00:53.219> ride<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.610> had<00:00:53.760> quite<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> long

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
your second ride you had quite a long

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.600 
your second ride you had quite a long
mystery<00:00:55.410> move<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.710> was<00:00:55.920> almost<00:00:56.129> thinking<00:00:56.309> he's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
mystery move I was almost thinking he's

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760 
mystery move I was almost thinking he's
getting<00:00:56.910> out<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.149> breath<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.379> what<00:00:58.559> were<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
getting out of breath so what were you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.020 
getting out of breath so what were you
thinking<00:00:59.100> they're<00:00:59.250> underwater<00:00:59.640> yeah

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
thinking they're underwater yeah

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.209 
thinking they're underwater yeah
basically<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.960> hard<00:01:01.440> part<00:01:01.649> about<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.980> place

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
basically a hard part about this place

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.860 
basically a hard part about this place
is<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> water<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:03.690> there's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
is that you get on the water but there's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.420 
is that you get on the water but there's
no<00:01:03.989> curves<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.500> keep<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> there<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.129> get<00:01:05.280> there

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
no curves to keep you there to get there

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.609 
no curves to keep you there to get there
like<00:01:05.549> really<00:01:05.760> muscle<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> down<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:06.990> so

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
like really muscle of down and now so

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.840 
like really muscle of down and now so
that's<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> hard<00:01:08.040> part<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.340> using<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> lot<00:01:08.820> of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that's the hard part is using a lot of

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.130 
that's the hard part is using a lot of
energy<00:01:09.030> while<00:01:09.330> holding<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.630> breath<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.110> I

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
energy while holding your breath but I

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.719 
energy while holding your breath but I
thought<00:01:10.710> great<00:01:10.770> i'll<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.220> how<00:01:11.340> long<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.640> was

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
thought great i'll know how long it was

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
thought great i'll know how long it was
but<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.119> pretty<00:01:12.210> fired<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.979> ran<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
but I was pretty fired up and ran out of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.499 
but I was pretty fired up and ran out of
breath<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> little<00:01:14.460> bit<00:01:14.760> from<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.030> entire

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
breath a little bit from the entire

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.880 
breath a little bit from the entire
routine<00:01:15.869> but<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.200> still<00:01:16.350> felt<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.710> good

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
routine but it's still felt really good

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.530 
routine but it's still felt really good
and<00:01:17.580> well<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> semi<00:01:18.810> some<00:01:19.140> Saturday<00:01:19.830> um

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
and well the semi some Saturday um

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
and well the semi some Saturday um
anything<00:01:21.540> else<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.960> us<00:01:22.170> which<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.799> will<00:01:22.920> show

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
anything else for us which you will show

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.710 
anything else for us which you will show
or<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.580> will<00:01:23.729> stick<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.119> same<00:01:24.299> routine

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
or you will stick to the same routine

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.749 
or you will stick to the same routine
I'll<00:01:25.320> probably<00:01:25.680> stick<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> similar<00:01:26.490> stuff

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
I'll probably stick to the similar stuff

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.460 
I'll probably stick to the similar stuff
it<00:01:26.909> seemed<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> work<00:01:27.180> pretty<00:01:27.330> well<00:01:27.570> maybe<00:01:28.290> I'll

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
it seemed to work pretty well maybe I'll

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.710 
it seemed to work pretty well maybe I'll
step<00:01:28.950> things<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.400> final<00:01:29.640> say<00:01:29.850> hey<00:01:30.509> I'm<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
step things up and final say hey I'm a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.149 
step things up and final say hey I'm a
