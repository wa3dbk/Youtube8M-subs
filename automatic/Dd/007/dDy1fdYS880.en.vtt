are we gonna show you guys difference we
Sumbul<00:00:11.660> for<00:00:11.810> his<00:00:11.930> wired<00:00:12.170> in<00:00:12.470> phase<00:00:12.740> and<00:00:12.950> out<00:00:13.070> of

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
Sumbul for his wired in phase and out of

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.590 
Sumbul for his wired in phase and out of
phase<00:00:13.280> as<00:00:14.090> you<00:00:14.180> can<00:00:14.330> see<00:00:14.830> the<00:00:16.450> terminals<00:00:17.450> are

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
phase as you can see the terminals are

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.929 
phase as you can see the terminals are
wired<00:00:17.810> in<00:00:18.110> phase<00:00:18.530> in<00:00:18.830> phases<00:00:19.369> when<00:00:19.520> everything

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
wired in phase in phases when everything

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.340 
wired in phase in phases when everything
is<00:00:20.060> continuous<00:00:20.689> positive<00:00:21.200> to<00:00:21.320> positive

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
is continuous positive to positive

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.529 
is continuous positive to positive
negative<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:22.340> negative

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
negative the negative

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:31.840 
negative the negative
you

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.400 

when<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.940> happens<00:00:33.420> your<00:00:33.870> speakers<00:00:34.200> gonna

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
when that happens your speakers gonna

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.200 
when that happens your speakers gonna
move<00:00:34.620> normal<00:00:37.790> see

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.180 

normal<00:00:43.210> sort<00:00:43.570> of<00:00:43.690> I<00:00:43.840> guess

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.980 

so<00:00:48.730> off-center

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:50.990 
so off-center

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:59.590 
so off-center
you

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.020 

so<00:01:00.800> when<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.010> wire<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.190> speaker<00:01:02.640> out<00:01:02.850> of

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
so when you wire your speaker out of

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.900 
so when you wire your speaker out of
phase<00:01:03.210> there<00:01:04.080> are<00:01:04.320> certain<00:01:05.100> very<00:01:05.339> telltale

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
phase there are certain very telltale

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.230 
phase there are certain very telltale
signs<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.510> one<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.710> doesn't<00:01:07.979> move<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.910> you<00:01:09.030> look

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
signs of one it doesn't move if you look

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.880 
signs of one it doesn't move if you look
at<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> amount<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.960> output<00:01:10.140> we're<00:01:10.500> giving<00:01:10.800> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
at the amount of output we're giving it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.050 
at the amount of output we're giving it
we<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> 2500<00:01:11.940> watt<00:01:12.030> amp<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.850> turn<00:01:15.030> it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
we have a 2500 watt amp and we turn it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.500 
we have a 2500 watt amp and we turn it
all<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> way<00:01:15.420> up<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.810> see<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.500> happens

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
all the way up and see what happens

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:25.580 
all the way up and see what happens
nothing<00:01:18.830> now<00:01:19.830> for<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> sake<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:21.979> its<00:01:22.979> science

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.160 

in<00:01:26.100> phase

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.370 

out-of-phase<00:01:33.329> do<00:01:34.329> that<00:01:34.450> again<00:01:34.689> just<00:01:35.200> that

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
out-of-phase do that again just that

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:50.000 
out-of-phase do that again just that
pong<00:01:35.590> here<00:01:38.039> in<00:01:40.890> phase-out<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:41.920> faith

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.580 

hey<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.270> what<00:01:51.420> happens<00:01:51.870> when<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.410> take

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
hey so what happens when you take

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.370 
hey so what happens when you take
something<00:01:53.010> that's<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.490> phase<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.380> it's

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
something that's out of phase and it's

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.500 
something that's out of phase and it's
not<00:01:55.590> making<00:01:55.800> any<00:01:56.040> sounds<00:01:56.550> so<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> say<00:01:57.030> why<00:01:57.450> is

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
not making any sounds so you say why is

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.920 
not making any sounds so you say why is
there<00:01:57.840> no<00:01:58.020> base<00:01:58.230> turn<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:59.010> man<00:01:59.690> see<00:02:00.690> it

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
there no base turn it up man see it

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.870 
there no base turn it up man see it
moves<00:02:01.260> but<00:02:01.980> we're<00:02:02.130> feeding<00:02:02.370> it<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.670> lot<00:02:02.850> of

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
moves but we're feeding it a lot of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.160 
moves but we're feeding it a lot of
power<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:04.100> it's<00:02:05.100> moving<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.880> lot<00:02:06.120> like<00:02:06.510> it's

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
power so it's moving a lot like it's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.170 
power so it's moving a lot like it's
gonna<00:02:07.320> make<00:02:07.560> noise<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.610> gonna<00:02:08.730> have<00:02:08.940> bass

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
gonna make noise it's gonna have bass

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.420 
gonna make noise it's gonna have bass
but<00:02:10.170> if<00:02:10.260> you<00:02:10.350> keep<00:02:10.500> doing<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.980> while<00:02:11.130> it's<00:02:11.280> out

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
but if you keep doing it while it's out

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.300 
but if you keep doing it while it's out
of<00:02:11.460> phase<00:02:12.260> how<00:02:13.260> much<00:02:13.440> output<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.980> get<00:02:14.160> how

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
of phase how much output you get how

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.130 
of phase how much output you get how
much<00:02:14.460> power<00:02:14.760> you're<00:02:14.910> using<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.510> extremely

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
much power you're using is extremely

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:32.450 
much power you're using is extremely
different<00:02:17.540> we<00:02:18.540> give<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.960> minute<00:02:31.280> one<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
different we give it a minute one of the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.040 
different we give it a minute one of the
coils<00:02:32.850> went<00:02:33.150> which<00:02:33.390> allowed<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.840> one<00:02:33.960> you're

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
coils went which allowed this one you're

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.820 
coils went which allowed this one you're
gonna<00:02:34.110> move<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.560> then<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.710> just<00:02:34.950> died<00:02:35.190> oh<00:02:36.830> so

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
gonna move and then it just died oh so

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.650 
gonna move and then it just died oh so
when<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.400> wire<00:02:38.610> your<00:02:38.730> speaker<00:02:39.180> out<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.450> phase

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
when you wire your speaker out of phase

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.080 
when you wire your speaker out of phase
sometimes<00:02:40.320> just<00:02:40.680> sometimes<00:02:41.220> bad<00:02:42.060> things

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
sometimes just sometimes bad things

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.150 
sometimes just sometimes bad things
happen<00:02:42.480> when<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:43.050> try<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.230> compensate<00:02:43.680> for

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
happen when you try to compensate for

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.250 
happen when you try to compensate for
the<00:02:44.280> lack<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.460> output<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.270> make<00:02:45.930> sure<00:02:46.080> your

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
the lack of output so make sure your

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.490 
the lack of output so make sure your
speakers<00:02:46.440> are<00:02:46.800> wired<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.250> phase
