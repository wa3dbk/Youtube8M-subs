fires with smokers unburned fuel yeah
smoke<00:03:10.799> is<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.250> sign<00:03:11.549> of<00:03:11.700> wasted<00:03:12.090> fuel<00:03:12.269> you're

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
smoke is a sign of wasted fuel you're

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.119 
smoke is a sign of wasted fuel you're
exactly<00:03:12.810> right<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.379> when<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.590> heats<00:03:13.769> up<00:03:13.980> it

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
exactly right so when the heats up it

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.430 
exactly right so when the heats up it
should<00:03:14.280> be<00:03:14.340> burning<00:03:14.639> at<00:03:14.790> all<00:03:14.940> yes<00:03:15.569> yeah<00:03:16.199> so<00:03:16.379> you
