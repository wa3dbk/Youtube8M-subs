00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
it's actually really responsible

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.819 
it's actually really responsible
especially<00:03:51.650> because<00:03:52.040> women<00:03:52.970> are<00:03:53.829> primarily

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
especially because women are primarily

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.670 
especially because women are primarily
