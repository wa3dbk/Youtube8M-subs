00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
in the boss rush tower that we have been

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.719 
in the boss rush tower that we have been
doing<00:01:41.970> level<00:01:42.329> 2<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.720> world<00:01:42.930> 7<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> guess<00:01:44.610> this

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
doing level 2 of world 7 so I guess this

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.569 
doing level 2 of world 7 so I guess this
is<00:01:44.850> my<00:01:44.970> final<00:01:45.240> showdown<00:01:45.570> with<00:01:45.780> wheelie<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.579> one

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579
