00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
you're going to see in a second as a new

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
act or whatever you want to call it and

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.769 
act or whatever you want to call it and
that<00:00:29.490> entrance<00:00:29.670> by<00:00:29.939> Wade<00:00:30.119> look<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.480> opens

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that entrance by Wade look like it opens

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.630 
that entrance by Wade look like it opens
and<00:00:30.869> shuts<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.619> anyway<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.949> new<00:00:32.070> thing<00:00:32.309> is

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
and shuts but anyway the new thing is

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.630 
and shuts but anyway the new thing is
mule<00:00:33.390> kick<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.800> lets<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.100> have<00:00:35.280> three

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
mule kick and this lets you have three

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.940 
mule kick and this lets you have three
weapons<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.440> that's<00:00:37.440> pretty<00:00:37.620> cool<00:00:37.770> be

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
weapons and that's pretty cool be

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.280 
weapons and that's pretty cool be
looking<00:00:38.280> for<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.059> while<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.600> they

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
looking for that for a while and they

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.780 
looking for that for a while and they
added<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.309> three<00:00:41.579> weapons

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
added it so you can have three weapons

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.369 
added it so you can have three weapons
I'm<00:00:42.180> probably<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.899> buy<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.110> off<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
I'm probably just you buy it off the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.619 
I'm probably just you buy it off the
wall<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.890> once<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.510> have

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
wall and once you have this and you have

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.709 
wall and once you have this and you have
three<00:00:45.870> weapons<00:00:46.020> that's<00:00:46.950> I'm<00:00:47.039> guessing<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.210> so

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
three weapons that's I'm guessing and so

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.860 
three weapons that's I'm guessing and so
I'll<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.930> pretty<00:00:49.110> cool<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:50.750> it's<00:00:51.750> pretty

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
I'll be pretty cool and it's pretty

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.900 
I'll be pretty cool and it's pretty
expensive<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.309> it's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
expensive as you can see but it's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.150 
expensive as you can see but it's
probably<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> best<00:00:55.530> new

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
probably going to be one of the best new

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.639 
probably going to be one of the best new
things<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> game<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.260> can<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.500> it's

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
things in the game and you can see it's

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.869 
things in the game and you can see it's
outside<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> moon<00:00:59.550> environment<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:01.879> now

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
outside in the moon environment and now

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.310 
outside in the moon environment and now
in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> distance<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:03.870> there's<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
in the distance you can see there's a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.270 
in the distance you can see there's a
new<00:01:04.470> drop<00:01:05.210> dis<00:01:06.210> past<00:01:06.600> 12<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.439> looks<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.799> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
new drop dis past 12 it looks like and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640 
new drop dis past 12 it looks like and
my<00:01:08.460> guess<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> new<00:01:09.600> drop<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.170> it's

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
my guess is this is a new drop and it's

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.200 
my guess is this is a new drop and it's
gonna<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> death<00:01:11.220> machine<00:01:11.400> now<00:01:11.790> it's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
gonna be like the death machine now it's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.760 
gonna be like the death machine now it's
probably<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> drop<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.960> random<00:01:13.409> weapons

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
probably going to drop a random weapons

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.820 
probably going to drop a random weapons
not<00:01:14.040> always<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.490> past<00:01:14.760> 12<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.560> you<00:01:16.560> pick<00:01:16.799> it

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
not always this past 12 and you pick it

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.520 
not always this past 12 and you pick it
up<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.240> gun<00:01:18.659> even<00:01:19.290> fill

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
up and then you have that gun even fill

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.560 
up and then you have that gun even fill
up<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:20.939> bit<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.119> time<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.540> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
up like a little bit of time like a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.719 
up like a little bit of time like a
death<00:01:21.810> machine<00:01:21.960> oh<00:01:22.350> maybe<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.340> switch<00:01:23.580> out

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
death machine oh maybe just switch out

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.160 
death machine oh maybe just switch out
the<00:01:23.820> gun<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.600> gun<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.049> it's

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the gun you have for that gun and it's

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.340 
the gun you have for that gun and it's
like<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> flea<00:01:25.530> mystery<00:01:25.860> box<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:28.140> see

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
like a flea mystery box and you see

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.539 
like a flea mystery box and you see
picks<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:29.130> now<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:32.250> that's<00:01:32.369> pretty

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
picks it up right now and that's pretty

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.450 
picks it up right now and that's pretty
cool<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.470> zombies<00:01:34.590> go<00:01:34.890> flying<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
cool and the zombies go flying in the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.660 
cool and the zombies go flying in the
space<00:01:35.700> environment<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.920> used<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
space environment as you used to and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.910 
space environment as you used to and
right<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.960> see<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.200> i'm<00:01:40.710> going<00:01:40.860> to

like<00:01:47.880> grabs<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.450> need<00:01:48.630> brings<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.229> somewhere

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
like grabs you need brings you somewhere

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
like grabs you need brings you somewhere
else<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> outside<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> map<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.939> i<00:01:51.540> looked

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
else in the outside the map and i looked

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.300 
else in the outside the map and i looked
pretty<00:01:51.899> cool<00:01:52.110> looks<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> zombie<00:01:52.560> got<00:01:53.189> too

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
pretty cool looks like a zombie got too

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.609 
pretty cool looks like a zombie got too
close<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> special<00:01:54.390> boss<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.930> like

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
close so like a special boss and like

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.770 
close so like a special boss and like
infected<00:01:56.189> him<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:56.700> he<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:56.969> runs<00:01:57.299> after

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
infected him and then he just runs after

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.230 
infected him and then he just runs after
a<00:01:58.049> teammate<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.799> brings<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.700> somewhere<00:02:00.060> else

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
a teammate and brings you somewhere else

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.420 
a teammate and brings you somewhere else
and<00:02:00.360> then<00:02:00.420> maybe<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.810> get<00:02:00.960> infected<00:02:01.430> well

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and then maybe you get infected well

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.770 
and then maybe you get infected well
maybe<00:02:02.549> not<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> don't<00:02:03.030> look<00:02:03.119> infected<00:02:03.420> but

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
maybe not you don't look infected but

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.800 
maybe not you don't look infected but
that's<00:02:04.740> something<00:02:04.860> cool<00:02:05.210> maybe<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.630> he'll

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
that's something cool maybe see he'll

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.359 
that's something cool maybe see he'll
this<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.020> probably<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.469> spawn<00:02:07.829> area<00:02:08.069> you're

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
this is probably the spawn area you're

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.249 
this is probably the spawn area you're
not<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> moon<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.090> area<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.599> 51<00:02:10.140> it

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
not on the moon you on area like 51 it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.080 
not on the moon you on area like 51 it
looks<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.280> see<00:02:11.400> jug<00:02:11.640> knots<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
looks like and you see jug knots in the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.059 
looks like and you see jug knots in the
back

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
back

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.670 
back
and<00:02:13.159> it<00:02:13.340> looks<00:02:13.519> like<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:14.019> spawn<00:02:15.019> on<00:02:15.409> the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
and it looks like you spawn on the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.339 
and it looks like you spawn on the
ground<00:02:16.159> and<00:02:16.430> area<00:02:16.700> 51<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.299> you<00:02:17.930> can<00:02:18.079> tell<00:02:18.319> I

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
ground and area 51 and you can tell I

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.770 
ground and area 51 and you can tell I
put<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.859> moon<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.249> back<00:02:19.359> because<00:02:20.359> jug<00:02:20.599> not

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
put to the moon and back because jug not

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.390 
put to the moon and back because jug not
cos<00:02:21.109> you<00:02:21.170> probably<00:02:21.439> have<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.680> come<00:02:21.829> back<00:02:21.859> and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
cos you probably have to come back and

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.369 
cos you probably have to come back and
you<00:02:22.909> see<00:02:23.060> right<00:02:23.239> now<00:02:23.269> on<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.599> big<00:02:23.780> teleporting

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
you see right now on a big teleporting

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.949 
you see right now on a big teleporting
pad<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.189> you<00:02:25.219> go<00:02:26.030> from<00:02:26.150> heel<00:02:26.329> to<00:02:26.359> the<00:02:26.540> moon<00:02:26.749> and

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
pad and you go from heel to the moon and

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.629 
pad and you go from heel to the moon and
it<00:02:27.650> looks<00:02:27.799> pretty<00:02:28.010> cool<00:02:28.159> because<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.430> still

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:28.639 
it looks pretty cool because you still

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.300 
it looks pretty cool because you still
have<00:02:28.670> your<00:02:28.879> spacesuits<00:02:29.359> on<00:02:30.010> then<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.159> see

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
have your spacesuits on then you see

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.970 
have your spacesuits on then you see
right<00:02:31.459> now<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.639> going<00:02:31.849> back<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.299> moon<00:02:32.980> and

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
right now to going back to the moon and

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.080 
right now to going back to the moon and
that's<00:02:34.099> pretty<00:02:34.400> cool<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.760> have<00:02:34.879> all<00:02:35.000> your

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
that's pretty cool you have all your

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.270 
that's pretty cool you have all your
spacesuits<00:02:35.689> you<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:35.989> probably<00:02:36.260> buy<00:02:36.409> and<00:02:37.159> you

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
spacesuits you can probably buy and you

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.449 
spacesuits you can probably buy and you
put<00:02:37.459> this<00:02:37.549> mask<00:02:37.790> back<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.889> which<00:02:39.889> is<00:02:40.040> expected

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
put this mask back on which is expected

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.319 
put this mask back on which is expected
and<00:02:41.439> usually<00:02:42.439> just<00:02:42.620> gets<00:02:42.799> a<00:02:42.889> nuke<00:02:43.129> and<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:44.209> can

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
and usually just gets a nuke and you can

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.059 
and usually just gets a nuke and you can
see<00:02:44.450> right<00:02:44.480> now<00:02:44.659> like<00:02:45.019> around<00:02:45.349> the<00:02:45.560> screen<00:02:45.829> the

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
see right now like around the screen the

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.459 
see right now like around the screen the
bottom<00:02:46.189> right<00:02:46.909> left<00:02:47.239> in<00:02:47.359> the<00:02:47.480> top<00:02:47.659> you<00:02:48.290> can<00:02:48.409> see

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:48.469 
bottom right left in the top you can see

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:50.920 
bottom right left in the top you can see
a<00:02:48.620> little<00:02:48.829> bit<00:02:49.040> just<00:02:50.030> showing<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:50.359> that<00:02:50.450> you

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
a little bit just showing you that you

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.659 
a little bit just showing you that you
have<00:02:51.049> a<00:02:51.079> mask<00:02:51.319> on<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:52.129> can<00:02:52.250> just<00:02:52.370> like<00:02:52.489> see

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:52.669 
have a mask on you can just like see

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.030 
have a mask on you can just like see
that<00:02:52.849> lines<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.359> it<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.599> stuff<00:02:53.810> which<00:02:54.019> is<00:02:54.049> cool

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
that lines of it and stuff which is cool

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.530 
that lines of it and stuff which is cool
i<00:02:55.099> guess<00:02:55.219> probably<00:02:55.849> gonna<00:02:56.150> be<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.299> little<00:02:56.359> bit

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
i guess probably gonna be a little bit

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.500 
i guess probably gonna be a little bit
annoying<00:02:56.780> but<00:02:57.699> and<00:02:58.699> now<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:58.849> can<00:02:59.030> see<00:02:59.239> he's

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
annoying but and now you can see he's

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.759 
annoying but and now you can see he's
gone<00:02:59.719> to<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.870> mystery<00:03:00.079> box<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.560> he's<00:03:00.650> going

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
gone to the mystery box and he's going

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.939 
gone to the mystery box and he's going
to<00:03:00.829> get<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:02.150> new<00:03:02.299> like<00:03:02.569> special<00:03:02.989> grenade<00:03:03.319> and

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:03.949 
to get the new like special grenade and

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.920 
to get the new like special grenade and
what<00:03:04.549> this<00:03:04.639> does<00:03:04.699> it<00:03:05.030> doesn't<00:03:05.269> explode<00:03:05.719> and

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
what this does it doesn't explode and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.770 
what this does it doesn't explode and
kill<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.260> zombies<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:07.060> explodes<00:03:08.060> like<00:03:08.419> a

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
kill the zombies it explodes like a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.409 
kill the zombies it explodes like a
bunch<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.709> like<00:03:09.859> wind<00:03:10.189> or<00:03:10.459> something<00:03:10.609> and<00:03:11.000> it

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:11.419 
bunch of like wind or something and it

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.569 
bunch of like wind or something and it
just<00:03:11.599> shoots<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.019> zombies<00:03:12.590> like<00:03:12.919> flying<00:03:13.340> in

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
just shoots the zombies like flying in

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.000 
just shoots the zombies like flying in
the<00:03:13.760> moon<00:03:14.629> atmosphere<00:03:15.290> on<00:03:15.409> stuff<00:03:15.650> doesn't

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
the moon atmosphere on stuff doesn't

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.379 
the moon atmosphere on stuff doesn't
like<00:03:16.099> explode<00:03:16.579> and<00:03:16.760> like<00:03:16.879> kill<00:03:17.120> them<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.359> just

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
like explode and like kill them it just

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.479 
like explode and like kill them it just
shoots<00:03:17.750> them<00:03:18.019> which<00:03:18.709> probably<00:03:18.979> does<00:03:19.250> kill

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
shoots them which probably does kill

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.920 
shoots them which probably does kill
them<00:03:19.639> but<00:03:19.729> if<00:03:19.819> you're<00:03:19.939> close<00:03:20.180> i<00:03:20.389> think<00:03:20.599> it<00:03:20.870> just

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
them but if you're close i think it just

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.319 
them but if you're close i think it just
shoots<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.500> too<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.009> you<00:03:22.729> see<00:03:22.909> these<00:03:23.120> things
