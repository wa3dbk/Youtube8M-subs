the stork predicted that flash would win

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.980 
the stork predicted that flash would win
at<00:01:42.479> 31<00:01:43.229> or<00:01:43.560> 30<00:01:44.130> i<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:44.520> he<00:01:44.579> said<00:01:44.610> 30<00:01:45.030> maybe<00:01:45.509> 31

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
at 31 or 30 i think he said 30 maybe 31

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.530 
at 31 or 30 i think he said 30 maybe 31
and<00:01:46.500> he<00:01:46.640> practice<00:01:47.640> against<00:01:47.909> flash<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.450> he

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and he practice against flash so he

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.690 
and he practice against flash so he
definitely<00:01:48.659> knows<00:01:49.140> how<00:01:49.470> strong<00:01:49.530> he<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.009> so

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
definitely knows how strong he is so

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.580 
definitely knows how strong he is so
that's<00:01:50.880> definitely<00:01:51.180> something<00:01:51.720> coming<00:01:52.439> from

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
sees those troops moving down so it's

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.039 
sees those troops moving down so it's
going<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.299> be<00:03:21.359> a<00:03:21.419> little<00:03:21.569> bit<00:03:21.750> suspicious

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
going to be a little bit suspicious

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.839 
going to be a little bit suspicious
probably<00:03:22.470> going<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.650> run<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.949> the<00:03:22.979> front<00:03:23.310> see

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
probably going to run to the front see

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.969 
probably going to run to the front see
if<00:03:23.940> he<00:03:24.030> can<00:03:24.180> follow<00:03:24.569> those<00:03:24.959> troops<00:03:25.319> he's<00:03:25.799> got

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979 
if he can follow those troops he's got

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.979 
if he can follow those troops he's got
to<00:03:26.069> follow<00:03:26.220> these<00:03:26.519> troops<00:03:26.790> with<00:03:27.030> his<00:03:27.359> observer

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
to follow these troops with his observer

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.659 
to follow these troops with his observer
so<00:03:28.560> he<00:03:28.650> knows<00:03:28.769> where<00:03:28.979> they<00:03:29.069> are<00:03:29.099> at<00:03:29.310> all<00:03:29.400> times

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
so he knows where they are at all times

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.879 
so he knows where they are at all times
look<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.150> lot<00:03:30.389> of<00:03:30.629> gateways<00:03:31.139> coming<00:03:31.560> up<00:03:31.680> for<00:03:31.859> a

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
look a lot of gateways coming up for a

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.729 
look a lot of gateways coming up for a
movie<00:03:31.919> so<00:03:32.790> yeah<00:03:33.239> he's<00:03:33.479> going<00:03:34.139> to<00:03:34.229> hope<00:03:34.470> that

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
movie so yeah he's going to hope that

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.319 
movie so yeah he's going to hope that
that<00:03:34.829> third<00:03:35.099> base<00:03:35.310> comes<00:03:35.549> up<00:03:35.819> he's<00:03:36.120> going<00:03:36.269> to

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
that third base comes up he's going to

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.969 
that third base comes up he's going to
protect<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.930> third<00:03:37.169> base<00:03:37.379> with<00:03:37.560> his<00:03:37.709> life

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:37.979 
protect that third base with his life

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.379 
protect that third base with his life
because<00:03:38.489> if<00:03:38.729> he<00:03:38.790> doesn't<00:03:39.000> get<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.209> third

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
because if he doesn't get that third

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.430 
because if he doesn't get that third
base<00:03:39.569> up<00:03:39.750> he's<00:03:39.900> not<00:03:39.930> going<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.139> be<00:03:40.199> able<00:03:40.260> to

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
base up he's not going to be able to

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.640 
base up he's not going to be able to
support<00:03:40.560> all<00:03:40.979> these<00:03:41.190> gateways<00:03:41.489> for<00:03:41.699> sure<00:03:42.650> but

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
support all these gateways for sure but

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.140 
support all these gateways for sure but
flash<00:03:43.889> is<00:03:44.159> not<00:03:44.310> playing<00:03:44.549> aggressively<00:03:44.760> he's

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
flash is not playing aggressively he's

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.629 
flash is not playing aggressively he's
playing<00:03:45.359> defensively<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.109> he<00:03:46.229> can<00:03:46.489> get<00:03:47.489> the

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
playing defensively so he can get the

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.580 
playing defensively so he can get the
defense<00:03:47.909> on<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.389> protect<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.989> third<00:03:49.290> base

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
defense on and protect that third base

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.409 
defense on and protect that third base
he's<00:03:49.919> going<00:03:50.129> for<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.340> macro<00:03:50.760> built<00:03:51.000> just<00:03:51.329> like

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
he's going for a macro built just like

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.360 
he's going for a macro built just like
movie<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.470> think<00:03:52.560> both<00:03:52.829> guys<00:03:53.040> are<00:03:53.069> just

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
movie so I think both guys are just

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.640 
movie so I think both guys are just
going<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.579> expand<00:03:54.030> down<00:03:54.299> expand<00:03:54.959> south<00:03:55.290> and

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
going to expand down expand south and

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.559 
going to expand down expand south and
once<00:03:56.069> they<00:03:56.220> hit<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.489> bottom<00:03:56.819> they're<00:03:57.299> going

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
once they hit the bottom they're going

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.089 
once they hit the bottom they're going
to<00:03:57.659> be<00:03:57.840> fighting<00:03:58.109> over<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.530> top<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:58.919> bottom

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
to be fighting over the top and bottom

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.550 
to be fighting over the top and bottom
expansions<00:03:59.849> and<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.750> going<00:04:01.109> to<00:04:01.199> be<00:04:01.319> epic

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
expansions and that is going to be epic

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.849 
expansions and that is going to be epic
there's<00:04:02.430> going<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.669> be<00:04:02.729> a<00:04:02.790> lot<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.409> heavy<00:04:04.409> heavy

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
there's going to be a lot of heavy heavy

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.770 
there's going to be a lot of heavy heavy
unit<00:04:05.129> battles<00:04:05.939> in<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.150> middle<00:04:06.389> especially

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.809 
with a fast arbiter tech out like this X
like<00:04:10.620> movies<00:04:10.919> transferring<00:04:11.489> all<00:04:11.609> of<00:04:11.699> his

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
probes to the new base over with the

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.460 
probes to the new base over with the
three<00:04:14.340> o'clock<00:04:14.609> but<00:04:15.599> just<00:04:15.870> now<00:04:16.019> going<00:04:16.199> to<00:04:16.349> come

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
three o'clock but just now going to come

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.069 
three o'clock but just now going to come
up<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:17.000> really<00:04:18.000> both<00:04:18.209> these<00:04:18.359> guys<00:04:18.599> are<00:04:18.840> safe

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
up and really both these guys are safe

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.960 
up and really both these guys are safe
to<00:04:19.229> expand<00:04:19.620> again<00:04:19.889> neither<00:04:20.190> wants<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:20.669> attack

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
to expand again neither wants to attack

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.790 
to expand again neither wants to attack
so<00:04:21.630> they're<00:04:21.750> both<00:04:21.870> probably<00:04:22.169> just<00:04:22.440> going<00:04:22.650> to

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
so they're both probably just going to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.260 
so they're both probably just going to
expand<00:04:23.250> until<00:04:23.430> they<00:04:23.580> hit<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.820> bottom<00:04:24.150> and

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
expand until they hit the bottom and

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.450 
expand until they hit the bottom and
then<00:04:24.630> attack<00:04:25.110> each<00:04:25.320> other

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
then attack each other

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.550 
then attack each other
because<00:04:27.419> they'll<00:04:27.539> both<00:04:27.690> be<00:04:27.720> able<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.169> keep<00:04:28.350> on

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
because they'll both be able to keep on

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.140 
because they'll both be able to keep on
the<00:04:28.710> scouting<00:04:28.979> with<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.280> observers<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:29.940> the

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
the scouting with the observers and the

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.930 
the scouting with the observers and the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.240 
scans respectively it comes the armory
coming<00:04:33.270> up<00:04:33.360> flash<00:04:34.350> is<00:04:34.530> going<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.770> scan<00:04:35.099> around

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
coming up flash is going to scan around

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.450 
coming up flash is going to scan around
he<00:04:35.699> might<00:04:35.729> have<00:04:36.030> seen<00:04:36.389> the<00:04:37.349> Stargate<00:04:38.009> up<00:04:38.250> so

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
he might have seen the Stargate up so

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.800 
he might have seen the Stargate up so
that<00:04:38.610> would<00:04:38.729> give<00:04:38.759> him<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.090> clue<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.360> he<00:04:39.630> got

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
that would give him a clue that he got

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.469 
that would give him a clue that he got
to<00:04:39.960> be<00:04:40.080> prepared<00:04:40.319> for<00:04:41.090> carriers<00:04:42.090> coming<00:04:42.240> and

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.360 
the jaedong vs yellow finals for obvious
reasons<00:04:50.699> I<00:04:50.880> mean<00:04:51.000> in<00:04:51.120> cvz<00:04:51.720> very<00:04:52.710> short<00:04:53.099> games

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.070 
reasons I mean in cvz very short games
and<00:04:53.789> you<00:04:53.849> don't<00:04:54.000> want<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.180> waste<00:04:54.840> your<00:04:54.990> time

and you don't want to waste your time

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.570 
and you don't want to waste your time
trying<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.560> find<00:04:55.740> a<00:04:55.800> parking<00:04:55.949> space<00:04:56.340> or

trying to find a parking space or

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.279 
trying to find a parking space or
whatever<00:04:56.880> or<00:04:57.419> trying<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.840> get<00:04:57.930> a<00:04:57.960> bus<00:04:58.169> or

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
whatever the people get to the thing but

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.839 
whatever the people get to the thing but
it<00:05:01.169> looks<00:05:01.349> like<00:05:01.410> flash<00:05:01.770> getting<00:05:02.220> up<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.699> nine

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
it looks like flash getting up the nine

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.150 
it looks like flash getting up the nine
o'clock<00:05:03.210> both<00:05:03.509> guys<00:05:03.780> expanding<00:05:04.530> down<00:05:04.740> kind<00:05:05.070> of

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.430 
o'clock both guys expanding down kind of
a<00:05:05.280> mirrored<00:05:05.970> kind<00:05:06.300> of<00:05:06.360> butterfly<00:05:06.660> build<00:05:07.169> on

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
a mirrored kind of butterfly build on

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.550 
a mirrored kind of butterfly build on
the<00:05:07.620> map<00:05:07.800> very<00:05:08.340> interesting<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:08.910> see<00:05:09.560> very

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
the map very interesting to see very

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
nice defensive Graig from flash tues I

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.150 
nice defensive Graig from flash tues I
don't<00:05:12.660> think<00:05:12.810> he's<00:05:12.900> going<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.289> I<00:05:13.620> don't<00:05:14.009> think

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
don't think he's going to I don't think

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.350 
don't think he's going to I don't think
movies<00:05:14.370> going<00:05:14.580> to<00:05:14.639> be<00:05:14.729> able<00:05:14.789> to<00:05:14.910> break<00:05:15.060> anytime

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
movies going to be able to break anytime

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.080 
movies going to be able to break anytime
soon<00:05:15.900> once<00:05:16.500> it<00:05:16.650> gets<00:05:16.800> his<00:05:17.039> arbiter<00:05:17.699> tech<00:05:17.849> going

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
soon once it gets his arbiter tech going

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.189 
soon once it gets his arbiter tech going
you<00:05:18.180> might<00:05:18.270> be<00:05:18.419> able<00:05:18.479> to<00:05:18.570> recall<00:05:18.750> into<00:05:19.110> the

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
you might be able to recall into the

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.159 
you might be able to recall into the
basic<00:05:19.530> caused<00:05:19.650> some<00:05:19.860> damage<00:05:20.009> but<00:05:20.630> all<00:05:21.630> being

basic caused some damage but all being

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.529 
basic caused some damage but all being
scanned<00:05:22.680> so<00:05:23.280> flash<00:05:23.639> didn't<00:05:24.060> know<00:05:24.120> about<00:05:24.240> that

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
scanned so flash didn't know about that

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.480 
scanned so flash didn't know about that
before<00:05:24.870> he<00:05:25.050> knows<00:05:25.229> about<00:05:25.380> it<00:05:25.620> now<00:05:25.770> he<00:05:26.340> knows

about that tech now he sees the fast
arbiters<00:05:29.180> there's<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.300> very<00:05:30.449> nice<00:05:30.630> photo<00:05:31.470> of

being picked off the flash saw that

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.719 
being picked off the flash saw that
little<00:05:40.650> glitch<00:05:40.889> on<00:05:41.009> the<00:05:41.099> map<00:05:41.250> he<00:05:41.370> said<00:05:41.550> hey<00:05:41.699> I

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
little glitch on the map he said hey I

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.670 
little glitch on the map he said hey I
want<00:05:42.060> to<00:05:42.090> kill<00:05:42.360> observers<00:05:42.870> so<00:05:43.229> he<00:05:43.320> killed<00:05:43.530> one

and<00:05:44.120> there<00:05:45.120> is<00:05:45.270> once<00:05:45.630> the<00:05:46.259> starport<00:05:47.099> is<00:05:47.250> out

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
and there is once the starport is out

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.670 
and there is once the starport is out
just<00:05:47.669> to<00:05:47.759> get<00:05:47.940> to<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.389> science<00:05:49.229> facility<00:05:49.650> i

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
just to get to the science facility i

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.580 
just to get to the science facility i
think<00:05:50.009> get<00:05:50.190> some<00:05:50.659> science<00:05:51.659> vessels<00:05:52.020> out<00:05:52.169> to

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
think get some science vessels out to

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.159 
think get some science vessels out to
deal<00:05:52.740> with<00:05:52.860> this<00:05:52.949> damned<00:05:53.340> arbiter<00:05:54.169> cuz

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
heavy tech build it means he probably

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:24.920 
heavy tech build it means he probably
doesn't<00:06:23.310> have<00:06:23.430> a<00:06:23.699> whole<00:06:23.759> lot<00:06:24.090> of<00:06:24.419> troops<00:06:24.780> out

on<00:06:25.080> the<00:06:25.139> ground<00:06:25.380> I<00:06:25.560> mean<00:06:25.680> he<00:06:25.770> got<00:06:25.919> all<00:06:26.099> all

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
on the ground I mean he got all all

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.909 
on the ground I mean he got all all
those<00:06:26.669> gateways<00:06:26.940> up<00:06:27.330> but<00:06:28.050> he<00:06:28.409> was<00:06:28.530> working<00:06:28.830> on

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
those gateways up but he was working on

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.070 
those gateways up but he was working on
his<00:06:28.979> macro<00:06:29.550> at<00:06:29.639> the<00:06:29.729> same<00:06:29.909> time<00:06:30.150> so<00:06:30.509> now<00:06:30.780> he's

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
his macro at the same time so now he's

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.290 
his macro at the same time so now he's
going<00:06:31.259> to<00:06:31.380> start<00:06:31.590> pumping<00:06:31.949> troops<00:06:32.219> lots<00:06:33.180> and

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
going to start pumping troops lots and

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.659 
going to start pumping troops lots and
lots<00:06:33.449> of<00:06:33.630> troops<00:06:33.900> and<00:06:34.229> then<00:06:35.010> who<00:06:35.159> might<00:06:35.520> be

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
lots of troops and then who might be

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:37.459 
lots of troops and then who might be
able<00:06:35.760> to<00:06:35.880> overwhelm<00:06:36.180> flash<00:06:36.630> just<00:06:37.050> the<00:06:37.229> enough
