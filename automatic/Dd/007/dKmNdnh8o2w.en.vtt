call truly holistic some places talk

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.320 
call truly holistic some places talk
about<00:02:11.500> mind<00:02:11.830> body<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.400> think<00:02:12.790> that's<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.210> end

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
about mind body and think that's the end

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.280 
about mind body and think that's the end
of<00:02:13.650> holistic<00:02:14.650> education<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.550> actually<00:02:15.880> we

cover the spirit dimension as well it's
a<00:02:19.630> very<00:02:19.810> strong<00:02:20.170> dimension<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.830> what<00:02:20.980> we<00:02:21.100> do

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
a very strong dimension of what we do

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.970 
a very strong dimension of what we do
