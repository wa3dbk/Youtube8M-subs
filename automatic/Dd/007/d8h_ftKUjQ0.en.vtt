00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 sarah jessica chau my dear doctor 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.600
 how is this life 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.550
 today a topic that I think is 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.200
 very interesting especially for the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.219
 mothers and for young girls because 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.139
 it's my first appointment to the gynecologist 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.880
 perfect should be the first appointment at 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.609
 good gynecologist we have to be clear 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.609
 certain ideas and three points from when 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.949
 you are already a woman to go to the doctor and 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.630
 then we have to be clear that a 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.910
 From the age of 11 we are already in the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.030
 age of puberty and they are going to present 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.680
 physical changes in your body does not 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.960
 only physical changes but changes 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.520
 emotional psychological changes that 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.070
 we have to be very aware of the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.149
 moms within the first changes going 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.160
 to be the growth of the gland 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.559
 mammary then the girls are going to tend 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.460
 your breast button that will grow and 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.920
 developing day by day usually the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.120
 doctor has to do that assessment 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.489
 who has to do it suddenly the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.500
 gynecologist then we have a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.809
 11-year-old girl with a growth of her 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.019
 breast button with hair development 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.280
 pubic that will gradually come out 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.190
 then it's time to visit 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.210
 our ginÃ©s 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.280
 then but make an assessment 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.890
 physical to see if the characters 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.690
 side of the girl are giving 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.270
 according to the age they threw now 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.340
 but that does not happen usually does not 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.220
 have sometimes moms prefer 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.160
 keep the pediatrician's concept up 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.380
 the 14 15 years then that 's very 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.230
 proper to our culture but our 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.850
 Pediatrician has to be well prepared 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.680
 obviously that if academically for 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.420
 determine these problems at the time 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.280
 now doctors when the first one arrives 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.340
 menstruation would be ideal to be at 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.990
 better the first appointment to the gynecologist 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.100
 it's really good that's personal like 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.420
 I tell you inside what is the 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.010
 development of secondary characters 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.020
 at the time of visiting your gynecologist 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.570
 but that already when it comes to the first 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.580
 menstruation to explain to mom how 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.770
 is going to be that menstruation the changes 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.660
 that can be presented if they are going to 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.020
 there are arrears and they are going to see advances and 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.880
 economic audio we really do not know the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.890
 human body is an enigma we do not know 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.750
 really how is it going to be presented or how 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.520
 is going to develop but we do have to 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.740
 talk with our girl and our 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.660
 doctor has to explain us what they are 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.980
 those changes that will be presented if 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.530
 a picture of pain is presented 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.060
 colic that we must do how it's going to be 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.010
 that administration there are girls who have 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.360
 menstruations by droplets in girls 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.310
 who have menstruation is totally 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.830
 abundant is a very heavy bleeding 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.269
 you can last 10 to 15 days there 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.760
 girls who can bleed you all month 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.379
 then it 's time to have a 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.269
 our trusted gynecologist 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.280
 to guide us and give you the treatment 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.870
 indicated to the guys is not our 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.879
 culture do not ask for ultrasound 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.920
 gynecological in childhood bone age 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.379
 78 years that nobody even I eat 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.209
 As a mom, I made it for my children 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.940
 then I am waiting for your development 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.860
 in the pre-adolescence phase to 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.540
 request and examine through a 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.120
 pelvic ultrasound to see how they are 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.690
 your organs is your uterine ovaries and everything 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.329
 the rest 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.310
 ok now the gynecologist would be the person 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.560
 indicated to talk with the boys and 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.579
 the girls better said and tell them which ones 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.890
 are the methods quantities 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.349
 contraceptives that exist and what happens 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.420
 if suddenly evening morning 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.090
 the afternoon decides to use some method 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.700
 that the friend recommended but then that 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.310
 It should be clearly parent 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.069
 I think that in this current era he has to 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.200
 be of the two ok obviously if I get 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.150
 a mother talks with her son 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.980
 13 year old teenager and I'm going to 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.480
 address the issue directly with the use 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.840
 contraceptives will go into shock 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.700
 but usually as the patient 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.560
 you know your doctor the questions 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.390
 they are given and the degree of empathy the 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.430
 degree of confidence generated by the doctor 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.739
 with the patient is what he really does 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.269
 develop the themes on the whole subject 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.640
 of family planning the subject of 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.500
 contraception I really am very very 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.030
 something a lot of relationship with my patient 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.440
 so believe me I have all the 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.239
 sincerity to speak like our 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.860
 children and mom and we have contabilidad AllTravels 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.130
 example to the girls he starts to give 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.750
 with very strong colic and mom 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.940
 buy something that is universal 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.950
 something that is always commercial that 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.930
 It is always easy to acquire true but 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.510
 we do not know what's behind that colic 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.819
 when when a colic is decisive 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.560
 so that that young truth goes to 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.000
 gynecologist really good when you already 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.370
 compromise your lifestyle 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.019
 ok because if you have a colic that you 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.180
 you come and give him a buffet you give him a 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.570
 medicine is taken away you can say 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.820
 good is a syndrome prepare themselves backwards 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.860
 but if I have a girl that falls in 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.050
 phases of hypotension headache 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.330
 sweating decay that will not be able 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.770
 develop your normal life your go to 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.170
 school that is going to stay at home 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.090
 obviously we are talking about something 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.560
 pathological you need to receive 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.660
 treatment on time because I have to 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.980
 see if a pure premenstrual syndrome or 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.080
 suddenly I have a patient with a 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.790
 ovarian cyst now that's going to tell you 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.040
 just that I have heard including many 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.440
 young girls who already have ovaries 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.460
 polycystic because they are so young 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.740
 has nothing to do with the activity 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.970
 sexual or if you have to see it has nothing 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.230
 what to do with sexual activity have 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.060
 that polycystic ovarian syndrome 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.980
 it has been studied a lot and it is followed 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.810
 studying because to date not 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.180
 has a specific cause 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.890
 then it is located or is related 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.230
 with a metabolic syndrome like all your 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.330
 metabolism to the late then comes 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.220
 the concept had the concept the visit 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.290
 gynecologist because because the doctor's 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.720
 cabecera sent you a pelvic ultrasound 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.340
 and we can find ovaries full of 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.110
 follicles but suddenly you're 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.990
 forgetting in which phase of the cycle 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.880
 menstrual is the girl is the girl 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.590
 is the teenager we are in a 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.910
 follicular phase obviously you have to 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.040
 find follicles 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.350
 then it's normal but if I eat 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.180
 professional you forgot about the phases 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.080
 obviously you are going to say that this child 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.210
 have a polycystic ovarian syndrome 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.460
 when what we are are really 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.290
 we are in a follicular phase of his 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.510
 menstrual cycle that is very important 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.040
 remember to remember the size of the 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.230
 follicular cysts because it can grow 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.540
 to two centimeters then we have some 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.340
 girls who have a 1.82 cyst 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.680
 centimeters can be a cyst that is 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.290
 previous ocular and is normal 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.510
 ok doctor then to finish that you 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.340
 we say the parents should take the 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.350
 girl when she receives her first 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.180
 Menstruation breaks or since 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.980
 stage of puberty and it is changing its 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.170
 body visits the gynecologist which 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.090
 of the two is the recommendation for 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.380
 dads for me my personal opinion is in 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.690
 the moment that those of the 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.940
 secondary sexual characteristics of the 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.080
 girls to develop to see the 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.240
 evolution because there is a 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.100
 rated a rating as soon as 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.720
 the development of the mammary gland if 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.400
 is growing is called the classification 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.320
 from tanner there is also a classification 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.090
 for the development of pubic hair there 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.760
 a predisposition of pubic hair that 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.710
 it can be to guide you a diagnosis of 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.009
 polycystic ovary syndrome then 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.770
 this 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:32.339
 changes have to be evaluated 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.139
 gradually in a good story 

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:36.889
 clinic by the professional doctor very 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.889
 good many thanks
