00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.589
 the count here that here I once 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.870
 more visit today I bring you a 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.599
 tweet for what is let the screen 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.089
 to be able to put the resemblance to what is the 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.830
 mac dock in ios and how can you 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.450
 observe here and I get the 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.970
 applications that I have in the background 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.440
 open I get inside this dock and 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.000
 well let's go to that day from here 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.290
 to show you how you are going to install it 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.490
 ready once it has already finished 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.410
 load we're going to go to the section of 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.640
 search and we'll look for rocket launcher 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.410
 as you can see in the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.930
 screen comes with a price of one dollar 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.550
 in the network we can maya but you know that 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.170
 I always leave a description of the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.910
 repos that you must add and if you do not know 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.199
 how to add a time you also see 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.519
 with the description to come out 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.809
 completely free 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.609
 good I read to install it is very 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.589
 simple you will give in install in 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.300
 confirm you will create a small 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.010
 spring once you have created the 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.329
 sprint we're going to go to adjustments because 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.550
 Of course, it creates a menu within 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.140
 adjustments and we're going to give you this one that 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.600
 says rocker launcher the one that has the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.129
 We will give you a popcorn to remove and as 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.199
 you can see here opens us different 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.030
 options the first one is to enable it 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.949
 disable it I obviously have it 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.010
 enabled the second and third 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.970
 time to disable the blog that 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.610
 fuzzy that you see 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.470
 or disabling the ink unfortunately 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.080
 these two options me personally 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.570
 they do not work for me because if I activate them 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.830
 deactivated I do not see any change if 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.180
 you see some change please 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.190
 leave me in the comments for it 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.520
 add it to the description of the video but 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.540
 I really feel that these two 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.040
 options are not working until the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.440
 today and well the third option that 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.870
 is the show full screen snapshots yes 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.270
 we have it activated we are going to 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.130
 believe will show us what it is like 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.170
 You can see here the screen 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.479
 full of what we have open in the 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.400
 multitasking me here I have open settings 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.100
 and it will completely show me the 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.380
 screen and well let's see what it would be 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.119
 if we have it activated to me 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.369
 I like it much more than having it disabled 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.100
 because you are going to see right now how 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.619
 change here I do not have deactivated and if 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.570
 we went through the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.090
 multitasking creates us a kind of 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.470
 pages a little smaller not all the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.690
 full screen and I do a lot 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.610
 more aesthetic to have this this function 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.020
 deactivated I like it much more in 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.630
 personal but this is already a matter of 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.000
 I'm going to disable it here 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.380
 where it says custom application settings 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.510
 and we are going here says 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.450
 applications we will select all 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.720
 the applications that we want to have as 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.850
 how could you say as favorites 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.440
 that we want that there will always be 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.940
 you can see the first ones are the the app 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.760
 store the second are the applications 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.950
 of the system or also calls from the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.770
 tweets and here we're going to go tell 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.020
 I'm going to add contacts to the app store and 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.000
 let's add also game center we 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.040
 let's go back and go here wherever 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.630
 application order here as you can see 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.510
 I already get the applications that were 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.209
 chosen we are going to upload the app store on 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.190
 game center and the contacts I want that 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.350
 all these are going to be going 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.540
 back we're going to block to go to 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.459
 lock screen and how can you see if I 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.780
 I leave here pressed my finger this is very 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.800
 important I have not explained how 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.600
 activate it 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.550
 they have to press their finger on 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.500
 the screen to activate it and move inside 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.050
 of them will first appear 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.060
 these are the favorite applications 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.350
 what we want them to be and 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.700
 then we will see those of the 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.590
 multitasking as they can be 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.170
 watching here on the screen and good 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.239
 here where it says black list applications 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.000
 all applications that do not want 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.090
 what 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.410
 for nothing of the world in the screen you 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.030
 here Havana will select 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.540
 suppose we do not want it to come out 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.150
