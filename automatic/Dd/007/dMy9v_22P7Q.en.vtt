00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello everybody is over e 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.240
 sorry if I'm making 40 thousand videos but 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.529
 you know a special day must 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.150
 compromise that stopped dubbed e 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.469
 analyzed the trailers obviously again 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.450
 an analysis cannot be deepened 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.190
 because little time has passed but we are looking for 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.780
 to see what happens in the trailer of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.760
 trevor the third and final trailer 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.130
 if you have not already done so look at i 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.779
 dubbing and analysis of the other two 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.279
 I'll put some notes on it 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.199
 link or even look at the playlist 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.430
 official begins with trevor howling 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.650
 to the full moon that was made 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.240
 really well also has the reflection 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.520
 in the clouds something that was not there nor the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.219
 gta other home 3 € a kind of 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.649
 desert laboratory in the north of los 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.629
 anthos already test tubes from scientist 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.570
 sandy shore where it is also written 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.190
 we have liquor the populations of 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.320
 three thousand inhabitants there is a van 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.480
 who is dragging a generator of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.539
 current because probably here in 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.520
 not all these desert areas are 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.860
 reached by the trevor electricity 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.660
 who has a scar on his stomach like 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.489
 we have already seen the models are made 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.410
 also internally what not always 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.629
 su gta however in the video game in 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.909
 general was made and trevor pulling 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.240
 a nice scrap of the ata in the face to 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.580
 a friend here at a rocker in the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.729
 licei monte cilia with the lake always in the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.799
 desert returns the tractor that was missing 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.600
 in gta iv but there was su gta san instead 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.430
 andreas motel always in the desert where 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.960
 there were always these broken-down machines 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.310
 also on gta san andreas 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.220
 michele misseri there on the right while 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.930
 Trevor picks up Michael 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.210
 therefore a plot weave like al 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.820
 usually blessed there is a nice calendar 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.710
 so it's my favorite area of ​​san 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.990
 sincerely andreas that desert 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.940
 I don't know about you here in someone's home 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.200
 finally changed that shirt is 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.060
 what he does not spoil i 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.620
 furniture that there is a uniform a kind of 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.450
 divided by mason probably stands 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.130
 moving to his home 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.180
 and here is trevor's ability to drive 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.370
 the planes as we have already seen 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.020
 wonderful view with the lake il 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.210
 river that has already been seen as like 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.370
 we know trevor evening will have the license of 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.530
 aircraft guidance from the beginning 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.180
 ok in town three for throttling 1 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.040
 supercar in the background the old woman who 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.479
 they pull on their pockets while they are 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.570
 others can't care less 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.580
 here one is overturned 3 euros I believe 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.990
 caught him in their torture 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.619
 this is the scene that reminds me of modern 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.890
 warfare 2 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.080
 torture him enough 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.230
 horrible ok the three friends trevor michael e 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.200
 franklin that I find I believe in a 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.430
 placed halfway between santos and the desert 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.709
 on a railroad 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.450
 ok i think it 's short is that 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.239
 railway that passes both from the desert and 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.590
 between the saint it will be an intermediate part 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.269
 between the city and so on 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.769
 3 because as usual but at least 1 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.970
 with the girl who looks at hyenas tirana 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.890
 that ray we had seen 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.540
 in the other trailer here slapped tirana 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.060
 of that absurd animates the animations 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.160
 they are really realistic here steal one 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.870
 machine as de terre animations 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.400
 really good here we are at home of 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.989
 Michael with his wife scolding him 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.060
 because he understood that trevor is a little bit of 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.739
 as good as you see the details of the house 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.160
 as usual I am always very very 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.650
 tall with paintings, statues, etc. 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.390
 Michael's son Michael Cuesta does not 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.980
 I know who the wife Trevor perhaps is 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.470
 bothers as usual to date to 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.519
 home always very defined microwave 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.260
 the thing rises from the weighs of objects, etc. 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.730
 the santos the channel i don't know if you have 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.430
 noticed but it is full of water thing 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.320
 quite unusual trevor in underpants is 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.489
 a beautiful effect of the sun the 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.640
 background 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.200
 so there is a climate effect 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.299
 very good here in the desert there was one 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.920
 bike them this is a shotgun 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.209
 ok this looks like some kind of monster 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.310
 truck because I see shock absorbers 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.350
 beautiful big that unfortunately blows up 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.360
 because of the trevor shotgun here 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.950
 trevor who has the gas tank in 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.140
 I think it's the same scene as the 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.240
 second trailer in which just set fire 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.610
 to a house 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.350
 to cover up obviously a murder is 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.390
 here trevor who speaks with ours 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.700
 dear michael should be yes 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.760
 behind tires 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.290
 ok pose i don't know who is driving maybe 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.230
 michael but three time really doing 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.840
 the bad ass shooting from the wing of the plane 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.700
 with the explosions behind and then jump 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.930
 at the end a wonderful lightning there 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.660
 behind that we had already seen in one 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.250
 screenshot on the desert pier here 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.770
 remembers so much red dead redemption but 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.350
 also trevor reminds me a little bit 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.970
 he would say redemption I don't know about you palace 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.650
 of the first trailer with helicopter of the 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.840
 police flying over santos like al 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.760
 usually pedestrians machines etcetera 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.880
 trevor who steals a helicopter in a 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.350
 incredible way by launching one 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.790
 obviously from there 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.200
 and here wonderful launches from 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.360
 car just before the train arrives 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.220
 look at the damage as you see it was 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.380
 incredibly improved the damage on 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.790
 vehicles even in shooting alone there 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.550
 something on television an advertisement 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.400
 here there is the masked puma man I don't know 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.280
 that looks like the saraband cat man e 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.110
 here we are on the pier of lo santos you see 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.690

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.910

 times because it is one of those games that 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.820
 must be absolutely publicized 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.950
 unlike the usual garbage that 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.840

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.660
