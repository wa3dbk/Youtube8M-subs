00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.920 
balance I think the best example of
balance<00:01:06.720> prize<00:01:07.260> cards<00:01:08.150> are<00:01:09.150> probably<00:01:09.630> Christ

balance prize cards are probably Christ

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.100

cards<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.500> giant<00:01:11.430> hand<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.030> dark<00:01:12.930> end

cards like giant hand and dark end
dragon<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.680> think<00:01:14.159> at<00:01:14.280> their<00:01:14.430> time<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.000> during

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
dragon I think at their time and during

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.719 
dragon I think at their time and during
their<00:01:15.360> prime<00:01:15.600> both<00:01:16.049> those<00:01:16.290> cards<00:01:16.799> not<00:01:17.580> only

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
their prime both those cards not only

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.270 
their prime both those cards not only
were<00:01:17.880> those<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.930> know<00:01:19.020> good<00:01:19.680> times<00:01:20.040> in

formats<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.330> general<00:01:24.750> they<00:01:25.049> were<00:01:25.110> formats

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
formats but in general they were formats

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.450 
formats but in general they were formats
where<00:01:25.860> players<00:01:26.610> could<00:01:26.880> both<00:01:27.119> use<00:01:27.299> those<00:01:27.750> cards

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
where players could both use those cards

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
where players could both use those cards
which<00:01:29.460> made<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> cards<00:01:30.030> retain<00:01:30.329> value<00:01:30.570> but

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
which made the cards retain value but

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
which made the cards retain value but
across<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> board<00:01:32.400> they<00:01:32.610> were<00:01:32.670> also<00:01:33.030> just

ideally<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.250> don't<00:03:50.489> think<00:03:50.670> this<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.299> very

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
ideally I don't think this is a very

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.060 
ideally I don't think this is a very
good<00:03:51.570> price<00:03:51.870> card<00:03:52.170> i<00:03:52.320> mean<00:03:52.470> i<00:03:52.500> wouldn't<00:03:52.920> say

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
good price card i mean i wouldn't say

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.100 
good price card i mean i wouldn't say
obviously<00:03:53.340> it's<00:03:53.610> not<00:03:53.640> broken<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.989> it's

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
obviously it's not broken and it's

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.380 
obviously it's not broken and it's
balanced<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.769> speak<00:03:56.040> but<00:03:56.370> it's<00:03:57.090> not<00:03:57.239> really

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
balanced so to speak but it's not really

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.180 
balanced so to speak but it's not really
relevant<00:03:57.810> competitively<00:03:58.709> i<00:03:58.739> don't<00:03:58.980> think

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
relevant competitively i don't think

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.350 
relevant competitively i don't think
anybody's<00:03:59.549> really<00:03:59.610> gonna<00:03:59.790> be<00:03:59.910> running<00:04:00.180> it<00:04:00.269> to

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
anybody's really gonna be running it to

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.030 
anybody's really gonna be running it to
give<00:04:00.480> them<00:04:00.630> any<00:04:00.989> sort<00:04:01.230> of<00:04:01.320> quote-unquote<00:04:01.830> edge

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
give them any sort of quote-unquote edge

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.699 
give them any sort of quote-unquote edge
in<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.580> future<00:04:02.850> that<00:04:03.000> gets<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.380> it's<00:04:04.380> just<00:04:04.590> one

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
in the future that gets it it's just one

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.140 
in the future that gets it it's just one
of<00:04:04.739> those<00:04:04.830> it's<00:04:05.130> kind<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.370> like<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.549> decimals<00:04:06.060> to

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
of those it's kind of like a decimals to

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.699 
of those it's kind of like a decimals to
go<00:04:06.530> Dark<00:04:07.530> Lord<00:04:08.900> ascension<00:04:09.900> sky<00:04:10.110> dragon<00:04:10.590> I

go Dark Lord ascension sky dragon I

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.170 
go Dark Lord ascension sky dragon I
think<00:04:10.890> ascension<00:04:11.280> sky<00:04:11.459> dragon<00:04:11.850> was<00:04:11.970> even

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
think ascension sky dragon was even

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.250 
think ascension sky dragon was even
better<00:04:12.299> than<00:04:12.450> um<00:04:13.790> then<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:14.970> card

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
better than um then this card

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.150 
better than um then this card
particularly<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.290> mean<00:04:16.410> I've<00:04:16.620> seen<00:04:16.769> like<00:04:16.950> yang

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160

Zing's<00:04:17.459> make<00:04:17.729> ascension<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.780> mean<00:04:19.109> it's<00:04:19.229> a<00:04:19.290> cool

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
Zing's make ascension I mean it's a cool

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.409 
Zing's make ascension I mean it's a cool

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.480 
play
that<00:04:22.140> were<00:04:23.140> running<00:04:23.530> instead<00:04:23.890> of<00:04:24.100> running<00:04:24.340> Leo

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
that were running instead of running Leo

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.770 
that were running instead of running Leo
were<00:04:24.700> running<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.120> is<00:04:25.270> there<00:04:25.420> tend<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.660> make

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
were running that is there tend to make

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.380 
were running that is there tend to make
decisive<00:04:26.080> armor<00:04:26.530> so<00:04:27.190> yeah<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:28.000> think<00:04:28.060> of<00:04:28.360> a

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
decisive armor so yeah I think of a

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.910 
decisive armor so yeah I think of a
nervous<00:04:28.720> isn't<00:04:29.140> that<00:04:29.170> great<00:04:29.260> across<00:04:29.740> the

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920

MSTS<00:05:55.960> and<00:05:56.320> I<00:05:57.010> believe<00:05:57.400> probably<00:05:57.670> like<00:05:57.760> a

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
MSTS and I believe probably like a

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.890 
MSTS and I believe probably like a
mirror<00:05:58.060> force<00:05:58.240> or<00:05:58.390> something<00:05:58.660> out<00:05:58.750> of<00:05:58.780> the

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
mirror force or something out of the

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.840 
mirror force or something out of the
main<00:05:59.050> deck<00:05:59.260> and<00:06:00.070> just<00:06:00.220> move<00:06:00.340> dennis<00:06:00.640> he's

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
main deck and just move dennis he's

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.580 
main deck and just move dennis he's
obviously<00:06:01.090> to<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.390> side<00:06:01.600> so<00:06:01.990> there's

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
obviously to the side so there's

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.750 
obviously to the side so there's
definitely<00:06:02.680> sposed<00:06:03.040> to<00:06:03.100> be<00:06:03.130> three<00:06:03.310> rotors<00:06:03.520> and

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760
