00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
as an HID once they get them everything

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.230 
as an HID once they get them everything
mounted<00:03:56.650> back<00:03:57.010> in<00:03:57.250> will<00:03:57.430> pull<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.730> outside<00:03:57.850> and

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
mounted back in will pull it outside and

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.810 
mounted back in will pull it outside and
see<00:03:58.360> how<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.600> looks
