00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.500
 next to the casa zander q5 is still there 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.730
 the x series also curiosity on the 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.889
 market comes to germany 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.939
 we have the top device of this xi 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.349
 that's the total rubik's 5.5 that has 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.790
 I already disassembled grandma 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.669
 to show that I am special 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.619
 All of the smartphones on as viz 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.029
 a dual sim function as you can see 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.290
 we also have the normal - in 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.029
 format you may know that too 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.980
 even from earlier is not a micro-sim 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.850
 necessary to have your old map 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.280
 do not exchange 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.449
 Here is also the slot for the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.219
 memory card here 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.760
 This device can be a memory card of 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.199
 hold up to 32 gigabytes whatever 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.489
 Another nice thing is that I can 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.649
 always show briefly is a so-called 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.620
 flip case that will be synonymous with this device 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.140
 how else do I have that slowly trooper 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.910
 Also turned on five times 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.280
 which of course with this device here 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.949
 the price of this is especially good 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.420
 that is only 169 euro I 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.190
 think discretely above all about the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.810
 free trade we have distributed here 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.000
 but only a dual core processor 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.340
 on board a clocking of 1 2 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.840
 gigahertz has as operating system can 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.229
 I show it here too 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.710
 of course again android in the version 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.479
 where is it down here 4.2.1 set that 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.780
 update to 4.3 resp 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.759
 4.4 according to the manufacturer also relatively 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.520
 soon follow because we are here a pure 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.939
 Android system reporter as said by 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.850
 We are here at 169 Europe 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.799
 including rubik's 5.5 then we still have 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.469
 three other x series devices the in 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.009
 Germany is coming to the market 1 with 4 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:46.310
 inch diagonal is cost 109 1 with 4 5 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.070
 inch diagonal costs 139 euro and then 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.740
 we still have a 5 inch device 179 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.270
 to the technical specifications of the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.829
 kasan troubadix 5.5 we have one here 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.859
 So an RAM of 512 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.780
 megabyte as I already said 1 2 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.979
 gigahertz dualcore processor that is 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.039
 So you are here in any case 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.740
 located below the q series the at 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.270
 Core processor has the internal memory 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.890
 is again only four gigabytes 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.960
 can via micro sd card over straight 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.660
 have expanded up to 32 gb 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.010
 become 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.230
 we have a camera on board this 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.240
 camera has five megapixels in the 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.700
 resolution there we come one more 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.370
 camera with 0 3 megapixels so 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.590
 VGA quality for video chats or for 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.900
 we are self of a display resolution 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.790
 here again as equipped as well 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.930
 already at kasan is different 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.200
 So 4.5 is really difficult with 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.610
 them 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.500
 they took their first time to all 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.070
 note we have a resolution of 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.620
 854 x 480 pixeln the battery the 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.360
 has taken out one agrarian 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.500
 capacity of 2005 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.900
 the amp hours at these devices 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.570
 So it should take a long time 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.940
 the term is also indicated with 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.380
 seven hours of speaking time and up to 400 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.380
 hours in the standby
