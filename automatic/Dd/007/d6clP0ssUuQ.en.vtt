00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
VW Meet 2007 at Eibach Germany

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.260
... not ready yet.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.970
Needs to be cleaned first!

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180
Slowly, slowly  ...

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.960
We've built both vehicles together.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.820
First we developed his, the airbrush is by me ...

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.310
And when we were done with that one, we started on mine.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.480
We don't talk about the money we've spent.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.830
It's just in there, if you know the stuff, you can see it ...

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.350
I did almost everything myself.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.900
I.e. extensions, the leather; I wrote "pink panther" with Rhinestones ...

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.930
What I'm really proud of are my gull-wing doors

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.880
and my car audio with 4,700 watts.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.470
That's a Seat Arosa.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.140
We modified it within the last 1 1/2 years, there is almost nothing "stock" any more,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.360
It's got original VW Lupo gull-wing doors, the trunk is extended and got two subwoofers,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.620
which deliver over 140 dB, it did quite good at the test.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.630
The interior is done with Alcantara, there are lots of Swarovski stones everywhere,

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.080
it's got a body kit, a thread gear, a sport exhaust pipe,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.770
sweet little 16" wheels ...
It's my baby.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.180
I have it for about 4 years now.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.410
Completely modified it myself.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.380
All manual labor.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.410
Everything modified by myself, no stock parts, everything custom-made.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.450
I always wanted a car that stands out of the crowd.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.850
Till the car was the way it is now I worked on it for ten years.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.630
Airbrushing alone took half a year.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.000
And probably there aren't many people who put all their money into a car ...

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.390
Bye!
And till next year, I guess.
