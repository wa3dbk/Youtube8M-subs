00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:22.210
 Speak there, the speaker is the 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.610
 invictus and I'm here today with love of 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.490
 Ana but it's not to say anything and 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.560
 specifically in the modern 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.370
 various types of squirrels still in the 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.510
 we have here, for example, the speeches 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:39.160
 also some chimpanzees as per 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:43.059
 example the morgana even the jana karma and 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.949
 yes they have shields they are skills they 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.940
 can use both however themselves 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.710
 as in allies darker it goes 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.769
 as its name says it will absorb and 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.140
 there is a certain amount of damage 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.960
 depending on the level of skill you can 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.170
 be caused by the champion you 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.619
 played poorly does not have any some themes that 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.690
 have some shields is differentiated 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.630
 so for example he said he will give the 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.610
 chosen for the album love of Ana beyond 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.460
 to give the dark that absorbs by doing 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.220
 magical she'll leave it too, man. 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.410
 that you have an immune shield found 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.960
 then you're not feel a thomas 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.100
 harlan teaching took gave in the fucking 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.300
 none 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.940
 when the task is also dark 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.980
 it is very useful since the last 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.320
 it is activated in the dark of the house 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.920
 for example it causes an area damage 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.280
 free 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:44.070
 if I was there there's a has a deal 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.480
 interesting about this business shields 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.780
 which is a configuration that has in that 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:55.570
 neighborhood that is called a self cast is the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.800
 self cast that you will spend on you 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.050
 same 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.200
 I put here more cash knee forms 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:07.240
 Morgana was dark to show for 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.920
 you 're is the normal disk differences of 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.989
 band as you press the e 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.360
 skill right appears here 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.370
 the target picker and goes 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.739
 select yourself an ally in 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.900
 enemy case you can not 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.870
 select yourself explained 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.670
 the magic shield activated there will last 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.420
 that time is counted down 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.379
 disappeared you can also use smart cast 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:36.599
 There you go, put the smart cast. 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:39.549
 Beauty you will need to use that 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.269
 by the media there for this zone the first 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:45.189
 Corinthians pressed with this 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.079
 aim is to direct the mouse 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:50.260
 I met on earth while 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.120
 enabled to listen I do not recommend 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.290
 use enamel cast 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.470
 the ideal is the one who finds it normal even 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.379
 primordial use that everyone uses more 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.709
 have a and self test is what is c'est si 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.870
 even and listen and become much more agile 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.239
 for example in the time of martin parfait 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.980
 that you have to choose yourself and not 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.629
 an ally of yours 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.609
 You can save your life and the accordion 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.609
 self kate does not need to be configured in the 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.220
 You've come this way is is in 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.310
 active is dealing here with a mobile 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.010
 with the blush 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.900
 you need a marginal defense that 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.359
 you do you can press alt and 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.019
 same dark time so wanted when it goes 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.019
 stay active there 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.540
 the shield stays active there from you 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.070
 just as if you had 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.510
 tired in the normal way 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.020
 The difference is that you will have a 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.060
 several seconds you go 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.870
 hold the altiplano your keyboard high 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.220
 left and will press Iran can see 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.230
 like me but he's up here not 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.470
 You're on top of the morgana I need with you. 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.850
 layout, I pressed the 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.150
 debut of a shield upon me 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.130
 same range and minimum possible 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.530
 this is a keyboard shortcut it does not 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.320
 Needs even mouse assistance may be 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.350
 a concert at the fucking house there and goes 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.730
 be captured by you and the same way 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.310
 I hope it has been useful to you. 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.870
 this is what you can use there is so much in 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.970
 dark of the canon morgana and how 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.790
 difficulty that I can not remember 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.500
 attack is dark of load as well. 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.240
 I'm not mistaken and also generally 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:38.140
 dark in the if we wish in wc andrezinho and 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.390
 from morgana you can use it there 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:44.150
 they will all come out this way is the 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.950
 next video hope it will be soon 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.450
 and if you liked the video did not 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.350
 Let me stay, I liked it underneath.
