high<00:01:06.880> levels<00:01:06.909> of<00:01:07.360> HCG<00:01:08.189> therefore<00:01:09.189> when<00:01:09.340> taking

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
high levels of HCG therefore when taking

high levels of HCG therefore when taking
a<00:01:09.900> homeopathic<00:01:10.900> HCG<00:01:11.310> 5,000<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:12.880> may<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:14.380> hot

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
day now just put that in perspective I

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.800 
day now just put that in perspective I
usually<00:01:35.950> consume<00:01:36.400> about<00:01:36.549> 3,000<00:01:37.420> calories<00:01:37.570> a

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.870 
usually consume about 3,000 calories a

HCG HCG diet has been around in since
the<00:02:19.930> 50s<00:02:20.349> a<00:02:20.560> guy<00:02:21.069> named<00:02:21.400> dr.<00:02:21.730> Albert's<00:02:22.120> simians

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
the 50s a guy named dr. Albert's simians

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.170 
the 50s a guy named dr. Albert's simians
he<00:02:22.989> was<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.140> doctor<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.830> he<00:02:24.400> did<00:02:24.610> some<00:02:24.849> studies

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
he was a doctor and he did some studies

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.809 
he was a doctor and he did some studies
in<00:02:25.300> Africa<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:27.160> it's<00:02:27.310> been<00:02:27.459> around<00:02:27.610> for<00:02:27.790> a

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
in Africa and so it's been around for a

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.220 
in Africa and so it's been around for a
while<00:02:27.879> I<00:02:28.300> don't<00:02:28.540> want<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.750> go<00:02:28.870> into<00:02:29.050> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
while I don't want to go into the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.960 
while I don't want to go into the
aspects<00:02:29.800> of<00:02:29.860> what<00:02:30.010> he<00:02:30.160> did<00:02:30.310> but<00:02:30.489> my<00:02:30.580> point<00:02:30.849> is

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
aspects of what he did but my point is

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.270 
aspects of what he did but my point is
if<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.750> really<00:02:31.930> was<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.200> miracle<00:02:32.500> method<00:02:32.830> it's

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
if it really was a miracle method it's

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.000 
if it really was a miracle method it's
been<00:02:33.700> over<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.000> half<00:02:34.209> century<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:35.500> know<00:02:35.620> nobody

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
been over a half century you know nobody

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.259 
been over a half century you know nobody
would<00:02:36.160> be<00:02:36.280> obese<00:02:36.519> by<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.879> point<00:02:37.060> if<00:02:37.180> it

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
would be obese by this point if it

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.880 
would be obese by this point if it
really<00:02:37.420> was<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.660> miracle<00:02:37.959> method<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.590> don't

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
really was a miracle method so you don't

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.740 
really was a miracle method so you don't
put<00:02:39.160> don't<00:02:39.489> put<00:02:39.640> on<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.790> pedestal<00:02:40.060> as<00:02:40.420> much<00:02:40.599> as

put don't put on a pedestal as much as

put don't put on a pedestal as much as

the third point I want to make to use
the<00:03:08.349> research<00:03:08.680> has<00:03:08.829> shown<00:03:08.980> that<00:03:09.010> HCG<00:03:09.579> itself

the research has shown that HCG itself

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.449 
the research has shown that HCG itself
does<00:03:10.780> not<00:03:10.810> result<00:03:11.379> in<00:03:11.530> weight<00:03:11.709> loss<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.160> fact

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
does not result in weight loss in fact

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.880 
does not result in weight loss in fact
what<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.940> lot<00:03:13.209> of<00:03:13.329> times<00:03:13.480> what<00:03:13.720> it'll<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.290> claims

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
what a lot of times what it'll it claims

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.970 
what a lot of times what it'll it claims
to<00:03:15.040> do<00:03:15.220> is<00:03:15.690> decrease<00:03:16.690> or<00:03:17.290> suppress<00:03:17.799> an

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
to do is decrease or suppress an

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.770 
to do is decrease or suppress an
appetite<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.670> therefore<00:03:19.000> people<00:03:19.329> are<00:03:19.540> able

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.080 
appetite and therefore people are able
to<00:03:20.049> more<00:03:20.350> comfortably<00:03:20.920> maintain<00:03:21.819> the<00:03:21.970> low

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
to more comfortably maintain the low

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.090 
to more comfortably maintain the low
calorie<00:03:22.540> diet<00:03:22.569> but<00:03:23.139> the<00:03:23.380> fact<00:03:23.620> is<00:03:23.799> is<00:03:24.069> that

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
calorie diet but the fact is is that

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.379 
calorie diet but the fact is is that
when<00:03:24.280> you're<00:03:24.459> robbing<00:03:24.760> yourself<00:03:24.850> of<00:03:25.239> these

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
when you're robbing yourself of these

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:26.970 
when you're robbing yourself of these
macro<00:03:25.780> nutrients<00:03:26.350> such<00:03:26.470> as<00:03:26.530> carbohydrates

macro nutrients such as carbohydrates
and<00:03:27.579> fat<00:03:27.850> then<00:03:28.569> you're<00:03:29.230> really<00:03:29.410> doing<00:03:29.620> your

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
and fat then you're really doing your

and fat then you're really doing your

be put here I really wouldn't suggest
