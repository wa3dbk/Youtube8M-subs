00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
let me first say that I think kung fu

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.020 
let me first say that I think kung fu
panda<00:01:58.300> 2<00:01:58.630> was<00:01:59.110> as<00:01:59.320> good<00:01:59.650> as<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.070> first<00:02:00.310> one<00:02:00.520> so

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
panda 2 was as good as the first one so

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.550

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
like this one the animation itself is

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.050 
like this one the animation itself is
passable<00:02:05.680> but<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.160> visual<00:02:06.490> design<00:02:06.880> is

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060
