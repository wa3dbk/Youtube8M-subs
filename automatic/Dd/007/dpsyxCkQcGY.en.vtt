00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.819
 for fans of the japanese movie monster 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.340
 This game could be an epiphany 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.160
 be like butter instead of the 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.390
 dinosaur lizard through tokyo and pulls 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.390
 And a trail of devastation 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.160
 Often the godzilla is first seen moving in 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.990
 little déjà vu remember some 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.850
 venues to one or the other 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.490
 natural movie classic of course 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.170
 There are Japanese cities in those 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.690
 you know his destructive rage so much 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.730
 may live with the big monster 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.280
 we simulate skyscrapers with pranks 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.410
 Factory building or giant neon 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.910
 neon sign but also in rural 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.250
 the player is on the way 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.989
 behind the horizon at any time 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.989
 may another monster appears 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.400
 the player often experiences one too 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.500
 pleasing reunion with one 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.300
 well-known opponent of godzilla the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.730
 dive into the story campaign 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.810
 level by level surprising to a certain extent 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.810
 as a final opponent 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.020
 the hearts of the fans strike one 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.000
 purzelbaum as soon as the failed ones 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.360
 Names of the numerous monsters can be heard 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.040
 are 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.020
 there are, for example, next to godzilla 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.960
 so fedora qingli dorothea michael 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.610
 schiller and scott siller as download 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.649
 content you can even get the godzilla 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.380
 from the hollywood blockbuster of roland 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.759
 emmerich to buy and so far 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.920
 everything sounds, unfortunately, there is also one 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.690
 Hook because the godzilla video game is 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.720
 technically not up to date 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.340
 Often the graphic reminds 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.140
 console games from days gone by 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.729
 pity actually because with the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.350
 performance of the playstation 4 would have the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.660
 developers let it rip neatly 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.220
 can the fall destroyed 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.710
 skyscrapers always in the same 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.390
 animation together and also the view 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.640
 Unfortunately, the city is very busy 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.740
 limited to it could be the control 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.570
 is pretty much getting used to and 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.470
 that the gameplay does not last long 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.470
 can satisfy 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.900
 So we can have a little one 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.240
 Conclusion pull the coachella video game 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.860
 is clearly aimed at hardcore fans 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.540
 the monster movies but also 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.490
 Occasional gamers on light 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.580
 Maybe action could stand 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.280
 a few evenings may have fun with it 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.630
 but unfortunately do not expect so much 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.400
 let the criticism aside 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.770
 especially in the video game is one 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.180
 much fan service alone the cover of the 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.910
 Spiels reminds of the Japanese 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.000
 original movie poster of the first godzilla 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.010
 stripes from the 50s so is menu 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.660
 and start the game in an old film look 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.370
 and of course there are certain 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.710
 camera settings and especially the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.240
 Soundscape one to one from the 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.240
 taken from canvas model 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.810
 in the game can then different modes 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.300
 to get voted 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.040
 there would be the mode master of destruction 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.200
 basically the singleplayer campaign 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.970
 includes the levels are with one 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.100
 unfortunately trivial story 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.900
 but are interwoven with each other 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.450
 getting bigger and harder so one 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.100
 real challenge somehow later 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.080
 but it is simply not enough for the game 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.710
 more from any controller buttons 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.050
 to press 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.810
 who wants can the repertoire of movement 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.280
 learn his monster properly and 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.490
 to perfect it as well 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.540
 There are light heavy and rechargeable 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.520
 special attacks these are of course each 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.320
 after the somewhat cumbersome and 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.240
 therefore need the right timing 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.370
 Of course you can also do that in the mode 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.530
 King of the crew wave for wave against 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.420
 other monsters have to compete which one 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.530
 You can defeat this even in the future 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.210
 choose story mode 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.860
 There is also the possibility the 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.050
 to improve gigants like in one 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.910
 roleplay so the player wants all 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.410
 Unlock Monster and get the highest 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.830
 he has a lot to offer 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.540
 do 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.730
 Of course, there is also the versus mode 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.410
 as a multiplayer part in the game 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.820
 They can become professionals from all over 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.010
 world against each other 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.870
 who his various attacks one 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.970
 chosen monsters and mastered these 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.410
 even a perfect part can be in the fight 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.410
 have a lot of fun 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.530
 Nevertheless, the title would be easy 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.040
 can become more no no 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.970
 what is left is a game for fans and 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.830
 casual and entertaining 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.530
 uncomplicated but with many weaknesses 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.600
 in terms of graphics control and 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.760
 alternation but with a 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.570
 special presentation and the certain 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.190
 trash factor 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.500
 since the release of the game 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.080
 The title is often used in the game world 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.180
 torn and yes godzilla is unfortunately 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.070
 no top title but who cares 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.870
 Bock has the calm should my view 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.910
 risk and have your own opinion 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.890
 we make an eye shut and that 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.900
 whole with a smile is considered 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.400
 ever clear in the advantage over the 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.170
 Japanese movie classics are 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.030
 especially from today's point of view a bit 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.560
 amateurish and this style means 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.030
 the developers have that too 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.030
 newest godzilla game transfer
