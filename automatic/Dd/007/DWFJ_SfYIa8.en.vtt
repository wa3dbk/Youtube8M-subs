00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.599
 i because the oak was time filipe 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.789
 I did not say that, I'll keep 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.699
 Work nostalgia however that with 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.590
 access in 4 once again we know that 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.080
 this game is not so famous for easter 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.259
 eggs and focused in what place jokes 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.580
 type gt aziz 111 but it always has 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.259
 something interesting that is worth it 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.120
 show video here for you one 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.310
 of these things is a localized stress 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.070
 at this point just here in the coordinates 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.350
 a downhill diving point will have 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.330
 a ship broke in half largely 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.490
 approaching the captain's cabin . 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.760
 ship will come face to face with giants 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.420
 pentacle going on here my you 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.460
 to approach 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.560
 then that hydrophobic return to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.750
 the bell that commissioned and never arrived 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.120
 near this color of this place but finally the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.890
 it is because night power can only approach the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.810
 window to the right of the entrance and stay 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.790
 stopped there for a few seconds 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.339
 appear an alcoutim pectin that 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.500
 based on a giant squid coming out of the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.149
 ship do not ask me why hole 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.090
 She left in the front she meets 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:15.270
 with a whale and the squid's whore 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.450
 head and pulls the bottom of the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.219
 old fucking ocean scene happens thousand 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.929
 from afar but you can get a sense of the 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.859
 size of the elements that we are 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.140
 playing here 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.020
 this is a sperm whale and believe me 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 or not the English name to spaan or me 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.219
 that's what you heard and it 's easy to 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.999
 identifiable because of her singing is 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.999
 very cool 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.500
 putting images that show clear 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.090
 proportions ranging from one year to the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.220
 size of this whale is to have a 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.050
 notion of the size of the moon's 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.750
 people think now it's the size that 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.450
 obviously it is supernatural or not with 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.970
 biggest surprise effect, of course , if you want 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.860
 This fucking thing is today, it 's just a short one. 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.330
 even just to give the faces and that 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.100
 not think I died on the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.410
 which has supported the facebook today 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.120
 even black can be worried about the 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.740
 audio video indicates that 64 had 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.350
 spoiled and such because he had given a 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.210
 problem on tv and played on enem's head 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.550
 just to make it clear here was just 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.230
 My wife's angle and I'm happy. 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.450
 because it was not serious, I feel 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.400
 covered by being a problem with simple is 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.550
 a problem of TV resolution and I 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.730
 was using by two poorly pixel types 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.170
 in a sector of the video and the audio of the tv is 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.780
 when I send it to smaller tv 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.370
 was still damaged in the reported Gulf 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.290
 because the resolution was still the same 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.090
 just change the resolution of the smaller screen 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.590
 again and so everything was normal or 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.540
 it's nothing serious 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.910
 I'm not going to play on the sofa for now. 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.700
 Thank you very much, thank you. 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.700
 talked to the next and waits in analysis
