 to 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.639
 teaching a dog to walk with the court can be difficult and then 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.329
 you realize third parties 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:15.719
 problems can often occur if the puppy gets too excited if you don't have it 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.269
 started exercising as a child and because of the time it takes to 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.199
 make sure your bathrooms get wet 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.640
 spend a little more time now teaching your little dog a 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.640
 Good walking will save you a lot of time in the future 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.850
 even small dogs can pull a lot is to make a walk a nightmare 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.820
 decide which way you want your little dog to walk often 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.010
 it will be more convenient to hold the leash with your hand placed where yours is 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.580
 dog while with the nearest one you offer him a prize 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.260
 at the beginning he compliments it simply by beating you to you 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.020
 take a few steps the pregnant towel to have walked beside you 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.650
 remember to interact with your puppy while walking otherwise 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.650
 will find other things in which it interests as 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.910
 the ideal would be to see a loose leash without any tension 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.630
 if your puppy jumps to try to take the prize probably it 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.539
 you are asking too low 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.970
 so he thinks that jumping could have him 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.430
 it is best to keep in this - far away in your pocket or inside a baby carrier until you do 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.330
 the time has come to reward the dogs 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.140
 verbally complimented telling him good to show me that you are happy 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.830
 of his behavior 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.330
 first courses or just for taking a couple of steps next to you 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.560
 how much film do you measure - for walking up to hours 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.450
 if your little dog starts to pull, stop immediately 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.010
 come stay close enough to our fan 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.580
 don't give you melancholy 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.100
 attract his attention and make him come back 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.100
 your puppy has to learn that pulling does not offer 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.370
 while you are soliciting it is important to change direction often to maintain 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.210
 your puppy's attention to you 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.020
 start in the house of gerbino before walking on the streets - 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:15.479
 it will take a lot of practice and patience to teach your puppy to walk 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.189
 with a leash noticed that you have to walk with your dog all the 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.499
 days for the rest of his life is very important
