00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
on careful and then squeeze I'm sure

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.580 
on careful and then squeeze I'm sure
skis<00:02:07.030> are<00:02:07.180> really<00:02:07.420> tightly<00:02:07.630> so<00:02:07.960> that<00:02:07.990> shrinks

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
skis are really tightly so that shrinks

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.770 
skis are really tightly so that shrinks
now<00:02:09.550> you're<00:02:09.850> going<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.060> have<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.270> give<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.600> some
