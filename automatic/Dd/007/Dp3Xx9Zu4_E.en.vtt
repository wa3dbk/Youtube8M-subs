00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.929 
blocks and stuff so look if you saw me
doing<00:00:28.380> there<00:00:28.680> was<00:00:28.980> me<00:00:29.220> singing<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.670> really

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
doing there was me singing a really

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.290 
doing there was me singing a really
derpy<00:00:30.330> song<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.260> had<00:00:31.890> boots<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.940> made<00:00:33.149> me

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
derpy song and I had boots that made me

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.959 
derpy song and I had boots that made me
jump<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.380> bow<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:35.280> when<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.460> held<00:00:35.790> it

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
jump and a bow that when I held it

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.860 
jump and a bow that when I held it
zoomed<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.559> could<00:00:37.770> shoot<00:00:38.629> now<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:39.750> you're

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
zoomed in so I could shoot now if you're

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.020 
zoomed in so I could shoot now if you're
wondering<00:00:39.989> how<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.620> works<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.790> bunch<00:00:41.940> of

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
wondering how this works it's a bunch of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.910 
wondering how this works it's a bunch of
systems<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.540> command<00:00:42.840> blocks<00:00:43.050> over<00:00:43.290> there<00:00:43.469> but

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
systems of command blocks over there but

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.970 
systems of command blocks over there but
in<00:00:44.370> more<00:00:44.550> detail<00:00:45.410> usually<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.469> can't<00:00:46.710> jump<00:00:46.950> that

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
in more detail usually I can't jump that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.569 
in more detail usually I can't jump that
high<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.700> whenever<00:00:47.879> I'm<00:00:48.120> holding<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> boots

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
high but whenever I'm holding the boots

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
high but whenever I'm holding the boots
gives<00:00:50.579> me<00:00:50.700> jump<00:00:50.940> boost<00:00:51.440> repeatedly<00:00:52.440> gives<00:00:52.649> me

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
gives me jump boost repeatedly gives me

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.639 
gives me jump boost repeatedly gives me
jump<00:00:53.010> boost<00:00:53.690> um<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.050> takes<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.440> while

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
jump boost um it takes a little while

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.380 
jump boost um it takes a little while
for<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> wear<00:00:56.280> off<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.030> stops

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
for it to wear off and then it stops

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.170 
for it to wear off and then it stops
like<00:00:57.480> right<00:00:57.780> about<00:00:57.989> now<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> then<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:01.760> bow<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
like right about now so then this bow of

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.469 
like right about now so then this bow of
aiming<00:01:03.989> bow<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.379> aiming<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.979> jump<00:01:05.460> boots<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
aiming bow of aiming and jump boots the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.980 
aiming bow of aiming and jump boots the
bow<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.840> aiming<00:01:07.260> gives<00:01:07.920> me<00:01:08.189> slowness<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.420> level

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
bow of aiming gives me slowness to level

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.820 
bow of aiming gives me slowness to level
100<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.790> jims<00:01:12.060> me<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.780> lot<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:14.900> think<00:01:15.900> 127

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
100 so it jims me in a lot I think 127

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.469 
100 so it jims me in a lot I think 127
actually<00:01:17.130> flips<00:01:17.430> your<00:01:17.580> view<00:01:17.790> upside-down<00:01:18.150> but

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
actually flips your view upside-down but

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.480 
actually flips your view upside-down but
my<00:01:18.810> render<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.439> some<00:01:19.710> tiny<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> can't

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
my render this is some tiny so you can't

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.240 
my render this is some tiny so you can't
really<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:20.850> anything<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.360> amazing<00:01:22.130> but<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
really see anything so amazing but you

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.719 
really see anything so amazing but you
see<00:01:23.369> assumes<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.330> then<00:01:25.400> get<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
see assumes it in and then get out and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.609 
see assumes it in and then get out and
I'm<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.000> using<00:01:27.330> op<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.720> find<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.759> so

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
I'm not using op you find to do that so

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.749 
I'm not using op you find to do that so
now<00:01:31.619> I'll<00:01:32.100> show<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.490> how<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.090> built<00:01:33.540> so

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.640 

so<00:01:38.759> basically<00:01:39.180> how<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.509> works<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:40.170> let<00:01:40.560> me

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
so basically how this works is let me

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.130 
so basically how this works is let me
just<00:01:40.890> middle<00:01:41.610> click<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.210> these<00:01:42.390> blocks<00:01:42.689> here

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
just middle click all these blocks here

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.200 
just middle click all these blocks here
when<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.590> middle<00:01:43.799> click<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.100> block<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.729> think

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
when you middle click a block I think

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.330 
when you middle click a block I think
I've<00:01:45.329> told<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.869> last<00:01:46.170> last<00:01:46.799> episode

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
I've told you in this last last episode

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.270 
I've told you in this last last episode
it<00:01:48.090> gives<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:49.259> block<00:01:49.619> into<00:01:50.159> your

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
it gives you that block into your

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.760 
it gives you that block into your
inventory<00:01:50.689> um<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.119> how<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.869> works<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.500> there

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
inventory um so how this works is there

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.490 
inventory um so how this works is there
is<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.159> clock<00:01:56.909> right<00:01:57.180> here<00:01:57.240> which<00:01:57.719> repeatedly

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
is a clock right here which repeatedly

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.289 
is a clock right here which repeatedly
tests<00:01:59.460> for<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.299> enchantment<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:02.090> infinity<00:02:03.090> on

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
tests for the enchantment of infinity on

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.969 
tests for the enchantment of infinity on
the<00:02:03.659> bow<00:02:03.979> for<00:02:05.060> at<00:02:06.060> peace<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.659> basically<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.799> do

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
the bow for at peace so basically you do

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.420 
the bow for at peace so basically you do
your<00:02:08.220> enchantment<00:02:08.729> ID<00:02:08.879> right<00:02:09.239> here<00:02:10.160> 51<00:02:11.160> which

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
your enchantment ID right here 51 which

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.090 
your enchantment ID right here 51 which
is<00:02:11.580> infinity<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.360> then<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.379> put<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.560> 0

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
is infinity and then you put a 0

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.760 
is infinity and then you put a 0
after<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.580> test<00:02:14.850> for<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.450> now<00:02:15.900> I'll<00:02:16.410> get

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
after it to test for it so now I'll get

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.300 
after it to test for it so now I'll get
the<00:02:16.830> bow<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:19.110> whenever<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.500> do<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.070> see

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the bow and whenever I do that you see

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.230 
the bow and whenever I do that you see
that<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.610> turns<00:02:21.420> off<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.130> turns<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.580> once

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
that that turns off and it turns on once

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.870 
that that turns off and it turns on once
I'm<00:02:24.480> not<00:02:24.510> holding<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.050> bow<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.860> that's<00:02:26.730> how

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
I'm not holding the bow so that's how

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.590 
I'm not holding the bow so that's how
that<00:02:26.940> works

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
that works

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.720 
that works
now<00:02:28.170> basically<00:02:28.380> what's<00:02:28.770> happening<00:02:29.160> here<00:02:29.580> is

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
now basically what's happening here is

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.050 
now basically what's happening here is
this<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:30.810> all<00:02:31.170> thing<00:02:31.710> turning<00:02:32.250> when<00:02:32.670> that

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
this is just all thing turning when that

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.670 
this is just all thing turning when that
goes<00:02:33.270> on<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.660> turns<00:02:33.870> off<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.290> which<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.650> a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
goes on it turns off this which is a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.400 
goes on it turns off this which is a
hopper<00:02:34.920> clock<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.550> if<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.730> smash<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.410> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
hopper clock so if I smash this the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.110 
hopper clock so if I smash this the
hopper<00:02:37.740> clock<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.130> gonna<00:02:38.280> keep<00:02:38.490> going<00:02:38.550> and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
hopper clock is gonna keep going and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.260 
hopper clock is gonna keep going and
it's<00:02:39.270> going<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.690> give<00:02:39.870> me<00:02:40.580> slowness<00:02:41.580> because

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
it's going to give me slowness because

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.830 
it's going to give me slowness because
the<00:02:42.930> hopper<00:02:43.140> clock<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.880> keeping<00:02:44.880> keep<00:02:45.450> going

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
the hopper clock is keeping keep going

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.800 
the hopper clock is keeping keep going
so<00:02:46.430> if<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.670> put<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> torch<00:02:48.120> back<00:02:48.330> there<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.690> will

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
so if I put a torch back there it will

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.440 
so if I put a torch back there it will
stop<00:02:49.340> because<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.490> locks<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.910> item<00:02:51.210> in<00:02:51.300> one

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
stop because it locks the item in one

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.090 
stop because it locks the item in one
place<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.930> when<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.080> item<00:02:52.470> goes<00:02:52.680> into<00:02:52.980> this

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
place and when the item goes into this

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.660 
place and when the item goes into this
hopper

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
hopper

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.170 
hopper
it<00:02:54.030> likes<00:02:54.300> this<00:02:54.420> comparator<00:02:54.990> which<00:02:55.380> turns<00:02:55.710> out

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
it likes this comparator which turns out

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.360 
it likes this comparator which turns out
now<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:58.230> can<00:02:58.380> pretty<00:02:58.530> much<00:02:58.620> customize<00:02:58.980> this

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
now you can pretty much customize this

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.930 
now you can pretty much customize this
however<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.910> want<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:01.430> if<00:03:02.430> we<00:03:02.580> just<00:03:02.760> do

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
however you want so if we just do

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:14.720 
however you want so if we just do
something<00:03:12.770> always<00:03:13.770> made<00:03:14.130> sure<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:14.550> have

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
something always made sure that you have

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.730 
something always made sure that you have
repeaters<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.600> right<00:03:15.780> sections<00:03:18.500> do<00:03:19.500> that

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
repeaters in the right sections do that

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.170 
repeaters in the right sections do that
put<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.160> redstone<00:03:20.340> torch<00:03:20.490> here<00:03:20.850> that's<00:03:21.060> a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
put a redstone torch here that's a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.350 
put a redstone torch here that's a
simple<00:03:21.480> clock<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:22.220> gave<00:03:23.220> all<00:03:23.430> credit<00:03:23.970> for<00:03:24.210> this

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
simple clock I gave all credit for this

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.960 
simple clock I gave all credit for this
little<00:03:24.540> cocky<00:03:25.170> thing<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:27.840> stuff<00:03:28.170> 2d<00:03:29.160> tv9

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
little cocky thing and that stuff 2d tv9

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.880 
little cocky thing and that stuff 2d tv9
he's<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.450> great<00:03:30.900> red<00:03:31.170> stoner<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.710> should

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
he's a great red stoner you should

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.200 
he's a great red stoner you should
definitely<00:03:32.460> check<00:03:32.490> out<00:03:32.820> his<00:03:33.000> channel<00:03:33.140> um<00:03:35.210> so

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
definitely check out his channel um so

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.030 
definitely check out his channel um so
then<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.780> put<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.960> torch<00:03:37.200> here<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.860> can

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
then you put a torch here you can

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.950 
then you put a torch here you can
optionally<00:03:38.280> put<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.940> block<00:03:39.150> there<00:03:39.450> just<00:03:39.750> tree

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
optionally put the block there just tree

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.730 
optionally put the block there just tree
nice<00:03:40.110> looks<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.220> looks<00:03:41.430> kind<00:03:41.610> of<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:41.850> a

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
nice looks so it looks kind of like a

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.250 
nice looks so it looks kind of like a
circle<00:03:46.070> torch<00:03:47.070> there<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.550> red<00:03:47.790> soon<00:03:48.030> there<00:03:48.810> so

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
circle torch there and red soon there so

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
circle torch there and red soon there so
that<00:03:49.500> torches<00:03:49.950> off<00:03:53.450> oh<00:03:54.450> yes<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.770> need<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:55.980> put

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
that torches off oh yes you need to put

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.090 
that torches off oh yes you need to put
the<00:03:56.430> intent<00:03:56.820> thing<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.210> here<00:03:57.390> first<00:03:57.630> slice

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
the intent thing in here first slice

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.810 
the intent thing in here first slice
enchants<00:03:59.100> oh<00:04:00.200> let's<00:04:01.200> do<00:04:02.870> can't<00:04:04.490> pull<00:04:05.490> up<00:04:05.640> the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
enchants oh let's do can't pull up the

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.430 
enchants oh let's do can't pull up the
enchantment<00:04:06.450> list<00:04:07.400> number<00:04:08.400> one<00:04:08.430> that's<00:04:09.440> never

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
enchantment list number one that's never

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.470 
enchantment list number one that's never
mind<00:04:10.620> but<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:11.250> can<00:04:11.400> do<00:04:11.580> in<00:04:11.820> chance<00:04:12.120> then<00:04:12.450> you

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
mind but you can do in chance then you

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:21.050 
mind but you can do in chance then you
insert<00:04:13.310> insert<00:04:14.600> potion<00:04:15.799> ID<00:04:16.880> here<00:04:19.160> zero<00:04:20.160> so<00:04:21.000> I

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
insert insert potion ID here zero so I

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.390 
insert insert potion ID here zero so I
already<00:04:21.390> showed<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:21.840> insert<00:04:22.530> in<00:04:22.860> stir

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
already showed you insert in stir

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.730 
already showed you insert in stir
instead<00:04:24.120> but<00:04:24.780> anyways<00:04:25.110> then<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.440> put<00:04:25.620> your

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
instead but anyways then you put your

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.940 
instead but anyways then you put your
hoppers<00:04:26.250> right<00:04:26.550> here

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
hoppers right here

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.590 
hoppers right here
now<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.010> item<00:04:29.370> will<00:04:29.850> be<00:04:29.880> going<00:04:30.360> back<00:04:30.570> and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
now the item will be going back and

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.090 
now the item will be going back and
forth<00:04:30.840> in<00:04:31.380> this<00:04:31.680> one<00:04:31.980> because<00:04:32.670> um<00:04:33.710> see<00:04:34.710> because

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
forth in this one because um see because

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.159 
forth in this one because um see because
the<00:04:35.250> torch<00:04:35.490> is<00:04:35.639> not<00:04:35.790> on<00:04:36.440> this<00:04:38.389> so<00:04:39.389> normally

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
the torch is not on this so normally

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.520 
the torch is not on this so normally
this<00:04:40.290> would<00:04:40.470> be<00:04:40.590> on<00:04:41.570> when<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.720> has<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.080> real

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
this would be on when it has the real

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.740 
this would be on when it has the real
enchant<00:04:43.980> command<00:04:44.310> in<00:04:44.460> there<00:04:44.639> I<00:04:44.820> say<00:04:45.300> you<00:04:45.570> can

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
enchant command in there I say you can

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.400 
enchant command in there I say you can
see<00:04:45.930> over<00:04:46.139> here<00:04:46.410> cuz<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:46.770> was<00:04:46.889> on<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:48.410> then

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
see over here cuz that was on so then

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.100 
see over here cuz that was on so then
you<00:04:49.530> just<00:04:49.590> take<00:04:49.800> another<00:04:50.100> comparator<00:04:50.960> feed<00:04:51.960> it

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
you just take another comparator feed it

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.129 
you just take another comparator feed it
into<00:04:52.620> your<00:04:52.770> command<00:04:53.190> block<00:04:53.430> do<00:04:54.440> slash<00:04:55.440> effect

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
into your command block do slash effect

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:05.990 
into your command block do slash effect
insert<00:04:58.790> effect<00:05:00.080> ID<00:05:01.130> here<00:05:03.110> and<00:05:04.110> then<00:05:05.100> zero<00:05:05.700> I

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
insert effect ID here and then zero I

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.020 
insert effect ID here and then zero I
mean<00:05:06.450> zero<00:05:06.720> and<00:05:07.350> then<00:05:07.919> your<00:05:08.160> amount<00:05:08.400> so<00:05:08.730> let's

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
mean zero and then your amount so let's

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.940 
mean zero and then your amount so let's
just<00:05:09.210> do<00:05:09.330> that

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
just do that
