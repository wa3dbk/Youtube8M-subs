topic attacks Joey go
well<00:01:58.710> obviously<00:01:58.979> fire<00:01:59.759> is<00:02:00.000> very<00:02:00.270> powerful<00:02:00.600> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
well obviously fire is very powerful you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.690 
well obviously fire is very powerful you
know<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.079> they<00:02:01.170> say<00:02:01.380> Kat<00:02:01.619> don't<00:02:02.340> play<00:02:02.579> with

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
know what they say Kat don't play with

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.240 
know what they say Kat don't play with
fire<00:02:02.850> or<00:02:03.090> else<00:02:03.210> you'll<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:03.479> burned<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.250> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
fire or else you'll get burned and the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
fire or else you'll get burned and the
only<00:02:05.430> way<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.149> put<00:02:06.360> out<00:02:06.390> fire<00:02:06.750> is

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
only way that you can put out fire is

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.300 
only way that you can put out fire is
with<00:02:07.110> water<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.530> that's<00:02:07.619> what<00:02:07.799> squirtle<00:02:08.160> has

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
with water and that's what squirtle has

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.150 
with water and that's what squirtle has
the<00:02:08.550> squirtle<00:02:08.819> wins<00:02:09.090> every<00:02:09.539> time<00:02:09.569> actually<00:02:10.160> if

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
the squirtle wins every time actually if

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.770 
the squirtle wins every time actually if
the<00:02:11.340> fire<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.580> hot<00:02:11.849> enough<00:02:12.090> which<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.420> usually

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the fire is hot enough which it usually

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.250 
the fire is hot enough which it usually
is

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.860 
is
can<00:02:13.349> evaporate<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.010> water<00:02:14.040> real<00:02:14.549> fast<00:02:14.870> nice

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
can evaporate the water real fast nice

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.580 
can evaporate the water real fast nice
very<00:02:16.170> okay

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
very okay

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.610 
very okay
fire<00:02:16.920> does<00:02:17.250> not<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.640> extinguish<00:02:18.540> water<00:02:19.170> by

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
fire does not like extinguish water by

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.990 
fire does not like extinguish water by
evaporating<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.370> quickly<00:02:20.579> if<00:02:20.790> no<00:02:20.879> it

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
evaporating it that quickly if no it

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.640 
evaporating it that quickly if no it
does<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.360> was<00:02:21.540> really<00:02:21.930> hot<00:02:22.110> I'll<00:02:22.319> just<00:02:22.439> try<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
does it was really hot I'll just try to

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.440 
does it was really hot I'll just try to
write<00:02:22.799> you<00:02:23.159> don't<00:02:23.400> even<00:02:23.640> what<00:02:23.879> do<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.299> even

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
science deal obviously well I don't

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.490 
science deal obviously well I don't
think<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.209> do<00:02:30.360> because<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.049> doesn't<00:02:31.290> matter

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
think you do because it doesn't matter

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.430 
think you do because it doesn't matter
