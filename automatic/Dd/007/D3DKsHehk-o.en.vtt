 with about 1868 players at least minimum 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.780
 at least, of course, have the test in 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.190
 taken and taken in the detail 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.290
 Germany too was pretty 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.730
 good luck will be in the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.050
 areas like at the 16 17 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.860
 who is at the top of the 2 korea as 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.690
 hard to stop 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.920
 six koreans have it in total 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.710
 finale made the world community 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.969
 for starcraft ii konfessions and game 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.800
 that game after pretty interesting 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.239
 so far every tournament has been held on the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.620
 they have also won 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.690
 There has never been that anywhere 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.729
 I've lost, I think 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.210
 now I'm heading semi-final 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.180
 born 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.380
 the last day on 9 and there you can 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.690
 also accessible if with gaming 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.400
 series will continue and then we would be 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.630
 even with the topic number three and 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.229
 last topic you want to say i have 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.900
 nearly nothing 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.930
 and in contrast to the mode , she gave it a turn 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.200
 Roger moment where there are new modes active 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.350
 are 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.970
 Although it could be offensive in the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.100
 one against one and two went two 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.470
 sector has currently been expanded 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.080
 Both versions now have awb maps 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.549
 to be available to websites and 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.680
 that's why there is also I believe today 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.170
 the day after tomorrow it is because they are exactly 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.900
 also again 100% xp boost just countess 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.450
 fans is in the new modes, yes 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.740
 said I'm already done again 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.140
 Actually, I do not do it that short 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.030
 but there was nothing said yes 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.530
 that's why, for example , I can 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.880
 again only for attention then 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.470
 even if she was still relatively short 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.790
 we are from the next update again 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.650
 maybe it is me again in detail 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.760
 I have no idea and then I am like that 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.650
 far out between the rest 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.880
 nice friday and a beautiful one 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.640
 start the weekend 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.320
 because they celebrate degree celebrate the past 30 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.390
 I'm sure you have too much today 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.800
 yes, if it's back in the open air 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.750
 without coming, wish you 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.950

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.780
