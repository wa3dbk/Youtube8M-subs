 HOW TO IRON MAN END 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.710
 - Impressive. 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.450
 You've improved your armor. 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.030
 I also made a few gadgets. 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.230
 Are you serious about the take-off speed? 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.100
 -Wau ... 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.530
 It takes a while. 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.200
 -Hmm ... 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.930
 But I'll catch you. 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.570
 -Certainly? 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.770
 Have you ever flown in it? 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.910
 - Not completely. 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.130
 But I can assure you that he is in every respect 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.950
 far better. 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.090
 - Well, when you say it's better than mine, 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.050
 so he will certainly not mind the anti-tank missile. 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.500
 - Boy, watch. The suit is new. 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.000
 So you just killed him? 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.690
 -Oh yeah. It would be stupid if Pepper should do it for me. 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.400
 So I decided to take that fame. 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.620
 -That's quite arrogant and considerate. 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.340
 -But anyway. You just killed him. 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.660
 That's pretty dark. 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.740
 You've known this man for almost a lifetime. 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.300
 - He tried to kill me. Twice. 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.100
 And you haven't learned that when you put superchunters in jail 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.100
 he devises a plan of revenge and takes a god. 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.380
 - Yeah ... that doesn't happen. 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.220
 - So what happened after you killed him? 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.500
 Well, then I organized a press conference and told the world that 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.550
 I am Iron Man. 

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:17.477
 -What? -What? 

00:01:17.557 --> 00:01:19.557
 -Dude. -You can't just betray yours 

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:20.340
 hidden identity. 

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:22.000
 -Why not? Because I did it 

00:01:22.044 --> 00:01:23.800
 and I'm amazing. So... 

00:01:23.894 --> 00:01:25.594
 Hit the black. -You can't. 

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:26.900
 Well ... You shouldn't. 

00:01:27.034 --> 00:01:28.500
 - Yeah ... I like the attention. 

00:01:28.524 --> 00:01:31.424
 Are you telling me you never revealed your true identity? 

00:01:31.774 --> 00:01:32.500
 -Ehm ... no. 

00:01:33.294 --> 00:01:35.294
 - What about all the girls you went with? -What? 

00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:37.704
 -I'm Bruce Wayne. I like you. 

00:01:37.824 --> 00:01:39.100
 -You want to know my secret? 

00:01:39.214 --> 00:01:42.654
 - Just talk. Mr. Mindy Racer (?). 

00:01:42.744 --> 00:01:44.144
 -Ouu ... Don't even try. 

00:01:44.184 --> 00:01:46.084
 I'll freeze your face. 

00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:47.650
 - You're not freezing. 

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:50.400
 -You are right. I don't freeze. I like him. 

00:01:50.484 --> 00:01:52.050
 PlacÃ¡k. 

00:01:53.694 --> 00:01:56.294
 But do you know I could pay you off at any time? 

00:01:56.464 --> 00:01:58.464
 - Guys, guys. This is not a competition. 

00:01:58.614 --> 00:02:01.000
 Because, I think we all know who would win if it were. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.164
 -But please. -Of course. 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.950
 I. 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.100
 - I'm Batman. 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.190
 -Let's handle. Right Now. 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.540
 -Hey. Why never take me out with you?
