and it's called Jamaican bundle wave it

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.250 
and it's called Jamaican bundle wave it
is<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.060> pretty<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.260> 99<00:00:19.670> jada<00:00:20.670> color<00:00:21.260> and

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.000 
I think they offer this packaging to
kind<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.250> offset<00:00:32.899> with<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.140> higher<00:00:34.559> priced

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010

been<00:03:25.290> using<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.310> was<00:03:26.460> a<00:03:26.490> sample<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:28.610> ain't

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
been using and it was a sample I ain't

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.980 
been using and it was a sample I ain't
gonna<00:03:29.730> even<00:03:29.850> try<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.210> pronounce<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:30.930> know

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
gonna even try to pronounce it I know

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.640 
gonna even try to pronounce it I know
it's<00:03:31.320> Kylie<00:03:32.900> something<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.580> got<00:03:35.580> this<00:03:36.050> as<00:03:37.050> a

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
it's Kylie something I got this as a

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.670 
it's Kylie something I got this as a
sample<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.820> it's<00:03:39.030> supposed<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.450> be<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.870> a

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
sample and it's supposed to be a a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.700 
sample and it's supposed to be a a
detangler<00:03:41.580> but<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.150> say<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.780> stuff<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.470> eat

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
detangler but I say this stuff is eat

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.180 
detangler but I say this stuff is eat
y'all<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.910> really<00:03:45.240> really<00:03:45.660> good<00:03:46.020> it<00:03:46.980> made

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
y'all it is really really good it made

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.760 
y'all it is really really good it made
my<00:03:47.400> even<00:03:48.270> though<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.390> synthetic<00:03:48.960> hair<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.620> made

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
my even though a synthetic hair it made

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.170 
my even though a synthetic hair it made
it<00:03:49.920> really<00:03:50.190> really<00:03:50.580> soft<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:53.640> didn't<00:03:54.000> have

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
it really really soft and it didn't have

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.810 
it really really soft and it didn't have
a<00:03:54.210> build<00:03:54.660> up<00:03:54.960> to<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.010> think<00:03:56.160> that's<00:03:56.640> why

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
a build up to it so I think that's why

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.170 
a build up to it so I think that's why
the<00:03:56.880> curls<00:03:57.330> have<00:03:57.510> kind<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.900> being<00:03:58.110> defined<00:03:59.180> the

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
the curls have kind of being defined the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.330 
the curls have kind of being defined the
back<00:04:00.420> row<00:04:00.780> because<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.530> did<00:04:01.710> start<00:04:02.010> all<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.310> way

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
back row because I did start all the way

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.540 
back row because I did start all the way
at<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:03.570> nape<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.290> worked<00:04:04.500> up<00:04:04.740> the<00:04:05.310> back

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
at the nape and it worked up the back

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.690 
at the nape and it worked up the back
row<00:04:05.880> got<00:04:06.510> tangled<00:04:06.930> instantly<00:04:07.710> but<00:04:07.950> with

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
row got tangled instantly but with

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.240 
row got tangled instantly but with
synthetic<00:04:09.330> hair<00:04:09.360> you<00:04:09.690> almost<00:04:10.200> have<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.680> expect

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
synthetic hair you almost have to expect

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.720
