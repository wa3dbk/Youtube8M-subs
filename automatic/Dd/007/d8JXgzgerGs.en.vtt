traveling<00:00:12.570> as<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.809> but<00:00:12.990> not<00:00:13.200> for<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.620> gander<00:00:13.889> in

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
traveling as is but not for a gander in

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.519 
traveling as is but not for a gander in
and<00:00:15.240> actually<00:00:15.660> we're<00:00:15.780> gonna<00:00:15.870> be<00:00:16.020> looking<00:00:16.199> at

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
and actually we're gonna be looking at

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.400 
and actually we're gonna be looking at
the<00:00:16.890> knee<00:00:17.070> CND<00:00:17.609> faders<00:00:18.060> now<00:00:18.630> essentially<00:00:19.230> if

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the knee CND faders now essentially if

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.980 
the knee CND faders now essentially if
you're<00:00:19.529> shooting<00:00:19.890> video<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.670> lot<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.960> are

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
you're shooting video a lot you are

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.980 
you're shooting video a lot you are
familiar<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.890> term<00:00:23.180> known<00:00:24.180> as<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.660> ND

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
familiar with the term known as the ND

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.140 
familiar with the term known as the ND
filter<00:00:25.380> now<00:00:25.920> an<00:00:26.039> ND<00:00:26.340> filter<00:00:26.609> or<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> neutral

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
filter now an ND filter or a neutral

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.939 
filter now an ND filter or a neutral
density<00:00:27.359> filter<00:00:27.930> cuts<00:00:28.140> down<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> amount<00:00:28.740> of

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
density filter cuts down the amount of

density filter cuts down the amount of
light<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.310> reaches<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.910> sensor<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.859> they

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
light that reaches the sensor and they

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.260 
light that reaches the sensor and they
come<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.099> different<00:00:32.130> standard<00:00:32.820> strengths<00:00:33.149> as

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
come in different standard strengths as

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.030 
come in different standard strengths as
well<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:33.750> stop<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.290> stop<00:00:34.590> all<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> way<00:00:34.920> up

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
well so one stop to stop all the way up

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.650 
well so one stop to stop all the way up
to<00:00:35.160> ten<00:00:35.340> stop<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.730> beyond<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.210> the

filmmakers the neutral density filters
are<00:00:38.399> really<00:00:38.430> essential<00:00:39.050> photographers<00:00:40.050> also

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
are really essential photographers also

are really essential photographers also
like<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.950> use<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.370> lot<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.570> mostly

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
like to use it a lot but it's mostly

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.869 
like to use it a lot but it's mostly
used<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.320> videographers<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.309> use<00:00:44.489> ND

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
used for videographers and we use ND

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.700 
used for videographers and we use ND

for<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.660> you<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.780> also<00:01:00.930> find<00:01:01.230> yourself

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
for you you can also find yourself

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.320 
for you you can also find yourself

thanks to the nd fader or an ND filter

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.120 
thanks to the nd fader or an ND filter
which<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.729> fixed<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.930> also<00:01:13.140> allows<00:01:13.500> less

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
which is fixed that also allows less

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.100 
which is fixed that also allows less
light<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.549> hit<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.700> sensor<00:01:14.820> allowing<00:01:15.600> more

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
light to hit the sensor allowing more

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.160 
light to hit the sensor allowing more
quality<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.310> more<00:01:17.640> value<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> image<00:01:18.990> or

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.179 
the frame to be captured by the sensor
itself<00:01:21.030> now<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> nice<00:01:21.960> e<00:01:22.110> ND<00:01:22.470> filters<00:01:22.890> are

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
itself now the nice e ND filters are

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.160 
itself now the nice e ND filters are
faders<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:24.090> most<00:01:24.330> commonly<00:01:24.630> available<00:01:24.780> in

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
faders are most commonly available in

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.130 
faders are most commonly available in
India<00:01:25.439> they<00:01:25.619> start<00:01:26.180> from<00:01:27.180> 6000<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.869> going

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
India they start from 6000 and going

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.140 
India they start from 6000 and going
upwards<00:01:28.560> depending<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:29.310> size<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.820> have

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
upwards depending on what size you have

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.030 
upwards depending on what size you have
they're<00:01:31.140> made<00:01:31.290> out<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.680> nice<00:01:31.799> quality

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
they're made out of a nice quality

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.700 
they're made out of a nice quality
Japanese<00:01:32.790> materials<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> lens<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.500> made

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
Japanese materials so the lens is made

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.660 
Japanese materials so the lens is made
out<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.890> Japanese<00:01:35.460> material<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:37.740> has<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.369> fader

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
out of Japanese material it has a fader

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.120 
out of Japanese material it has a fader
density<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.509> fader<00:01:39.780> value<00:01:40.229> from<00:01:40.439> 2<00:01:40.680> all<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
density or a fader value from 2 all the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.190 
density or a fader value from 2 all the
way<00:01:41.159> up<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.460> 400<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:42.210> nice<00:01:42.509> because<00:01:42.869> you

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
way up to 400 that's nice because you

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.069 
way up to 400 that's nice because you
don't<00:01:43.320> need<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> change<00:01:43.829> your<00:01:44.130> filters<00:01:45.079> once

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
don't need to change your filters once

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.450 
don't need to change your filters once
you<00:01:46.200> are<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> middle<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.040> shoot<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.310> can

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you are in the middle of a shoot you can

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.670 
you are in the middle of a shoot you can
adjust<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.299> go<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:49.530> also

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
adjust it on the go it also

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.590 
adjust it on the go it also
automatically<00:01:50.189> locks<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.729> place<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.420> won't

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
automatically locks in place so it won't

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.889 
automatically locks in place so it won't
change<00:01:51.810> once<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.200> set<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:53.420> it's<00:01:54.420> easy<00:01:54.689> to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
change once you set it up it's easy to
