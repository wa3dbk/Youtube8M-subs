00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the whole package so I end up wasting a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.330 
the whole package so I end up wasting a
lot<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> found<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.899> way<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:41.040> keep

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.569 
lot but I found a way that you can keep
one<00:00:42.030> batch<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.780> green<00:00:43.350> onions<00:00:43.739> going<00:00:44.129> and

and guess what we can harvest them for a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.979 
and guess what we can harvest them for a
really<00:00:52.770> long<00:00:52.920> time<00:00:52.980> afterwards<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.570> let's<00:00:54.809> get
