gearbox or if he wears them a nest
easier<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.540> just<00:02:29.660> pull<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.140> open<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:31.430> dance

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
easier you just pull it open so dance

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.800 
easier you just pull it open so dance
