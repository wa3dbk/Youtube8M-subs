00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
they're like what's flux and I'm like

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.679 
they're like what's flux and I'm like
you<00:00:29.130> don't<00:00:29.340> know<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:29.580> fluxes<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.269> each<00:00:30.390> time

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
you don't know what fluxes and each time

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.759 
you don't know what fluxes and each time
it<00:00:30.869> blows<00:00:31.140> my<00:00:31.380> mind

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769

of<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.170> might<00:01:25.439> even<00:01:25.470> game<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> dark<00:01:26.640> which

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
of you might even game in the dark which

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.520 
of you might even game in the dark which
is<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.479> very<00:01:27.659> good<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:27.930> your<00:01:28.020> eyes<00:01:28.170> leaving

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
your monitor like that so essentially

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.719 
your monitor like that so essentially
what<00:01:30.960> happens<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.619> your<00:01:31.890> house<00:01:32.040> most<00:01:32.400> like

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
most house lighting like if you look at

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.870 
most house lighting like if you look at
my<00:01:34.229> lighting<00:01:34.560> right<00:01:34.710> now<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.040> quite<00:01:35.460> orange

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
my lighting right now is quite orange

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.249 
my lighting right now is quite orange
you<00:01:36.060> know<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.299> quite<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> vibrant<00:01:36.869> orange

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you know it's quite a vibrant orange

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
you know it's quite a vibrant orange
sort<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.829> hue<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.640> much<00:01:38.790> better<00:01:38.970> for

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
sort of hue and this is much better for

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.969 
sort of hue and this is much better for
your<00:01:39.299> eyes<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:40.320> much<00:01:40.439> warmer<00:01:40.650> much

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
more comfortable to be in and it also

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.690 
more comfortable to be in and it also
doesn't<00:01:43.439> sort<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.770> keep<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.040> awake<00:01:44.310> too<00:01:44.520> much

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
doesn't sort of keep you awake too much

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.429 
doesn't sort of keep you awake too much
like<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.149> sort<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.420> lighting<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.140> easier

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
like this sort of lighting it's easier

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.020 
like this sort of lighting it's easier
to<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> sleep<00:01:47.009> after<00:01:47.340> being<00:01:47.520> experiencing

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to get to sleep after being experiencing

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.069

this<00:01:48.119> sort<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.360> lighting<00:01:48.630> compared<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
this sort of lighting compared to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.289 
this sort of lighting compared to
looking<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> Sun<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.180> know

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
looking at the Sun and this is you know

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.030 
looking at the Sun and this is you know
kind<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.899> sciency<00:01:52.350> thing<00:01:52.590> I'm<00:01:52.710> not<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
kind of a sciency thing I'm not going to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.410 
kind of a sciency thing I'm not going to
go<00:01:53.130> too<00:01:53.189> much<00:01:53.369> into<00:01:53.670> jargon<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.149> stuff<00:01:54.299> like

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
go too much into jargon and stuff like

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.700 
go too much into jargon and stuff like
that<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.659> guys<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.110> your<00:01:55.140> research<00:01:55.560> if

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
that you guys can do your research if

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.929 
that you guys can do your research if
you<00:01:55.740> want<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.950> look<00:01:56.070> into<00:01:56.219> things<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.729> that

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
you want to look into things like that

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.090 
you want to look into things like that
but<00:01:57.360> basically<00:01:57.590> sunlight<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.829> sort<00:01:59.070> of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
but basically sunlight that sort of

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.940 
but basically sunlight that sort of
white<00:01:59.369> blue<00:01:59.640> light<00:01:59.909> keeps<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.420> awake<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.049> if

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
white blue light keeps you awake and if

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.289 
white blue light keeps you awake and if
you<00:02:02.159> find<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.790> trouble<00:02:03.240> getting

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
you find that you have trouble getting

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.510 
you find that you have trouble getting
to<00:02:03.509> sleep<00:02:03.540> after<00:02:04.140> using<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.530> computer<00:02:05.009> then

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
to sleep after using the computer then

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.160 
to sleep after using the computer then
it's<00:02:05.640> probably<00:02:06.090> because<00:02:06.450> your<00:02:06.750> monitor<00:02:07.079> is

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it's probably because your monitor is

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.040 
it's probably because your monitor is
basically<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.829> looking<00:02:08.160> at<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> Sun<00:02:08.580> and

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
basically like looking at the Sun and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.119 
basically like looking at the Sun and
that's<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> mess<00:02:10.410> with<00:02:10.530> your<00:02:10.679> body<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
that's going to mess with your body and

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.680 
that's going to mess with your body and
that<00:02:11.250> keeps<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.610> awake<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.239> causes<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.569> lot

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
that keeps you awake and it causes a lot

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.040 
that keeps you awake and it causes a lot
of<00:02:12.750> eye

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
of eye

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.170 
of eye
when<00:02:13.440> you're<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.710> warm<00:02:13.980> environment<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.970> warm

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
when you're in a warm environment a warm

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.610 
when you're in a warm environment a warm
lighting<00:02:15.540> environment<00:02:16.020> or<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.380> dark

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
lighting environment or in a dark

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.760 
lighting environment or in a dark
environment<00:02:16.740> instead<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.180> simply<00:02:19.170> what<00:02:19.380> flux

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
environment instead so simply what flux

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.220 
environment instead so simply what flux
does<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.520> changes<00:02:21.090> your<00:02:21.630> monitor<00:02:22.050> to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
does is it changes your monitor to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.470 
does is it changes your monitor to
emulate<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.100> lighting<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.520> your<00:02:23.640> room<00:02:23.880> now<00:02:24.120> it

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
emulate the lighting of your room now it

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.880 
emulate the lighting of your room now it
has<00:02:24.660> two<00:02:24.870> different<00:02:25.170> modes<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.680> just

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
has two different modes you can just

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.530 
has two different modes you can just
leave<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.280> at<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.460> darker<00:02:26.850> setting<00:02:27.150> if<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.360> have

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
leave it at a darker setting if you have

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.240 
leave it at a darker setting if you have
a<00:02:27.570> pretty<00:02:27.780> consistent<00:02:28.170> room<00:02:28.500> lighting<00:02:28.830> like

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
a pretty consistent room lighting like

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.430 
a pretty consistent room lighting like
myself<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.880> have<00:02:29.910> block<00:02:30.300> out<00:02:30.480> curtains<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.140> I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
myself I have block out curtains and I

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.230 
myself I have block out curtains and I
use<00:02:31.680> inside<00:02:32.130> lighting<00:02:32.520> whenever<00:02:32.820> I'm<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.120> this

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
use inside lighting whenever I'm in this

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.090 
use inside lighting whenever I'm in this
room<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.690> leave<00:02:33.990> it<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.200> consistent<00:02:34.590> setting

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
room so I leave it a consistent setting

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.980 
room so I leave it a consistent setting
however<00:02:35.460> if<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.880> have<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.210> Sun<00:02:36.420> rises<00:02:36.960> you

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
however if you have the Sun rises you

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.360 
however if you have the Sun rises you
know<00:02:37.230> your<00:02:37.350> room<00:02:37.500> gets<00:02:37.710> brighter<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.190> then<00:02:38.280> at

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
know your room gets brighter and then at

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.190 
know your room gets brighter and then at
night<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.700> gets<00:02:38.730> darker<00:02:39.210> flux<00:02:39.720> will<00:02:39.960> actually

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
night it gets darker flux will actually

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.510 
night it gets darker flux will actually
automatically<00:02:40.710> adjust<00:02:41.130> your<00:02:41.310> monitor

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
automatically adjust your monitor

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.310 
automatically adjust your monitor
lighting<00:02:42.000> with<00:02:42.180> your<00:02:42.450> your<00:02:42.930> lighting

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
lighting with your your lighting

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.380 
lighting with your your lighting
situation<00:02:44.220> as<00:02:44.340> well<00:02:44.550> which<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:44.970> really<00:02:45.150> good

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
situation as well which is really good

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.270 
situation as well which is really good
it's<00:02:45.660> nice<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.200> nice<00:02:46.290> gradual<00:02:46.800> change<00:02:47.130> it

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
it's nice it's a nice gradual change it

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.150 
it's nice it's a nice gradual change it
makes<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.610> your<00:02:48.090> monitor<00:02:48.590> warmer<00:02:49.590> as<00:02:49.740> it

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
makes you a your monitor warmer as it

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.710 
makes you a your monitor warmer as it
gets<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.430> as<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.730> gets<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.030> know<00:02:51.060> nighttime

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
gets it as it gets you know nighttime

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.240 
gets it as it gets you know nighttime
and<00:02:51.960> as<00:02:52.080> your<00:02:52.260> lighting<00:02:52.620> your<00:02:52.650> house<00:02:52.950> lighting

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
and as your lighting your house lighting

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.220 
and as your lighting your house lighting
takes<00:02:53.550> over<00:02:53.880> instead<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.420> then<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.960> makes<00:02:55.080> it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
takes over instead and then it makes it

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.780 
takes over instead and then it makes it
brighter<00:02:55.530> during<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.010> day<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.220> match<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
brighter during the day to match the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.670 
brighter during the day to match the
sort<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.060> natural<00:02:57.390> lighting<00:02:57.600> situation<00:02:58.290> so

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
sort of natural lighting situation so

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.840 
sort of natural lighting situation so
there's<00:02:58.860> those<00:02:59.010> different<00:02:59.400> different<00:02:59.700> modes

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
there's those different different modes

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.220 
there's those different different modes
there<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.360> that's<00:03:00.480> going<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.630> help<00:03:00.810> your<00:03:00.990> lot

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
there and that's going to help your lot

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.780 
there and that's going to help your lot
with<00:03:01.410> minimizing<00:03:01.830> eye<00:03:02.220> strain<00:03:02.490> if<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:02.640> get<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
with minimizing eye strain if you get a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.040 
with minimizing eye strain if you get a
lot<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:02.940> headaches<00:03:03.210> from<00:03:03.600> looking<00:03:03.810> at<00:03:03.900> your

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
lot of headaches from looking at your

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.870 
lot of headaches from looking at your
monitor<00:03:04.410> or<00:03:04.740> if<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:04.980> just<00:03:05.010> sometimes<00:03:05.340> you

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
monitor or if you just sometimes you

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.460 
monitor or if you just sometimes you
know<00:03:06.000> feel<00:03:06.480> like<00:03:06.600> maybe<00:03:06.780> you're<00:03:06.930> just<00:03:07.080> burning

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
know feel like maybe you're just burning

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.170 
know feel like maybe you're just burning
your<00:03:07.590> eyeballs<00:03:07.890> out<00:03:08.070> then<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.790> probably

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
your eyeballs out then I probably

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.970 
your eyeballs out then I probably
actually<00:03:09.750> are<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.140> after<00:03:10.200> using<00:03:10.470> flux<00:03:10.770> for<00:03:10.950> a

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
actually are and after using flux for a

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.230 
actually are and after using flux for a
while<00:03:11.100> you'll<00:03:11.310> certainly<00:03:11.670> notice<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.060> when

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
while you'll certainly notice that when

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.300 
while you'll certainly notice that when
you<00:03:12.330> turn<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.630> off<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.650> that's<00:03:13.950> what<00:03:14.130> really

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
you turn it off so that's what really

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.100 
you turn it off so that's what really
happens<00:03:14.730> actually<00:03:15.090> when<00:03:15.240> you<00:03:15.360> turn<00:03:15.570> flux<00:03:15.930> off

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
happens actually when you turn flux off

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.449 
happens actually when you turn flux off
after<00:03:16.380> using<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.770> that's<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.040> biggest<00:03:17.250> thing

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
after using it that's the biggest thing

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.920 
after using it that's the biggest thing
that<00:03:17.730> really<00:03:17.850> sells<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.300> for<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.510> lot<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.720> people

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
that really sells it for a lot of people

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.060 
that really sells it for a lot of people
they're<00:03:19.050> like<00:03:19.170> wow<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.530> can't<00:03:19.770> believe<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.040> used

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
they're like wow I can't believe I used

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.040 
they're like wow I can't believe I used
to<00:03:20.280> look<00:03:20.370> at<00:03:20.459> my<00:03:20.610> monitor<00:03:20.880> like<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.209> but

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
to look at my monitor like that but

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.840 
to look at my monitor like that but
here's<00:03:22.290> guys<00:03:22.500> here's<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.190> best<00:03:23.430> possible

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
example I can give to you now flux is

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.570 
example I can give to you now flux is
just<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.530> filter<00:03:25.890> for<00:03:26.040> your<00:03:26.100> monitor<00:03:26.430> what

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
just a filter for your monitor what

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.280 
just a filter for your monitor what
actually<00:03:26.850> displays<00:03:27.270> I<00:03:27.480> can't<00:03:27.900> show<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.110> this

actually displays I can't show you this
on<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.530> screen<00:03:28.709> because<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.160> only<00:03:29.280> works<00:03:29.550> on

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
on the screen because it only works on

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.190 
on the screen because it only works on
my<00:03:29.820> monitor<00:03:30.060> doesn't<00:03:30.360> affect<00:03:30.690> what<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:31.020> guys
