00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.950
 about people here is new coach today 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.600
 with the task of a myth one 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.930
 to destroy the misconception and thus 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.029
 to roll up and that's the one 's 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.130
 Incidentally, since the beginning of the bikini class 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.779
 the bikini athletes do not 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.520
 Bodybuilders are and now too 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.439
 easier to get in shape 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.180
 or the competitive form too 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.399
 reach and that is more complete 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.980
 nonsense I even claim that some 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.380
 bikini athletes make it a lot harder 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.730
 have as extreme bodybuilders around theirs 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.190
 to obtain a competitive form 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.600
 Look at a bikini athlete 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.850
 just as fat we lose an extreme 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.430
 Bodybuilder is the problem with women 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.620
 but that their asset gold is where the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.780
 Body fat content in the normal range 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.600
 settles much higher than one 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.540
 man women have twice as much in the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.300
 ratio twice as much as men 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.030
 that is nature and now it is like that 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.810
 that the woman at 22 percent on this 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.100
 weight now at just 11 12 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.100
 want to stay 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.810
 at a weight of 62 kilos, she would have to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.819
 now worth 54 kilo 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.729
 that means she would have to be seven kilos fat 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:20.670
 lose seven kilos of fat 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.270
 in calories per kilo, that's 7000 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.399
 Calories are 49,000 calories 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.579
 Now this lady during the competition 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.560
 So diet has to be lost when a man is 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.689
 it so that the set point accordingly 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.999
 is deeper than the woman we go 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.899
 assuming that now at the whole 

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:40.619
 15 has leveled is then 90 91 kilo 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.990
 body builder 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.789
 He wants to be on stage with 67 percent 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.859
 that means you have to go down 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.719
 almost 82 83 kilo 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.119
 that means who would have to seven kilo 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.310
 lose fat in the same period 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.499
 and that's 49 thousand again 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.829
 kilocalories deficit losing it 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:00.569
 is considered as wonder where is the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.060
 Difference if the woman the bikini 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.709
 athlete the 49 1000 calories deficit 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.299
 It has to be lost and just as a man 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.459
 if he gets those seven kilos now 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.069
 lose say 49 thousand 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.640
 Kilokalorien deficit must have where is 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.540
 the difference 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.760
 I'll tell you 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.920
 It's like that with a woman 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.560
 some difficulties on the one hand 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.269
 that's just not the women in vain 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.280
 have twice as much fat as men 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.989
 that by nature so determined that the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.609
 women should have more reserves 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.400
 and so it is with a woman in 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:32.950
 so that the organism is more against that 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.319
 losing weight fights as a man 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.750
 There are more adoptions than one 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.260
 man the further you get from this 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.909
 said 22 moved down all the more 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.599
 she must go her own organism 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.459
 fight 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.319
 I say that men do not fight 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.870
 but it must be so with women 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.060
 that you are dealing with nature again and 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.430
 according to more use 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.040
 on the other hand, it has to be shown 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.480
 so that in women fat 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.419
 Mainly stored subcutaneously 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.780
 Women store fed under the skin 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:06.760
 the hips at the triceps at the belly 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.709
 you can see that it wobbles and you see 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.750
 it is also a part of men 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.389
 so well stored but 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.790
 is stored mainly know 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.010
 So in the belly space although we get a 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.599
 Drum and you can see the sixpacks 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.069
 nor because it is not so good 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.799
 accordingly not too much like one 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.359
 woman is saved so again point 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.940
 to men two to zero 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.530
 It is so that both if 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.699
 you want to go to the competition stage 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.530
 have a hard time 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.299
 the hardest part is the people 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.280
 very far away from her set point 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.699
 move on now in competition form 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.650
 but in the end it is so both 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.629
 have to create a deficit and they 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.909
 must match this deficit of 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.099
 deduct your maintenance if 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.319
 Now I mean conservation at ready 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.109
 have two and a half thousand calories and me 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.419
 now a deficit of 5 1500 calories at 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.400
 day it only wants to torture 2000 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:59.139
 calories in a woman, it is so 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.540
 that they are due to their lighter 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.970
 weight also less maintenance needs 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.010
 maybe maybe at 1,700 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.199
 calories if you have 500 calories now 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.549
 want to deficit then it is 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.129
 just under 1200 calories 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.659
 These ladies can still eat in mine 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.979
 eyes , it is now almost zero for 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.250
 us men we can either way 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:19.419
 eat a bit more because we stop too 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.700
 accordingly a higher maintenance 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.040
 have needed 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.560
 So you see bikini athletes have to 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.840
 God knows no less about it now 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.150
 in a competitive way to come to my eyes 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.010
 As I said, they even have to do more 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.470
 maybe they have eleven 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.300
 percent is not as extreme as it is 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.920
 bodybuilder at five to eight 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.410
 percent body fat stands on the stage 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.710
 but believe me, for each organism is 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.350
 that just as difficult the most extreme 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.510
 form is in my eyes that women 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.520
 bodybuilding then the figures class 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.070
 because these ladies are much more extreme then 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.320
 under yours is worth under your set 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.790
 point then the fight then have to go 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.400
 most 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.910
 that was it through thick for today together 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.540
 and thin 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.540
 new coach
