 beautiful horse that has stood out 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.769
 in the luck of coleadero but that now 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.660
 is taking excellent scales with 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.910
 which alejandro bohn and is 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.010
 presenting excellent mounts in 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.510
 the present we give ourselves with the plans 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.710
 on the canvas where Napoleon reséndiz 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.510
 magaña 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.430
 on his second chance gathered towards 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.119
 in front of twenty plus two additional 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.600
 for 22 points in the coleadero the best 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.550
 it was alejandro goñi rojo accumulating 38 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.920
 starting points with a right half of 10 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.840
 with 1 distance to 11 in the second 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.450
 opportunity is called round right of 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.570
 12 with 1 away for 13 points 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.300

 strong with a 14 take 38 in his three 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.539
 opportunities and contribute in just two 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.310
 strong 82 points alejandro goñi red 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.280
 we go to the bull rider where 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.470
 eduardo fivela incredibly can not stand 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.369
 them because as we can see 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.340
 the bull does not present much difficulty without 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.159
 However, it is sweeping being more and more 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.710
 he dismantles it and takes only two 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.270
 of time saved in tightening the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.860
 triple in the ring was consummated by 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.110
 Napoleon reséndiz with the head loop 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.750
 of 24 points 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.360
 while mere lópez consume this 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.990
 excellent skin a long distance to 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.410
 take 46 points of the shortlist in the 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.840
 Arena 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.460
 marco antonio ramírez has no fortune 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.430
 that I repaired the mare like him 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.980
 I would have liked however it contributes well 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.740
 17 points to the score sheet for 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.240
 get to that moment at 211 this great 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.460
 charro de huichapan team that 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.820
 I was looking to improve your place number 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.390
 14 with which they reached this phase 976 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.310

 napo resendis achieve the three manganas a 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.900
 foot however the second one could not 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.410
 knock down so it only contributes 49 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.080
 units 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.380
 mary lópez consumes another two on horseback 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.470
 of 56 which were not enough 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.560
 since they closed with 341 from place number 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.340

 excellent average of 321 in the first 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.849
 328 in the second and 327 in the third 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.849
