pet my pet bat and flies around it gets

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.710 
pet my pet bat and flies around it gets
too<00:00:21.090> far<00:00:21.420> away<00:00:23.210> eventually<00:00:24.210> he<00:00:24.510> gets

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
too far away eventually he gets

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.810 
too far away eventually he gets
teleported<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.500> me<00:00:26.000> just<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:28.580> but<00:00:29.580> as

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
teleported to me just like that but as

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.999 
teleported to me just like that but as
long<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.029> he's<00:00:30.510> within<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.529> certain<00:00:31.859> distance

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
long as he's within a certain distance

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.220 
long as he's within a certain distance
he<00:00:32.910> doesn't<00:00:33.329> get<00:00:33.420> teleported<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:37.340> if<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:39.230> move

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
he doesn't get teleported and if I move

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.250 
he doesn't get teleported and if I move
to<00:00:41.300> different<00:00:42.300> location<00:00:44.600> we<00:00:45.600> had<00:00:45.690> teleported

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
to different location we had teleported

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
to different location we had teleported
to<00:00:46.289> me<00:00:46.530> eventually<00:00:48.260> there<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:54.030> how<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
to me eventually there is and so how I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.939 
to me eventually there is and so how I
do<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.280> command<00:00:56.730> block<00:00:57.000> here

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
do this is with this command block here

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.500 
do this is with this command block here
testing<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.250> me<00:00:59.539> if<00:01:00.539> I'm<00:01:00.840> online<00:01:01.879> then<00:01:02.879> that

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
testing for me if I'm online then that

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.219 
testing for me if I'm online then that
will<00:01:03.809> power<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.650> block<00:01:05.420> which<00:01:06.420> powers<00:01:07.020> this

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
will power this block which powers this

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.609 
will power this block which powers this
clock<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:10.020> command<00:01:10.470> block<00:01:12.049> execute<00:01:13.049> at

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
clock in this command block execute at

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.840 
clock in this command block execute at
me<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:15.090> TP<00:01:15.770> my<00:01:16.770> bath<00:01:17.070> named<00:01:17.790> Hoku<00:01:18.439> that's

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
me to TP my bath named Hoku that's

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.859 
me to TP my bath named Hoku that's
further<00:01:20.850> than<00:01:21.360> 15<00:01:21.990> blocks<00:01:22.259> away<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:23.820> me<00:01:25.100> and

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
further than 15 blocks away to me and

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.560 
further than 15 blocks away to me and
over<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:29.180> is<00:01:30.180> testing<00:01:30.840> for<00:01:31.110> my<00:01:31.259> bat<00:01:31.970> so<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.299> my

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
over here is testing for my bat so if my

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:43.370 
over here is testing for my bat so if my
fat<00:01:34.350> dies<00:01:36.409> now<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:40.009> sew<00:01:41.479> my<00:01:42.479> bat<00:01:42.840> dies

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
fat dies now I have to sew my bat dies

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.730 
fat dies now I have to sew my bat dies
then<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.280> will<00:01:44.490> create<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.000> new<00:01:45.149> bed<00:01:48.500> this<00:01:49.500> is

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
then it will create a new bed this is

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.999 
then it will create a new bed this is
the<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.560> some<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> back<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:54.329> me<00:01:54.689> with

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
the one so some in the back at me with

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.840 
the one so some in the back at me with
the<00:01:56.009> custom<00:01:56.430> name<00:01:56.670> Hoku<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:58.100> i<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.430> his<00:01:59.640> name

the custom name Hoku and i have his name
visible<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:02.509> when<00:02:03.509> i<00:02:03.540> log<00:02:03.899> off<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.979> power

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
visible and when i log off this power

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.449 
visible and when i log off this power
this<00:02:06.030> block<00:02:06.540> here<00:02:06.840> gets<00:02:07.110> d<00:02:07.380> powered<00:02:07.799> which

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
this block here gets d powered which

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.010 
this block here gets d powered which
turns<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.209> porch

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
turns on this porch

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.180
