we have the bespoke premium audio system
then<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.400> would<00:02:53.610> see<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.880> map<00:02:54.150> right<00:02:54.360> there<00:02:54.420> on

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
then you would see a map right there on

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.120 
then you would see a map right there on
the<00:02:54.810> screen<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.380> one<00:02:55.500> thing<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.769> keep<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:56.070> mind

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
the screen and one thing to keep in mind

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.740 
the screen and one thing to keep in mind
about<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.640> bespoke<00:02:56.850> system<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.600> map

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
about the bespoke system is that the map

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.660 
about the bespoke system is that the map
is<00:02:57.959> delivered<00:02:58.440> by<00:02:58.590> your<00:02:58.769> attached<00:02:59.100> smartphone

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
is delivered by your attached smartphone

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.430 
is delivered by your attached smartphone
and<00:03:00.090> because<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.480> have<00:03:00.600> an<00:03:00.690> iPhone<00:03:00.750> 5<00:03:01.170> right<00:03:01.410> now

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
and because I have an iPhone 5 right now

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.770 
and because I have an iPhone 5 right now
and<00:03:01.769> I'm<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.010> an<00:03:02.130> area<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.459> has<00:03:02.730> no<00:03:03.000> signal<00:03:03.420> we

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
and I'm in an area that has no signal we

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.540 
and I'm in an area that has no signal we
can't<00:03:04.019> actually<00:03:04.260> get<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.769> map<00:03:05.040> through<00:03:05.400> this

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
can't actually get a map through this

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.040 
can't actually get a map through this
system<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.090> even<00:03:06.269> if<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.420> have<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.690> bespoke

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
system so even if I have the bespoke

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.960 
system so even if I have the bespoke
option<00:03:07.470> in<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.680> car<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.040> wouldn't<00:03:08.459> get<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.790> map

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
option in the car I wouldn't get the map

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.300 
option in the car I wouldn't get the map
right<00:03:09.180> over<00:03:09.390> here<00:03:09.600> now<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.230> car<00:03:10.590> does<00:03:10.920> cache

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
right over here now the car does cache

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.070 
right over here now the car does cache
some<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.760> data<00:03:11.910> from<00:03:12.120> your<00:03:12.330> smartphone<00:03:12.660> so

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
some of the data from your smartphone so

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.080 
some of the data from your smartphone so
you<00:03:13.290> can<00:03:13.769> drive<00:03:14.190> through<00:03:14.430> certain<00:03:14.820> areas

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
you can drive through certain areas

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.300 
you can drive through certain areas
without<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> signal<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:15.989> still<00:03:16.560> navigate<00:03:17.070> but

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
without a signal and still navigate but

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.280 
without a signal and still navigate but
you<00:03:17.730> can't<00:03:18.000> enter<00:03:18.209> new<00:03:18.360> destinations<00:03:18.989> things

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
you can't enter new destinations things

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.319 
you can't enter new destinations things
like<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.709> with<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.400> system<00:03:20.790> I'm<00:03:21.030> told<00:03:21.180> by

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
like that with that system I'm told by

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.060 
like that with that system I'm told by
Scion<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:21.810> for<00:03:21.959> 2014<00:03:22.560> there<00:03:22.709> have<00:03:22.799> been<00:03:22.860> some

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
Scion that for 2014 there have been some

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.130 
Scion that for 2014 there have been some
other<00:03:23.190> changes<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.820> bespoke<00:03:24.120> app<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.720> now

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
other changes to the bespoke app and now

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.870 
other changes to the bespoke app and now
it<00:03:25.290> has<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.650> little<00:03:25.829> bit<00:03:25.980> more<00:03:26.040> intelligence<00:03:26.730> so

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
it has a little bit more intelligence so

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.759 
it has a little bit more intelligence so
if<00:03:26.970> you're<00:03:27.060> looking<00:03:27.209> for<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.810> gas<00:03:28.230> station<00:03:28.470> or<00:03:28.739> a

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
driving somewhere it will prioritize

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.280 
driving somewhere it will prioritize
destinations<00:03:33.209> in<00:03:33.390> front<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.870> rather<00:03:34.049> than

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
destinations in front of you rather than

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.080 
destinations in front of you rather than
behind<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.709> which<00:03:34.829> is<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> nice<00:03:35.250> touch<00:03:35.400> overall

behind you which is a nice touch overall
I<00:03:36.120> was<00:03:36.329> impressed<00:03:36.630> with<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.840> sound<00:03:37.110> quality

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
I was impressed with the sound quality

OK option but for $1100 I would rather
