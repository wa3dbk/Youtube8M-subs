00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:29.890
 many tomatoes here years ago i was 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:35.860
 Gardener in geneva bio de biodynamic 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:37.120
 garden was such a small community and there 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.690
 we have opened 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.949
 from morning to night all year round 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.659
 year long it was like I'm there 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.930
 actually got around to one 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:52.809
 fieldwork came from the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.890
 University of Vienna and was on the flight 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:01.510
 from spain back to vienna and there was 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.670
 a landing in Zurich and there I should 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.820
 change 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.679
 an american friend was in geneva 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.100
 and he had written letters to me and 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:14.649
 said or are weird things here 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.390
 and you may be the ethnologist 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.520
 Do you know what's going on here? 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.590
 I say yes I have no idea yes 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.740
 that's some magic doing that 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.740
 here 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.200
 I caught it then I have no time 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.960
 semester starts tomorrow I have to 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.450
 to come back to vienna we came 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.340
 put us in probably should that is 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.780
 the duck and drove all night and 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.890
 then he dragged me the next morning 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.040
 when we arrived to the garden house and in 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.640
 The corner of the garden shed was one 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.259
 bubble so sony ball and he said that 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.649
 some weed in it 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.290
 and you know what that is is the voodoo 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.240
 or so I did not know and then 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.140
 I met the gardener so much distanced 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.680
 a bit like the ones you like a lot 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.369
 lifted guy and said then spoke 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.820
 then of etheric essences and 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.060
 then he grabs me a brochure and there 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.480
 stood in there by a Rudolf Steiner the 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.470
 angels work on the etr body during the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.630
 night thought what is that and came 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.269
 not clear and what is that for you 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.870
 Bubble turned out to be a deer 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:35.530
 bubble stuffed with yarrow and 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.930
 then later fear that the venus should 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.410
 bringing in forces comes in the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.769
 compost and makes the compost sensible 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.680
 so that the compost can hear the 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.690
 arrange the powers of the venus and these 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.640
 can convey the plants further 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.670
 So that was a world I never had 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:00.430
 had experienced before and there I am then 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:02.620
 disguised as a gardener and alternated 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.050
 to the university bern and should once 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.780
 be in Bern during the week and then be 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.550
 walking around in the garden prüflings at 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.500
 sunrise and went up 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.379
 Sunset all the time in the garden 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.480
 and that was so fascinating fingering 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:20.980
 bacchus to run and the hair became 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.620
 long and I was so taken by 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.989
 the garden and the plants and there 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.900
 then you saw little beetles running 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:33.489
 as close as they are wonderful again 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:38.080
 this today and yes in the bus came the 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.540
 Rhone flew over the garden 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.000
 flew over the garden made his circles 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.819
 very low and I realized that they were one 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.870
 other awareness that's one thing on 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.629
 looked and when old came 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.330
 friends on visit from the city and me 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.610
 showed them around the garden and 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.370
 I did not want her somehow 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.590
 affect or disturb the atmosphere 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.650
 I am then silent in the garden 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.170
 but has the bug again and how 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.110
 wonderful that is now flourished and 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.900
 so and then after about an hour 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.989
 or three quarters of an hour's roundtrip then 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:22.090
 they did them well we can do them 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:25.210
 not endure the consciousness was then 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.940
 Over time, so extended 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.430
 extended that I was completely 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.940
 scientist and quite rationally so 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.599
 I think that was and in the evening after 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.490
 done work there you are so tired so 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.490
 tired and then maybe you make yourself 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.599
 even before the garden house and looks 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.360
 what you did looks like 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:53.649
 Everything grows and meditates 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.110
 bit and in this space there 

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:58.750
 happened to me suddenly comes 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.510
 heinzelmännchen on me to such a 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.990
 real heinzelmännchen should dwarf with 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.839
 his pointed cap and wall come so 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:12.550
 to be on top of me does not come after all 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:15.520
 towards me and then I realized that and 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.950
 I thought that's as big as me 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.770
 it does not exist but then I realized 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:25.330
 that it ran in a rut and the 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.740
 it was really that small the plants 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.750
 were so high and I was myself 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.479
 a little hound, that was 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.219
 that these are the experiences you get 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.440
 not in everyday life that is 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:41.460
 unusual experiences sometimes 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.500
 you slip out of the 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.710
 Everyday awareness and we will always be 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.409
 stopped too right in this too 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.860
 to remain everyday consciousness 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:56.080
 but it is possible it is possible that 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.219
 to shift awareness or to 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.440
 expand 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:01.779
 you do not need any drugs for that 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.839
 but it happens especially when 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:06.760
 to be in such an interval as 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:10.690
 when you're tired after the whole day 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.460
 work and there you can see things 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.159
 you usually do not see it 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.229
 that's fine too, so put yourself in front of me 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:19.750
 a car drives and she's the one 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.200
 nothing else she can be very dangerous 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.200
 his
