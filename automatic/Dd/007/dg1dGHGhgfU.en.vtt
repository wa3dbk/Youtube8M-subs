another<00:00:13.320> video<00:00:13.500> today<00:00:14.070> i'm<00:00:14.340> working<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:15.030> the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
another video today i'm working in the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.120 
another video today i'm working in the
default<00:00:15.510> texture<00:00:15.840> pack<00:00:15.990> some<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> little<00:00:16.980> bit

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
default texture pack some a little bit

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.400 
default texture pack some a little bit
uh<00:00:17.480> it'll<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> little<00:00:18.690> interesting<00:00:18.960> for<00:00:19.380> me

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
uh it'll be a little interesting for me

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.500 
uh it'll be a little interesting for me
i'm<00:00:19.590> not<00:00:19.619> used<00:00:19.860> to<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.550> normal<00:00:21.119> look<00:00:21.360> of

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
i'm not used to the normal look of

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.830 
i'm not used to the normal look of
Minecraft<00:00:22.400> as<00:00:23.400> i<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.640> everything<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.420> mixes

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
Minecraft as i do everything in mixes

Minecraft as i do everything in mixes
texture<00:00:25.200> pack<00:00:26.119> but<00:00:27.119> today<00:00:27.360> i<00:00:27.390> wanted<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:28.040> go

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
texture pack but today i wanted to go

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.690 
texture pack but today i wanted to go
over<00:00:29.070> something<00:00:29.660> today<00:00:30.660> i<00:00:30.779> was<00:00:30.930> watching

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
over something today i was watching

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.600 
over something today i was watching
siblings<00:00:32.700> awesome<00:00:33.690> video<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:34.140> proximity

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
siblings awesome video about proximity

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.430 
siblings awesome video about proximity
detectors<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:37.530> many<00:00:37.710> uses<00:00:37.950> for<00:00:38.160> those

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
detectors and the many uses for those

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.529 
detectors and the many uses for those
apparently<00:00:40.489> cows<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.910> other<00:00:42.030> animals<00:00:42.239> i

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
apparently cows and other animals i

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.510 
apparently cows and other animals i
didn't<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.829> well<00:00:44.039> they<00:00:44.250> will<00:00:44.370> only

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
didn't know this but well they will only

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
didn't know this but well they will only
move<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:45.270> they're<00:00:45.690> within<00:00:45.840> these<00:00:46.230> two<00:00:46.260> blocks

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
move if they're within these two blocks

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.630 
move if they're within these two blocks
would<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.949> so<00:00:47.699> he's<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.600> sit<00:00:48.780> there

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
would be so he's now going to sit there

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.700 
would be so he's now going to sit there
as<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.750> see<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> other<00:00:52.109> animals<00:00:52.559> aren't

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
as you can see the other animals aren't

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.849 
as you can see the other animals aren't
moving<00:00:53.120> like<00:00:54.120> they'll<00:00:54.300> turn<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.899> whatever

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
moving like they'll turn and whatever

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.680 
moving like they'll turn and whatever
they<00:00:56.160> won't<00:00:56.370> move<00:00:56.550> they<00:00:56.910> won't<00:00:57.090> walk<00:00:57.300> around

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
they won't move they won't walk around

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.990 
they won't move they won't walk around
and<00:00:58.469> there's<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.250> number<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.519> animals<00:00:59.760> out

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and there's a number of animals out

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.430 
and there's a number of animals out
there<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.420> notice<00:01:00.690> now<00:01:00.839> that<00:01:00.870> i'm<00:01:01.109> moving

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
there but you notice now that i'm moving

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.939 
there but you notice now that i'm moving
that's<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.429> i've<00:01:02.809> left<00:01:03.809> their<00:01:04.230> their

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that's because i've left their their

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.430 
that's because i've left their their
field<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.120> soon<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.600> walk<00:01:06.810> outside<00:01:07.020> of

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
field so as soon as you walk outside of

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.780 
field so as soon as you walk outside of
or<00:01:07.740> leave<00:01:08.160> 32<00:01:09.030> blocks<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.600> their<00:01:09.750> location

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
or leave 32 blocks of their location

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.569 
or leave 32 blocks of their location
they<00:01:11.790> won't<00:01:12.030> move<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:14.150> sethbling<00:01:16.579> developed

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
they won't move so sethbling developed

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.130 
they won't move so sethbling developed
i'm<00:01:17.880> not<00:01:18.030> sure<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.360> he<00:01:18.479> was<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> first<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
i'm not sure if he was the first one to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.620 
i'm not sure if he was the first one to
develop<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.130> proximity<00:01:21.000> detector<00:01:21.479> now

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
develop it but a proximity detector now

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.670 
develop it but a proximity detector now
i'm<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.960> show<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.079> this<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.409> I'm<00:01:22.590> going

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
i'm going to show you this one I'm going

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.760 
i'm going to show you this one I'm going
to<00:01:22.829> show<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.790> made<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.770> but

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
to show you what I made with this but

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530 
to show you what I made with this but
essentially<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.340> one<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.180> lights<00:01:27.390> up

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
essentially this one just it lights up

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.149 
essentially this one just it lights up
like<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.990> gives<00:01:28.259> them<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> opportunity<00:01:28.590> move

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
like it gives them the opportunity move

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.920 
like it gives them the opportunity move
and<00:01:29.399> their<00:01:29.520> light<00:01:29.729> up<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.149> it's<00:01:30.689> fairly

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
and their light up it's it's fairly

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.080 
and their light up it's it's fairly
simple<00:01:31.350> sure<00:01:32.100> shouldn't<00:01:32.430> give<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.729> away<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
simple sure shouldn't give that away and

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.359 
simple sure shouldn't give that away and
as<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.720> see<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.960> lights<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> moment

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
as you can see it lights up for a moment

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.670 
as you can see it lights up for a moment
because<00:01:35.970> they<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.600> pushed<00:01:36.840> he<00:01:37.290> had<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.500> push

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
because they get pushed he had to push

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.459 
because they get pushed he had to push
back<00:01:37.950> into<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.520> center<00:01:38.790> block<00:01:38.939> area<00:01:39.380> where<00:01:40.380> he

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
back into the center block area where he

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.980 
back into the center block area where he
can<00:01:40.680> possibly<00:01:40.890> move<00:01:41.310> again<00:01:41.659> now<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.719> probably

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
can possibly move again now you probably

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.420 
can possibly move again now you probably
saw<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> sneak<00:01:43.500> peek<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.829> what<00:01:43.979> i<00:01:44.040> want<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> show

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
saw a sneak peek of what i want to show

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.740 
saw a sneak peek of what i want to show
you<00:01:44.869> unfortunately<00:01:45.869> i<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> bit<00:01:46.950> uh

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
you unfortunately i was a bit uh

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.649 
you unfortunately i was a bit uh
whatever<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.469> yeah<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> basic<00:01:51.119> concept

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
whatever so yeah this is a basic concept

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.139 
whatever so yeah this is a basic concept
and<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.170> stackable<00:01:52.770> based<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
and it's stackable based on the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.600 
and it's stackable based on the
dimensions<00:01:54.960> I've<00:01:55.140> given<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.500> now<00:01:56.280> what<00:01:56.490> I've

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
dimensions I've given it now what I've

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.649 
dimensions I've given it now what I've
got<00:01:56.759> over<00:01:56.969> here<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.829> stacked<00:01:59.479> this<00:02:00.479> is

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
got over here is it stacked this is

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.120 
got over here is it stacked this is
about<00:02:01.219> 5<00:02:02.219> by<00:02:02.520> 6<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:03.570> far<00:02:04.170> as<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.469> amount<00:02:04.890> there

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
about 5 by 6 as far as the amount there

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.700 
about 5 by 6 as far as the amount there
are<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.149> he<00:02:06.689> has<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> good<00:02:07.049> number<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.350> them<00:02:07.439> I've

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
are so he has a good number of them I've

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
as you can see it's going to blow up so

this<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.040> my<00:02:17.220> mind<00:02:17.550> filled<00:02:17.959> approximately

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
this is my mind filled approximately

detection minefield now because of

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.750 
detection minefield now because of
the<00:02:22.500> delay<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:23.160> normally<00:02:23.280> get<00:02:23.640> with

the delay that you normally get with
cows<00:02:24.060> movement<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.950> forth<00:02:26.250> if<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:27.060> would

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
cows movement and so forth if you would

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.850 
cows movement and so forth if you would
well<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.170> will<00:02:28.380> die<00:02:28.560> unless<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.280> live<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> gap

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
well you will die unless you live a gap

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.250 
well you will die unless you live a gap
because<00:02:31.860> obviously<00:02:32.010> 32<00:02:32.790> blocks<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.110> have

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
because obviously 32 blocks so you have

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.380 
because obviously 32 blocks so you have
to<00:02:34.410> make<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.680> either<00:02:34.830> exactly<00:02:35.400> 232<00:02:35.940> blocks<00:02:36.210> or

31 blocks on the surface or whatever

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.650 
31 blocks on the surface or whatever
because<00:02:40.050> basically<00:02:41.060> what<00:02:42.060> you're<00:02:42.150> trying<00:02:42.480> to

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
because basically what you're trying to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.440 
because basically what you're trying to
do<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.930> if<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:43.980> imagine<00:02:44.190> 32<00:02:44.880> blocks<00:02:45.210> being

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
do is if you imagine 32 blocks being

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.310 
do is if you imagine 32 blocks being
your<00:02:45.750> you're<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:47.580> distance<00:02:47.970> between<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:49.110> cow

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
your you're the distance between the cow

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.380 
your you're the distance between the cow
in<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.710> if<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.580> make<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.910> ground<00:02:51.090> lesson

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
in you if you make the ground lesson

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.940 
in you if you make the ground lesson
then<00:02:52.230> than<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.340> then<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:55.080> field<00:02:55.410> of

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
then than that then the field of

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.610 
then than that then the field of
detection<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.670> um<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.210> less<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:58.320> will<00:02:58.440> take<00:02:58.590> a

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
detection is um is less it will take a

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.290 
detection is um is less it will take a
list<00:02:58.860> for<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.160> cow<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.460> detect<00:03:00.090> your<00:03:00.210> presence

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
list for the cow to detect your presence

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.170 
list for the cow to detect your presence
so<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:01.350> can<00:03:01.500> make<00:03:01.650> this<00:03:02.100> more<00:03:02.400> sensitive<00:03:02.940> or

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
so you can make this more sensitive or

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.100 
so you can make this more sensitive or
less<00:03:03.450> sensitive<00:03:03.900> dependent<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.800> if<00:03:06.110> that

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
less sensitive dependent on that if that

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.050 
less sensitive dependent on that if that
makes<00:03:07.320> sense<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.220> now<00:03:08.340> let's<00:03:08.550> have<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.700> look<00:03:08.790> at

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
makes sense so now let's have a look at

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.910 
makes sense so now let's have a look at
the<00:03:09.540> now<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:10.170> everything<00:03:10.470> stopped<00:03:10.740> moving

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
the now that everything stopped moving

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.950 
the now that everything stopped moving
again<00:03:11.250> let's<00:03:12.090> take<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.330> look<00:03:12.570> at<00:03:12.690> everything

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
again let's take a look at everything

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.830 
again let's take a look at everything
exploding<00:03:13.790> because<00:03:14.790> then<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.240> is<00:03:15.390> basically

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
exploding because then this is basically

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.790 
exploding because then this is basically
something<00:03:15.960> you<00:03:16.110> could<00:03:16.230> hold<00:03:16.380> in<00:03:16.500> your<00:03:16.560> base

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
something you could hold in your base

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.560 
something you could hold in your base
you<00:03:17.040> have<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.190> lever<00:03:17.490> so<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.210> can<00:03:18.360> safely

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
you have a lever so you can safely

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.860 
you have a lever so you can safely
passage<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.370> from<00:03:20.550> your<00:03:20.700> base<00:03:20.940> not<00:03:21.750> that

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
passage to and from your base not that

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.870 
passage to and from your base not that
you<00:03:22.020> would<00:03:22.080> probably<00:03:22.410> use<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.760> in<00:03:23.760> a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
you would probably use this in a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.729 
you would probably use this in a
reusable<00:03:24.060> setting<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.250> given<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:27.180> arm

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
reusable setting but given the the arm

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.710 
reusable setting but given the the arm
characteristics<00:03:28.739> of<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:29.520> these<00:03:30.000> for<00:03:30.270> example

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
characteristics of of these for example

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.910 
characteristics of of these for example
you<00:03:31.440> could<00:03:32.239> possibly<00:03:33.290> reload<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.500> every<00:03:34.800> now

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
you could possibly reload this every now

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.100 
you could possibly reload this every now
and<00:03:35.070> then<00:03:35.190> but<00:03:35.430> whatever<00:03:36.060> anyway<00:03:36.810> let's<00:03:36.989> have

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
and then but whatever anyway let's have

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.199 
and then but whatever anyway let's have
a<00:03:37.140> look<00:03:37.320> I'm<00:03:38.070> talking<00:03:38.430> about<00:03:38.459> enough<00:03:38.820> let's<00:03:39.060> go

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
a look I'm talking about enough let's go

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.810 
a look I'm talking about enough let's go
blow<00:03:39.570> up<00:03:39.600> so<00:03:40.470> as<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.739> walk<00:03:40.950> through<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.489> won't<00:03:41.670> be

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
blow up so as I walk through it won't be

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.240 
blow up so as I walk through it won't be
instant<00:03:42.270> explosion<00:03:42.840> because<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.709> cows<00:03:43.950> don't

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
instant explosion because the cows don't

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.860 
instant explosion because the cows don't
walk<00:03:44.580> straight<00:03:44.910> away<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.270> made<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.690> UH<00:03:45.720> the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
walk straight away I made the UH the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.830 
walk straight away I made the UH the
sensitivity<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.739> little<00:03:46.920> bit<00:03:47.010> longer<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.840> and

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
sensitivity a little bit longer and and

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.360 
sensitivity a little bit longer and and
so<00:03:49.020> it<00:03:49.140> gives<00:03:49.260> us<00:03:49.500> cows<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.770> little<00:03:50.130> bit<00:03:50.220> more

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
so it gives us cows a little bit more

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.360 
so it gives us cows a little bit more
time<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.610> walk<00:03:51.090> around<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:52.650> think<00:03:53.070> I<00:03:53.160> made<00:03:53.340> it

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
time to walk around I think I made it

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.490 
time to walk around I think I made it
down<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.209> 30<00:03:54.480> blocks<00:03:54.750> probably<00:03:55.320> should<00:03:55.440> have

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
down the 30 blocks probably should have

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.590 
down the 30 blocks probably should have
done<00:03:55.680> less<00:03:55.890> than<00:03:56.100> that<00:03:56.280> but<00:03:57.030> someone<00:03:57.360> walking

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
done less than that but someone walking

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.570 
done less than that but someone walking
on<00:03:57.840> here<00:03:58.019> would<00:03:58.170> have<00:03:58.290> no<00:03:58.470> idea<00:03:58.800> and<00:03:59.370> then<00:03:59.489> all

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
on here would have no idea and then all

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.300 
on here would have no idea and then all
sudden<00:03:59.730> what<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.150> hell<00:04:00.330> boom<00:04:01.100> we<00:04:02.100> sure<00:04:02.220> to

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
sudden what the hell boom we sure to

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.550 
sudden what the hell boom we sure to
make<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.750> distance<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:04.050> little<00:04:04.110> bit<00:04:04.380> better

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
make the distance a little bit better

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.890 
make the distance a little bit better
but<00:04:04.890> you<00:04:05.640> get<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.850> idea

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.770 
like I said adjust the sensitivity of
that<00:04:23.750> by<00:04:24.280> raising<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.640> lowering<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.510> ground

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780
