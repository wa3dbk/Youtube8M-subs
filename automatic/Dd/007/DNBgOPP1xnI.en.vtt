while<00:01:28.890> ago<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.220> are<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.759> guys<00:01:29.909> remember<00:01:30.210> I

while ago you are if you guys remember I

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.749 
while ago you are if you guys remember I
videos<00:01:30.810> from<00:01:30.930> back<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.220> never<00:01:32.520> really

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
videos from back then and I never really

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.249 
videos from back then and I never really
liked<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.180> much<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.540> always<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.079> like

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
liked it that much I always just like

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.740 
liked it that much I always just like
iOS<00:01:34.710> that's<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.490> who<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.700> am<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.030> an<00:01:36.390> apple

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
iOS that's just who I am I just an apple

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.719 
iOS that's just who I am I just an apple
I<00:01:36.960> mean<00:01:37.290> I'm<00:01:37.500> an<00:01:37.619> iphone<00:01:37.920> fanboy<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.579> pretty

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
I mean I'm an iphone fanboy it's pretty

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.630 
I mean I'm an iphone fanboy it's pretty
much<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> am<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.829> iOS<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.490> never

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
much what I am so I like iOS I never

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.770 
much what I am so I like iOS I never
really<00:01:41.850> liked<00:01:42.030> Android<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.540> that's<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
really liked Android so that's the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.569 
really liked Android so that's the
reason<00:01:42.810> why<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.470> think<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.070> iPhone<00:01:44.369> 5<00:01:44.549> is

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
reason why I think the iPhone 5 is

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.270 
reason why I think the iPhone 5 is
better<00:01:45.149> than<00:01:45.420> any<00:01:46.049> other<00:01:46.290> android<00:01:46.649> phone<00:01:46.860> it's

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
better than any other android phone it's

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.710 
better than any other android phone it's
not<00:01:47.399> big<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:47.640> aspects<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.329> nothing<00:01:48.600> like

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
not big as aspects it's nothing like

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.569 
not big as aspects it's nothing like
that<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.229> because<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.680> screen<00:01:50.310> size

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that it's not because the screen size

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.100 
that it's not because the screen size
there's<00:01:50.970> nothing<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.390> either<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
there's nothing like that either the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.359 
there's nothing like that either the
only<00:01:52.380> reason<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.950> better<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.220> because

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
only reason I like it better is because

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.999 
only reason I like it better is because
of<00:01:53.549> iOS<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:55.110> because<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.350> design<00:01:55.829> I

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
