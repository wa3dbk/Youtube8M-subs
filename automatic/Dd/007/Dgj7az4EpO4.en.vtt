00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:14.809
 I'm going to make a salt lamb roast 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:18.269
 here we have a front quarter of 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.480
 little lamb that is very tiny and 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:24.680
 very tender 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.900
 some potatoes onions have these 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.990
 little shallots and others 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.840
 little girls 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.840
 white wine salt and oil 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.480
 we have here the source where we are going to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.300
 prepare the roast and I have put a 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.200
 squish of oil now we have cut 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.930
 the sliced â€‹â€‹potatoes 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.720
 We are going to salt them and put them in the 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.760
 bottom of the fountain and on top of the 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.260
 potatoes we will put the ternasco that already 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.260
 we have salty on all sides 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.450
 we must place in the tray of the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:11.050
 salted potatoes, salted ternasco and 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.900
 chives out there peeled 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:18.070
 and now we need to throw him 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:23.190
 a good closed olive oil 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:27.520
 virgin and a bullshit of white wine 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.770
 You can also put cognac and once 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.890
 we add all the ingredients we have 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.190
 a preheated oven at 200 degrees it 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.630
 we will enter the second height below 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.600
 When about 20 minutes have passed 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.400
 we will turn the pieces of 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.700
 ternasco to be done on the other 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.700
 side 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:55.090
 we've been an hour and ten minutes 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.460
 with the roast at 220 230 degrees we have 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.400
 given some spin during all this 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.270
 time the meat and we have impregnated 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.340
 with the caldito that has 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.619
 so now let's give it again 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.060
 turn so that it is bent on the other 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:15.709
 side and I guess this already ended 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.860
 to be done completely and then 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.310
 we will present 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.560
 to tell you that in the oven at the base 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.440
 from the oven I put a cup with a 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.620
 little bit of water to create humidity 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.240
 inside and then be the helechal stay 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.070
 more juicy 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.140
 We will now turn around 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.840
 all the pieces 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.750
 after an hour and a half we just 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.090
 remove the suckling lamb from the oven 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.910
 is the aspect that our roast has 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.220
 Y 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.720
 that is, in the last few minutes we have 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.650
 raised even a little bit more the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.860
 temperature so that you now get more 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.110
 but good in essence has been about 220 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.410
 230 degrees 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.860
 and now without loss of time to 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.860
 attack
