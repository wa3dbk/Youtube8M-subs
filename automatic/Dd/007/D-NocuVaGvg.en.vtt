00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.290
 if all roads lead to Rome as 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.750
 you leave blunt sometimes think 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.670
 too much and feel very little my grandfather 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 always said that if someone wants 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.169
 seriously being part of your life will make 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.360
 the impossible to be in it although in 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.460
 somehow we lose between screens the 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.500
 value of the looks forgetting that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.000
 When someone dedicates his time we 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.460
 is giving away the only thing that is not 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.950
 will ever recover is that life those 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.040
 moments you know I'm here now and 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.839
 tomorrow I do not know, so I wanted to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.719
 tell you that if you ever want something 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.640
 if you want something really go for it 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.859
 without looking back looking at the fear of 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.870
 in front of the eyes delivering everything and 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.059
 giving the soul taking out the child you are carrying 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.710
 inside that believes in the impossible and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.640
 that would give the moon to touch a star 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.170
 so I do not know what will happen to me tomorrow 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.350
 lend sun is always going to be the same as 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.319
 yours and the friends of the family that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.789
 we choose and I choose you I choose you 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:04.890
 for owning the wrinkles that 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.290
 they would have the lips of old woman that I bet 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.810
 strong for all these years saturated by 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.540
 the nights in sailing 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.270
 the laughter the secrets and the loves of the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.549
 past your hugs like that because if without 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.119
 come to story or have to celebrate 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.119
 something 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.729
 and it is that in this time I have given 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.159
 Notice that the little details are 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.590
 those who do the great things that you 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.180
 you have made my limit infinite so you 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.850
 I thank you for being the only person 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.860
 able to make me cry laughing 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.020
 appear in my life with that crazy smile 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.390
 for that brightness the eyes able to fight 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.820
 against a million tsunamis so no 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.939
 I do not know where we will be in ten 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.759
 I do not even know how to get out of Rome 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.619
 I can assure nothing but I promise you that 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.770
 whatever happens wherever you are 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.399
 I will remember you all my life and for 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.500
 that my moon will always be with you 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.330
 because tube you taught me to live each 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.840
 day like the first day of the rest of my 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.840
 life and that I will never forget
