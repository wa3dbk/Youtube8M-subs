00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
was our only source of illumination we

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.450 
was our only source of illumination we
would<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> nice<00:00:58.350> illumination<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.309> one

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
would have a nice illumination on one

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
would have a nice illumination on one
side<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> subject<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.870> rest<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.199> the

side of the subject but the rest of the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.959 
side of the subject but the rest of the
subject<00:01:01.680> would<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:01.980> dark<00:01:02.219> shadows<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
shadows we use the fill light and that

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
shadows we use the fill light and that
fills<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.150> side<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.630> subject<00:01:09.900> many

then just a feel like to make sure that

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.700 
then just a feel like to make sure that
the<00:01:21.150> shadows<00:01:21.479> aren't<00:01:21.780> too<00:01:21.930> dark<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.470> side

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the shadows aren't too dark on this side

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.380 
the shadows aren't too dark on this side
of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.890> person<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.700> works<00:01:23.939> pretty<00:01:24.240> well

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
of the person and that works pretty well

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.690 
of the person and that works pretty well
however<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> subject<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.580> has

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
however if you have a subject that has

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.899 
however if you have a subject that has
dark<00:01:27.210> hair<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> dark<00:01:28.590> background

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
dark hair and you have a dark background

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.520 
dark hair and you have a dark background
the<00:01:29.909> subject<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.020> lost<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the subject is going to be lost in the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.590 
the subject is going to be lost in the
background<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> separate<00:01:33.390> that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
background and so to separate that

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.390 
background and so to separate that
subject<00:01:33.990> from<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.170> background<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:35.100> use<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
subject from the background we use the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
subject from the background we use the
separation<00:01:35.880> light<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.780> does<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.170> it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
separation light what that does is it

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.170 
separation light what that does is it
gives<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.470> nice<00:01:37.590> Sheen<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> hair<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.820> an

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
gives a nice Sheen to the hair and an

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.450 
gives a nice Sheen to the hair and an
outline<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:39.990> subject<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:41.130> pulls

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
outline to the subject and really pulls

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.249 
outline to the subject and really pulls

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
take it up a notch this is a very basic

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.539 
take it up a notch this is a very basic
three<00:03:18.139> light<00:03:18.319> setup<00:03:18.560> but<00:03:19.130> it's<00:03:19.250> really<00:03:19.370> the

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
three light setup but it's really the

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.089 
three light setup but it's really the

foundation for all kinds of setups so

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.349 
foundation for all kinds of setups so
we're<00:03:22.310> going<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.459> take<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:22.940> we're<00:03:23.209> going<00:03:23.299> to

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
we're going to take this we're going to

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.530 
we're going to take this we're going to
add<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.900> grid<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.769> reflector<00:03:25.760> throw<00:03:26.090> in<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.239> flag

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
add a grid and reflector throw in a flag

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.140 
add a grid and reflector throw in a flag
and<00:03:26.900> do<00:03:27.290> some<00:03:27.500> really<00:03:27.769> really<00:03:28.040> neat<00:03:28.400> stuff<00:03:28.700> so

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
and do some really really neat stuff so

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.870 
and do some really really neat stuff so
let's<00:03:29.450> get<00:03:29.599> started<00:03:30.489> we're<00:03:31.489> going<00:03:31.609> to<00:03:31.669> start

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
let's get started we're going to start

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.610 
let's get started we're going to start
over<00:03:31.970> here<00:03:32.090> with<00:03:32.269> our<00:03:32.450> key<00:03:32.660> light<00:03:32.870> this<00:03:33.380> is<00:03:33.590> a

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
over here with our key light this is a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.900 
over here with our key light this is a
small<00:03:34.069> softbox

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
small softbox

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.420 
small softbox
attached<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> c-stand<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.709> I<00:03:37.130> wanted<00:03:37.370> to

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
attached to a c-stand and I wanted to

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.800 
attached to a c-stand and I wanted to
make<00:03:37.549> sure<00:03:37.579> that<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:37.970> light<00:03:38.120> didn't<00:03:38.419> spill<00:03:38.690> on

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
make sure that the light didn't spill on

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.110 
make sure that the light didn't spill on
the<00:03:38.900> background<00:03:39.349> so<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:39.530> added<00:03:39.799> a<00:03:40.130> flag<00:03:40.790> and

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
the background so I added a flag and

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.729 
the background so I added a flag and
this<00:03:41.510> really<00:03:41.840> makes<00:03:42.079> sure<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.530> light

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
this really makes sure that the light

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.309 
this really makes sure that the light
hits<00:03:43.280> Megan<00:03:43.760> that<00:03:44.060> stays<00:03:44.329> off<00:03:44.540> this<00:03:44.720> dark<00:03:45.019> area

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
hits Megan that stays off this dark area

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.569 
hits Megan that stays off this dark area
of<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.530> background<00:03:45.980> it's<00:03:46.190> really<00:03:46.220> going<00:03:46.519> to

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
of the background it's really going to

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.940 
of the background it's really going to
be<00:03:46.639> key<00:03:46.880> in<00:03:47.120> our<00:03:47.269> image<00:03:47.630> so<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.349> get<00:03:48.709> some

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
be key in our image so to get some

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.330 
be key in our image so to get some
separation<00:03:49.459> I'm<00:03:49.819> using<00:03:50.299> this<00:03:50.599> 5<00:03:50.870> degree

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
separation I'm using this 5 degree

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.250 
separation I'm using this 5 degree
honeycomb<00:03:52.340> grid<00:03:52.609> and<00:03:53.060> what<00:03:53.209> that<00:03:53.419> does<00:03:53.750> is<00:03:54.139> it

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
honeycomb grid and what that does is it

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.229 
honeycomb grid and what that does is it
makes<00:03:54.440> sure<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:54.859> we<00:03:54.950> have<00:03:55.099> a<00:03:55.130> nice<00:03:55.430> splash<00:03:55.940> of

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
makes sure that we have a nice splash of

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.030 
makes sure that we have a nice splash of
light<00:03:56.450> on<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.780> background<00:03:57.290> but<00:03:57.799> it<00:03:57.919> also

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
light on the background but it also

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.659 
light on the background but it also
controls<00:03:58.489> things<00:03:58.910> so<00:03:59.630> instead<00:04:00.470> of<00:04:00.530> having<00:04:01.310> a

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
controls things so instead of having a

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.309 
controls things so instead of having a
separation<00:04:02.419> light<00:04:02.569> that<00:04:02.750> illuminates<00:04:03.169> our

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
separation light that illuminates our

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.870 
separation light that illuminates our
subject<00:04:03.829> we're<00:04:04.280> illuminating<00:04:04.790> the

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
subject we're illuminating the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.550 
subject we're illuminating the
background<00:04:05.329> does<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.870> same<00:04:06.079> thing<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:06.530> just

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
background does the same thing it just

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.319 
background does the same thing it just
has<00:04:06.829> a<00:04:06.859> little<00:04:07.099> bit<00:04:07.280> different<00:04:07.579> effect<00:04:07.849> and<00:04:08.030> I

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
has a little bit different effect and I

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.460 
has a little bit different effect and I
think<00:04:08.599> looks<00:04:08.780> a<00:04:08.840> little<00:04:09.019> bit<00:04:09.110> grew

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
think looks a little bit grew

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.500 
think looks a little bit grew
so<00:04:10.070> they<00:04:10.190> make<00:04:10.370> sure<00:04:10.520> that<00:04:10.730> we<00:04:10.880> have<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.330> nice

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
so they make sure that we have a nice

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.830 
so they make sure that we have a nice
high<00:04:11.990> contrast<00:04:12.710> image<00:04:13.220> our<00:04:14.150> key<00:04:14.360> lights<00:04:14.570> over

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
high contrast image our key lights over

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.440 
high contrast image our key lights over
here<00:04:14.870> but<00:04:15.680> on<00:04:15.770> this<00:04:15.950> side<00:04:16.220> what<00:04:17.030> I've<00:04:17.120> done<00:04:17.270> is

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
here but on this side what I've done is

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.860 
here but on this side what I've done is
I've<00:04:17.600> constructed<00:04:17.900> this<00:04:18.350> sort<00:04:18.980> of<00:04:19.010> wall<00:04:19.310> of

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
I've constructed this sort of wall of

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.300 
I've constructed this sort of wall of
subtraction<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.260> these<00:04:21.410> black<00:04:21.680> panels<00:04:22.190> are

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
subtraction so these black panels are

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.200 
subtraction so these black panels are
going<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.520> make<00:04:22.640> sure<00:04:22.790> that<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.030> light

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
going to make sure that the light

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.390 
going to make sure that the light
doesn't<00:04:23.420> bounce<00:04:23.690> back<00:04:24.020> into<00:04:24.350> Megan's<00:04:24.590> face<00:04:24.800> so

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
doesn't bounce back into Megan's face so

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.860 
doesn't bounce back into Megan's face so
we'll<00:04:25.520> have<00:04:25.640> a<00:04:25.670> darker<00:04:26.060> side<00:04:26.210> over<00:04:26.450> here<00:04:26.480> a

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
we'll have a darker side over here a

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.140 
we'll have a darker side over here a
lighter<00:04:27.350> side<00:04:27.590> over<00:04:27.830> here<00:04:27.860> so<00:04:28.490> we<00:04:28.640> have<00:04:28.790> side

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
lighter side over here so we have side

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.540 
lighter side over here so we have side
light<00:04:29.390> in<00:04:30.230> addition<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.740> these<00:04:30.830> black<00:04:31.130> panels

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
light in addition to these black panels

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.850 
light in addition to these black panels
higher<00:04:32.060> contrast<00:04:32.750> and<00:04:33.290> to<00:04:33.350> make<00:04:33.500> sure<00:04:33.680> she

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
higher contrast and to make sure she

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.500 
higher contrast and to make sure she
doesn't<00:04:34.040> get<00:04:34.280> lost<00:04:34.580> in<00:04:34.940> that<00:04:34.970> high<00:04:35.240> contrast

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
doesn't get lost in that high contrast

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.710 
doesn't get lost in that high contrast
we<00:04:36.200> have<00:04:36.350> a<00:04:36.380> 5<00:04:36.740> degree<00:04:36.940> spot<00:04:37.940> let<00:04:38.480> me<00:04:38.570> talk

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
we have a 5 degree spot let me talk

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.810 
we have a 5 degree spot let me talk
about<00:04:38.750> these<00:04:39.200> panels<00:04:39.890> over<00:04:40.100> here<00:04:40.250> if<00:04:40.490> you<00:04:40.580> step

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
about these panels over here if you step

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.750 
about these panels over here if you step
over<00:04:40.940> here<00:04:41.120> you'll<00:04:41.900> see<00:04:42.140> that<00:04:42.440> these<00:04:43.400> are<00:04:43.460> the

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
over here you'll see that these are the

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.910 
over here you'll see that these are the
panels<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.390> showed<00:04:44.600> you<00:04:44.720> earlier<00:04:45.080> in<00:04:45.290> episode<00:04:45.650> 4

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
panels I showed you earlier in episode 4

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.820 
panels I showed you earlier in episode 4
and<00:04:46.130> to<00:04:47.090> secure<00:04:47.450> them<00:04:47.660> I<00:04:47.900> have<00:04:48.290> a<00:04:48.350> couple<00:04:48.620> of

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
and to secure them I have a couple of

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.380 
and to secure them I have a couple of
sandbags<00:04:49.130> to<00:04:49.640> make<00:04:49.790> sure<00:04:50.000> that<00:04:50.150> they<00:04:50.240> don't

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
sandbags to make sure that they don't

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.360 
sandbags to make sure that they don't
fall<00:04:50.660> over<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:51.110> I've<00:04:51.620> also<00:04:51.950> secured<00:04:52.310> the

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
fall over and I've also secured the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.920 
fall over and I've also secured the
second<00:04:52.730> one<00:04:52.850> just<00:04:53.120> with<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:53.360> real<00:04:53.540> small

now one of the stars of grip I didn't

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.180 
now one of the stars of grip I didn't
mention<00:04:59.210> last<00:04:59.360> time<00:04:59.720> are<00:05:00.020> ladders<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:01.070> what

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
holds this reflector we can get more

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.100 
holds this reflector we can get more
light<00:05:37.640> underneath<00:05:37.970> Megan's<00:05:38.390> chin<00:05:38.660> or<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:38.990> the
