00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.759 
but on this run I was not looking for
Paul<00:03:48.000> what<00:03:49.000> Justin<00:03:49.419> does<00:03:49.599> not<00:03:49.810> have<00:03:50.109> is<00:03:50.349> Luke

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
Paul what Justin does not have is Luke

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.699 
Paul what Justin does not have is Luke
acts<00:03:51.099> or<00:03:51.489> John<00:03:51.819> he<00:03:52.449> may<00:03:52.629> or<00:03:52.780> may<00:03:52.930> not<00:03:53.109> have<00:03:53.379> mark

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
acts or John he may or may not have mark

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.770 
acts or John he may or may not have mark
but<00:03:54.280> mark<00:03:54.549> should<00:03:54.849> have<00:03:54.970> been<00:03:55.090> available<00:03:55.659> by

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
but mark should have been available by

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.469 
but mark should have been available by
this<00:03:56.109> time<00:03:56.409> mark<00:03:57.280> is<00:03:57.489> simply<00:03:57.819> too<00:03:58.030> much<00:03:58.180> like

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479 
this time mark is simply too much like

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.509 
this time mark is simply too much like
the<00:03:58.629> other<00:03:58.780> synoptic<00:03:59.379> Gospels<00:03:59.889> that<00:04:00.099> mark

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
the other synoptic Gospels that mark

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.420 
the other synoptic Gospels that mark
quotes<00:04:00.790> end<00:04:01.060> up<00:04:01.209> being<00:04:01.449> difficult<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:02.109> find<00:04:02.430> so

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
quotes end up being difficult to find so

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.759 
quotes end up being difficult to find so
on<00:04:03.760> this<00:04:04.000> run<00:04:04.239> we<00:04:04.479> found<00:04:04.750> some<00:04:05.019> more<00:04:05.229> gems

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
on this run we found some more gems

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.680 
on this run we found some more gems
Justin's<00:04:06.430> account<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.879> the<00:04:06.940> birth<00:04:07.090> that<00:04:07.269> Jesus

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
Justin's account of the birth that Jesus

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.839 
Justin's account of the birth that Jesus
comes<00:04:08.019> from<00:04:08.199> the<00:04:08.319> Gospel<00:04:08.680> of<00:04:08.769> James<00:04:09.099> and<00:04:09.340> is

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
comes from the Gospel of James and is

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.689 
comes from the Gospel of James and is
inconsistent<00:04:10.299> with<00:04:10.780> Luke's<00:04:11.079> account<00:04:11.699> one

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
inconsistent with Luke's account one

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.280 
inconsistent with Luke's account one
other<00:04:12.879> fascinating<00:04:13.449> thing<00:04:13.810> that<00:04:13.989> was<00:04:14.109> found

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
other fascinating thing that was found

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.620 
other fascinating thing that was found
here<00:04:14.709> is<00:04:14.829> that<00:04:15.280> Matthew's<00:04:15.760> infancy<00:04:16.120> account

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
here is that Matthew's infancy account

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.259 
here is that Matthew's infancy account
appears<00:04:17.349> to<00:04:17.560> be<00:04:17.709> also<00:04:17.979> consistent<00:04:18.880> with<00:04:18.940> the

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
appears to be also consistent with the

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.260 
appears to be also consistent with the
Gospel<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.900> James<00:04:20.199> James<00:04:21.099> may<00:04:21.340> have<00:04:21.549> priority

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
Gospel of James James may have priority

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.990 
Gospel of James James may have priority
over<00:04:22.300> Matthew<00:04:22.750> as<00:04:23.050> well<00:04:23.320> so<00:04:24.250> right<00:04:24.490> now<00:04:24.700> this

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
over Matthew as well so right now this

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.360 
over Matthew as well so right now this
is<00:04:25.180> where<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.510> synoptic<00:04:25.990> Gospels<00:04:26.020> line<00:04:26.680> up

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
is where the synoptic Gospels line up

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.189 
is where the synoptic Gospels line up
we<00:04:27.490> have<00:04:27.639> no<00:04:27.850> certainty<00:04:28.330> on<00:04:28.510> Matthew<00:04:28.990> or<00:04:29.169> mark

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
we have no certainty on Matthew or mark

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.129 
we have no certainty on Matthew or mark
dating<00:04:30.070> however<00:04:30.729> Luke<00:04:31.300> is<00:04:31.540> consistent<00:04:32.080> with

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
dating however Luke is consistent with

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.430 
dating however Luke is consistent with
169<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:33.070> 183<00:04:33.520> in<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.240> era<00:04:34.449> of<00:04:34.720> Theophilus<00:04:35.290> of

Antioch the Gospel of James probably had

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.430 
Antioch the Gospel of James probably had
priority<00:04:39.160> over<00:04:39.699> Matthew<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.360> definitely<00:04:41.199> has

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
priority over Matthew and definitely has

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
priority over Luke this is a very big

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.900 
priority over Luke this is a very big
deal<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:44.650> it<00:04:45.100> should<00:04:45.310> make<00:04:45.520> things<00:04:45.760> much

deal and it should make things much

simpler<00:04:46.600> to<00:04:46.630> track

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
however the sources before Justin Martyr

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.890
