a video how you can make puri so this is

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.460 
a video how you can make puri so this is
as<00:00:05.819> you<00:00:05.970> can<00:00:06.000> see<00:00:06.180> this<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.720> same<00:00:07.080> dough

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
as you can see this is the same dough

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.009 
as you can see this is the same dough
like<00:00:08.220> that<00:00:08.790> we<00:00:08.940> showed<00:00:09.240> how<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.540> can<00:00:09.809> make<00:00:09.960> a

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
like that we showed how you can make a

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.110 
like that we showed how you can make a
whole<00:00:10.380> wheat<00:00:10.769> flour<00:00:10.800> dough<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.429> them<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
whole wheat flour dough in them in the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.780 
whole wheat flour dough in them in the
video<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.540> making<00:00:12.929> rotis<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.429> dough

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
video of making rotis so this is a dough

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.029 
video of making rotis so this is a dough
in<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.260> made<00:00:16.470> basically<00:00:16.890> a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
in the so you have made basically a

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.950 
in the so you have made basically a
dough<00:00:17.250> from<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> whole<00:00:17.789> wheat<00:00:17.970> floor<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.510> now

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
dough from the whole wheat floor and now

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.390 
dough from the whole wheat floor and now
we'll<00:00:19.199> show<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.920> steps<00:00:20.130> are<00:00:20.369> very

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
we'll show you the steps are very

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.060 
we'll show you the steps are very
similar<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.090> making<00:00:21.630> roti<00:00:21.840> except<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.890> you

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
similar to making roti except that you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.009 
similar to making roti except that you
will<00:00:23.220> fly<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.180> rather<00:00:24.390> than<00:00:24.570> putting<00:00:24.810> it

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
will fly this one rather than putting it

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.339 
will fly this one rather than putting it
on<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> pan<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.949> heat<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.849> let's<00:00:27.420> let's<00:00:27.720> just<00:00:28.199> get

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
how many porous are we going to make two

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.690 
how many porous are we going to make two
please<00:00:42.390> ok<00:00:44.030> as<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:46.070> so<00:00:47.070> first<00:00:47.430> we

ready usually this this use this should
come<00:00:56.160> up<00:00:57.140> come<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.199> brown<00:00:58.789> so<00:01:00.109> looks<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.199> our

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
come up come up brown so looks like our

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.160 
come up come up brown so looks like our
oil<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.859> not<00:01:02.190> how<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.579> make<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.420> already<00:01:04.019> here

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
oil is not how to make is already here

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.149 
oil is not how to make is already here
no<00:01:04.379> no<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.100> let's<00:01:05.549> not<00:01:05.850> ever<00:01:06.390> make<00:01:06.750> that

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
no no it's not let's not ever make that

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.429 
no no it's not let's not ever make that
ok<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.220> vile<00:01:09.119> oil<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.689> still<00:01:09.810> getting<00:01:10.170> heated

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
ok so vile oil is still getting heated

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.469 
ok so vile oil is still getting heated
will<00:01:11.070> show<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.790> make<00:01:11.970> free<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> are

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
will show you can make free so you are

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.630 
will show you can make free so you are
dipping<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.020> oil<00:01:13.140> right<00:01:13.470> right<00:01:13.830> ok<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.430> this

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
dipping it in oil right right ok so this

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.190 
dipping it in oil right right ok so this
is<00:01:14.760> something<00:01:15.000> different<00:01:15.270> than<00:01:15.659> making<00:01:15.869> roti

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
is something different than making roti

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.620 
is something different than making roti
then<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.130> roti<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.640> didn't<00:01:17.909> dip<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
then so in roti we didn't dip it in the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.130 
then so in roti we didn't dip it in the
oil<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.729> for<00:01:20.729> making<00:01:21.119> puri<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.720> already

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
oil but for making puri we already

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.179 
oil but for making puri we already
dipped<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:23.360> rondo<00:01:24.360> into<00:01:25.049> oil<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.470> now<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:25.979> are

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
dipped the rondo into oil and now we are

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.249 
dipped the rondo into oil and now we are
trying<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.640> give<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> circle<00:01:27.450> shape<00:01:30.259> again

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
trying to give it a circle shape again

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.670 
trying to give it a circle shape again
don't<00:01:31.790> focus<00:01:32.790> too<00:01:32.970> much<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> shape<00:01:33.900> shape

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
don't focus too much on the shape shape

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.710 
don't focus too much on the shape shape
is<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:35.130> important<00:01:35.640> all<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.820> Furies<00:01:36.299> around

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
is not important all the Furies around

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.999 
is not important all the Furies around
but<00:01:37.159> it's<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.909> will<00:01:39.210> come<00:01:39.420> by<00:01:39.570> practice<00:01:43.009> so

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
but it's it will come by practice so

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.749 
but it's it will come by practice so
these<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.250> our<00:01:44.759> two<00:01:45.979> non-porous<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.399> want<00:01:47.579> to

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
these are our two non-porous you want to

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.999 
these are our two non-porous you want to
have<00:01:47.939> them<00:01:48.180> small<00:01:48.540> usually<00:01:48.810> Puri<00:01:49.290> Saar<00:01:49.380> medium

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
have them small usually Puri Saar medium

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.429 
have them small usually Puri Saar medium
sized<00:01:50.250> rotis<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.270> bigger<00:01:51.479> size<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.079> buoys

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
sized rotis can be bigger size but buoys

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.429 
sized rotis can be bigger size but buoys
are<00:01:52.649> traditionally<00:01:53.640> small<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.450> small<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
are traditionally small is small and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:07.200 
are traditionally small is small and
thin

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.110 

okay<00:02:08.210> so<00:02:08.570> let's<00:02:08.810> see<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:09.979> not<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:10.970> our

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
okay so let's see this is not so our

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.810 
okay so let's see this is not so our
listen<00:02:11.570> so<00:02:12.500> we<00:02:12.620> should<00:02:12.800> still<00:02:13.070> wait<00:02:13.280> for<00:02:13.340> the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
listen so we should still wait for the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.420 
listen so we should still wait for the
oil<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.120> get<00:02:14.360> heated<00:02:14.720> up<00:02:14.950> meanwhile<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.250> can

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
oil to get heated up meanwhile you can

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.420 
oil to get heated up meanwhile you can
see<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.330> curry<00:02:18.200> we<00:02:18.530> were<00:02:18.680> trying<00:02:19.250> to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
see this is the curry we were trying to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.480 
see this is the curry we were trying to
cook<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.850> think<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:20.570> been<00:02:20.840> like<00:02:21.200> six<00:02:22.100> seven

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
cook I think it's been like six seven

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
turn off the gas just one yet ok we want

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.830 
turn off the gas just one yet ok we want
it<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.810> be<00:03:07.050> more<00:03:07.260> thicker<00:03:08.090> ok<00:03:09.090> we'll<00:03:09.599> we'll

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
it to be more thicker ok we'll we'll

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.470 
it to be more thicker ok we'll we'll
allow<00:03:10.140> more<00:03:10.410> water<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.830> boil<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.120> it's

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
allow more water to boil so that it's

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.970 
allow more water to boil so that it's
more<00:03:12.630> sticker<00:03:13.880> first<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.270> think<00:03:16.230> our<00:03:16.380> oil<00:03:16.709> is

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
more sticker first I think our oil is

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:28.630 
more sticker first I think our oil is
getting<00:03:17.160> heated<00:03:17.489> now<00:03:26.660> yes<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.810> done<00:03:27.989> me<00:03:28.140> proud

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
getting heated now yes it done me proud

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.250 
getting heated now yes it done me proud
ok<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.060> turned<00:03:30.300> round<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:30.750> probably

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
ok so it turned round so probably

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.979 
ok so it turned round so probably
possibly<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.370> oil<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.700> hot<00:03:32.730> now<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.720> if<00:03:33.810> they

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
possibly the oil is hot now so if they

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.320 
possibly the oil is hot now so if they
want<00:03:34.019> they<00:03:34.380> can<00:03:34.440> they<00:03:35.100> can<00:03:35.130> take<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.940> test<00:03:36.150> it

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
want they can they can take and test it

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.660 
want they can they can take and test it
with<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.569> small<00:03:36.900> piece<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.200> dough<00:03:37.799> right<00:03:38.069> yeah

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
with a small piece of dough right yeah

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.050 
with a small piece of dough right yeah
so<00:03:39.560> we<00:03:40.560> can<00:03:40.739> test<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.130> with<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.310> like<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.730> small

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
so we can test it with the like a small

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.030 
so we can test it with the like a small
piece<00:03:42.269> of<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.930> put<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.500> probably<00:03:43.650> this

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
piece of this and put it probably this

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.360 
piece of this and put it probably this
dough<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.790> oil<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.750> now<00:03:45.959> if<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.470> oil<00:03:46.769> is

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
dough in the oil so now if the oil is

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.309 
dough in the oil so now if the oil is
hot<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.819> will<00:03:47.910> see<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:48.390> should<00:03:48.600> come<00:03:48.900> up<00:03:48.930> to

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
hot you will see this should come up to

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.289 
hot you will see this should come up to
the<00:03:49.440> top<00:03:49.910> quickly<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.690> can<00:03:51.840> see<00:03:52.080> it's<00:03:53.299> far

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
the top quickly you can see it's far

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:00.660 
the top quickly you can see it's far
better
