 Hey, guys, there's a white blue demon in the area. 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.280
 I'm here with one more tutorial 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.580

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.810
 playstation amateur memory card 

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:22.119
 It's good to see that many people have difficulty 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.070
 I thought maybe I'll make the video. 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.919
 it's a very simple thing 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.059
 then you will stay in this link of the 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:37.300
 application that will download the hoodie 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:40.270
 aido memory card simulator 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.180
 There you go and save a folder. 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.870
 Wanna feel the desktop? 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.920

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.800
 Good , it'll be here on the desktop. 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:03.700
 This simulator is what you are going to do. 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.000
 You're going to enter flirting go in 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.390

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.720
 check one of you will select there 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:20.080
 you go to where you have saved and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.549
 these are regulars manicardi are you 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.920
 select go in ok simple only that has 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.180
 a however if you are to rename file 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.729
 to let type so your name your name 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.140
 to know that manicardi acts for example 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.479
 to be divided 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.280
 you can not afford this point mcr 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.100
 because otherwise it will give shit 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.659
 type it will put in another format the 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.409
 file and will not work 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.670

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.840

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.840
