00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Today in the test an accessory that you on 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.640
 miss any case if you have it 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.770
 once bought has a so-called 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.250
 power bank that is an external battery 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.599
 in the case of the company age or ideas 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.849
 whatever it is we pronounced 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.980
 10,400 milliamp hours and we 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.000
 look at the part now in the test 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.000
 stay tuned 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.480
 nice that you stayed tuned to 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.120
 test of the power bank with 10.400 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.760
 milliole hours of ea genes or four 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.739
 Batteries 2600 milliamps from the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.329
 company samsung has the manufacturer here in 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.399
 the device is integrated 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.559
 it is not a small one 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.219
 power bank so much in advance with you 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.350
 14 centimeters in length about 63 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.629
 centimeters in width and two 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.000
 centimeters in thickness are 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.649
 a decent bremer of about 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.960
 as big as an apple smartphone 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 but much heavier 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.410
 because the four batteries of samsung Trang 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.420
 neat weight 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.739
 you can not just with products from them 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.900
 apple but also from everyone else 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.720
 possible companies like htc samsung and co 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.970
 charge and the bank has to 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.890
 two exits we are now in 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.290
 detail the two outputs 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.060
 are here on the left side 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.830
 you see already above output 5 volt 1 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.140
 ampere and below is an output with 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.000
 five gold and 2.1 ampere so for the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.170
 fast chargers from the home apple 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.850
 samsung and co 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.770
 you can here then down her 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.780
 Of course you can do both at the same time 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 use then shares however the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.549
 2.1 ampere output power when it 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.740
 correctly formulate on the two 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.000
 Devices and you have two times 1 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 ampere and that's how they last 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.530
 of course much longer 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.799
 as if he only got one on here now 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.570
 Invite me to the model of them 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.970
 I liked it a lot 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.530
 Finish this little lcd display 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.210
 it is already blue and it is illuminated 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.119
 turns off after a short time and it 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.200
 shows you how much 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.939
 capacity wants to rank 97 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.619
 we also have in the corresponding 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.390
 and off switch is pressed once 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.340
 we activate the display we hold 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.329
 the power button is pressed longer then 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.310
 you have already seen 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.750
 then the whole thing will be natural 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.709
 switched off so that the battery no current 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.450
 can give more 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.300
 that has very good in the test with me 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.060
 works i have s 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.850
 several months were lying and loud 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.890
 display no discharge notice 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.960
 how can you say everything so well 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.370
 has an end only the sausage has two that 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.750
 does not fit here so completely but everything 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.150
 what has an exit must of course 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.860
 also have an input here and we 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.340
 See the one below with the little one 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.620
 charge led a micro usb input and 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.120
 You can charge the device for that 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.890
 should, however, also a corresponding 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.390
 high quality charger take that for 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.010
 is not part of the delivery 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.960
 if you like a nice apple 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.730
 charger with 10 watts or so then 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.620
 the part in about four to five hours 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.750
 charged when the output power 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.370
 Your charger is a bit weaker 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.830
 then it can be eight to nine 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.290
 lasts until the 10,400 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.390
 Milliamps are fully charged thanks 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.240
 at least you always see the display 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.360
 how far are you just 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.880
 to the scope of delivery of the xv x2 mentioned 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.680
 power bank, you own these three 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.420
 shapely adapter that you can use 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.280
 by just a normal micro usb 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.390
 cable the top of a prop and then have 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.040
 we have special adapters here for example 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.470
 for the old nokia standard in the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.040
 middle for the old apple standard and 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.900
 here we have the old usb standard 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.600
 what we lack is actually one 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.190
 adapters on lightning are available here 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.590
 unfortunately not with it so that he the 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.360
 current devices from home apple only 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.880
 with the corresponding in addition to 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.680
 I can charge acquiring cable 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.560
 because something is prepared because I have that 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.610
 supplied cable directly into mine 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.470
 android smartphone plugged in and how 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.820
 he just can see it loads 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.980
 in fact that would have me too 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.810
 wondered the built-in battery at the 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.340
 small scooter is not all that 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.440
 powerful so he naturally after 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.600
 a short time already charged is that 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.239
 whole changes but if you others 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.060
 things like here, for example 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.940
 apple iphone which, of course, too 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.060
 Charged up in a few hours 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.050
 to the apple ipad or other 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.430
 Android tablet whose batteries are natural 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.290
 are significantly larger and therefore decreases 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.330
 The loading process then easy 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.430
 longer time to complete 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.780
 depending on how big the battery is if you 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.299
 for example, batteries from the ipad he take with me 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.519
 mah than 8,000 then 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.950
 Of course, this battery only after a few 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.930
 hours charged and the energy in 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.640
 europe bank is then actually 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.570
 so to speak in the end so they in 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.620
 end effect depending on the battery power yours 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.940
 Term of the smartphones 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.250
 maybe even triple 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.360
 and probably with normal tablets 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.600
 rather double 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.210
 what speaks for the xbox two power bank 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.880
 from ea gene first and very first 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.740
 the price the thing comes namely only 25 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.630
 second, we have a nice euro 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.580
 lcd display that always shows me 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.800
 how many rest services the built-in 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.240
 Battery still delivers 10,400 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.190
 milliahours as I said from the 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.510
 home samsung with it I can do it 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.770
 every case a smartphone two to 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.960
 reload three times and also one 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.520
 latest tablet at least once again 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.140
 completely recharge 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.760
 I also liked the fact 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.260
 that I theoretically ever get two devices 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.640
 can load at the same time, however 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.590
 only with 1 amp each 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.780
 output power and accordingly 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.220
 longer term 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.840
 I would say this thing is real 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.430
 Great thing I was missing is in 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.260
 end only the lightning adapter 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.910
 the thing is not working ex works that is 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.320
 You have to take your own cable 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.850
 otherwise you can here with this 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.950
 cable and adapter actually all 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.490
 Get current devices alive from 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.729
 therefore 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.770
 thumbs up for this useful accessory 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.479
 if you liked the little review 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.700
 Of course, I'm happy about yours 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.919
 chance and likes and thumbs up too 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.660
 very important, just write in 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.289
 the comments what you get from the power 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:44.950
 banks hold or whether you prefer to 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.570
 I am using a good old socket 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.430
 thank you for your attention and 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.760
 say as always, do it well and until the 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.760
 days 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.189
 luck
