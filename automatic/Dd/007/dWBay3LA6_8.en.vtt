00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
pricey but you just put distilled water

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.140 
pricey but you just put distilled water
in<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.799> it<00:02:25.920> works<00:02:26.160> amazingly<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.060> i've

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
in it and it works amazingly and i've

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.330 
in it and it works amazingly and i've

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.319 
if you can't exactly afford that i
definitely<00:02:32.220> recommend<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.940> boil<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.299> pot

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
of water and stand over it it may not be

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:50.590 
of water and stand over it it may not be
as<00:02:36.180> glamorous<00:02:36.450> but<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.049> does<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.440> job
