00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.720
 Welcome to the home of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.910
 master thief garrett a huge 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.260
 clock tower I think you can see the same 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.660
 at first glance the game is created 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.950
 no longer primary for xbox 360 and ps3 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.350
 rather, the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.660
 xbox's power of ps4 and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.520
 modern pcs optimized you see 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.410
 foggy air quite cool 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.210
 lighting and also right now 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.350
 Effectively make you playful the whole thing 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.019
 a little bit easier 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.820
 but an optional you can namely 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.140
 activate the so-called focus mode 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.880
 then be certain interaction 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.230
 points in the world highlighted in blue 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.450
 That's for example this rope 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.309
 or even the ladder or up there 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.200
 this little blue dot over the crate 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.910
 there we can now take part in a fire 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.800
 and can shoot at it then crashes 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.390
 down the slope and allows us 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.770
 then up to kill her so we new 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.260
 section can reach where else 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.250
 can not be gotten 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.110
 We're going to go right now 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.149
 all this interaction and climbing 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.230
 so on, it works relatively intuitively 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.210
 there's basically taken a 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.100
 Pressing the button could remind the whole thing 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.989
 pretty much assassin's just creed it 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.430
 just from the ego-perspective 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.629
 what works naturally 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.460
 playful focus is mine 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.630
 the game is called her cloud ran a lot 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.070
 zeug we have just now here so 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.750
 got a thing out of a drawer 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.740
 Now we can see this picture here 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.510
 manipulate that works 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.180
 like this he is fumbling on the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.650
 frame around until you see her somewhere 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.119
 Now that there is a point with that 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.409
 we interact and can do such a thing 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.880
 small switch press and the same 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.100
 will do again in the right side 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.540
 and then the picture disappears 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.040
 finally or we can open it 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.960
 and then take a sweetheart with you 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.299
 all converted immediately into gold 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.439
 what we can spend later if we 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.729
 Somewhere you do not just go in there 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.229
 Finally we have sonatas 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.759
 iron with it we can 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.020
 window on which we naturally 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.520
 always have to pay attention that we 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.530
 not to be discovered for example 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.420
 Betters are sitting right here in the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.189
 corner down this rather harmless 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.600
 and we do nothing but otherwise they are 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.979
 Roads actually full of weapons 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.840
 also very quickly aware of you 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.729
 so synonymous if the graphics are the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.649
 really beautiful seduced to the topic 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.060
 stops and has to look around 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.380
 you still always be on your guard 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.180
 because if you are discovered then it will 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.740
 it quickly becomes relatively chubby or 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.960
 tricky but what about the game like that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.280
 thought is through the indication below 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.899
 left in the picture there you see one now 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.759
 black dot within these two 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.989
 Curved lines is now 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.310
 completely black that means we are 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.989
 invisible and you should too 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.560
 actually try to always be by 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.750
 easy 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.920
 Cover must cover if you want 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.630
 Of course you can also try 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.040
 with the guards maybe what 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.440
 still works if there are two because 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.090
 then you can now here with a zb 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.580
 turn off the bow then he is already 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.050
 let's go then but also the other one 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.220
 immediately aware of it and then 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.840
 we should run and cut 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.840
 try to turn it off in close combat 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.810
 if you want to avoid it 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.099
 it is always the opponent to create 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.780
 better if he is not on the street 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.410
 besides being on the road , he is so over 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.670
 the roofs 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.200
 we can go here again 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.700
 see how all these parcours elements 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.480
 work as for example yourself 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.489
 somewhere up and move over 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.319
 lockouts or jump here 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.120
 balance one over the beam 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.620
 and then jump away over several bars 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.450
 All this works pretty well 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.620
 easy and looks cool and 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.360
 had fled coolly 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.280
 I had previously explained that 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.019
 the treasures he finds directly in gold 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.489
 can be converted that in turn you can 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.110
 give out for example for different 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.090
 arrows as they have always been 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.190
 deep sea is eg a waterfall or the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.349
 fire arrow or just arrows the 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.819
 to hit clean what you meet 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.400
 Alternatively, you can do as well 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.500
 you buy upgrades for example more 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.579
 hurt for your bow or that he 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.530
 take less harm if you 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.299
 met improved melee 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.890
 or completely new items such as 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.040
 for example, this wirecard is one of these 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.060
 Art kicked Schneider or Saved this 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.290
 that is something like a 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.510
 wrench or like a ratchet 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.750
 and we'll see the m again soon 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.769
 in use 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.150
 we climb here now again 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.410
 about a few opponents on a rope around 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.730
 can now here in such a way 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.350
 calls for jumping and then a flat 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.989
 get there and we'll see you again 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.329
 what the focus engine in detail or too 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.530
 in the smaller parts of the area 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.880
 we see we could go to 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.959
 make out the candles, for example 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.819
 a few are lying on the desk 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.260
 things we can collect there is 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.180
 again something with the painting back there 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.829
 or here in the closet we can 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.269
 open the closet and there it is again 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.620
 the gold kathrin also brings us 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.480
 equal to a bit of gold still a 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.829
 the picture in the corner we can easily 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.510
 it's straight out of the frame 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.239
 a so-called collect evil so one 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.920
 several of them collect the items 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.600
 in the city or in the section 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.130
 are hidden then there is still one 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.350
 letter on the table also around 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.060
 collective then there's a piece of all 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.320
 of course with and then though 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.609
 it is actually obsolete now because 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.440
 we have stolen everything we still have 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.760
 the candles are out and you can join them here now 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.320
 the wrench of this grid 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.669
 open and climb out of it 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.440
 that he is such a typical thing as you are 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.440
 from playing knows very well 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.009
 the bow of yours a little 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.000
 Of course, it's all-purpose weapon 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.650
 not only good for that with it 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.240
 You can shoot enemies directly 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.620
 thus also generate distraction by 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.900
 for example, here on this back 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.100
 book or what's up there shoot start 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.120
 the waking and we have the 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.289
 opportunity then here with the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.979
 wrench this plaque 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.600
 unscrew 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.380
 This is also a scrapbook that we 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.380
 can take with you here 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.700
 Unfortunately , we will be here now 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.490
 we still want to flee 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.660
 discovered then we see here already and 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.070
 we also hear it at the screaming and 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.640
 There are several opponents behind a sound 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.260
 us 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.400
 that means that only makes sense how 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.620
 climb here now on the roofs and 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.120
 make us from the field now one more 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.100
 Trifle to the end is also something 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.660
 one knows from other games that is 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.130
 Cracking locks that works too 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.600
 easier if you have the focus mode 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.220
 then you see where you are 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.630
 push these individual parts is 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.040
 so that finally closed on the 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.830
 jumps open and you open the safe 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.840
 yes and that was synonymous with it first 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.160
 this very short section looks like 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.910
 certainly until the release comes 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.540
 lots more 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.540
 bye bye
