 Ilya want to tell you today about 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.970
 this amazing tool is called 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:21.850
 glitches it is very little version of who is it 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.180
 still come up well, that invariably it 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.130
 the fact that this instrument in two years is 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.230
 the youngest instrument on our 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.150
 the planet and now he is very fast 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.940
 gaining its popularity by 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.659
 its sounding sound chime 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.989
 bells 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:42.699

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.120
 my mind really clears the space and 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.530
 harmonizes both the inner world and 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.569
 exterior space of the home 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.569

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.159
 I am sure that you will appreciate this 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.680
 the tool is not to be 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.360
 some musician don't have a hearing 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.360

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.430
 sizes and they are all different in rank and 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.210

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.210
 two-way Krakow he 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.430
 the sound is completely different from 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.610
 This glitch background is due to the thickness of the metal and 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.850
 hall beskov this tool still calls 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.520

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.890
 reed drum due to these languages 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.140
 which cuts through in metal every 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.590
 the icon tunes to its note and to 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.330
 its tonality and for it turns out 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.310
 cacophony of music music which 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.790
