togekiss<00:01:02.250> would<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.090> flinch<00:01:03.390> guess<00:01:03.660> what

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
togekiss would be like flinch guess what

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.219 
togekiss would be like flinch guess what
Lynch<00:01:05.129> flinching<00:01:05.939> one<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.720> went<00:01:07.020> through<00:01:07.110> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
Lynch flinching one so I went through a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.500 
Lynch flinching one so I went through a
substitute<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> expecting<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.180> thunder

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
substitute but I expecting a thunder

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.690 
substitute but I expecting a thunder
wave<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.650> thunder<00:01:10.950> wave<00:01:11.040> was<00:01:11.310> exactly

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
wave and the thunder wave was exactly

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.940 
wave and the thunder wave was exactly
what<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.880> got<00:01:12.500> substitute<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> good<00:01:13.920> idea

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
what I got substitute was a good idea

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.310 
what I got substitute was a good idea
that<00:01:14.490> anyway<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.150> scout<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:15.840> tokus

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that anyway just to scout out what tokus

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.719 
that anyway just to scout out what tokus
can<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.680> because<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.189> know<00:01:17.310> they're<00:01:17.460> pretty

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.240 

varied<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:21.780> they<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.500> but

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
varied as to what they can get up to but

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.940 
varied as to what they can get up to but
I<00:01:23.580> chose<00:01:23.880> right<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.900> turn<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.170> say<00:01:25.500> go<00:01:25.710> with

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
I chose right so this turn I say go with

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.929 
I chose right so this turn I say go with
a<00:01:26.400> car<00:01:26.700> mine's<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:28.140> gets<00:01:28.439> my<00:01:29.310> special<00:01:29.670> attack

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
a car mine's just gets my special attack

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.190 
a car mine's just gets my special attack
up<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.920> special<00:01:31.920> defense<00:01:32.509> as<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.810> didn't<00:01:34.049> seem

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
up and special defense as it didn't seem

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.600 
up and special defense as it didn't seem
as<00:01:34.350> though<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:34.890> would<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.220> physical

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
as though this one would be a physical

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.930 
as though this one would be a physical
Toby<00:01:36.030> guess<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.619> carmine<00:01:38.579> gets<00:01:38.939> off<00:01:39.090> no<00:01:39.299> sweat

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
Toby guess so carmine gets off no sweat

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.130 
Toby guess so carmine gets off no sweat
that<00:01:41.630> my<00:01:42.170> opponent<00:01:42.940> kind<00:01:43.940> of<00:01:44.030> surprised<00:01:44.450> me<00:01:44.690> by

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
that my opponent kind of surprised me by

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.290 
that my opponent kind of surprised me by
having<00:01:45.320> shadow-born<00:01:45.860> nesto<00:01:46.580> guess<00:01:46.940> because<00:01:47.180> I

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
having shadow-born nesto guess because I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.550 
having shadow-born nesto guess because I
thought<00:01:47.510> like<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:47.960> said<00:01:48.140> I<00:01:48.170> thought<00:01:48.410> it<00:01:48.470> was

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
thought like I said I thought it was

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.950 
thought like I said I thought it was
gonna<00:01:48.680> be<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:49.700> know<00:01:49.790> fund<00:01:50.090> away<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.390> an<00:01:50.480> air<00:01:50.630> /

gonna be you know fund away of an air /
flinching<00:01:51.590> one<00:01:51.800> but<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.760> probably<00:01:53.030> wasn't<00:01:53.480> if

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
flinching one but it probably wasn't if

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.250 
flinching one but it probably wasn't if
I<00:01:53.900> had<00:01:54.020> jello<00:01:54.290> ball<00:01:54.620> but<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:56.240> obviously<00:01:56.630> gets

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
I had jello ball but that obviously gets

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.960 
I had jello ball but that obviously gets
rid<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.440> my<00:01:57.560> substitute<00:01:58.190> which<00:01:58.520> was<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.700> bit<00:01:58.880> of

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
rid of my substitute which was a bit of

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.840 
rid of my substitute which was a bit of
a<00:01:59.030> pain<00:01:59.210> but<00:01:59.600> I<00:01:59.660> a<00:02:00.080> I<00:02:00.260> expected<00:02:00.920> something<00:02:01.640> that

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
a pain but I a I expected something that

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.870 
a pain but I a I expected something that
I'm<00:02:01.970> like<00:02:02.150> at<00:02:02.360> least<00:02:02.540> like<00:02:02.690> an<00:02:02.930> air<00:02:03.050> /<00:02:03.320> coming

I'm like at least like an air / coming
but<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:04.910> decide<00:02:05.270> go<00:02:05.420> with<00:02:05.570> Thunderball<00:02:05.930> this

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
but I decide go with Thunderball this

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.040 
but I decide go with Thunderball this
turn<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:06.560> was<00:02:06.950> hoping<00:02:07.070> he<00:02:07.400> wouldn't<00:02:08.229> try<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:11.050> use

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
Thunder Wave again this turn may be
