before purchasing restaurant 3 I spent a

few hours searching the net for
information<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.500> compatibility<00:00:41.070> with

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
information on the compatibility with

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.610 
information on the compatibility with
Power<00:00:41.760> Systems<00:00:42.329> different<00:00:43.020> sites<00:00:43.350> offer

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
Power Systems different sites offer

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.860 
Power Systems different sites offer
different<00:00:44.160> explanations<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.210> some<00:00:45.660> would

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
different explanations like some would

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.190 
different explanations like some would
say<00:00:46.200> doesn't<00:00:46.890> work<00:00:47.129> with<00:00:47.309> any<00:00:47.430> games<00:00:48.200> someone

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
say doesn't work with any games someone

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.380 
say doesn't work with any games someone
say<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.410> works<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.770> few<00:00:50.120> some<00:00:51.120> would<00:00:51.270> say

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
say it works with a few some would say

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.619 
say it works with a few some would say
it<00:00:51.510> works<00:00:51.690> with<00:00:51.840> every<00:00:52.050> game<00:00:53.270> maybe<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.360> didn't

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
it works with every game maybe I didn't

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.020 
it works with every game maybe I didn't
search<00:00:54.899> enough<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.949> decided<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.910> would<00:00:56.969> be

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
search enough but I decided it would be

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.270 
search enough but I decided it would be
a<00:00:57.120> good<00:00:57.210> idea<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.690> make<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:57.899> video<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.590> all

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
a good idea to make this video for all

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.400 
a good idea to make this video for all
the<00:00:59.430> collectors<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.940> power<00:01:00.210> regions<00:01:00.780> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the collectors in power regions to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.260 
the collectors in power regions to
basically<00:01:01.890> give<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.190> an<00:01:02.370> idea<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.000> power

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
basically give you an idea on the power

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.770 
basically give you an idea on the power
compatibility<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> system

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
compatibility in the system

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.310 
compatibility in the system
alright<00:01:06.780> let's<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.880> first<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.320> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
alright let's get to it first of all to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.050 
alright let's get to it first of all to
plug<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.580> will<00:01:11.700> need<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.909> get<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
plug it in you will need to get a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.670 
plug it in you will need to get a
step-down<00:01:12.780> converter<00:01:15.979> because<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:18.680> will

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
step-down converter because this will

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.460 
step-down converter because this will
not<00:01:19.860> work<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.030> UK<00:01:22.520> this<00:01:24.140> will<00:01:25.140> convert

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
not work in the UK this will convert

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.230 
not work in the UK this will convert
that<00:01:26.090> to<00:01:27.090> run<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.970> see<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:33.060> just

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
that to run with that see that you just

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.530 
that to run with that see that you just
plug<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.570> in

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.690 

like<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.110> plug<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.850> yeah<00:01:42.049> okay

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
like that and you plug that in yeah okay

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.130 
like that and you plug that in yeah okay
I'll<00:01:44.700> leave<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> link<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> description

below and a bit of information on which

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.710 
below and a bit of information on which
converter<00:01:50.640> you'll<00:01:50.909> need<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.210> buy<00:01:51.360> because<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
converter you'll need to buy because you

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.630 
converter you'll need to buy because you
can't<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.110> go<00:01:52.259> buy<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.649> any<00:01:52.770> cheap<00:01:53.130> crap<00:01:53.460> I

into the console but it does have
component<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.200> course<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:22.709> plugged<00:02:22.950> in

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
component of course and it's plugged in

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.500 
component of course and it's plugged in
there<00:02:23.989> with<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.110> scarf<00:02:25.790> what<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.940> will<00:02:27.239> need

with Powell and French mega drive

00:04:48.490 --> 00:05:03.060 
with Powell and French mega drive
systems<00:04:49.290> so<00:04:50.290> that<00:04:50.320> won't<00:04:50.680> work<00:04:51.840> but<00:04:52.840> I<00:05:02.070> think

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
systems so that won't work but I think

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:16.809 
systems so that won't work but I think
that's<00:05:03.250> info<00:05:03.610> I<00:05:07.410> do<00:05:08.410> that

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:16.819 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:21.249 

you<00:05:17.270> get<00:05:17.389> Sonic<00:05:17.749> 3<00:05:17.930> &amp;<00:05:17.990> Knuckles<00:05:19.749> so<00:05:20.749> that<00:05:20.960> does

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
you get Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles so that does

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.529 
you get Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles so that does
work<00:05:24.129> now<00:05:25.129> I'll<00:05:25.339> just<00:05:25.370> show<00:05:25.699> you<00:05:25.879> a<00:05:26.089> couple<00:05:26.389> of

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
work now I'll just show you a couple of

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.119 
work now I'll just show you a couple of
games<00:05:26.689> out<00:05:26.990> of<00:05:27.020> interest<00:05:27.499> I<00:05:27.620> wasn't<00:05:27.860> going<00:05:28.099> to

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
games out of interest I wasn't going to

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:30.610 
games out of interest I wasn't going to
but<00:05:28.370> I<00:05:28.430> think<00:05:28.490> I<00:05:28.849> should<00:05:28.909> really<00:05:29.509> alright<00:05:30.439> so

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620
