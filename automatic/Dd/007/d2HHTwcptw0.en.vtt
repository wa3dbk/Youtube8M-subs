reference as to what what this would be

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.389 
reference as to what what this would be
like<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.559> go<00:00:37.680> here's<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.980> quarter<00:00:38.280> note

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
like so here we go here's a quarter note

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:55.340

approach that's it these clips or
quarter<00:00:55.619> notes<00:00:55.799> now<00:00:56.489> these<00:00:56.759> clips<00:00:57.089> are

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
quarter notes now these clips are

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:09.499 
quarter notes now these clips are
happening<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> those<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.030> two<00:01:09.210> point

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
happening so those are the two point

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.530 
happening so those are the two point
those<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> two<00:01:11.090> references<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.390> this

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
those are the two references for this

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.850
