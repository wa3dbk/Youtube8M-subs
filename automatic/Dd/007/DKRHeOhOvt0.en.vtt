00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
and sleeping on it that way helps me

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
and sleeping on it that way helps me
kind<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.039> keep<00:00:53.250> my<00:00:53.399> shape<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.789> little<00:00:53.820> bit

kind of keep my shape a little bit

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.200 
kind of keep my shape a little bit
better<00:00:54.949> so<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:55.980> don't<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> pineapple<00:00:57.090> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
better so I don't do the pineapple I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.150 
better so I don't do the pineapple I
maybe<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.989> gets<00:00:58.140> longer<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:59.010> not

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
maybe one that gets longer but it's not

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.349 
maybe one that gets longer but it's not
very<00:00:59.250> long<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.699> back<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.149> doesn't<00:01:00.329> work

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
very long in the back so it doesn't work

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.900 
very long in the back so it doesn't work
very<00:01:00.510> well<00:01:00.690> but<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.890> use<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.219> refresh<00:01:02.850> my
