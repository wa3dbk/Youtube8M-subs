00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.809
 who I am 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.089

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.510

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.539
 dear nick eagle welcome hello hello 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.160
 hi kant people 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.380
 I know it's a special episode this 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 true very particular look at why 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.399
 today then what we do a movement 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.399
 which to date we have not yet 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.300
 done 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.860
 let's think about our guitar 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.030
 let's go there let 's lift it off 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.170
 we support where you want those times 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.200
 on the knees 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.390
 keep it where you want to see the volume 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.059
 today we don't play and the king bet 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.000
 this may already cause some how 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.030
 there are thumbs in June let's say 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.989
 immediately a thing and that's what i have 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.239
 I said to him off the air 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.390
 basically it may seem to you 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.650
 this is a boring episode at least 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.100
 apparently but actually it actually is 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.479
 dedicated to improving ours 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.590
 musculature from the own point of view 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.780
 technician also from the own point of view 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.030
 how do you study how we approach the la 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.890
 live situation also of the staff 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.290
 what I mean is that you can't 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.210
 arrive like all cold things 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.159
 cold with chilly muscles 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.619
 we need to warm ourselves in some way is 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.360
 then what we will do today 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.270
 basically a warm up 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.670
 muscle if own heating 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.409
 muscle before we use before 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.689
 start playing which is good for i 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.799
 advanced intermediate beginners for 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.350
 anyone 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.170
 and then we're going to do some exercises 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.850
 heating on the right guitar that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.720
 You will teach the so various techniques 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.070
 that this not only helps you and helps us 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.740
 we learners to learn 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.720
 acquire speed and touch too 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.570
 that is, it was also improving the sound but 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.700
 above all it facilitates us and there 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.530
 especially helps in the part of 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.539
 when we will then go further to do the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.020
 solos because having speed having 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.459
 tact general technical contact if 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.440
 we will be able to play better and I said 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.360
 a bit like that fucking headdress 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.250
 others to say that he explained exactly 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.260
 right then we go immediately we do 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.420
 team let's do gymnastics today ok 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.400
 then let's use it here if you got it 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.750
 learned in the united states with all the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.760
 mornings I had early morning elections 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.470
 and then arrive this morning in 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.720
 guitar classes just the way they are 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.640
 put as we are put today is one think 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.850
 having morning I don't want no because 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.420
 the name for him far east in that dawn 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.430
 I had this master but it is the film that he is 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.380
 greetings, among other things, every morning 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.209
 he had this exercise done 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.880
 these this series of exercises that then 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.190
 in the end I get into it so much 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.360
 daily routine that still is not 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.330
 he can get his hands on the instrument 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.370
 if I don't do here but some of these 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.810
 dissolution exercises and in which 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.630
 they are easy and then we leave immediately 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.000
 arms as if we wanted to do 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.730
 arm wrestling I was keeping our wrists 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.380
 first clockwise 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.420
 a dozen of them I know if I'm doing it 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.640
 clockwise not even scams ready a 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.320
 flights among others can in terms of 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.880
 opposites so I believe one is time 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.250
 and one counter, however, goes well true 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.440
 reason for coca ciria voli in my opinion 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.030
 you said shit but let's go back 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.150
 back then we turn the opposite side 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.850
 ok ok this is a dozen times 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.000
 now let's do it quickly to do it for you 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.790
 understand then we open the ungodly palms of the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.680
 hands and turn we continue to turn here 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.230
 how long should at least one last 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.910
 about ten times a dozen rounds to ok 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.000
 let us do ten minutes now valley 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.620
 then we turn on the opposite side 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.140
 and here we also warmed up the part 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.250
 of the shoulders in fact we feel that 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.570
 the exercise reminds me of gay 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.040
 pride let's choose well between the exercise 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.959
 of the shot 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.370
 now let's move on to dissolution 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.650
 add another one since we are talking 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.570
 backwards years ago when I didn't have it 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.830
 belly 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.620
 I would also add this on 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.350
 shirt yes yes yes there was this indeed is 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.390
 this is also strongly true of me 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.430
 however it is all decided and 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.080
 involve the part of the arms e 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.020
 shoulders are fine but well 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.280
 above all that this very serious push 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:24.350
 upwards also because let's remember 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.300
 that we tend especially when playing 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.420
 to sit as a guitar to stoop 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.680
 instead the correct position as he says 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.920
 your best friend varini that 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.440
 salute is that erect bust six 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.720
 always enough that the type a stake 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.980
 in the seat this other is exact 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.450
 they come even if you don't see mine 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.030
 arm of here however lengthened le 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.860
 your arms like this and pull as if 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.410
 good we exist out good we push 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.390
 outside we raised goods palms our finger towards 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.340
 the sky and spaces we feel all this 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.380
 part some pull then buying that 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.200
 we are stretching your good forearm 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.790
 now the opposite side down and we hear 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.370
 the part above that pulls here in everyone 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.750
 the tendons that go a little old 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.820
 important because above all those who play 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.530
 even standing sometimes the first of the 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.870
 carpal tunnel because I love you guitar 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.120
 low and less problems here in fact now 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.090
 let's go to an exercise for the wrist 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.810
 so let 's put our right arm 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.970
 first leaning on our taste and 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.500
 we press circulates but the other hand e 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.960
 we also press with pimples slightly 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.240
 we pull here we hear a pull 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.320
 this part we are working Quiesa 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.560
 always working on the forearm 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.750
 assists and then slowly we stretch 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.010
 even the arm without straining 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.870
 obviously because but it must be one 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.610
 pain thing but the city of 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.260
 stretch heating the memories 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.060
 I remember that I have to be with the 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.510
 low shoulder you don't have to pull one up 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.190
 shoulder 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.250
 history must not go to the ear 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.830
 but that there be able to say the same 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:55.520
 do also the other part is ok childbirth 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:57.350
 oporto shot shot i think later 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.030
 this at least I personally feel 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.870
 always a lot better will be a factor 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.480
 psychological 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.270
 but we make you stretch your muscles 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.440
 feel better because it also gives you that 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.300
 sense of well-being precisely because i 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.849
 muscles not working often tend to 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.969
 little to contract no 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:16.069
 the stretch and they're distendano and you 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:17.569
 they give this sense of relaxation 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.939
 we say that we are ready then for a 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.349
 this point take the guitar 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:23.029
 up to at least 20 at the end 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:25.129
 boys was not so pale 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.779
 not even so painful for the first one 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.399
 part of exercise and I recommend it 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:29.119
 always return this exercise to 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:31.069
