00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 in oxidative stress when they predominate 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.230
 the proxy that and boss mechanisms and there 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.320
 a decrease in the mechanisms 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.690
 antioxidants like this happens in the body 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.450
 an imbalance and an excess of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.010
 free radicals and those free radicals 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.080
 are what they provoke at the level of 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.600
 cells alterations in their 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.699
 functioning the alteration in the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.130
 cellular operation is what is the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.699
 basis of many pathologies especially of 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.140
 chronic cardiovascular pathologies 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.360
 diabetes and cancer and hence the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.570
 Importance of consuming antioxidants for 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.370
 have enough this mechanism that of 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.590
 somehow counteract stress 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.110
 oxidized those pathologies that have 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.960
 mentioned natalia are those 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.930
 lead mortality in our country 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.420
 and is speaking clearly as we have 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.270
 said in endless opportunities to 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.840
 the wrong eating habits that 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.609
 has a good part of the population 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.890
 exactly as you mention if 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.260
 we think of the food sources of 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.830
 antioxidants the main ones are the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.290
 vegetables 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.930
 the fruits in our population more than 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.700
 a must have in that sense if more 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.380
 forward let's mention that the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.120
 recommendation the consumption of vegetables and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.130
 fruits are about five servings daily 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.400
 and the average consumption to our 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.650
 population is only 2 a day yes or 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.210
 be that what to say that we have 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.200
 that promote the consumption of vegetables and 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.210
 fruits because it is a tool 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.950
 fundamental for the prevention these 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.650
 chronic diseases that you just mind 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.920
 natalia only in fruits and vegetables 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.660
 we found antioxidants and 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.979
 mainly yes but there are also others 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.170
 foods that are sources of 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.360
 antioxidants olive oil is a 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.280
 excellent source of antioxidants the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.500
 Soy is also an excellent source of 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.590
 antioxidants the main 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.140
 antioxidants are they are basically 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.510
 carotenoids is exactly the good thing 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.670
 flavonoids exactly is that they are 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.030
 within polyphenols polyphenols a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.310
 this vitamin c and vitamin e and the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.410
 Food sources of their antioxidants 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.050
 They are mainly vegetables and fruits 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.180
 soybean olive oil 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.200
 of the leaves very well thanks to natalia 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.560
 engineer 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.580
 I 'm going to invite you to come to a table 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.060
 that we have with a lot of vegetables and 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.599
 of all elements 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.569
 plethoric antioxidants I invite you to 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.060
 that you come hurricane today early in the 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.519
 tomorrow before coming to the program what 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.750
 We did go to the market if we found 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:40.810
 the fruits and vegetables of the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.150
 station that are currently the ones that 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.099
 let's use as though they oxidize 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.959
 well let's go here is the table 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:54.579
 so I invite you to come and go 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:58.599
 taking each fruit each vegetable there is 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:01.180
 olive oil I see that I see grapes I see 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.930
 red wine or carrots you're going 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.109
 explaining the properties 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.810
 the vitamins and the importance that it has 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:12.620
 each of the fruits and each of the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.170
 vegetables if we do 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.109
 I really like the kitchen, let's start 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.379
 our day with citrus true as 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.930
 Natalia said vitamin C is one of 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.310
 the most important antioxidants and not 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.000
 let's buy the juice of the 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.640
 supermarket let's take a grapefruit 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.420
 with the let's make juice as it is a 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.410
 little acid or bitter we're going to also 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.440
 put a tangerine juice 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.780
 I showed him the mandarin 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.150
 we bought very early and found in 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.700
 the market also oranges that are 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:58.270
 out there but we also found a 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:01.450
 fruit that although it is not an excellent 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.390
 source of vitamin c therefore going to 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.120
 make those free radicals that 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.860
 happen in all organisms that 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.860
 we need oxygen to live 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.019
 it's like it's an element with a 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.690
 patita that has to be filled with something 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.690
 of our organism we will cheat 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.080
 and we're going to put vitamin c for 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:31.080
 that it is the antioxidant that 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:34.139
 benefit truth for our health 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.849
 but then we are going to think about preparing the 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.129
 lunch and we have an excellent 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.500
 antioxidant within the plant kingdom 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:43.680
 which is very much in mind at this time 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.129
 because it is a seasonal vegetable that is 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.490
 the broccoli us is very good press 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:55.229
 the broccoli for some years 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:58.229
 engineers and wonders are spoken of 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:01.379
 broccoli then we want to hear you the 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:04.680
 broccoli the first important thing to have 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:08.069
 in account is that it is well green that we 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.289
 give the plant animal we do not 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:13.860
 we have the habit of consuming it in 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:18.479
 However, if we draw 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:20.370
 these saplings we can truly cut it 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.370
 in this way and add it to our 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.319
 salad look what interesting good what 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.500
 season with a little oil 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:30.100
 olive we can add something crispy like 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.960
 are the nuts 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.320
 and we are going to add something of a lot of color 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.830
 how can it be something that is also 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.460
 a cruciferous truth a little cabbage 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.370
 that gives us color that also food 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:50.780
 comes through the eyes we all know 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:52.580
 what importance the colors have are 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.040
 important the colors we are going to add 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.560
 a white here with garlic we take it out 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.199
 the bud does not like anything that also 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.570
 that deep low taste that sometimes does not 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.940
 It is convenient for us to take it off with a 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:08.810
 little bit of parsley the smell of garlic 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:11.210
 remove because it is important 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.949
 pigmentation pigmentation gives us 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.540
 because nature is so wonderful 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.360
 that we have to follow it in each 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.150
 station gives us those fruits and 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.949
 vegetables that we need truth we have 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.080
 an excellent carrot that also 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:26.449
 we are going to add muscle to our 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.940
 salad then what is it that we 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:31.550
 we teach children at school level 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.910
 true that at least we have five 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.880
 colors five colors between fruits and 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:41.600
 vegetables you talked about children and you know 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:44.870
 that many moms have told me I do not 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.380
 I can make my son eat broccoli 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.920
 I can not make him eat cabbage or 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.450
 cauliflower 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.050
 and then this is an opportunity 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:58.040
 great engineer for you to tell 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:01.260
 all the moms who are watching us 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:05.220
 how they prepare the cauliflower 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:07.740
 we are going to prepare saplings that the child 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.410
 does not like to eat a small tree is a 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.849
 very magical thing then mom with 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.639
 a lot of patience goes 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:18.219
 because they saw that it 's pretty easy to 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:20.199
 cut prepare small trees these 

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:23.219
 saplings what interesting and what more 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:26.020
 important is that they do not lose their 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:29.709
 antioxidant property then we have 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:33.369
 a pot with water before it starts 

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:35.800
 bubbles in the boil and place the 

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:38.889
 little trees that will diminish the 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.719
 water temperature and before it comes back 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:43.479
 to make spurts so it looks good 

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:45.849
 green and nice to look at we're going 

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:49.659
 to serve the child without burning 

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:54.039
 course flower let's go to the break we're going to 

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:58.559
 we cook with pampering we are going to take 

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:58.559
 a drop of wine but a little bit true
