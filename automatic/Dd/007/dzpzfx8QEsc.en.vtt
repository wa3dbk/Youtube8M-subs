this at a low heat I'm gonna keep going

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.640 
this at a low heat I'm gonna keep going
at<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.880> until<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.450> starts<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> thicken<00:01:36.650> so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
at this until it starts to thicken so

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.440 
at this until it starts to thicken so
this<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.920> about<00:01:38.100> ten<00:01:38.460> minutes<00:01:38.759> later<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.420> you

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
this is about ten minutes later and you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.359 
this is about ten minutes later and you
can<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> mixture<00:01:40.680> has<00:01:40.860> really

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
can see that the mixture has really

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.120 
can see that the mixture has really
really<00:01:41.579> thickened<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.060> now<00:01:42.770> just<00:01:43.770> like<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
really thickened up now just like that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.120 
really thickened up now just like that
I'm<00:01:44.790> gonna<00:01:44.970> grab<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.390> spoon<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> spoon<00:01:46.979> in

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
I'm gonna grab a spoon get the spoon in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.580 
I'm gonna grab a spoon get the spoon in
there<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.520> then<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.899> draw<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.350> line

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
there and then you can just draw a line

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.760 
there and then you can just draw a line
and<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.729> holds<00:01:50.939> its<00:01:51.210> shape<00:01:51.590> then<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.710> know

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and if it holds its shape then I know

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.940 
and if it holds its shape then I know
that<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.460> ready<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.000> go<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:57.860> at<00:01:58.860> this

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
that this is ready to go so at this

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.980 
that this is ready to go so at this
point<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.520> turn<00:01:59.700> my<00:01:59.850> oven<00:02:00.000> off<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.869> are

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
point I can turn my oven off and we are

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.830 
point I can turn my oven off and we are
ready<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.439> strain<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:03.119> our<00:02:03.240> next<00:02:03.390> step<00:02:03.659> is

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
ready to strain this so our next step is

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.280 
ready to strain this so our next step is
to<00:02:04.170> strain<00:02:04.549> our<00:02:05.549> beautiful<00:02:06.090> lemon<00:02:07.020> curd

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290
