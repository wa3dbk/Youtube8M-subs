00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
sparking one in Germany so it seems my

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.760 
sparking one in Germany so it seems my
color<00:01:09.229> tuning<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.580> this<00:01:11.580> very<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.840> know<00:01:12.869> it's

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
color tuning in this very you know it's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.880 
color tuning in this very you know it's
quite<00:01:14.189> automatic<00:01:14.729> behavior<00:01:15.119> i<00:01:15.180> guess<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
quite automatic behavior i guess and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.760 
quite automatic behavior i guess and
just<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.100> know<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.549> want<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.770> get

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
just I know what I want and I just get

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.730 
just I know what I want and I just get
the<00:01:20.280> bottle<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:21.030> water<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.570> into<00:01:21.930> color<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.710> I

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the bottle of water for into color but I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
the bottle of water for into color but I
think<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.100> really<00:01:23.280> funny<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.880> picked<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> one

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
think it's really funny I picked the one

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.719 
think it's really funny I picked the one
according<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> Dutch<00:01:25.619> system<00:01:26.340> even

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
according to the Dutch system even

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.990 
according to the Dutch system even
though<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.880> was<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.299> Germany<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.880> is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
though I was in Germany so and that is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.910 
though I was in Germany so and that is
one<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.780> subtle<00:01:31.409> cultural

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
one of the really subtle cultural

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.380 
one of the really subtle cultural
differences<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:33.030> there<00:01:33.270> are<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:34.820> I<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
differences that there are and I like to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.410 
differences that there are and I like to
explore<00:01:36.720> them<00:01:36.900> all<00:01:37.020> um<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:39.000> think<00:01:39.240> it's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
explore them all um and I think it's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.200 
explore them all um and I think it's
it's<00:01:39.780> really<00:01:40.140> quite<00:01:40.680> funny<00:01:41.130> how<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.850> little

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
it's really quite funny how this little

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.929 
it's really quite funny how this little
things<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:43.200> make<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.409> difference<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.159> how

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
things can make a difference and how

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.090 
things can make a difference and how
many<00:01:45.619> you<00:01:46.619> know<00:01:46.710> how<00:01:46.860> many<00:01:48.079> subconscious

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
many you know how many subconscious

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.340 
many you know how many subconscious
information<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.820> about<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.750> specific

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
information we have about a specific

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.880 
information we have about a specific
culture<00:01:52.939> that<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.299> only<00:01:54.540> become<00:01:55.110> aware<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.409> if

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
culture that we only become aware of if

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.300 
culture that we only become aware of if
they<00:01:56.610> don't<00:01:56.850> work<00:01:57.000> out<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.570> us<00:01:57.600> anymore<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:59.130> i

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
they don't work out for us anymore so i

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.160
