00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
pretty funny so we thought we'd start

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
pretty funny so we thought we'd start
feeding<00:00:36.360> him<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.079> far<00:00:37.260> he's<00:00:37.440> been<00:00:37.559> smart

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
feeding him so far he's been smart

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.760 
feeding him so far he's been smart
enough<00:00:37.980> not<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.309> run<00:00:38.670> across<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.420> ground

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
be really cool to take the girls to see

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.150 
be really cool to take the girls to see
some<00:04:07.630> places<00:04:07.780> in<00:04:08.050> Michigan<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.860> not<00:04:09.040> only

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
some places in Michigan that not only

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.470

seen to it I think that would just be
really<00:04:12.250> cool<00:04:12.460> so<00:04:12.970> if<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.150> could<00:04:13.270> do<00:04:13.390> that<00:04:13.420> that

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
really cool so if you could do that that
