00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.740
 snapdragon 810 processor that is well 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.720
 famous in lg flex 2 for keita and 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.040
 takes too long to cool and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.380
 back to normal 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.260
 in addition you have almost exactly wing 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.750
 the same things 2 billion and 3 previous 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.760
 that is 32 gb of internal memory 3 gb of 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.879

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.149
 megapixels 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.670
 there we have news until more and more use 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.570
 to enter this high self area 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.120
 resolution 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.710
 in addition you also have the rear 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.949
 do not remove the removable back cover 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.289
 which lost almost 400 million per hour 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.780
 This is bad news because 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.880
 it means that to get more child it 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.280
 lost load and ask you to ask the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.350
 The name came and the device arrived. 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.420
 completely the same body and a part 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.610
 It is quite interesting that he is 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.619
 comes with the possibility of entering 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.049
 underwater without plug 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.939
 in the usb port which is very welcome 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.360
 because also in the usb port with the time 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.280
 go go go go get out will lose will 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.740
 break every time in the top close because it is 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.090
 also you will open more throughout 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.619
 the time of use of the appliance at least 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.700
 once a day to load the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.619
 device tanks sinks and three pans that 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.229
 is the eye on the outside is basically the same 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.090
 thing that c3 is called g-4 in japan 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.570
 three points here in Brazil because it is a 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.659
 very small update of c3 and with 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.920
 fame in delivery 810 is quite capable that 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.640
 the c3 in the interior performs 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.009
 best 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.290
 in the long run than this guy here a 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.000
 Device review reaches the fifth 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.979

 In the meantime I 'll find out if 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.349
 this lower capacity battery will 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.650
 actually delivering less autonomy and 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.629
 if this process said is the update 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.239
 not as disappointing as it sounds 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.220
