00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:13.920
 as a whole this is my unboxing im 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:15.849
 test video about the mouse event and 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.419
 Model names is directly attached to the 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.369
 vertical must be small in size 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:25.739
 packaging and they look us now 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:29.980
 more precisely, this mouse should serve 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:33.790
 the data would seem to prevent decision 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.530
 and valiant easy at the many mouse 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.920
 to relieve the burden and here we see 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.440
 that also with articles from 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.199
 that means the mouse is so we know 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.620
 all just out and in this form 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.890
 now built upright vertically 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.199
 and is the usb version of your plug 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.749
 I will also test again soon 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.089
 then we see here is the thumb 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:59.859
 gets up and the rest is the hand 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.199
 actually like a normal mouse 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.800
 here in the area around normal then there and 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.450
 this is supposed to relax the hand quite so 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.620
 that is the small version now 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.570
 you have to say you can also see 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.160
 the color the new version is mine 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.410
 so far as I know always in 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.650
 This purple tone my girlfriend had 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.380
 use smaller hands from rath angle 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.910
 button right button left the calculated 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.690
 Investigators have them they have to 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.160
 look what you can adjust there and 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.170
 behind speed so here you can still 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.410
 Setting a speed of 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.630
 ok closer down front back button 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.500
 There is also a great one here 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.390
 thing to test the same time 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.660
 right here on the back the patch 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:49.510
 to see and here 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:51.040
 the laser exactly so you use it 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.920
 then that is very clear you know that 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.850
 all 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.060
 that's not bad 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.330
 I just mean that now 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.440
 a little bit back and forth 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.780
 but let's go over there now 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.420
 to the pc and you see it in the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.670
 next part of the video 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.349
 so and now we are like in the test video 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.090
 I use the mouse and it is natural 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.480
 a bit hard to present to you 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.550
 because I did that 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.860
 here in the left area of a macbook 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.680
 airs can see the pointer and here 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.670
 on the right important mouse use 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.319
 and that is really a whole 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.540
 comfortable to use 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.069
 if we compare that now I 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.470
 I have such a very simple standard 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.530
 Logitech I tell you sleeve 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.780
 roll up you see that in what 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.790
 a position the ingenious of the mouse 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.200
 The hand holder you see that I have to 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.299
 yes always grab a bit high 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.569
 and that's why I'm in permanent 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.459
 tension here in this area and 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.349
 this results yes that one feels yes 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.239
 then always so presses and with you 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.220
 even this leads you to realize that it is 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.660
 everything hardens and then just stops 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.829
 this click position could thereby 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.260
 reason has so for example one 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.180
 tendonitis and look us 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.370
 always the position when we are here 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.890
 and if we compare that now with 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.170
 the vertical I have to be in one now 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.549
 completely natural position and if I am 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.109
 now he suspects the poor from above 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.579
 that's pretty loose here as well 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.680
 and not tense at all 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.019
 and I have a really great one 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.540
 starting position to operate the mouse 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.819
 and especially if you have it today 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.579
 professionally 48 hours from wc seat or 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.280
 That's just a great thing longer 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.079
 so you do not overburden it anymore 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.700
 on the right arm or as left in the 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.310
 is also available as left-handed based on 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.299
 left hand and how she reacts 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.000
 mouse super fast 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.919
 that works well and you have 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.780
 nice he asks twice lighting 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:43.430
 once here for the manufacturer event 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.060
 event so here and she also has red 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.400
 Points 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.780
 and they are an indication of the speed 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.910
 history here that is exactly want the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.139
 picture that means the mouse works fast 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:01.340
 and you can change it here with xl 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:03.260
 medium to high and then you realize already 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.650
 huge difference if I am now 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.060
 move the mouse a bit 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.199
 Do you see the picture of the show here 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.459
 moved very fast when I go 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:15.459
 reduce speed runs 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.780
 so now I see it light it shines 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.520
 only a long way that means this 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.510
 set to xl and what I am there for 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.010
 make movements 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.630
 with that moves out of itself so that can 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.530
 one again individually at the 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.570
 mouse very well for yourself 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.540
 I hope I could with the 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.590
 video and little insight about the 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.910
 Give evolution vertical mouse and enjoy 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.270
 My thumbs up for that 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.270
 Video
