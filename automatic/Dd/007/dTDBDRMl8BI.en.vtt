 nature but i love it too of course 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.320

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.029
 We welcome the autumn with a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.460
 delicious autumn have to build like 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.189
 we need apple juice or water 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.869
 still wheat mail a pinch of salt cream 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.140

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.109
 then we need sugar honey 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.550
 cream fraiche or sour cream what you 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.520
 then you still need at home 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.829
 walnuts one lemon two 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.899
 sourish apples really sour one 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.030
 butter pump is not something normal 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.969
 pear seedless grapes and the last one 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.370
 ingredient for the autumn tat are with it 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.649
 we would all have ingredients together we 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.660
 Now take 200 grams of flour then take 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.760
 we still have 100 grams of cold margarine or 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.010
 butter in pieces and just do it 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.640
 on the mail then we will take 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.370

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.969
 Eg please a small 1 m and I no 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.680
 great 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.350
 the whole thing will be easy now 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.860
 kneaded until we are a nice part of the ball 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.140
 to have 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.060
 As a tip, take a bit more flour 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.040
 then the whole thing does not stick like that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.689
 and if you finish the ball then 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.960
 The whole thing just comes for 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.549
 30 minutes in the fridge now 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.500
 we get used to the lining and me 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.939
 Take 200 milliliters for juice here 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.799
 I also like to take water 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.750
 only apple juice because of the taste 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.460
 then tastes more intense then we take 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.740
 here all lemons we in two 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.049
 cut and then we take one 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.049

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.180

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.340

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.369
 Lemon juice then we still give 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.780
 about 1 tablespoon of honey purely that 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.570
 I leave all now at medium 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.340
 first simmer and the whole thing 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.600
 should become one of them in the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.729
 In the meantime, I will be here now 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.130

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.840
 the pear is then peeled around the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.299
 very small pieces cut 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.280
 then I take the seedless ones 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.020
 I also grapes in small 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.659

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.200

 I have the sugar syrup 56 minutes 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.540
 Simmer after the moment because 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.310
 The mixture has cooked so it 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.050
 is reduced and foamed and we 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.940
 Nice caramel syrup have come there 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.430

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.420
 One is stirred with a whisk for 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.130
 then depending on the taste i love to 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.410
 he will eat another pinch of cinnamon 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.030

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.280

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.750
 Caramel on the side then I come 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.150
 now here for the dough this is this 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.299
 Shortcrust pastry is only short with flour 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.630
 dust and then roll out briefly 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.280
 prefabricated form clean and good 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.690
 the edge of hand we are what 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.090
 finished now we take the cover 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.430
 and give them the sugar caramel with 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.620
 Then we will do the whole thing 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.510
 stir well and in the ready-made 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.370
 give form with the dough I will now 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.900
 first because the fruits and minister 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.630
 rhine and I will not 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.269
 do the whole geoplan but just like that 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.250
 much that the nuts and the fruits yes 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.500
 simply covered are not swimming 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.769
 the whole thing is still a bit covered 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.410
 then just at 175 degrees above and 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.930
 heat down for about 40 minutes 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.209
 the oven dollar and so on sees the end 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.760
 blanket in the fall it really is very 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.440
 Succulent autumn do not be surprised if that 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.540
 Whole something is soft it tastes 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.250
 unbelievably delicious and a small one 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.400
 calorie bomb but what would life be like 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.389
 without all those little sins and yes 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.100
 I will be the last 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.920
 sunbeams here from the heart yet 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.510
