but in this case the drive would not

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.390 
but in this case the drive would not
even<00:00:24.269> spin<00:00:24.689> since<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> physical<00:00:25.920> drive<00:00:26.099> still

even spin since the physical drive still

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400 
even spin since the physical drive still

and if you did the drive is dead and
you're<00:01:01.949> probably<00:01:02.190> safe<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.090> take<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.049> singing

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
yeah here's the thing the galaxy is

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.630 
yeah here's the thing the galaxy is
about<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.049> only<00:01:07.080> non<00:01:07.619> invasive<00:01:07.950> way<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> erase

data on a dead drive strapping a magnet
to<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.520> probably<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> bad<00:01:12.270> idea<00:01:12.560> okay<00:01:13.560> i<00:01:13.590> just

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
to it is probably a bad idea okay i just

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.620 
to it is probably a bad idea okay i just
wouldn't<00:01:14.369> trust<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.820> well<00:01:15.000> well<00:01:15.420> there's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
wouldn't trust it well well there's

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
wouldn't trust it well well there's
there's<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.960> hole<00:01:16.110> there's<00:01:16.740> layers<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.220> this

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
there's a hole there's layers to this

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.710 
there's a hole there's layers to this
first<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.700> all<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.180> should<00:01:18.360> basically<00:01:18.509> be

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
first of all you should basically be

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.080 
first of all you should basically be
doing<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> movement<00:01:19.860> over<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> platter<00:01:20.580> area

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
doing the movement over the platter area

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
doing the movement over the platter area
to<00:01:21.390> try<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.659> basically<00:01:21.960> what<00:01:22.560> you're<00:01:22.680> trying

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
to try to basically what you're trying

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.679 
to try to basically what you're trying
to<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.280> confuse<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.210> heck<00:01:24.360> out<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
to do is confuse the heck out of the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.050 
to do is confuse the heck out of the
magnetic<00:01:24.990> information<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.520> platter<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
magnetic information on the platter and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.210 
magnetic information on the platter and
