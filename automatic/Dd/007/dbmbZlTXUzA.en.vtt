apparent Bible contradiction lies in the

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.410 
apparent Bible contradiction lies in the

further<00:00:58.609> we<00:00:58.850> find<00:00:59.120> out<00:00:59.329> verse<00:00:59.960> 5<00:01:00.199> it<00:01:00.230> says<00:01:00.410> and

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
further we find out verse 5 it says and

dish that I brought with me today if we

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.550 
dish that I brought with me today if we
were<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.119> perform<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.570> same<00:01:11.810> measurements

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
were to perform the same measurements

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.800 
were to perform the same measurements
and<00:01:12.680> calculations<00:01:12.860> on<00:01:13.490> this<00:01:13.790> dish<00:01:14.180> that<00:01:14.689> they

and calculations on this dish that they

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.200 
and calculations on this dish that they

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
performed on solomon's molten sea we

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.789 
performed on solomon's molten sea we
wouldn't<00:01:17.479> end<00:01:17.630> up<00:01:17.720> with<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:17.960> ratio<00:01:18.350> of<00:01:18.409> pot

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
wouldn't end up with a ratio of pot

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.859 
wouldn't end up with a ratio of pot
either<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:20.119> reason<00:01:20.329> for<00:01:20.509> that<00:01:20.659> is

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
either and the reason for that is

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.630 
either and the reason for that is
there's<00:01:21.049> actually<00:01:21.409> two<00:01:21.710> different<00:01:21.740> circles

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
there's actually two different circles

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.270 
there's actually two different circles
involved<00:01:23.360> with<00:01:23.450> this<00:01:23.600> object<00:01:24.140> one<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:25.100> the

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
involved with this object one is the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.429 
involved with this object one is the
circle<00:01:25.640> for<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.880> brim<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.930> other<00:01:27.110> is<00:01:27.259> the

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
circle for the brim and the other is the

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.440 
circle for the brim and the other is the
circle<00:01:27.799> of<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:27.950> base<00:01:28.340> those<00:01:29.000> are<00:01:29.180> two

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
circle of the base those are two

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.090 
circle of the base those are two
different<00:01:29.810> circles<00:01:30.200> with<00:01:30.590> two<00:01:30.890> different

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
different circles with two different

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.999 
different circles with two different
sizes<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.290> Solomon's<00:01:33.290> molten<00:01:33.680> sea<00:01:33.860> is

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
sizes and Solomon's molten sea is

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.130 
sizes and Solomon's molten sea is
similar<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.270> when<00:01:35.390> they<00:01:35.509> measured<00:01:35.930> the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
similar and so when they measured the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.319 
similar and so when they measured the
diameter<00:01:36.860> they<00:01:37.399> were<00:01:37.460> taking<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.820> diameter

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
diameter they were taking the diameter

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.999 
diameter they were taking the diameter
of<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.509> larger<00:01:38.930> circle<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.590> the

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
of the larger circle and the

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.490 
of the larger circle and the
circumference<00:01:40.579> of<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:41.030> smaller<00:01:41.329> circle<00:01:41.899> fine

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
circumference of the smaller circle fine

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.020 
circumference of the smaller circle fine
see<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.159> tell<00:01:43.399> me<00:01:43.430> that<00:01:43.700> this<00:01:43.820> was

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
see that so you tell me that this was

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.840 
see that so you tell me that this was
ten<00:01:44.270> cubits<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.770> was<00:01:45.979> 30<00:01:46.189> cupid<00:01:46.640> that's

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
ten cubits and this was 30 cupid that's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.819 
ten cubits and this was 30 cupid that's
correct<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:47.689> that's<00:01:47.899> why<00:01:48.049> my<00:01:48.200> math<00:01:48.409> didn't

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
correct so that's why my math didn't

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.020 
correct so that's why my math didn't
work<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.189> sounds<00:01:49.460> like<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.700> solution<00:01:50.000> of

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
work so it sounds like the solution of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.609 
work so it sounds like the solution of
this<00:01:50.180> problem<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.780> simply<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.140> more<00:01:51.409> careful

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
this problem is simply a more careful

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.499 
this problem is simply a more careful
