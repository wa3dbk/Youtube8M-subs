00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
a Chavez Jr has to go to Oxnard and

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.840 
a Chavez Jr has to go to Oxnard and
train<00:01:10.600> there<00:01:10.900> but<00:01:11.770> now<00:01:12.009> it<00:01:12.159> looks<00:01:12.250> like<00:01:12.369> it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
train there but now it looks like it

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.249 
train there but now it looks like it
looks<00:01:12.880> like<00:01:13.149> Robert<00:01:13.450> Garcia<00:01:13.630> has<00:01:13.929> to<00:01:14.109> go<00:01:14.229> to

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
looks like Robert Garcia has to go to

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.760 
looks like Robert Garcia has to go to
Mexico<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:15.039> train<00:01:15.369> Chavez<00:01:16.210> Jr<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:16.719> think<00:01:17.289> it<00:01:17.499> I

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
Mexico and train Chavez Jr I think it I

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.580 
Mexico and train Chavez Jr I think it I
think<00:01:18.700> a<00:01:18.850> Chavez<00:01:19.539> Jr<00:01:19.569> should<00:01:19.869> have<00:01:20.109> just<00:01:20.289> gone

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
think a Chavez Jr should have just gone

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.590 
think a Chavez Jr should have just gone
to<00:01:20.770> Oxnard<00:01:21.429> and<00:01:21.549> trained<00:01:21.850> over<00:01:22.119> there<00:01:22.299> because

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
to Oxnard and trained over there because

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.510 
to Oxnard and trained over there because
I<00:01:22.780> think<00:01:22.840> training<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:23.829> Mexico<00:01:24.189> would<00:01:24.340> be

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
I think training and Mexico would be

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.359 
I think training and Mexico would be
more<00:01:24.819> disrupting<00:01:25.539> i'm<00:01:26.139> not<00:01:26.319> sure<00:01:26.380> but<00:01:26.560> we'll

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
more disrupting i'm not sure but we'll

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.969 
more disrupting i'm not sure but we'll
see<00:01:27.520> how<00:01:27.549> it<00:01:27.670> turns<00:01:27.789> out<00:01:28.380> robert<00:01:29.380> garcia<00:01:29.560> will

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
see how it turns out robert garcia will

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.139 
see how it turns out robert garcia will
definitely<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:31.380> discipline<00:01:32.609> Chavez<00:01:33.609> Jr<00:01:33.639> at
