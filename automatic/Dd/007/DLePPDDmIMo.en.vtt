00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.410
 a question because the last one half 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.509
 of militancy and all half of halves 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.689
 have been a success because this is the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.689
 latest 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:20.230
 I did not hear if we give it 3 half and half 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.180
 that by the way there is a person who 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.689
 wants to say hello since he was one of the 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.689
 first 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.910
 sorry who today discusses since 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.910
 a lot that was not seen on TV 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.660
 that is 3 half of my tank have been a 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.910
 success but success in earnest and that this already 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:52.300
 completely surpassed the other two in 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.300
 hearing issues because the last 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.090
 I did not hear anything 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.060
 is a person 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.090
 decision is not a program that is very 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.010
 draining its production is a program 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.630
 where more than 70% of TVs 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.420
 only in the Monterrey area are 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.810
 tuning what then is a bit 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.810
 difficult to overcome ourselves in 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.750
 broadcast transmission transmission year after 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.020
 year and we decided that it was time to 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.080
 that this formula will end as well as 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.660
 great programs and great 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.100

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.900

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.010

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.380
 question so that it ends up half and
