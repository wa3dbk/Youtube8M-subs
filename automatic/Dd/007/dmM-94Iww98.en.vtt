00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 more even from matteo now if the subject 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.100
 that summons us and we worry about eggs 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.080
 easter to see what are the prices 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.860
 good that I take in the same 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.940
 presentation and in the same supermarket 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:19.560
 the price per kilo in 2011 was 280 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.380
 pesos and the 2012 359 with what may not rise 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.650
 of 25 percent the truth that is a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.630
 quite important figure considering 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.490
 that there are other products that are 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.560
 dropping its sales for example the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.079
 clothing or foods that are 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.510
 stagnant that 25% of the egg goes up 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.410
 Easter is really an increase 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.649
 quite important of 283 59 the kilo 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.350
 now there are many presentations not by 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.210
 example the same brand different 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.910
 sizes these small eggs are more 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.300
 well normal they are not so small they are 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.520
 individual gods but are we say the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.809
 appetizer for a family not only the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.970
 main egg that has to be more 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:07.290
 large one of 125 grams comes out 50 pesos 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.990
 and one of 150 grams comes out 63 pesos here 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.770
 more or less what could be said is 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.350
 almost 50 cents per gram 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.030
 more or less when they do not look at each other 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 for example the television one has to 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 calculate him 100 pesos per inch an lcd 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.640
 32 sells it to 3 thousand 200 pesos more or 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.150
 least it 's good to do those accounts 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.720
 about 50 cents in weight per 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.290
 gram that good really are eggs no 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.020
 all big let go some more 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.660
 great yet that's why we say the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.400
 family size look at you 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.400
 they are two brands almost the same 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.940
 presentation because in one case they are 260 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.920
 grams and in another case 250 and here already 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.170
 we are above a gram weight 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.410
 so if you do not really say it's 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.950
 awesome clear are eggs brands 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.039
 more or less known a single brand 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.200
 of well-known treats this case and 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.569
 another is a brand of chocolate through 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.690
 there are no big chocolate brands in the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.280
 Argentina but they are going to kill me the brand 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.709
 Chocolate can say this but 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.230
 this is is more or less known although 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.610
 do not so much notice you above 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.180
 a gram weight the truth is that 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.180
 these eggs are really expensive too 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.739
 there are offers online 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.630
 that's why there is a wide variety of prices 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.660
 I do not know tax cents a peso 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.790
 Average grams of much less than 50 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.549
 cents to degrees look at you estevo 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.280
 of 180 grams comes from rosary because what 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.510
 I clarify because it had been in rosario 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.970
 It would be good to buy it if it gives you 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.489
 more deny so say capital must see 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.140
 how it arrives do not say what state the 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.819
 egg is fine that for joy of 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.220
 danielito to people who do not like the 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.170
 Summer is cold now but you have to see 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.920
 how it arrives now are 180 grams if it is 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:03.240
 20 pesos really very cheap an egg 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:08.070
 200 grams is offered at 125 pesos 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:11.430
 1 250 with brands and the supermarket is 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.710
 offered at almost 300 pesos and this 200 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.480
 grams that has no brand is offered at 25 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.210
 today's weights there is a difference 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.310
 important and one of 35 grams always and 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.880
 when you buy it 10 units each 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.440
 unit will charge you 3 with 20 in a large 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:31.050
 variety of prices included by 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.050
 course but they are for the 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.890
 children up to 4 5 or 6 years old 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.890
 there are no pallets 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.989
 it's been lost four years grabs something 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.989
 A) Yes 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:04:00.099
 Cocoa comes up 25 percent 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.440
 now look at you are curiosities 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.349
 then I'm going to add a half figure 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.720
 you are this curiosity because in 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.459
 general what one buys is the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.299
 complete presentation of this habit 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:16.000
 Now if you buy animals, they do not come out 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.539
 expensive will have good marketing or not the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.459
 animals with the kids what happens is 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.900
 that the proposal that makes up 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.760
 that a boy promises is an egg of 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.760
 pay him with an Easter bunny 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.410
 rabbits and it's cute if it's ugly for example 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.479
 this rabbit smiles I do not know if the boy 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.180
 he wants a easter bunny who smiles 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.580
 but hey it's cheaper not 130 grams 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.740
 it's 28 pesos is not expensive 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.659
 a school of 110 degrees but one what 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.560
 has to do is go preparing the boys 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:49.689
 of 12 weeks talking about business 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.990
 because a rabbit of 110 is worth what is 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.990
 how much 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:02.530
 if I do not deal with the rabbit and on the blog 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.539
 to do is to buy a large egg of 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.909
 a kilo and then give as 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.919
 individual I do not know rabbits have that 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.740
 sympathetic animal hugo kilos and 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.669
 you do not want certain aesthetic terms 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.669
 it ends up being at the end 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:20.770
 we are going to pay for the nice little animal 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.660
 certain aesthetics for example a ferret or 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.150
 a crow is not animals either 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.740
 nice you have but I did it for something 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.400
 particularly not because it is not an animal 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.400
 nice 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:39.160
 and if you are going to associate the topic that is 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.270
 with hurricane I will be terrible week 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.270
 pick up everywhere 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:53.370
 but you can buy many eggs from 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:53.370
 easter as it is to the players 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.259
 we have to love in life 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.819
 daily 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.740
 to put their hands and put it on 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.149
 to the hurricane keeper to the other games 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.729
 they are missing some other parts of the 

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:16.069
 fourth a greeting to coco sily if we are 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.999
 go and he wants to come touch the touch and 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.999
 I know it can not be true 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:25.550
 come and show some tables 

00:06:23.929 --> 00:06:28.639
 averages so we all get sad 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:31.400
 and a hen of 200 grams yes without 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:35.300
 no successful reference 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:38.150
 to the people 22 pesos now now notice 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:41.150
 you this important detail I 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:45.410
 said the price per kilo the same egg 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:47.960
 last year 280 because it was no longer 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:51.050
 come back is time is linear at least 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.720
 how do we experience it 350 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:57.169

 exquisite alfajores with which 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.400

 internet comes out 175 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:30.150
 surprise that similar presentations and 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:33.130
 qualities there is so much variety of prices 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:36.580
 175 if you get the nice coupon mentos 

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:39.700
 150 if you go to the cafeteria or 362 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.290
 supermarkets conclusion so far by 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.840
 the survey that we did so far 

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:46.690
 because you can already this is still missing for 

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.400
 Easter not so far those that are 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.610
 sold in supermarkets are the most 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.610
 expensive
