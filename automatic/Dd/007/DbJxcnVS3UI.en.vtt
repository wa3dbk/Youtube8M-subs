potatoes up a little bit okay show me

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.240 
potatoes up a little bit okay show me
how<00:02:09.070> you<00:02:09.130> watch<00:02:10.620> so<00:02:11.620> we're<00:02:11.740> gonna<00:02:11.830> Brown<00:02:12.070> these

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
how you watch so we're gonna Brown these

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:20.250 
how you watch so we're gonna Brown these
up<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:12.610> little<00:02:12.640> bit<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.660> now<00:02:19.690> we're<00:02:19.870> gonna<00:02:19.960> dice

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
up a little bit so now we're gonna dice

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.380 
up a little bit so now we're gonna dice
these<00:02:20.650> onions<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.340> this<00:02:21.520> is<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.760> fastest<00:02:22.270> way

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
these onions and this is the fastest way

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.199 
these onions and this is the fastest way
to<00:02:22.450> dice<00:02:22.660> an<00:02:22.810> onion<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.230> cut<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.040> in<00:02:24.100> half<00:02:24.280> peel

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
to dice an onion you cut it in half peel

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.420 
to dice an onion you cut it in half peel
it<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:26.290> then<00:02:26.410> aim<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.620> make<00:02:26.770> quick<00:02:26.980> slices

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
it and then aim to make quick slices

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.449 
it and then aim to make quick slices
like<00:02:27.520> that<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:29.260> then<00:02:29.350> we<00:02:29.470> cut<00:02:29.680> this<00:02:29.830> direction

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
like that and then we cut this direction

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.970 
like that and then we cut this direction
and<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.830> you've<00:02:32.950> got<00:02:33.510> horizontal<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.980> you

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and so you've got horizontal and you

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.040 
and so you've got horizontal and you
know<00:02:36.150> perpendicular<00:02:37.150> or<00:02:37.330> whatever<00:02:37.600> anyway<00:02:37.989> so

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
know perpendicular or whatever anyway so

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.340 
know perpendicular or whatever anyway so
then<00:02:38.320> you<00:02:38.440> just<00:02:38.470> cut<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:38.890> like<00:02:38.980> this

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
then you just cut it like this

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.240 
then you just cut it like this
are<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:41.440> still<00:02:41.650> pointing<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:44.020> bam<00:02:44.709> diced

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
are you still pointing and bam diced

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.510 
are you still pointing and bam diced
onion<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.709> quickest<00:02:48.070> way<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.220> dice<00:02:48.489> that

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
onion so the quickest way to dice that

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.729 
onion so the quickest way to dice that
