00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.620
 immersion d 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.700
 the year on the site under 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.640
 of the devil in that the guide told us that 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.410
 there is the whale shark then 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.600
 we hurry to enter 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.350
 pretty much it 's a pretty site 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:33.830
 Depth are around 60 meters 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.970
 we went around the part of the rock 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.300
 that we not only use and swim 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.810
 the shark was several minutes we were 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.810
 with 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.510
 a gigantic marine visitor accompanied 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.180
 to four propeller divers on the island of 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.039
 cannon a whale shark of almost 10 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.469
 meters came close enough for 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.809
 surprise this group for six 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.640
 Whale anti whale minutes will be 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.070
 consider the biggest fish in the world 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.460
 can measure up to 12 meters and 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.780
 weigh up to 21 tons is a kind 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.090
 that usually travels in open water 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.799
 although it feeds mainly from 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.799
 plankton and small fish 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.380
 very impressive because it is an animal 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.990
 quite pretty big is to see it very 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.710
 up close to see the remmora fish that 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.590
 they are next to him the colors all that is 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.140
 an animal too cute 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.340
 and be lucky to live here in 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.340
 our country in this 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.700
 the meeting ended as surprising as 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.780
 started the huge fish went however 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.020
 there was time even to take pictures 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.970
 we saw it two turns this around three 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.610
 minutes four minutes we could be 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.220
 the animal actually nothing very very 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.010
 slow movement is slow which 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.790
 happens is that for one if you have to swim 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.770
 pretty fast then be there low 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.750
 PSUV then a little one was 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.090
 diving then you have to take care of 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.400
 part of the pressures then not 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.390
 as we could follow very closely 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.390
 sometimes sometimes
