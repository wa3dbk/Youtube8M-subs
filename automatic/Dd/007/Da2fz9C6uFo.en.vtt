over the corner on the right or left and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.880 
over the corner on the right or left and
you<00:00:51.360> get<00:00:51.510> an<00:00:51.629> ice-cream<00:00:51.989> cone<00:00:52.289> shape<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
you get an ice-cream cone shape and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.790 
you get an ice-cream cone shape and
we'll<00:00:53.670> take<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.030> second<00:00:54.600> corner<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.649> that's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
we'll take that second corner so that's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
we'll take that second corner so that's
where<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.280> shot<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> little<00:00:56.730> bit<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.480> roll

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
where this shot a little bit just roll

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.290 
where this shot a little bit just roll
that<00:00:57.989> round<00:00:58.289> until<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.370> end<00:00:59.520> up<00:00:59.699> with<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that round until we end up with a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.110 
that round until we end up with a
perfect<00:01:00.840> ice<00:01:01.440> cream<00:01:01.739> cup<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> nice<00:01:02.430> tight

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
perfect ice cream cup with a nice tight

point<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> end<00:01:04.700> okay<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.060> let<00:01:06.210> go

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
point at the end okay now if we let go

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.230 
point at the end okay now if we let go
that<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.869> would<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.350> unroll<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:09.030> just

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that that would just unroll so we just

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.620 
that that would just unroll so we just
take<00:01:09.630> those<00:01:09.930> top<00:01:10.610> corn<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.939> little<00:01:12.180> ears<00:01:12.360> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
take those top corn the little ears that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.990 
take those top corn the little ears that
are<00:01:12.750> sticking<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> fold<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.799> over<00:01:14.000> two

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
are sticking up and fold that over two

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.460 
are sticking up and fold that over two
or<00:01:15.119> three<00:01:15.360> times<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.619> secure<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:18.470> icing

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
or three times just to secure the icing

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.630 
or three times just to secure the icing
bag<00:01:19.650> from<00:01:19.890> unrolling<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.720> there<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:21.990> go

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
bag from unrolling so there you go

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.840 
bag from unrolling so there you go
another<00:01:23.640> fold<00:01:24.210> at<00:01:25.140> three<00:01:25.530> folds<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.490> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
another fold at three folds now you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.719 
another fold at three folds now you
could<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.540> wanted<00:01:27.990> take<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.070> little<00:01:29.400> bit<00:01:29.579> of

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
could if you wanted take a little bit of

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.460 
could if you wanted take a little bit of
scotch<00:01:30.030> tape<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.509> little<00:01:30.750> bit<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.960> sellotape

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
scotch tape a little bit of sellotape

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.850 
scotch tape a little bit of sellotape
and<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:32.340> tape<00:01:32.670> over<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:34.049> stop<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.560> from

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
and just tape over that to stop it from

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.830 
and just tape over that to stop it from
unraveling<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:36.060> you're<00:01:36.210> making<00:01:36.450> several

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
unraveling if you're making several

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.929 
unraveling if you're making several
these<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.200> possibly<00:01:37.650> worth<00:01:37.860> doing<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
these is possibly worth doing and

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.429 
these is possibly worth doing and
that'll<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.329> hold<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.659> replace<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.170> pop

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
that'll just hold it replace you pop

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.410 
that'll just hold it replace you pop
that<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:41.100> fairly<00:01:41.610> safe<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.420> won't<00:01:42.600> undo

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
that in be fairly safe that won't undo

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.320 
that in be fairly safe that won't undo
so<00:01:44.290> I'll<00:01:44.530> just<00:01:44.799> make<00:01:45.009> up<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.189> next<00:01:45.549> one<00:01:45.700> we'll

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
so I'll just make up the next one we'll

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.600 
so I'll just make up the next one we'll
just<00:01:46.509> put<00:01:46.659> that<00:01:46.689> on<00:01:46.840> fast-forward<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:48.369> you<00:01:48.460> can

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
just put that on fast-forward so you can

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.289 
just put that on fast-forward so you can
see<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.470> given<00:01:50.470> that<00:01:50.560> elegant<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.270> beautiful

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299
