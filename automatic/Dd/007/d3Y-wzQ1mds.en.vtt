00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
here because I will introduce you a new

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.020 
here because I will introduce you a new
game<00:02:08.539> made<00:02:09.539> by<00:02:09.569> some<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.679> my<00:02:10.890> Italian<00:02:11.310> friends

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
game made by some of my Italian friends

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.530 
game made by some of my Italian friends
and<00:02:12.409> well<00:02:13.409> the<00:02:13.709> game<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:13.920> called<00:02:14.849> land<00:02:15.360> of

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and well the game is called land of

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.899 
and well the game is called land of
Britain<00:02:16.049> and<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:17.159> really<00:02:17.459> cool

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
Britain and it's really cool

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.420 
Britain and it's really cool
first<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.690> all<00:02:18.780> because<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.290> Italian<00:02:19.740> and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
first of all because it is Italian and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.250 
first of all because it is Italian and
so<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.060> will<00:02:21.390> bring<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.870> Italian<00:02:22.230> flag<00:02:22.530> because

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
so I will bring the Italian flag because

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.720 
so I will bring the Italian flag because
usually<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:26.230> don't<00:02:26.349> develop<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.129> many<00:02:27.370> games

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
usually we don't develop so many games

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.360 
usually we don't develop so many games
so<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.959> new<00:02:29.080> thing<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:30.030> well<00:02:32.220> second<00:02:33.220> but

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
so it's a new thing and well second but

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.930 
so it's a new thing and well second but
not<00:02:33.700> less<00:02:33.909> important<00:02:34.510> because<00:02:35.280> it's<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.489> PvP

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940
