00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:03.510
 Today at the internet auction 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.770

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.260
 Listen to your opinion 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.340
 The contract is two years 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.640
 But 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.090
 In recent years Hosokawa has won many face sellers 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.780
 To no protective film 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.970
 Compared with the UK ad 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.560
 I'm heading for myself 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.409
 I read that I thought it would be nice to have that film 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.330
 I intended to be like that 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.320
 f1 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.540

 Yesterday the day before yesterday 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.800
 am 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.140
 I left it to say that there were many at that time 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.390
 I do not want to get upset right now, but 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.390
 We cope through correspondence May movement 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.650
 How 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.410
 Well what does it say on film? 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.479
 You're in trouble if you can make a wide and sharp dent 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.579
 At the root of the body 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.579
 I thought it was American 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.969
 that 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:14.519
 For example because it was awful condition, how for the team 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.260
 I wanted to clean it but my stomach was in front 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.149
 Follow 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:23.089
 Such a large amount of air enters in such a way and it becomes profitable 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.680
 A memorial game that has become like this stage 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.870
 I also want to buy a protective film 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.069
 I can say such a thing 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.509
 I went to the temple on that 20th 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.979
 So far in the house this is 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.449
 I used it for the market of Willcom 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.550
 I will not stop this time 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.480

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.209

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.749
 End 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.739
 . 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.189
 16th 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:23.609
 Oh this is really the end eye 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.920
 I do not always wonder if I am not at home 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.519
 9 in the average of critical metal tone for 16 standing 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:34.599
 Approach has no reply 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.209
 I have not done it 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.499
 I wrote a sale ipat 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.579

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.579

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.529

 The president is in full operation from plastic 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:02.409
 Once 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.719
 I want to wear my favorite 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.449
 I recalled that it was a while 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.249
 Typically 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.639
 In addition to one block, color or this event Calletta 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.600
 Blue or white house 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.879
 Right after this 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.080
 I'm meeting this 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.610
 Eklek 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.120
 But this German dock 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.150
 No comment on the question whether it is southern 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.310
 Where the book is the new version of ubuntu was glad to see the archipelago power button 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.999

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.119
 There is no problem at all in using Laughter 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:56.639
 It is written that it corresponds to the second generation third generation 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.559
 Because 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.430

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.580
 Andean voice 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.600
 I think that I can get it if I miss two even if I go beyond great 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.740
 Let's go 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.740
 Like this 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 It became impossible to watch during ion execution 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.680

 As much as possible
