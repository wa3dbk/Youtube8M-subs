00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.480
 at 20 cm are the two formations the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.460
 less prolific in 2015 with only 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.470
 two points garnered over the period 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.180
 in this late afternoon both 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.730
 teams compete with the goal 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.289
 common to finally find success the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.880
 have not won since the 13 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.070
 December but remains on a draw 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.349
 snatched at the end of the match at the velodrome and 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.119
 the messins have not won 2 since 13 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.880
 10 defeats and three draws 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.250
 in fact the reasons for satisfaction are 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.140
 a little bit rarer as much as in 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.149
 start of the meeting are the Reims 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.829
 who will get the main 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.870
 opportunities with this typing of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.059
 preville exit in front of his line by 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.039
 Roman still metanire the pressure 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.610
 exercised by men of jean luc 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.610
 vasseur 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.949
 the shot of benjamin moukandjo and beautiful 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.110
 johann carrasso's cuff at the first 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.149
 post prevents top scorer remmois 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.579
 cameroon and moukandjo to open the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.680
 strong mark was too short but 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.080
 then when you play were good 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.519
 present a reaction of the houses on 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.030
 set pieces must help 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:14.400
 involuntary on Saturday to see the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.140
 first notable opportunity garnets the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.170
 kossi clapper still agassa 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.150
 holder in place of johnny placid 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.810
 the messins are taken against 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.540
 this sequence 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.490
 with a conclusion that is not 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.530
 happy for nicolas de preville who 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.530
 sees his shot hijacked at the last moment 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:43.159
 0 0 at the break but it continues 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:46.490
 to have a shortage of offensive more than 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.259
 450 minutes at that moment of the game 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.659
 but albert cartier's instructions go 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.530
 to be heard beyond this 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.009
 opportunity to remakes let's do 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.600
 a beautiful second period 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.899
 here and benjamin moukandjo is too short 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.650
 on the center of ait Saturday but behind 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:10.080
 all the hot actions will be for 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.910
 the messins reminder is red lantern the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.250
 championship captain sylvain marchal 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.370
 in imbalance requires 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:22.710
 kossi agassa to unfold in advance 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.110
 in this meeting with beautiful 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.790
 taken initiative on the part of 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.430
 doctors the function override of 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.920
 Roman metanire and who had come 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.590
 provide support 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.660
 once again the Togolese porter 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.390
 decisive watch just like on this 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.340
 intervention in front of the Malian modibo 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.010
 maiga but it's closing a 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.080
 16th match out of 26 without scoring 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.570
 goal and the doctors are missing and will be 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.700
 no goal either the flock of Gregory 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.430
 bourillon ans flirts with the pole of 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.120
 johann carrasso we will stay there 0 0 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.010
 final score 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.500
 everyone had their half time but no one 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.180
 scoring and training remains so 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.180
 virgin victory in 2015
