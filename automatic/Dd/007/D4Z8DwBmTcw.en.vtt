00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.080
 the infrared is a type of light that does not 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.540
 we can see with our eyes in the 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.080
 The light spectrum is between 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.750
 700 and 1200 nanometers 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.450
 infrared light is not the only light that 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.480
 we can not see with our eyes there 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:29.259
 many more like gamma rays light 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.689
 ultraviolet x-rays radio waves each 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.370
 one of these different types of light we 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.380
 gives new information that we can not 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.320
 observe using simply our 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.469
 eyes our eyes can only see 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.969
 what we call light visible light 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.760
 infrared gives us information 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.940
 special that we can not get from the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.670
 visible light gives us information about the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.339
 temperature of an object all things 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.190
 they have some heat and they radiate light 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.980
 infrared even the things that 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.160
 we think they are very cold like 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.890
 an ice cube radiates some heat 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.920
 cold objects radiate less heat 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.320
 that hot objects objects 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.550
 hot ones they saw more brightly in the 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.020
 infrared because they radiate more heat 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.359
 and that's why more light is reflected 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.039
 another interesting fact about light 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:25.640
 infrared is that it travels through 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:28.130
 of the smoke thick dust or fog and others 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.250
 materials but can not go through 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.579
 glass the necessary photographic equipment 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.869
 it can be a conventional reflex camera 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.869
 accompanied by filters and film 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.569
 sensitive in this wavelength that 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.030
 we can observe two glasses one with water 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.280
 hot and another with cold water in the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.079
 photography in visible light we can not 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.090
 say only looking which glass 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.489
 contains cold water which water 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.439
 hot in the infrared image we can 

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:56.329
 clearly observe the bright from 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.520
 the hot water in the glass of the 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.670
 left and the darkest and coldest water in 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.709
 the glass on the right if we had eyes 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.670
 infrared we could say if an object 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:09.220
 It is hot or cold without having to touch it 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.590
 the infrared filters have like 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.650
 mission to exclude ultraviolet light and 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.319
 all or a large part of the spectrum 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.620
 visible letting go in the camera about 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.659
 the infrared respect 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.030
 this works as seen in the 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.549
 predator movies an extraterrestrial 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.010
 that hunted to give us 8 negre using 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.080
 your infrared view uses and 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.409
 applications of this type of photographs 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.260
 they are very varied they are used for things 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.599
 scientific as well as artistic on satellites 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.629
 of climate as an example and the study of 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.129
 cold and warm-blooded animals the 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.470
 police use it to find 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.810
 criminals hiding in the dark or 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.519
 rescue people from smoke in what 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.040
 artistic interesting effects are achieved 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.310
 like the vegetation tends to be 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.319
 white in this video can appreciate 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.810
 how infrared light works in a 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.180
 remote control with the blue device that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.340
 it shows is connected to a stack of 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.590
 lithium and its function is to turn on a led 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.409
 every time you receive an infrared signal 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.019
 of the control either by changing channel or 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:15.269
 raising the volume since like us 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.530
 we can not observe that the LED that sends 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.350
 Infrared control light 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.840
 can only be appreciated by means of 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.520
 a camera and the device we're going to 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.069
 be every time you use this 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.900
 function will see how it flashes 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.350
 different ways depending on the 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.360
 control and they will see their luminosity also 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.640
 varies in different colors so 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.300
 general you see a blue ring or 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.300
 yellowish
