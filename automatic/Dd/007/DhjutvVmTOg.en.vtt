know EAS the phosphagen HP and that's
what<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.720> was<00:01:27.930> into<00:01:28.430> with<00:01:29.430> being<00:01:29.790> seven

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
what really I was into with being seven

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.540 
what really I was into with being seven
years<00:01:30.420> drug-free<00:01:31.070> that's<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:32.370> of<00:01:32.400> like

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550

give<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:43.430> polygraph<00:01:44.020> now<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.770> only<00:01:45.920> thing<00:01:46.160> is

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
give you polygraph now the only thing is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.610 
give you polygraph now the only thing is
with<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.520> polygraph<00:01:46.940> is<00:01:47.600> you<00:01:48.260> know<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.410> can

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
with the polygraph is you know you can

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.440 
with the polygraph is you know you can
do<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.740> five<00:01:48.980> ten-minute<00:01:49.280> polygraph<00:01:49.880> test

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
do a five ten-minute polygraph test

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.240 
do a five ten-minute polygraph test
you<00:01:50.990> know<00:01:51.140> I'll<00:01:51.380> fit<00:01:51.530> my<00:01:51.680> little<00:01:51.830> finger<00:01:52.160> to

you know he even said a true polygraph
test<00:02:07.370> is<00:02:07.640> gonna<00:02:08.179> take<00:02:08.479> 90<00:02:09.110> minutes<00:02:09.410> long

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
test is gonna take 90 minutes long

anything less than that it's not a true
polygraph<00:02:13.400> test<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.030> people<00:02:15.020> people<00:02:15.470> passed

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
polygraph test and people people passed

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.460 
polygraph test and people people passed
I<00:02:16.130> mean<00:02:16.280> people<00:02:16.610> pass<00:02:16.790> all<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.090> time<00:02:17.350> you<00:02:18.350> know

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
I mean people pass all the time you know

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.860 
I mean people pass all the time you know
when<00:02:18.620> they<00:02:18.710> they<00:02:19.100> only<00:02:19.250> do<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.600> 10<00:02:20.600> minutes

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
when they they only do it 10 minutes

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.710 
when they they only do it 10 minutes
30-minute<00:02:21.620> polygraph<00:02:22.100> test<00:02:22.360> not<00:02:23.360> too<00:02:23.600> many

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
30-minute polygraph test not too many

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.660 
30-minute polygraph test not too many
people<00:02:23.930> pass<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.740> they<00:02:24.860> do<00:02:24.920> an<00:02:25.280> hour<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.610> a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
people pass and they do an hour and a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.920 
people pass and they do an hour and a
half<00:02:25.790> polygraph<00:02:26.570> test

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
half polygraph test

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.840 
half polygraph test
so<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:28.610> know<00:02:28.990> you<00:02:29.990> know<00:02:30.140> it's<00:02:30.320> in<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.040> imba

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
so you know you know it's in the imba

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.670 
so you know you know it's in the imba
they<00:02:32.450> say<00:02:32.630> it's<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> seven-year<00:02:33.140> drug<00:02:33.380> free<00:02:33.560> it

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
they say it's a seven-year drug free it

they say it's a seven-year drug free it
is<00:02:33.760> we<00:02:34.760> have<00:02:34.880> we<00:02:35.180> have<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.890> imba<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:36.950> dunno<00:02:37.400> they

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
is we have we have a imba I dunno they

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.640 
is we have we have a imba I dunno they
have<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.420> category<00:02:38.660> that's<00:02:38.930> called<00:02:39.320> forever

they<00:02:49.580> do<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.730> polygraph<00:02:50.140> sometimes<00:02:51.140> they<00:02:51.230> don't

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
they do a polygraph sometimes they don't
