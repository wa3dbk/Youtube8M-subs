00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
those of you who think the dress is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.030 
those of you who think the dress is
white<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:15.960> gold<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.380> would<00:01:16.500> agree<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
white and gold I would agree with you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
white and gold I would agree with you
but<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.340> we'd<00:01:17.610> both<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.970> wrong<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.420> actually

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
but then we'd both be wrong I actually

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.090 
but then we'd both be wrong I actually
saw<00:01:18.990> white<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.290> gold<00:01:19.439> by<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.619> way<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.979> then

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
saw white and gold by the way and then

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.590 
saw white and gold by the way and then
about<00:01:20.310> five<00:01:20.549> minutes<00:01:20.580> later<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.060> looked<00:01:21.390> at<00:01:21.509> it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
about five minutes later I looked at it

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.030 
about five minutes later I looked at it
again<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.350> blue<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.619> black<00:01:22.770> garlic

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
again and it was blue and black garlic

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.590 
again and it was blue and black garlic
so<00:01:23.220> what<00:01:23.340> color<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.640> see<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> dress<00:01:24.360> guys

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
so what color you see it's a dress guys

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.230 
so what color you see it's a dress guys
and<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.439> think<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.220> focus<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.759> more

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and I think we can focus on more

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.300 
and I think we can focus on more
important<00:01:27.630> things<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.470> llama<00:01:28.680> chase<00:01:29.040> I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
important things like the llama chase I

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.630

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
found this llama chase to be extremely

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.060 
found this llama chase to be extremely
exciting<00:01:33.270> interesting<00:01:33.600> funny<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.829> then<00:01:34.950> you

exciting interesting funny but then you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.740 
exciting interesting funny but then you
know<00:01:35.189> also<00:01:35.400> meaningful<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.329> dress<00:01:36.540> was

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
know also meaningful the dress was

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.300
