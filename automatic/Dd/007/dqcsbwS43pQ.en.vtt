what<00:00:05.580> can<00:00:05.730> happen<00:00:05.910> 36<00:00:06.899> thousand<00:00:07.290> times<00:00:07.500> every

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
what can happen 36 thousand times every

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.760 
what can happen 36 thousand times every
second<00:00:08.519> do<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.450> know<00:00:15.230> now<00:00:16.230> before<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.590> answer

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
second do you know now before I answer

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.400 
second do you know now before I answer
that<00:00:16.890> question<00:00:17.400> let<00:00:17.850> me<00:00:17.940> bring<00:00:18.090> up<00:00:18.210> another

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
that question let me bring up another

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.349 
that question let me bring up another
what<00:00:19.410> makes<00:00:19.590> one<00:00:19.949> ink<00:00:20.160> cartridge<00:00:20.580> different

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
what makes one ink cartridge different

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.810 
what makes one ink cartridge different
from<00:00:21.480> another<00:00:21.859> now<00:00:22.859> these<00:00:22.980> may<00:00:23.189> look<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.609> same

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
from another now these may look the same

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.910 
from another now these may look the same
and<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.779> may<00:00:24.900> even<00:00:24.930> think<00:00:25.289> they<00:00:25.380> perform<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
and you may even think they perform the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.339 
and you may even think they perform the
same<00:00:26.130> job<00:00:26.430> however<00:00:27.119> there<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> difference

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
same job however there is a difference

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.830 
same job however there is a difference
it's<00:00:29.099> what's<00:00:29.369> behind<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.119> also<00:00:30.449> what's

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it's what's behind it and also what's

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.250 
it's what's behind it and also what's
inside<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:32.160> makes<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.460> stand<00:00:32.640> apart<00:00:33.260> for

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
inside it that makes it stand apart for

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.130 
inside it that makes it stand apart for
