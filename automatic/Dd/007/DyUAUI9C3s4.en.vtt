00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.490
 palermo and hellas verona face each other 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.110
 in the third elimination round of tim cup 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.580
 gennaro gattuso confirms ten 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.380
 eleventh of the training he has 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.480
 beat the Cremonese with San Severino 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.680
 which detects stefano vice on the left 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.390
 in the trio behind lafferty 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 completed by di bala and them and if 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.439
 whistle to start the driving game 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.480
 the referee of this lafferty meeting 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.670
 immediately tries to steal Rafael's ball 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.470
 succeeds but the ball ends at the bottom e 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.170
 therefore the action of the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.390
 number 18 rosanero the palermo pushes 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.950
 on the right with paolo di bala that 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.690
 check this ball then kick it 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.540
 left very severed the conclusion 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.100
 However, the ball ends its run 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.899
 on the outside of the test almond net 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.640
 to shake his but the palermo that makes 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.410
 the game does not see the difference of 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.010
 category between the two teams cross from the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.079
 left 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.059
 the early bala bid checks 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.430
 in the area, however, he hits the post in full 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.100
 this unfortunate left-handed conclusion 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.739
 really the Argentine number 9 that does 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.809
 tremble the door defended by Raffaele la 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.219
 desperation of paolo di bala and then 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.080
 giulio san severino who has a good one 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.129
 chance on the left controls the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.530
 balloon enters his left area 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.200
 however it ends high above the crossbar 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.150
 good opportunity for the number 7 rosanero 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.369
 the verona passes to the first carelessness 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.350
 rosanero with luca toni that crushes 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.060
 this head ball fails 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.729
 sorrentino to grab the ball 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.850
 the rejoicing of the number 9 for the most 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.580
 classic of the former goals and therefore the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.070
 Verona takes the lead to Barbera 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 at the thirty - seventh of the first half la 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.579
 feature rejoicing tones there 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.040
 time in the final for one last action 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.320
 rosanero with this ball that is 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.960
 rears up after this cross from the right 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.110
 driving whistles the end of the first half 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.670
 therefore an unlucky palermo despite 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.409
 a good performance enters hernandez 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.570
 in the second half in place of san severino 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.759
 immediately the Uruguayan dangerous with 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.680
 this left-handed diagonal that ends at 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.960
 the palermo side continues to push 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.180
 sinisa andelkovic really unlucky 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.579
 beautiful his left-handed balloon turn 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.890
 that breaks on the second crossbar 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.649
 pole for palermo in the meeting on 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.630
 verona then tries to attack on 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.100
 left this cross is diverted into 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.770
 net from cacia but the referee cancels 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.990
 for offside position of the number 8 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.290
 Veronese again we see on the cross there 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.160
 the header of tones that makes then 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.620
 incline the assistant for 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.050
 network cancellation a scrum in 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.480
 area is resolved by Stefano Sorrentino 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.210
 with this intervention, however, the referee 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.280
 had stopped the game for a position 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.310
 irregular once again of a 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.040
 striker from Verona the Palermo now 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.410
 attack and this header of moras 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.780
 Rafael Ballo is not surprising 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.700
 that ends in a corner kick after having 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.740
 touched the crossbar 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.620
 the palermo then protests for this 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.840
 contact in the area between lores and martino 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.610
 the referee does not see the details for the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.700
 penalty kick now we go to 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.920
 review slow images 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.250
 let's review the contact by guide again 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.890
 venial and therefore does not indicate the disk 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.900
 the race director who does however 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.540
 just as soon after and here the doubts are 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.240
 decidedly more on this foul than 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.660
 hand of laner the great protests of the 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.550
 rosanero bench and also of the players 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.110
 we actually review the player 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.990
 Veronese touches the ball with his hand 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.000
 after hitting it with your foot 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.160
 vehement protests of the whole environment 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.960
 rosanero lead to the removal of the 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.640
 mister gennaro gattuso first expulsion 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.380
 so in Italy, however, there is one for him 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.360
 great ovation of the public a 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.160
 transport it to the entrance of the 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.070
 locker room tunnel in the end 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.300
 rafael suo's great intervention 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.550
 hernÃ ndez beautiful turn 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.800
 the goalkeeper skips from the Uruguayan 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.870
 veronese in area laner tries to close 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.930
 the accounts but does not find the mirror in 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.450
 this conclusion of about 18 meters 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.730
 that thanks to stefano sorrentino 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.370
 in the final a turn of bala comes 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.290
 deflected in a corner kick by 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.470
 a Verona defender on the beaten corner 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.000
 from the same number 9 thirds he sends high 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.070
 head is the last chance for i 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.210
 rosanero that also loses in the final 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.250
 for double admonition 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.110
 armin bacinovic is away 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.630
 by the referee the palermo goes out with 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.280
 so many regrets from the tim cup signals 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.410
 positive however in view of the challenge of 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.720
 all there are, that's why 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.460
 rosanero team is still accepted 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.460
 from the applause of the Barbera public
