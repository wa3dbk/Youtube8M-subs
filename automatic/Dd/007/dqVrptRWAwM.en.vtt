though<00:02:11.319> like<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:12.040> has<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.370> see<00:02:12.580> has<00:02:12.819> to<00:02:12.849> say<00:02:13.150> a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
though like it has to see has to say a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.229 
though like it has to see has to say a
man<00:02:14.010> nice<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.280> groomed<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:16.000> yeah<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:19.150> the

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
man nice and groomed and yeah in the

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.630 
man nice and groomed and yeah in the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
middle so if that's the alternative I

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.180 
middle so if that's the alternative I
