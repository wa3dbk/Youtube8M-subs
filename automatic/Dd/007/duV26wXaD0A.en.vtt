computer<00:03:59.989> harness<00:04:00.680> comes<00:04:00.890> out<00:04:01.160> of<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.580> had

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
computer harness comes out of that had

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.090 
computer harness comes out of that had
to<00:04:02.000> get<00:04:02.150> got<00:04:02.810> in<00:04:03.020> there<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.590> was<00:04:03.709> just<00:04:03.770> so

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
to get got in there and it was just so

and<00:04:32.139> so<00:04:32.320> forth<00:04:33.090> this<00:04:34.199> actually<00:04:35.820> this<00:04:36.820> whole

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
and so forth this actually this whole

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.540 
and so forth this actually this whole
factor<00:04:38.160> alternator<00:04:39.449> and<00:04:41.039> air<00:04:42.039> conditioner

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
factor alternator and air conditioner

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.850 
factor alternator and air conditioner
goes<00:04:42.789> into<00:04:44.250> this<00:04:45.250> guy<00:04:46.139> which<00:04:47.139> is<00:04:47.169> back<00:04:47.470> in<00:04:47.650> here

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
goes into this guy which is back in here

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.580 
goes into this guy which is back in here
with<00:04:47.979> all<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.340> air<00:04:48.520> conditioner<00:04:49.000> stuff<00:04:49.270> is

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
with all the air conditioner stuff is

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.680 
with all the air conditioner stuff is
and<00:04:50.760> this<00:04:51.760> thing<00:04:53.550> last<00:04:54.550> I<00:04:54.820> will<00:04:55.000> relay<00:04:55.389> the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
and this thing last I will relay the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.310 
and this thing last I will relay the
only<00:04:55.990> reason<00:04:56.380> it's<00:04:56.560> in<00:04:56.710> there<00:04:56.919> right<00:04:57.130> now<00:04:58.320> is

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
only reason it's in there right now is

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
only reason it's in there right now is
because<00:04:59.530> I<00:04:59.740> can't

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
because I can't

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.830 
because I can't
I<00:05:00.430> haven't<00:05:00.789> yet<00:05:01.030> just<00:05:01.389> figured<00:05:01.720> out

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
I haven't yet just figured out

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.250 
I haven't yet just figured out
completely<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.740> wiring<00:05:03.250> on<00:05:03.430> it<00:05:04.080> some<00:05:05.080> of<00:05:05.110> this

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
completely the wiring on it some of this

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.500 
completely the wiring on it some of this
is<00:05:05.410> power<00:05:05.650> back<00:05:06.039> in<00:05:06.250> here<00:05:06.490> to<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.850> blower<00:05:07.300> and

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
is power back in here to the blower and

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.689 
is power back in here to the blower and
just<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.289> the<00:05:08.440> other<00:05:09.270> but<00:05:10.270> there<00:05:11.169> is<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:12.190> line

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
just and the other but there is a line

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.219 
just and the other but there is a line
in<00:05:13.150> here<00:05:13.600> that<00:05:14.440> comes<00:05:14.740> from<00:05:15.389> the<00:05:16.389> AC<00:05:16.570> harness

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
in here that comes from the AC harness

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.510 
in here that comes from the AC harness
goes<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:19.510> fast<00:05:20.349> idle<00:05:20.620> still<00:05:20.979> annoyed<00:05:21.220> of

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
goes to the fast idle still annoyed of

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.100 
goes to the fast idle still annoyed of
course<00:05:21.760> back<00:05:21.970> over<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.419> fast<00:05:22.660> idle<00:05:23.070> but<00:05:24.070> I

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
course back over to the fast idle but I

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.850 
course back over to the fast idle but I
think<00:05:26.110> I<00:05:26.639> may<00:05:27.639> not<00:05:27.910> need<00:05:28.090> it<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:29.320> pressure

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
think I may not need it the pressure

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.700 
think I may not need it the pressure
regulator<00:05:30.610> switch<00:05:31.090> right<00:05:31.389> there<00:05:31.419> right<00:05:32.320> after

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
regulator switch right there right after

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.900 
regulator switch right there right after
that<00:05:32.860> it<00:05:33.820> comes<00:05:34.090> through<00:05:34.330> here<00:05:34.599> and<00:05:34.780> goes<00:05:34.990> to

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
that it comes through here and goes to

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.740 
that it comes through here and goes to
that<00:05:36.910> relay<00:05:37.419> I<00:05:37.860> believe<00:05:39.090> now<00:05:40.090> all<00:05:40.270> these<00:05:40.419> well

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
that relay I believe now all these well

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.850 
that relay I believe now all these well
there's<00:05:40.960> a<00:05:40.990> couple<00:05:41.080> of<00:05:41.229> other<00:05:41.349> things<00:05:41.440> in

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
there's a couple of other things in

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.520 
there's a couple of other things in
there<00:05:42.270> but<00:05:43.270> they<00:05:43.449> just<00:05:43.630> can't<00:05:43.780> but<00:05:44.050> this<00:05:44.199> one

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
there but they just can't but this one

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.110 
there but they just can't but this one
of<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:44.740> wires<00:05:44.949> goes<00:05:45.280> back<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.699> the<00:05:45.789> computer

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
of the wires goes back to the computer

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.640 
of the wires goes back to the computer
and<00:05:46.270> I'm<00:05:46.510> sure<00:05:46.720> that's<00:05:47.050> just<00:05:47.139> to<00:05:47.380> tell<00:05:47.560> the

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
and I'm sure that's just to tell the

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.170 
and I'm sure that's just to tell the
computer<00:05:47.919> that<00:05:48.220> this<00:05:48.400> is<00:05:48.550> going<00:05:48.820> on<00:05:48.940> that's

that loop or not and that's the one

that loop or not and that's the one

now<00:06:33.250> we<00:06:34.250> look<00:06:34.370> at<00:06:34.490> all<00:06:34.580> the<00:06:34.610> space<00:06:34.940> in<00:06:35.150> this

now we look at all the space in this

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.650 
now we look at all the space in this
thing<00:06:35.479> once<00:06:35.750> you<00:06:35.810> jerk<00:06:36.199> everything<00:06:36.710> out<00:06:36.919> of<00:06:36.949> it

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
thing once you jerk everything out of it

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.510 
thing once you jerk everything out of it
look<00:06:38.660> how<00:06:38.780> much<00:06:38.930> room<00:06:39.110> is<00:06:39.320> in<00:06:39.350> there<00:06:39.620> there's

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
look how much room is in there there's

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.050 
look how much room is in there there's
two<00:06:40.759> feet<00:06:41.030> from<00:06:41.210> the<00:06:41.330> front<00:06:41.630> of<00:06:41.660> the<00:06:41.720> block<00:06:43.060> to

the condenser and once everything is
there<00:06:46.970> you<00:06:47.270> don't<00:06:47.389> have<00:06:47.509> an<00:06:47.690> inch<00:06:47.960> to<00:06:48.139> move

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
there you don't have an inch to move

there you don't have an inch to move
this<00:06:50.389> thing<00:06:50.660> is<00:06:50.900> getting<00:06:51.080> ready<00:06:52.630> as<00:06:53.630> soon<00:06:53.780> as<00:06:53.870> I

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
this thing is getting ready as soon as I
