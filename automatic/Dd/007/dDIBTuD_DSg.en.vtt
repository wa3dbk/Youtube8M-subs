00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
first out when it came to me actually

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.889 
first out when it came to me actually
the<00:00:35.010> side<00:00:35.190> was<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:35.969> cracked<00:00:36.329> I've

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the side was in but it's cracked I've

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.170 
the side was in but it's cracked I've
taken<00:00:37.170> them<00:00:37.320> out<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.010> piece<00:00:38.489> out<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.120> I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
taken them out the piece out so that I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.090 
taken them out the piece out so that I
can<00:00:39.390> actually<00:00:39.750> get<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.500> grips<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.800> what's

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
can actually get to grips with what's

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.450 
can actually get to grips with what's
going<00:00:41.309> wrong<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.790> basically<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
going wrong with it basically one of the

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.190 
going wrong with it basically one of the
struts<00:00:44.460> inside<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.390> parallel<00:00:45.690> struck<00:00:46.050> by

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
struts inside this is parallel struck by

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.240 
struts inside this is parallel struck by
the<00:00:46.260> way<00:00:46.379> they're<00:00:46.500> not<00:00:46.530> expressed<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:49.250> it's

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the way they're not expressed so it's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.270 
the way they're not expressed so it's
allowed<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.809> collapse<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.140> break<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
allowed it to collapse and break so the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.529 
allowed it to collapse and break so the
first<00:00:53.489> time<00:00:53.610> I'm<00:00:53.699> going<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.180> I've<00:00:54.390> got

in now that's we're going to feed hot
steam<00:01:54.329> into<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.590> glue<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.369> used

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
steam into that the glue that was used

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.639 
steam into that the glue that was used
in<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.850> period<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:58.700> soluble<00:01:59.700> with<00:02:00.149> heat<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
in this period is soluble with heat and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.560 
in this period is soluble with heat and
moisture<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:02.579> we<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.880> some<00:02:03.060> hot<00:02:03.270> steam

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
moisture so if we get some hot steam

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.109 
moisture so if we get some hot steam
into<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.020> it'll<00:02:04.439> simply<00:02:05.280> lift<00:02:05.520> off<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.880> say

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
into it it'll simply lift off I say

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.450 
into it it'll simply lift off I say
simply<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:06.780> not<00:02:06.899> obvious<00:02:07.380> we'll<00:02:08.340> get<00:02:08.429> most

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
simply it's not obvious we'll get most

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.720 
simply it's not obvious we'll get most
quite<00:02:09.580> easily<00:02:10.080> okay<00:02:11.080> let's<00:02:11.320> do<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.740> I'm

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
quite easily okay let's do that I'm

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.640 
quite easily okay let's do that I'm
gonna<00:02:12.880> use<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.330> long<00:02:13.540> series<00:02:14.020> two<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.620> a

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
gonna use it a long series two and a

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.820 
gonna use it a long series two and a
half<00:02:14.770> mil<00:02:15.070> drill<00:02:18.330> which<00:02:19.330> should<00:02:19.620> go<00:02:20.620> through

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
half mil drill which should go through

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.280 
half mil drill which should go through
the<00:02:20.920> fret<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.670> into<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.910> dovetail<00:02:25.110> I'm<00:02:26.110> gonna

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
the fret and into the dovetail I'm gonna

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:42.589 
the fret and into the dovetail I'm gonna
get<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.560> as<00:02:26.830> low<00:02:27.160> as<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.370> possibly<00:02:27.700> can

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.000 

the<00:02:43.599> reason<00:02:43.930> I'm<00:02:44.019> going<00:02:44.049> through<00:02:44.409> the<00:02:44.530> fret<00:02:44.799> is

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
the reason I'm going through the fret is

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.520 
the reason I'm going through the fret is
that<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:46.060> hole<00:02:46.299> won't<00:02:46.750> be<00:02:46.959> visible<00:02:47.230> under

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
that this hole won't be visible under

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.330 
that this hole won't be visible under
the<00:02:48.010> new<00:02:48.159> fret<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.269> a<00:02:52.540> domestic<00:02:53.340> steam

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
the new fret so this is a domestic steam

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.630 
the new fret so this is a domestic steam
generator<00:02:54.849> for<00:02:55.209> an<00:02:55.629> iron<00:02:55.989> it's<00:02:56.920> also

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.099 

basically<00:03:03.640> that's<00:03:03.879> gonna<00:03:04.510> give<00:03:04.689> me<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.870> steam

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
basically that's gonna give me the steam

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.259 
basically that's gonna give me the steam
to<00:03:05.290> get<00:03:05.409> into<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.799> so<00:03:06.310> I've<00:03:06.819> made<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.209> little

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
to get into it so I've made this little

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.000 
to get into it so I've made this little
jig<00:03:07.659> that<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.049> connect<00:03:08.319> on<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.709> it

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
jig that I can connect on to it

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.890 
jig that I can connect on to it
I<00:03:09.040> made<00:03:09.519> this<00:03:09.670> little<00:03:09.969> thing<00:03:10.389> up<00:03:10.510> these<00:03:10.659> are

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
I made this little thing up these are

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.559 
I made this little thing up these are
thin<00:03:11.560> brass<00:03:11.859> tubes<00:03:12.189> that<00:03:13.120> I've<00:03:13.209> solved<00:03:13.540> it

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
thin brass tubes that I've solved it

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.869 
thin brass tubes that I've solved it
into<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.870> piece<00:03:14.049> of<00:03:14.170> copper<00:03:14.319> pipe<00:03:14.609> let<00:03:15.609> me<00:03:15.760> end

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
into a piece of copper pipe let me end

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.009 
into a piece of copper pipe let me end
off<00:03:16.030> put<00:03:16.689> a<00:03:16.720> fitting<00:03:17.049> on<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.799> for<00:03:18.250> them<00:03:19.019> it's

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
off put a fitting on it so for them it's

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.119 
off put a fitting on it so for them it's
pretty<00:03:20.139> essential<00:03:20.379> that<00:03:20.650> we<00:03:20.739> hold<00:03:20.919> it<00:03:21.069> on

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
pretty essential that we hold it on

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.250 
pretty essential that we hold it on
tight<00:03:21.400> because<00:03:21.819> hot<00:03:22.510> steams<00:03:22.840> obviously

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
tight because hot steams obviously

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.379 
tight because hot steams obviously
pretty<00:03:23.439> dangerous<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.819> I'm<00:03:24.909> just<00:03:25.060> got<00:03:25.180> time

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
pretty dangerous so I'm just got time

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:46.140 
pretty dangerous so I'm just got time
malfunction

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.660 

that's<00:03:47.150> pretty<00:03:47.420> hot

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
that's pretty hot

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.270 
that's pretty hot
others<00:03:49.670> need<00:03:49.819> to<00:03:49.849> go<00:03:50.000> as<00:03:50.120> low<00:03:50.330> as<00:03:50.450> possible<00:03:51.280> we

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
others need to go as low as possible we

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.660 
others need to go as low as possible we
drilled<00:03:52.550> quite<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:52.819> way<00:03:53.060> down<00:03:53.239> there<00:03:53.300> and<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:54.709> can

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
drilled quite a way down there and I can

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.229 
drilled quite a way down there and I can
feel<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:55.970> what<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:56.959> hit<00:03:57.260> with<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.590> drill<00:03:58.239> was

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
feel that what I hit with the drill was

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.210 
feel that what I hit with the drill was
the<00:03:59.480> gap<00:03:59.660> in<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.050> in<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.500> dovetail<00:04:00.860> so<00:04:01.099> that

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
the gap in the in the dovetail so that

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:10.059 
the gap in the in the dovetail so that
were<00:04:01.340> in<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.519> right<00:04:01.640> place<00:04:08.650> when<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:09.739> started

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
were in the right place when I started

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.900 
were in the right place when I started
going<00:04:14.470> this<00:04:15.470> can<00:04:15.680> take<00:04:15.890> anything<00:04:16.220> from<00:04:16.519> sort

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
going this can take anything from sort

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.259 
going this can take anything from sort
of<00:04:17.000> 15<00:04:17.419> minutes<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.900> half<00:04:18.079> an<00:04:18.229> hour<00:04:19.269> but

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
of 15 minutes to half an hour but

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.050 
of 15 minutes to half an hour but
eventually<00:04:20.750> we'll<00:04:21.709> start<00:04:21.979> seeing<00:04:22.220> steam<00:04:22.639> come

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
eventually we'll start seeing steam come

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.159 
eventually we'll start seeing steam come
out<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.330> side<00:04:23.540> exit<00:04:23.810> etc<00:04:25.450> as<00:04:26.450> you<00:04:26.630> can<00:04:26.810> see<00:04:26.960> now

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
out the side exit etc as you can see now

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.659 
out the side exit etc as you can see now
it's<00:04:27.350> starting<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.680> push<00:04:27.950> up<00:04:28.130> he's<00:04:28.280> finding

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
it's starting to push up he's finding

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:35.110 
it's starting to push up he's finding
all<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:28.910> holes<00:04:31.510> it<00:04:32.510> will<00:04:32.750> get<00:04:32.990> hotter<00:04:34.120> the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
all the holes it will get hotter the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:45.209 
all the holes it will get hotter the
glue<00:04:35.360> will<00:04:35.479> get<00:04:35.660> softer

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:45.219 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.570 

you<00:04:46.219> can<00:04:46.369> feel<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.639> glue<00:04:46.819> coming<00:04:47.059> out<00:04:47.270> of

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
you can feel the glue coming out of

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:56.139 
you can feel the glue coming out of
convention<00:04:50.110> city<00:04:52.089> taking<00:04:53.089> effect<00:04:55.029> you<00:04:56.029> may

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:56.149 
convention city taking effect you may

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:57.489 
convention city taking effect you may
think<00:04:56.389> that<00:04:56.449> this<00:04:56.599> is<00:04:56.779> sort<00:04:56.930> of<00:04:57.020> destroyed

00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:57.499 
think that this is sort of destroyed

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.339 
think that this is sort of destroyed
guitar<00:04:57.800> but<00:04:58.009> it<00:04:58.279> doesn't<00:04:58.699> and<00:04:59.210> it<00:04:59.629> destroys

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
guitar but it doesn't and it destroys

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.719 
guitar but it doesn't and it destroys
the<00:05:00.499> finish<00:05:02.139> so<00:05:03.159> when<00:05:04.159> you've<00:05:04.309> done<00:05:04.460> this<00:05:04.669> job

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
the finish so when you've done this job

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:33.770 
the finish so when you've done this job
you<00:05:05.240> have<00:05:05.599> to<00:05:05.629> refinish

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.590 

there's<00:05:34.780> actually<00:05:35.110> a<00:05:35.140> crack<00:05:35.380> here<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:37.240> it's

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
there's actually a crack here and it's

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.180 
there's actually a crack here and it's
making<00:05:38.230> it<00:05:38.320> difficult<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.770> come<00:05:38.890> out<00:05:39.040> because

there's the bottom part they put it in
with<00:06:03.460> a<00:06:03.520> couple<00:06:03.700> of<00:06:04.500> shims<00:06:05.970> which<00:06:06.970> is<00:06:07.180> pretty

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
with a couple of shims which is pretty

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.520 
with a couple of shims which is pretty
normal<00:06:08.260> practice<00:06:08.830> it<00:06:09.190> has<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.460> bottom<00:06:09.610> half

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
normal practice it has the bottom half

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.920 
normal practice it has the bottom half
in<00:06:11.530> actual<00:06:11.830> fact<00:06:11.980> that<00:06:12.280> isn't<00:06:13.180> a<00:06:13.240> split<00:06:13.510> it<00:06:13.810> was

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
in actual fact that isn't a split it was

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.380 
in actual fact that isn't a split it was
made<00:06:14.140> in<00:06:14.290> two<00:06:14.440> parts<00:06:14.830> it<00:06:15.730> was<00:06:15.850> glued<00:06:16.030> on<00:06:16.240> to<00:06:16.360> the

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
made in two parts it was glued on to the

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.560 
made in two parts it was glued on to the
bottom<00:06:16.660> of<00:06:16.720> the<00:06:16.780> hill<00:06:19.410> way<00:06:21.000> so<00:06:22.000> the<00:06:22.120> next<00:06:22.330> job

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
bottom of the hill way so the next job

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.540 
bottom of the hill way so the next job
after<00:06:22.810> this<00:06:22.960> is<00:06:23.230> we<00:06:23.740> need<00:06:23.890> to<00:06:24.040> take<00:06:24.220> the<00:06:24.340> top

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
after this is we need to take the top

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.620 
after this is we need to take the top
off<00:06:26.340> we<00:06:27.340> can<00:06:27.490> just<00:06:27.640> cut<00:06:27.850> through<00:06:28.030> the<00:06:28.240> side<00:06:28.450> to

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
off we can just cut through the side to

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.110 
off we can just cut through the side to
take<00:06:28.750> off<00:06:28.960> I'd<00:06:29.920> like<00:06:29.950> to<00:06:30.130> keep<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:30.490> neck<00:06:30.850> block

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
take off I'd like to keep the neck block

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:39.719 
take off I'd like to keep the neck block
and<00:06:31.720> the<00:06:31.870> block<00:06:35.550> we<00:06:36.550> used<00:06:36.820> the<00:06:37.510> sides

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
and the block we used the sides

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:42.629 
and the block we used the sides
I<00:06:40.529> have<00:06:41.529> actually<00:06:41.680> taken<00:06:41.979> the<00:06:42.129> template<00:06:42.610> of

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
I have actually taken the template of

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:43.950 
I have actually taken the template of
the<00:06:42.819> side<00:06:43.029> already

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
the side already

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.920 
the side already
that's<00:06:44.589> the<00:06:44.830> with<00:06:45.789> the<00:06:46.389> top<00:06:46.569> is<00:06:46.779> actually

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
that's the with the top is actually

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.950 
that's the with the top is actually
straight<00:06:47.589> the<00:06:48.370> back<00:06:48.580> curves<00:06:49.059> and<00:06:49.599> get<00:06:49.870> the

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
straight the back curves and get the

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.850 
straight the back curves and get the
Marriott<00:06:50.289> in<00:06:50.319> front

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
Marriott in front

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.619 
Marriott in front
so<00:06:51.520> I've<00:06:51.610> already<00:06:51.729> take<00:06:51.999> the<00:06:52.150> template<00:06:52.539> of

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:52.629 
so I've already take the template of

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.100 
so I've already take the template of
that<00:06:52.749> side<00:06:53.430> so<00:06:54.430> we<00:06:54.639> can<00:06:54.669> take<00:06:55.389> these<00:06:55.509> sides<00:06:55.839> off

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
that side so we can take these sides off

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:05.290 
that side so we can take these sides off
and<00:06:56.349> separate<00:06:56.740> it<00:06:56.889> off

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.360
