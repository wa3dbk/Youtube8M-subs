see<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.440> moves<00:02:42.340> with<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.760> sounds<00:02:45.239> it's<00:02:46.239> a

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
see it moves with the sounds it's a

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.770 
see it moves with the sounds it's a
stainless<00:02:47.050> steel<00:02:47.290> watch<00:02:47.830> up<00:02:48.280> with<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.300> polish

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
stainless steel watch up with the polish

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.920 
stainless steel watch up with the polish
combination<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.860> what<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.670> really<00:02:52.209> like<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.870> a

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
combination and what I really like is a

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.120 
combination and what I really like is a
bead<00:02:53.830> blasted<00:02:54.489> finish<00:02:55.480> around<00:02:56.290> here<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:56.980> run

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
bead blasted finish around here and run

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.410 
bead blasted finish around here and run
the<00:02:57.280> edges<00:02:57.640> just<00:02:58.150> gonna<00:02:58.360> consume<00:02:58.900> it

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
the edges just gonna consume it

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.880 
the edges just gonna consume it
so<00:03:01.420> it's<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.840> case<00:03:02.110> with<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:04.500> can<00:03:05.500> see<00:03:05.680> the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
so it's a case with you can see the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.460 
so it's a case with you can see the
details<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.760> took<00:03:07.000> really<00:03:07.690> good

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
details and took really good

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.970 
details and took really good
well<00:03:08.920> done<00:03:09.250> watch<00:03:09.580> now<00:03:10.510> finished<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.769> would

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
well done watch now finished and I would

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.160 
well done watch now finished and I would
really<00:03:12.810> kept<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:14.170> model<00:03:14.910> if<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.239> wasn't<00:03:16.900> for

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
really kept this model if it wasn't for

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.240 
really kept this model if it wasn't for
the<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.920> small<00:03:18.430> dial<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:20.170> watches<00:03:20.860> over<00:03:21.040> all

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
the the small dial and watches over all

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.949 
the the small dial and watches over all
from<00:03:22.769> diameter<00:03:23.769> is<00:03:24.160> 40<00:03:24.670> mils<00:03:24.910> plus<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.660> crown

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
from diameter is 40 mils plus the crown

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.729 
from diameter is 40 mils plus the crown
but<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:27.100> face<00:03:27.820> or<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.570> dial<00:03:28.840> this<00:03:29.140> white<00:03:29.440> part

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
but the face or the dial this white part

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.750 
but the face or the dial this white part
here<00:03:29.890> as<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:31.320> somehow<00:03:32.320> small<00:03:32.829> somewhat<00:03:33.370> smaller

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
here as a somehow small somewhat smaller

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.530 
here as a somehow small somewhat smaller
and<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:35.260> doesn't<00:03:35.769> really<00:03:36.100> appear<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.970> be<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.150> 40

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
and it doesn't really appear to be a 40

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.500 
and it doesn't really appear to be a 40
mil<00:03:37.750> watch<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.320> just<00:03:38.980> looks<00:03:39.220> like<00:03:39.360> it's<00:03:40.360> a

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
mil watch it just looks like it's a

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.250 
mil watch it just looks like it's a
smaller<00:03:40.870> one<00:03:41.049> model<00:03:41.860> but<00:03:42.750> overall<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:44.049> good

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
smaller one model but overall the good

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.380 
smaller one model but overall the good
quality<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.250> watch<00:03:47.070> no<00:03:48.070> witness<00:03:48.549> to<00:03:48.579> good

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
quality of the watch no witness to good

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.020 
quality of the watch no witness to good
quality<00:03:49.600> of<00:03:49.959> other<00:03:50.079> watches<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:50.950> it's<00:03:51.880> a

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
quality of other watches and it's a

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.650

can<00:03:55.870> see<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.140> brace<00:03:56.410> what<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:56.829> also

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
can see to brace what is also

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.900

stone wash I'm not quite sure what what

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.150 
stone wash I'm not quite sure what what
they<00:04:03.820> call<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.390> but

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
also bracelet is integrated so you

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.280 
also bracelet is integrated so you
cannot<00:04:30.530> swap<00:04:30.950> it<00:04:31.160> for<00:04:31.190> out<00:04:31.640> whether<00:04:32.450> one<00:04:32.810> which

cannot swap it for out whether one which
I<00:04:33.530> will<00:04:33.890> not<00:04:34.460> really<00:04:34.910> big<00:04:35.450> fan<00:04:35.810> of<00:04:35.840> and<00:04:36.669> that's

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
I will not really big fan of and that's

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.670 
I will not really big fan of and that's
also<00:04:38.150> one<00:04:38.540> of<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:38.810> turnout<00:04:39.500> for<00:04:39.860> me<00:04:40.070> but<00:04:40.370> I

different models that it's really

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.040 
different models that it's really
impossible<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:49.280> find<00:04:49.669> one<00:04:50.090> that<00:04:50.510> you<00:04:50.540> don't

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
impossible to find one that you don't

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
dozens of the Timex models that you

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.180 
dozens of the Timex models that you
really<00:04:56.900> like<00:04:57.320> and<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:57.970> want<00:04:58.970> to<00:04:59.270> have<00:04:59.480> and

chronograph and has alarm and this here

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.920 
chronograph and has alarm and this here
too<00:05:15.650> looks<00:05:16.160> really<00:05:16.490> cool<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:20.270> this<00:05:20.600> is<00:05:20.780> how

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
too looks really cool and this is how

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.110 
too looks really cool and this is how
you<00:05:20.990> set<00:05:21.350> up<00:05:21.380> alarm<00:05:21.890> and<00:05:22.220> you<00:05:22.370> have<00:05:22.520> a<00:05:22.550> special

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
you set up alarm and you have a special

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.020 
you set up alarm and you have a special
manual<00:05:23.479> for<00:05:23.750> it<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:25.160> one<00:05:25.340> thing<00:05:25.610> I<00:05:25.820> like

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
manual for it and the one thing I like

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.500 
manual for it and the one thing I like
it<00:05:26.300> is<00:05:26.540> they're<00:05:26.810> just<00:05:27.440> the<00:05:27.830> integral<00:05:30.130> which<00:05:31.130> is

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
it is they're just the integral which is

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.450 
it is they're just the integral which is
really<00:05:32.510> co-op<00:05:32.900> being<00:05:33.169> very<00:05:33.530> intense<00:05:33.950> for<00:05:34.340> the

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
really co-op being very intense for the

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.130 
really co-op being very intense for the
past<00:05:35.350> few<00:05:36.350> days<00:05:36.410> just<00:05:37.450> I'm<00:05:38.450> just<00:05:38.510> playing

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
activated something man it has a lots of

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.880 
activated something man it has a lots of
features<00:05:46.270> it's<00:05:47.270> a<00:05:47.450> chronograph<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:50.710> puts<00:05:51.710> a

features it's a chronograph and puts a
canal<00:05:52.310> show<00:05:52.640> and<00:05:52.970> you

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
canal show and you
