00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
in case and then you can

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.980 
in case and then you can
multiple<00:01:09.490> kills<00:01:10.240> with<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.600> second<00:01:10.840> round

we're<00:01:19.149> fast<00:01:19.329> forwarding<00:01:19.689> here<00:01:19.840> a<00:01:19.869> little<00:01:20.020> bit

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
we're fast forwarding here a little bit

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.179 
we're fast forwarding here a little bit
to<00:01:20.439> get<00:01:20.920> pink<00:01:21.399> and<00:01:21.610> deadly<00:01:22.479> and<00:01:23.079> that<00:01:23.829> is<00:01:24.009> where

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
to get pink and deadly and that is where

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.350 
to get pink and deadly and that is where
you<00:01:24.310> get<00:01:24.549> ten<00:01:24.969> noogler<00:01:25.630> kills<00:01:25.990> on<00:01:26.469> one<00:01:26.770> level

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you get ten noogler kills on one level

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.590 
you get ten noogler kills on one level
now<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.799> gets<00:01:29.950> pretty<00:01:30.159> finicky<00:01:30.610> like<00:01:31.240> I<00:01:31.270> right

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
now it gets pretty finicky like I right

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.289 
now it gets pretty finicky like I right
there<00:01:31.840> on<00:01:32.340> when<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.459> will<00:01:33.490> actually<00:01:33.819> give<00:01:34.209> you

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
there on when it will actually give you

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.559 
there on when it will actually give you
the<00:01:34.420> kill<00:01:34.719> I<00:01:35.909> haven't<00:01:36.909> quite<00:01:37.090> figured<00:01:37.360> out

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
the kill I haven't quite figured out

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.279 
the kill I haven't quite figured out
when<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:39.610> gives<00:01:39.850> them<00:01:39.969> to<00:01:40.119> you<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.899> closest

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
when it gives them to you the closest

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.260 
when it gives them to you the closest
thing<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.470> can<00:01:41.530> think<00:01:41.679> of<00:01:42.119> get<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:45.270> big

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
thing I can think of get that big

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.240 
thing I can think of get that big
explosion<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:46.929> you<00:01:47.020> give<00:01:47.170> them<00:01:47.380> answers<00:01:47.530> is

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
explosion that you give them answers is

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.529 
explosion that you give them answers is
when<00:01:48.429> you<00:01:48.520> get<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.849> full<00:01:49.119> one<00:01:49.299> of<00:01:49.420> those

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
when you get a full one of those

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.469 
when you get a full one of those
explosions<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.399> right<00:01:51.700> here<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.149> bridge<00:01:52.360> is

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
explosions and right here the bridge is

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.660 
explosions and right here the bridge is
pissed<00:01:52.689> me<00:01:52.780> off<00:01:52.810> enough<00:01:53.170> where<00:01:53.319> I<00:01:53.380> use<00:01:53.530> my<00:01:53.799> one

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
pissed me off enough where I use my one

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.630 
pissed me off enough where I use my one
of<00:01:54.700> my<00:01:54.759> other<00:01:54.880> Rockets<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.920> fast<00:01:57.310> forwarding<00:01:57.610> a

this right side they're playing on the
left<00:02:19.540> side<00:02:19.660> too<00:02:19.870> for<00:02:20.139> some<00:02:20.260> reason<00:02:20.319> I<00:02:20.709> favor

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
left side too for some reason I favor

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.800 
left side too for some reason I favor
the<00:02:21.160> right<00:02:21.400> side<00:02:21.700> more<00:02:22.030> when<00:02:22.389> i<00:02:22.480> play<00:02:22.660> this

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
the right side more when i play this

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.259 
the right side more when i play this
level<00:02:23.139> it<00:02:24.040> doesn't<00:02:24.370> matter<00:02:24.459> as<00:02:24.700> long<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:25.030> get

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
level it doesn't matter as long to get

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.890 
level it doesn't matter as long to get
the<00:02:26.170> amount<00:02:26.829> of<00:02:26.920> kills<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.630> recommend

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
the amount of kills and I recommend

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.960 
the amount of kills and I recommend
doing<00:02:29.139> it<00:02:29.380> on<00:02:29.500> this<00:02:29.889> level<00:02:30.160> because<00:02:30.609> you<00:02:30.760> have

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
doing it on this level because you have

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.809 
doing it on this level because you have
the<00:02:31.810> most<00:02:31.959> concentrated<00:02:32.500> amount<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.310> Covenant

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
the most concentrated amount of Covenant

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.140 
the most concentrated amount of Covenant
I<00:02:34.120> think<00:02:34.690> on<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.019> level<00:02:35.819> there's<00:02:36.819> plenty<00:02:36.970> of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
I think on this level there's plenty of

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.629 
I think on this level there's plenty of
Needlers<00:02:37.569> because<00:02:37.780> they<00:02:38.160> bring<00:02:39.160> tons<00:02:39.489> of

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:39.639 
Needlers because they bring tons of

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.750 
Needlers because they bring tons of
meglar's<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:40.209> grunts<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.690> dragon

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
meglar's the grunts in the dragon

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.839 
meglar's the grunts in the dragon
so<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:43.680> don't<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.280> get<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.610> one<00:02:44.819> on

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
so you don't have to get this one on

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.199 
so you don't have to get this one on
this<00:02:45.090> level<00:02:45.299> but<00:02:45.810> i<00:02:46.019> definitely<00:02:46.290> recommend

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
this level but i definitely recommend

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.910 
this level but i definitely recommend
trying<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.420> get<00:02:48.689> the<00:02:48.840> pink<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.680> deadly

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
trying to get the pink and deadly

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.240 
trying to get the pink and deadly
achievement<00:02:50.370> on<00:02:50.519> this<00:02:50.909> one<00:02:51.150> because<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:52.290> how

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
achievement on this one because of how

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.970 
achievement on this one because of how
many<00:02:53.430> coming<00:02:53.970> if<00:02:54.060> there<00:02:54.180> are<00:02:54.299> you<00:02:54.450> can<00:02:54.599> see

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
many coming if there are you can see

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.250 
many coming if there are you can see
there<00:02:55.980> about<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.879> third<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.689> the<00:02:57.810> grunts<00:02:58.170> you

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
there about the third of the grunts you

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.619 
there about the third of the grunts you
jackals<00:02:58.680> are<00:02:58.739> carrying<00:03:00.019> Needlers<00:03:01.019> so<00:03:02.629> just

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
jackals are carrying Needlers so just

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.289 
jackals are carrying Needlers so just
use<00:03:04.099> use<00:03:05.099> them<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.549> level<00:03:05.790> i<00:03:05.970> think<00:03:06.209> is

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
use use them on this level i think is

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.819 
use use them on this level i think is
the<00:03:06.329> best<00:03:06.450> bet<00:03:06.840> but<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.230> can't<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.560> one<00:03:07.739> other

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
the best bet but you can't do one other

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.490 
the best bet but you can't do one other
one<00:03:10.159> so<00:03:11.159> trying<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.549> stay<00:03:11.790> alive<00:03:12.379> killing<00:03:13.379> off

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
one so trying to stay alive killing off

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.960 
one so trying to stay alive killing off
