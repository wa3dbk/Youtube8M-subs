00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.669
 good comments for raúl alonso 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.950
 jiménez in his first match the second 

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:09.260
 Ramón de Carranza game also 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.300
 won to the cadiz today plays as a starter 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.880
 before the sampdoria of genova with the 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.460
 dorsal number 17 looked good with 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.429
 many wishes and showing off their 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.099
 resources did not clash raúl aaron his 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.869
 jiménez in his first game with the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.640
 Atlético de Madrid had a shot to the 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.739
 14 minute head if it is not for the 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.039
 goalkeeper the sampdoria would have fallen in 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.439
 goal 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.660
 physically had to leave change with 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.449
 the discomfort a cramp is a nuisance 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.969
 muscular nothing to worry about but the 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.280
 Spanish press praised him brand what 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.500
 recognizes like the daily 'as' are 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.420
 well-known newspapers in the old 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.160
 continent and it's very important for a 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.829
 Mexican footballer that the press of 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.289
 home also breaks you I think what 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.359
 most outstanding of all is that jiménez he 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.339
 Luce does not clash, he is seen with resources 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.870
 the ones we know in the league that are 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.820
 enough to get a good 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.070
 still a long presentation 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.890
 We commented about the payment at the beginning of the 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.150
 program and without mentioning it seems to me that 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.740
 in a very clear way is that jiménez and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.750
 has many conditions to be able 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.409
 be a starter without caring less for 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.409
 fights forgive 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.640
 title fight I do not think boot 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.350
 game launched that chili so even though my 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.299
 brother is center during a little 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.049
 because if it's nobody as a flyer, it's going to 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.869
 Cook 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.970
 yes it will cost you comes with rhythm of 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.179
 competition is high that helps you 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.770
 a lot unlike mandzukic or 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.560
 Griezmann has the advantage that already 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.110
 has competition for difficult to 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.119
 what because you follow so much football 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.210
 international by program of the ends 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.250
 week is very difficult 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.630
 it is not from this it looks is not very difficult 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.820
 that can play with two nines he is 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.850
 new to not because everyone says is 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.960
 that is human but immense not of any 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.330
 way you can play in any way is 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.790
 that simeone has good references 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.679
 and you see that he likes the way you play 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.660
 of the genre we also review how it has 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.260
 played the previous tournaments the cholo 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.989
 simeone 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.209
 the green team I'm talking about what 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.520
 who played the formations consists of a 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.170
 nominal centrodelantero and with a false 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.570
 'nine' as they call it in Spain or 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.310
 Europe has the opportunity to play if 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.380
 earning the titular position will cost you 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.940
 work is natural and anybody 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.980
 work is the favorite for 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.640
 start as a starter in the athletic of 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.800
 oscar 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.890
 depending on the rivals you can play 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.890
 I think it's going to end 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.630
 winning if it is omán your kit or 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.630
 jiménez will end up in alcorta 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:52.690
 ending to finish if it is in the 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:55.480
 first campaign I say good hopefully I 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.190
 I'd love to think about it if it's not easy 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.080
 after looking badly his prick cost three 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.730
 times more than they regulated their jiménez 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.260
 pansequito is more adapted football 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.720
 international brings a much more poster 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.390
 broad has more experience and hopefully 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.049
 I hope it's like you say look at what 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.870
 I already know that Raúl Alonso is going to come to 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.459
 bring him or take the role of Adrian with 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.799
 the athletic team yes as a 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.799
 kind of third alternative of cholo 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.810
 simeone from among your attackers if so 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.760
 It will not be bad at all, there's nothing wrong 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.829
 enough skills there will be 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.140
 enough minutes to be able to show 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.220
 the jets split that ability and in addition 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.510
 javier aguirre 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.829
 I Aguilé because there walks thread pulling a goal 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.660
 waving in the land of the sun of the sun 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.980
 nascent was in a league match 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.230
 is starting to observe players already 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.940
 as new coach of the national team 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.790
 National of Japan will be very 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.250
 interesting very interesting to see the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.310
 personality of javier aguirre in theory 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.230
 against people because of that because you 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.530
 coach him especially that is a 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.420
 character that drives that motivate if 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.630
 they do not understand him and obviously he's going to have 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.919
 a translator as it transmits is what 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.599
 you want when that's why I think it's 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:08.970
 interesting of javier uses suddenly 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.970
 bad words suddenly is charismatic 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.139
 any
