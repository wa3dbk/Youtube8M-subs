with<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.709> CCFL<00:02:40.700> halo<00:02:41.120> ring<00:02:41.420> which<00:02:42.260> again<00:02:42.860> is

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
with a CCFL halo ring which again is

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.860 
with a CCFL halo ring which again is
cold<00:02:43.370> cathode<00:02:43.880> fluorescent<00:02:43.910> light<00:02:44.660> so

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
cold cathode fluorescent light so

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.680 
cold cathode fluorescent light so
basically<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.319> a<00:02:45.380> small<00:02:45.709> glass<00:02:46.130> tube<00:02:46.690> inside

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
basically it's a small glass tube inside

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.680 
basically it's a small glass tube inside
the<00:02:47.900> ring<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.680> gives<00:02:49.099> a<00:02:49.220> really<00:02:49.459> nice

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
the ring and that gives a really nice

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.259 
the ring and that gives a really nice
projected<00:02:50.690> color<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:52.370> they<00:02:52.610> do<00:02:52.670> have<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.000> few

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
projected color but they do have a few

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.030 
projected color but they do have a few
issues<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.660> will<00:02:54.019> explain<00:02:54.440> in<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.739> advanced

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
issues that will explain in the advanced

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.770 
issues that will explain in the advanced
video<00:02:55.430> there's<00:02:56.000> some<00:02:56.209> times<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.569> have<00:02:56.599> an

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
video there's some times you have an

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.390 
video there's some times you have an
issue<00:02:56.930> with<00:02:57.170> them<00:02:57.290> starting<00:02:57.709> in<00:02:57.860> cold<00:02:58.099> weather

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
issue with them starting in cold weather

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.220 
issue with them starting in cold weather
they<00:02:59.000> have<00:02:59.209> heat<00:02:59.420> up<00:02:59.569> times<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.019> they're<00:03:00.110> also

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
they have heat up times and they're also

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.370 
they have heat up times and they're also
very<00:03:00.380> fragile<00:03:00.799> so<00:03:01.310> they<00:03:01.430> do<00:03:01.510> break<00:03:02.510> if<00:03:03.319> you

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
very fragile so they do break if you

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.140 
very fragile so they do break if you
were<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.799> get<00:03:03.950> in<00:03:04.069> kind<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.489> some<00:03:04.610> serious<00:03:04.849> road

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
were to get in kind of some serious road

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.580 
were to get in kind of some serious road
conditions<00:03:05.630> potholes<00:03:06.079> things<00:03:06.290> like<00:03:06.440> that

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
conditions potholes things like that

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.349 
conditions potholes things like that
they<00:03:06.739> can<00:03:06.769> break<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.370> now<00:03:07.910> they're<00:03:08.090> just<00:03:08.269> more

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
they can break and now they're just more

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.479 
they can break and now they're just more
fragile<00:03:08.780> then<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.500> top-of-the-line<00:03:09.950> option

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
fragile then the top-of-the-line option

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.740 
fragile then the top-of-the-line option
is<00:03:10.639> the<00:03:10.880> LED<00:03:11.269> upgrade<00:03:11.660> which<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.799> also<00:03:13.370> a

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
is the LED upgrade which is also a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.539 
is the LED upgrade which is also a
add-on<00:03:14.750> ring<00:03:15.109> but<00:03:15.650> instead<00:03:15.980> of<00:03:16.069> having<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.370> see

add-on ring but instead of having a see
CFL<00:03:16.970> inside<00:03:17.359> of<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.840> is<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.500> 60<00:03:19.780> LED<00:03:20.780> ring<00:03:21.079> so

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
CFL inside of it it is a 60 LED ring so

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.129 
CFL inside of it it is a 60 LED ring so
each<00:03:21.590> ring<00:03:21.799> has<00:03:21.950> 60<00:03:22.370> LEDs<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.120> these<00:03:23.840> things

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
each ring has 60 LEDs and these things

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.849 
each ring has 60 LEDs and these things
are<00:03:24.350> indestructible<00:03:25.160> they're<00:03:26.120> bright<00:03:26.480> and
