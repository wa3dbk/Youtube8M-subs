00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
found another way to do dt nanos thanks

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.910 
found another way to do dt nanos thanks
to<00:00:30.840> JP<00:00:31.520> he<00:00:32.520> found<00:00:32.870> some<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.020> these<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.440> helped

us lab these and we have them in

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.180 
us lab these and we have them in
multiple<00:00:38.820> formations<00:00:39.570> now<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.440> we're<00:00:41.070> going

this<00:00:49.050> weekend<00:00:49.530> along<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.039> couple<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
this weekend along with a couple of

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.910

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
other ones and we will continue to add

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.240 
other ones and we will continue to add
these<00:00:53.460> dt<00:00:54.000> nanos<00:00:54.559> throughout<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.739> year<00:00:56.010> as

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
these dt nanos throughout the year as

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.510 
these dt nanos throughout the year as
they<00:00:56.550> come<00:00:56.789> available<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:58.350> us<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.980> it

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
they come available to us and it

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.910 
they come available to us and it
actually<00:00:59.730> seems<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.350> more<00:01:01.559> reliable

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
actually seems to to be more reliable

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.990 
actually seems to to be more reliable
than<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:03.559> older<00:01:04.559> dt<00:01:05.010> nettles<00:01:05.430> which<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.790> kind

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
than the older dt nettles which is kind

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.830 
than the older dt nettles which is kind
of<00:01:06.060> ironic<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.780> funny<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.580> in<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.729> sense

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.149 

anyways<00:01:12.840> there's<00:01:13.320> kind<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.770> trick<00:01:14.010> to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
anyways there's kind of a trick to

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.270 
anyways there's kind of a trick to
making<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:15.360> play<00:01:15.689> work<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.530> will

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.359 
making it work and you'll definitely see
it<00:02:03.580> in<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:03.880> film<00:02:04.150> room<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:05.200> sunday<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:05.770> if<00:02:06.250> you

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
it in the film room the sunday so if you

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.800 
it in the film room the sunday so if you
haven't<00:02:06.550> purchased<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.150> film<00:02:07.360> room<00:02:07.570> yet

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810

haven't purchased the film room yet
there's<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.590> link<00:02:08.860> below<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:10.090> also<00:02:10.360> works

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
there's a link below this also works

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.660 
there's a link below this also works
online<00:02:11.020> it's<00:02:11.560> been<00:02:11.740> lab<00:02:11.950> has<00:02:12.280> been<00:02:12.459> tested

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
online it's been lab has been tested

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.199 
online it's been lab has been tested
works<00:02:13.180> again<00:02:13.450> shotgun<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:15.520> said<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.970> comes

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
works again shotgun like said it comes

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.900 
works again shotgun like said it comes
out<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:17.230> works<00:02:17.500> out<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.800> different<00:02:18.250> formations

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
out it works out of different formations

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.740 
out it works out of different formations
and<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:21.250> has<00:02:21.430> been<00:02:21.700> tested<00:02:22.570> on<00:02:23.110> line<00:02:23.680> JP<00:02:24.750> just

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
and it has been tested on line JP just

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.440 
and it has been tested on line JP just
got<00:02:25.989> off<00:02:26.230> line<00:02:26.530> with<00:02:26.800> it<00:02:27.010> recorded<00:02:27.670> 11<00:02:27.940> sacks

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
got off line with it recorded 11 sacks

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.180 
got off line with it recorded 11 sacks
i'm<00:02:29.080> using<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.300> similar<00:02:31.660> technique

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
i'm using this and a similar technique

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.800 
i'm using this and a similar technique
it<00:02:33.190> works<00:02:33.520> like<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:34.030> said<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.239> think<00:02:34.510> it's<00:02:34.630> more

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
it works like I said I think it's more

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.100 
it works like I said I think it's more
reliable<00:02:35.500> than<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.520> old<00:02:36.850> ET<00:02:37.270> nanos<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:38.290> enjoy
