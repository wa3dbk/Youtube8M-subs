00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.700
 beautiful satin slippers with hard 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.950
 toe without heels on ribbons 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.170
 almost every girl in childhood dreamed 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.809
 become a ballerina to flit around the scene in 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.540
 pointe but actually dance 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.970
 pointe is hardest labor and more complex and 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.550
 in terms of technology they do not have shoes 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.750
 a large number of parts and make 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.849
 pointe shoes can only be handing 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.250
 these are just the main steps in the creation of pointe shoes 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.590
 hard sock so-called little box 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.640
 consists of several taped their layers 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.920
 sackcloth and calico 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.110
 after sizing plant need quality 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.480
 flash because it affects their strength 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.140
 then they are turned over again they pull 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 on the block 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.120
 and manually forms another raw box 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.339
 master aligns it with a hammer attached 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.890
 the shape of socks and polished to perfection 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.989
 bring the edges correctly made and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.059
 balanced shoes held onto 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.579
 wearing it without support so you can 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.280
 check give implants are sent to 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.980
 day to dry in the oven and drying socks 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.440
 they get very hard 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.540
 even a custom made top for 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.870
 Ballerinas must be customized 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.590
 new pointe shoes need to be broken with a hammer 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.690
 leaving only the sock itself hard and 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.369
 well like that stretch the insole on 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.280
 finger puts on such here 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.130
 analog or silicone liner to 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.950
 we were dissatisfied with hard shoes 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.100
 each side of the inner edge of the canvas 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.750
 stitching ribbons they and 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.130
 Ponte is fixed on the leg of a ballerina 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.130
 now what you need 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.460
 unfortunately ballet shoes are short-lived 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.920
 and sometimes serves only 230 tons per month 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.080
 ballerinas of ours up to 10 pairs of shoes 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.690
 and for one theatrical season literally 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.250
 trades out a few hundred during 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.590
 one performance ballerina 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.229
 dancing big difficult parties can 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.820
 change a few pairs of pointe shoes a master 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.400
 can produce no more than four 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.540
 batches of the game and are made only from 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.490
 natural materials 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.950
 after all, in faux ballerina shoes 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.200
 just risk ruining his legs even 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.720
 glue is boiled from natural ingredients 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.480
 therefore, if desired, ballet shoes can 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.390
 eat without much harm to health 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.370
 I do not advise you to do this 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.370
 were bad for a long ballet history
