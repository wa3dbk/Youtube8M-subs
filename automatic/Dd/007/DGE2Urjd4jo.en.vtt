00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello my name is ulyana i lay down and steam 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.710
 a month ago I wondered so strange 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.019
 the question is that people are reading something now 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.700
 Read those people who are active on youtube 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.740
 what do people think actively 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.560
 Internet, in principle, and decided that 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.609
 great place to spend mamaika 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.560
 research will be a social network 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.020
 social platform is so possible 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.119
 say about 20 instagram I think everything 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.269
 know well instagram if you don't know 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.390
 you can subscribe to me there's 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.099
 my moment can't i take a spelling so 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.510
 or else I decided to hold a little 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.489
 study every week for 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.489
 last two ply months I 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.040
 coming out in 1g sin on the same day 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.020
 In instagram and viewed 101 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.530
 photos that come out and based on 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.600
 This data may not be very true. 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.700
 Statistics I got it well 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.670
 I hope today tell you what people 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.530
 read in instagram in instagram i 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.780
 noticed such an interesting trend not 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.520
 rarely exhibit one photo 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.559
 There are such photos of course 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.390
 many but more often such 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.519
 know how god the hall and only in 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.409
 instagram people show some they 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.920
 bought them the most in her in 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.409
 a pile 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.390
 photos and talked what to choose 5 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.850
 most popular books that appear 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.040
 on the photo is meaningless and I divided 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.820
 obtained results on peculiar 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.640
 categories 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.710
 these categories are completely different 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.810
 criteria for creating therefore not 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.420
 scare my country scary cute sky 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.720
 statistics anyway during my time 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.270
 research appeared one clear 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.200
 favorite which was present every time 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.740
 when I checked 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.530
 photos are and and james and u 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.350
 grayscale and trilogy in general and but 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.090
 109 percent of cases in which 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.009
 come across 50 shades of gray people 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.840
 extremely positive opinions about opinions 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.610
 and I didn't like this 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.920
 because how 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.600
 weight 50 shades of gray on the internet 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.900
 taken to stuff though 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.210
 Aljay, in principle, did not claim the book 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.160
 finds a literary masterpiece it was coffee 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.010
 and 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.440
 and stayed and that's literally a week later 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.600
 until in two weeks we will see on the screens 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.460
 finally the screen version of 50 shades 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.470
 series if you go watch her 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.510
 cinema write the answer in the comments not 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.670
 go then of course what appetite legs 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.959
 why 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.280
 categories most often caught my eye 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.160
 this yangi gave 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.320
 literature is cold this is a divergent 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.050
 veronica mouth is cassandra clare city 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.209

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.580
 series and last three weeks on 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.370
 photo more often began to appear books 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.980
 Like the apse the author which name is Armen 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.300
 others are only 3 not less popular 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.250
 category some people more often 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.650
 put in instagram and this is a book on 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.630
 self-improvement is a lot 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.120
 a lot of Chinese research 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.190
 principle of books and wait for mom farm 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.850
 Alpina Publishing Business Books Alpina 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.670
 publisher 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.670
 besides this, a lot of books appeared on 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.650
 Dyukan, which I can not lose weight plus 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.260
 also very often appearing books from 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.480
 Series if so can be said about Syria 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.269
 the show is also about self-improvement 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.010
 esoteric and stuff like that brought 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.290
 category is categories that change 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.790
 no compact2 subcategories is a series 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.220
 book series which is increasingly me 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.790
 came across the publishing series 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.840
 and it will be an exclusive classic and 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.880
 intellectual these books these more often 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.040
 just appeared where people buy 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.230
 most stocks collect entire collections 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.910
 because exclusive classics too 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.860
 she attracts many with her interesting 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.970
 design is great this see beautiful 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.130
 names of your blogs 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.989
 but also the last 5 category this category 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.450
 which is entirely devoted 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.150
 one of the authors is steven king 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.010
 the instagram of people exposed huge 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.320
 number of photos steven agent they 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.720
 appeared in each collection steadily 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.700
 each time determined the search result and 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.500
 I think this refereeing collectors 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.640
 positively this is google 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.370
 literature if 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.020
 the fact that is that how the servo turned out 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.030
 I myself popular kinema principle 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.190
 which appeared in instagram all the same 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.850
 in the end we return to the recognized 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.209
 classics 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.550
 well and not the leading positions but 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.350
 and from it not less losing 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.330
 appear regularly in instagram 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.340
 classic very much classic 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.780
 literature traders in this case 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.610
 Bulgars will appear because very 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.070

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.810
 pages where people talk about books 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.580
 write a review of books if yes then 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.530

 than on comments on youtube because 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.100
 I receive a notice of how it serves 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.110
