 be for this year going 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.010
 thought wrong but this video is directed 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.960
 especially to those who like the sims 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.559
 4 like and like to have interest 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.480
 would like 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.549
 I promised I when info 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.850
 or if I have something out of that 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.930
 have fished out far wide net 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.529
 I will tell you what I am 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.840
 hereby do 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.039
 the concept artist without her level you 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.800
 never pronounce 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.380
 no matter has put a few artworks 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.350
 Artworks just for a moment are pictures 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.920
 that is called artistic graphics 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.090
 nervously says the word artistically that 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.610
 play a bit 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.260
 it is not the original artwork it is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.969
 beautify a bit of course 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.940
 It's always the same as it is 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.449
 sometimes seen this cinematic trailer 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.460
 totally trauma from the graphics but that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.199
 Ultimately, game is different 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.050
 then a little bit of this graphic 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.500
 which was then presented there 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:09.150
 So he has some pictures were laid 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.220
 found the pictures and so only 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.400
 First of all, these are not official 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.460
 info just so you know that 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.990
 was not art works by her now here 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.170
 Coupe instead of fully horny are here a 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.840
 they are still covered in what 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.240
 As far as the official info is concerned 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.299
 We will probably be up to the middle of January 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.500
 february march do not know it 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.780
 is not a country in sight almost 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.979
 official info on what the fans 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.210
 but here unfortunately affects such pictures 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.100
 Of course, they are always such a small one 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.439
 appetizers and I want you now 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.220
 no longer looking forward to the torture 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:54.450
 and if you enjoy the pictures 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.490
 while the first picture to see this 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.170
 neighborhood has me on such a 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.909
 Californian housing estate the world 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.430
 already quite big so that the field 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.990
 since they even without apartment 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.820
 You also have to count on it 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.960
 then we have a head 50 we hold this 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.840
 come pleasure possibilities 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:19.170
 gym library cinema and all 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.720
 These things as crucial small 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.510
 The duck has been quite a bit world wide 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.520
 and harmonious and the houses that fell 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.320
 me too, but the next one 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.320
 Neighborhood the world perfect 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.830
 I think it's amazing that they are so great 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.660
 Outlook was important with an open mouth 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.100
 fort that is such a mixture for me 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:45.150
 from monaco and venice 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.640
 that sees fairy lights and lisa tour 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.950
 and then this neighborhood is itself 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.950
 should then give to the knee people 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.020
 Fantastically beautiful you can really nothing 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.850
 to tell others who the next pictures 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.820
 Maybe that would be uninteresting 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.220
 but actually I do not think so 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.620
 Stylistics of these houses like one 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.430
 correction definitely differs 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:15.959
 of the three buildings have the lower ones 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.090
 neither in tim burtons but thats 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.910
 then so in the middle so spanish houses 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.290
 I also find it very detailed 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.170
 represented a lot 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.640
 because the roma wants to change and down there 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.190
 These should choose as well 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.880
 to give neighborhood 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.880
 more he wants has represented one eighth 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.630
 The public building for post office post 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.630
 office or something 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.860
 for his apron of so huge 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.709
 yes, it's supposed to be a neighborhood 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.220
 to reach Libya 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.650
 I'm really looking forward to that and the 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.100
 next houses timbered houses like 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.080
 Verona also wants to be similar 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.320
 everyone looks forward despite the back as a 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.550
 bit in miami also very nice of 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.280
 The farmer has gentleman I think yes im 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.350
 next picture as cosmopolitan design 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:19.919
 a house and there you see again 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:22.500
 Rest for new buildings are possible that one 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.340
 our times is grown ever wider to 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.460
 from the top and I also fantastic the 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.380
 data brand new yes just here one 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.840
 black and white in the room from the room 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.550
 I think I could design it too 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.280
 itself fast so the answer only 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.470
 furniture all very much a 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.740
 I like the picture very well 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.360
 this house and if you look at such 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.660
 Creating land can be so beautiful 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.760
 calm and simply dreamlike that reminds 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.840
 me to assassin's creed 3 so i 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.030
 think it's fantastic 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.169
 I think we see a houseboat here 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.520
 I or a party could be short term 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.500
 also be possible so the pack 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.510
 really some into the main game really 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.550
 should vote exactly like this one 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.250
 signs that seem to be employment 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.020
 belong on the right again a bat on 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.630
 saxophone so maybe that could be one 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.760
 be young couple that i will be back 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.700
 supernatural beings already exist 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.550
 in the main game as 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.480
 I had already been told that it was 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.110
 to give something like that 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.440
 but it will be great and here 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.240
 to hear it busy while still in operation 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.260
 and above is not whether pets 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.300
 I can not imagine that is 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.300
 already pets are in the main jumping 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.120
 it's sure to be like a main game 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.640
 add on but what's down there is that 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.290
 then obviously belongs to food 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.870
 so restaurants bars somehow there and 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.990
 a pizza yes I think it all very much 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.340
 nicely done and I am very curious 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.390
 how that finally happens 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.820
 game will affect 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.390
 yes and that was from the pictures I have to 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.390
 really shown 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.250
 very promising or why one 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.330
 a real or the authenticity of the 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.400
 pictures should not doubt 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.590
 or must go among other things 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.140
 also this cupcake wants 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.990
 machine should pull the draft well 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.360
 in the zins magazine in the official in 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.000
 reprinted this summer and therefore can 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.650
 it can be assumed that these pictures 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.810
 graphics belong to these and I think 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.840
 there was appetite for the times 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.750
 eyes and I really hope 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.640
 that very soon from the official side i 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.210
 mine that practically because officially 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.970
 that's from a designer of ea's 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.350
 but come studios that is was 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.270
 really what's official 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.700
 correct information again 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.440
 I know the game only appears in 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.170
 autumn but it is already a whole 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.470
 It was all over again 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.120
 My last information came in the summer 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:58.370
 and he's a little bit 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:02.540
 and therefore we are all happy 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:05.479
 more about these spheres and we learn 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.419
 of course on this channel 14 though 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:10.610
 Something new is coming out here , too 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:11.380
 Of course now I'll get away from it 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.340
 to report 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.889
 do not forget this channel 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:19.190
 Subscribe then you missed namely even 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.820
 nothing and yes then I would say something 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.710
 it for today 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.370
 I hope you enjoyed it and then 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.370
 see you soon
