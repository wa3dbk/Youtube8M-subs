00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.089 
we're going to let the microwave go for
the<00:01:51.310> first<00:01:51.490> 30<00:01:51.819> seconds<00:01:52.359> okay<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.740> is<00:01:53.920> what

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
the first 30 seconds okay this is what

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:55.709 
the first 30 seconds okay this is what
the<00:01:54.219> chocolate<00:01:54.609> looks<00:01:54.819> like<00:01:54.999> after<00:01:55.359> the<00:01:55.479> first

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
the chocolate looks like after the first

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.249 
the chocolate looks like after the first
30<00:01:55.929> seconds<00:01:56.789> it's<00:01:57.789> still<00:01:58.090> in<00:01:58.389> pretty<00:01:58.869> good<00:01:59.079> way

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
30 seconds it's still in pretty good way

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.809 
30 seconds it's still in pretty good way
for<00:01:59.529> form<00:01:59.770> but<00:02:00.009> as<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.249> can<00:02:00.399> see<00:02:00.459> it's

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
for form but as you can see it's

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.909 
for form but as you can see it's
starting<00:02:00.999> to<00:02:01.329> melt<00:02:01.479> it's<00:02:02.049> important<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.679> stir

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:02.919 
starting to melt it's important to stir

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:05.730 
starting to melt it's important to stir
at<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.310> first<00:02:03.520> 30<00:02:03.789> seconds<00:02:04.270> because<00:02:05.109> it<00:02:05.469> moves

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
at the first 30 seconds because it moves

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.440 
at the first 30 seconds because it moves
the<00:02:05.889> chocolate<00:02:06.310> around<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.819> allows<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.270> heat

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
the chocolate around and allows the heat

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.499 
the chocolate around and allows the heat
to<00:02:07.599> disperse<00:02:07.959> more<00:02:08.229> evenly<00:02:08.560> okay<00:02:09.459> now<00:02:10.329> we're

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
to disperse more evenly okay now we're

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.210 
to disperse more evenly okay now we're
ready<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.899> put<00:02:11.079> this<00:02:11.200> back<00:02:11.439> in<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.799> microwave

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
ready to put this back in the microwave

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.130 
ready to put this back in the microwave
for<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.670> next<00:02:12.909> 30<00:02:13.090> second<00:02:13.510> interval

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.780 

so<00:02:19.140> now<00:02:19.290> we've<00:02:19.470> done<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.650> another<00:02:19.980> 30<00:02:20.250> seconds

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
so now we've done it another 30 seconds

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.030 
so now we've done it another 30 seconds
I'm<00:02:21.239> going<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.659> stir<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.049> and<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:22.980> see

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
I'm going to stir it and as you can see

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.160 
I'm going to stir it and as you can see
there's<00:02:23.760> melted<00:02:24.209> chocolate<00:02:24.599> on<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.840> bottom

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
there's melted chocolate on the bottom

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.110 
there's melted chocolate on the bottom
so<00:02:25.470> we're<00:02:25.620> getting<00:02:25.890> closer<00:02:26.129> but<00:02:26.760> it's<00:02:26.909> still

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
so we're getting closer but it's still

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.180 
so we're getting closer but it's still
important<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:27.690> remain<00:02:28.019> stirring<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.650> every<00:02:28.980> 30

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
important to remain stirring it every 30

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.250 
important to remain stirring it every 30
seconds<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.970> now<00:02:30.629> we're<00:02:30.780> going<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.930> go<00:02:31.080> back

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
seconds and now we're going to go back

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.839 
seconds and now we're going to go back
for<00:02:31.500> an<00:02:31.560> additional<00:02:32.010> 30<00:02:32.310> seconds

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.970 

okay<00:02:35.849> now<00:02:36.299> we're<00:02:36.450> at<00:02:36.599> our<00:02:36.629> third<00:02:37.049> 30-second

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
okay now we're at our third 30-second

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.860 
okay now we're at our third 30-second
interval<00:02:39.110> as<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:41.700> can<00:02:41.879> see<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.299> chocolate<00:02:42.480> is

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
interval as you can see the chocolate is

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.740 
interval as you can see the chocolate is
almost<00:02:43.140> melted<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.640> important<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.360> stir<00:02:45.599> it

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
almost melted it's important to stir it

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.270 
almost melted it's important to stir it
every<00:02:45.930> 30<00:02:46.290> seconds<00:02:46.829> because<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.099> chocolate

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
every 30 seconds because the chocolate

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.030 
every 30 seconds because the chocolate
retains<00:02:47.849> its<00:02:48.090> shape<00:02:48.150> even<00:02:48.629> when<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.590> melted

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
retains its shape even when it's melted

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.849 
retains its shape even when it's melted
so<00:02:50.790> continue<00:02:51.239> stirring<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.709> see

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
so continue stirring and as you can see

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.890 
so continue stirring and as you can see
it<00:02:52.980> becomes<00:02:53.250> more<00:02:53.489> creamy<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.120> now<00:02:54.750> we're

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
it becomes more creamy and now we're

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.729 
it becomes more creamy and now we're
going<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.049> do<00:02:55.230> one<00:02:55.440> final<00:02:55.709> 30-second<00:02:56.640> interval

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
going to do one final 30-second interval

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.259 
going to do one final 30-second interval
so<00:02:58.739> there<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.040> have<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.250> we've<00:02:59.760> melted<00:03:00.000> our

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
so there you have it we've melted our

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.330 
so there you have it we've melted our
Dolci<00:03:00.629> fruta<00:03:00.930> for<00:03:01.140> two<00:03:01.290> minutes<00:03:01.650> at<00:03:01.829> half

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
power and stirred every 30 seconds as

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.000 
power and stirred every 30 seconds as

it's<00:03:36.419> as<00:03:36.660> easy<00:03:36.780> as<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.290> with<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.280> little<00:03:38.489> bit

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
it's as easy as that with a little bit

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.729 
it's as easy as that with a little bit
of<00:03:38.700> practice<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.299> can<00:03:39.450> do<00:03:39.599> two<00:03:39.780> pints<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.349> 5<00:03:40.560> to

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
of practice you can do two pints in 5 to

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.770 
of practice you can do two pints in 5 to
10<00:03:40.769> minutes<00:03:41.250> or<00:03:41.489> if<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.030> have<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.269> kids<00:03:42.510> join

10 minutes or if you have the kids join

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.390 
10 minutes or if you have the kids join
you<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.290> might<00:03:43.590> take<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.799> little<00:03:44.010> bit<00:03:44.160> longer

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400
