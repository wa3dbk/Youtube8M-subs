very<00:00:39.870> handy<00:00:40.200> indeed<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.220> copying<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> load<00:00:42.090> of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
very handy indeed for copying a load of

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.080 
very handy indeed for copying a load of
code<00:00:42.920> much<00:00:43.920> easier<00:00:44.280> than<00:00:44.400> stop<00:00:44.700> starting<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
code much easier than stop starting the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.980 
code much easier than stop starting the
video<00:00:45.330> all<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> time

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:45.990 
video all the time

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.900 
video all the time
ok<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.380> let's<00:00:46.800> crack<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.220> into<00:00:47.790> our

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
ok so let's crack on into our

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.580 
ok so let's crack on into our
command-line<00:00:48.360> interface<00:00:48.780> we're<00:00:49.380> going<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
command-line interface we're going to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.950 
command-line interface we're going to
create<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.250> directory<00:00:50.610> first<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.360> all<00:00:51.480> which<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
create a directory first of all which is

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.600 
create a directory first of all which is
where<00:00:52.140> all<00:00:52.380> the<00:00:52.530> web<00:00:52.680> sites<00:00:52.950> are<00:00:53.340> going<00:00:53.490> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
where all the web sites are going to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.300 
where all the web sites are going to
reside<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.240> that's<00:00:54.450> called<00:00:54.720> public<00:00:55.530> HTML<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
reside and that's called public HTML and

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.970 
reside and that's called public HTML and
so<00:00:56.880> that<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.240> visualize<00:00:57.450> that<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.800> your

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
so that you can visualize that in your

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.580 
so that you can visualize that in your
FTP<00:00:59.460> client<00:00:59.850> if<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.360> open<00:01:00.600> up<00:01:00.660> my<00:01:00.720> site<00:01:01.050> we've

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
FTP client if I open up my site we've

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.219 
FTP client if I open up my site we've
got<00:01:01.670> our<00:01:02.670> Linux<00:01:03.090> directory<00:01:03.690> structure<00:01:04.079> down

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
got our Linux directory structure down

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.880 
got our Linux directory structure down
here<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.710> there's<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.729> home<00:01:05.909> directory<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
here and there's the home directory and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
here and there's the home directory and
in<00:01:07.890> there<00:01:08.130> I've<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.340> got<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.700> folder<00:01:09.600> which

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
in there I've just got one folder which

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.290 
in there I've just got one folder which
is<00:01:09.840> my<00:01:10.200> username<00:01:10.710> governor<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.120> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
public HTML folder is also going to go

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
public HTML folder is also going to go
in<00:01:14.610> here<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:15.090> all<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.630> my<00:01:15.780> websites<00:01:15.960> and

the<00:02:35.540> group<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.900> webmasters<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:37.100> basically

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
the group of webmasters to basically

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.850 
the group of webmasters to basically
rule<00:02:38.030> over<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.810> folder<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.470> public<00:02:39.739> HTML

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
rule over that folder the public HTML

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.460 
rule over that folder the public HTML
folder<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.790> so<00:02:41.600> that's<00:02:41.840> what<00:02:42.050> that<00:02:42.230> does

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
folder and so that's what that does

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.310 
folder and so that's what that does
together<00:02:43.010> with<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:44.840> line<00:02:45.019> of<00:02:45.170> code

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
together with that and this line of code

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.400 
together with that and this line of code
here<00:02:45.380> is<00:02:45.830> for<00:02:46.519> future<00:02:46.760> proofing<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.480> basically

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
here is for future proofing so basically

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.530 
here is for future proofing so basically
any<00:02:48.709> files<00:02:49.280> or<00:02:49.580> folders<00:02:49.790> created<00:02:50.209> in<00:02:50.480> the

any files or folders created in the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.630 
any files or folders created in the
future<00:02:50.690> are<00:02:51.200> going<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.530> belong<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.920> that<00:02:52.220> group

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
future are going to belong to that group

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.780 
future are going to belong to that group
and<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:53.540> governor<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.350> this<00:02:54.530> case<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.040> log<00:02:55.700> out

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
and to governor in this case and log out

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.699 
and to governor in this case and log out
a<00:02:55.850> route<00:02:56.150> now<00:02:56.989> what<00:02:57.170> we're<00:02:57.319> doing<00:02:57.350> here<00:02:57.650> we're

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
a route now what we're doing here we're

a route now what we're doing here we're
going<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:57.950> create<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.250> test<00:02:58.640> home<00:02:59.000> page<00:02:59.300> for<00:02:59.720> the

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
going to create a test home page for the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.830 
going to create a test home page for the
first<00:02:59.959> new<00:03:00.260> domain<00:03:00.820> creating<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:01.910> using<00:03:02.269> the

as many domains as you want to put up on
the<00:03:24.079> web<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.579> that's<00:03:25.579> all<00:03:25.760> pretty

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
the web and that's all pretty

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.789 
the web and that's all pretty
straightforward<00:03:26.299> ok<00:03:27.110> so<00:03:27.440> we're<00:03:27.620> going<00:03:27.709> to

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
straightforward ok so we're going to

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.949 
straightforward ok so we're going to
create<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.310> virtual<00:03:28.549> host<00:03:29.060> files<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:29.810> the

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
create the virtual host files and the

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.259 
create the virtual host files and the
symlinks<00:03:30.440> now<00:03:31.190> now<00:03:31.489> you've<00:03:31.730> got<00:03:31.850> one<00:03:32.090> of<00:03:32.180> each

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
symlinks now now you've got one of each

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.569 
symlinks now now you've got one of each
of<00:03:32.329> those<00:03:32.630> per<00:03:33.140> domain<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.920> symlink<00:03:34.280> or<00:03:34.459> the

web server for example things like where
the<00:03:45.290> web<00:03:45.500> files<00:03:45.859> live<00:03:46.280> or<00:03:46.640> any<00:03:46.880> address

rewrite<00:03:48.290> rules<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.799> sort<00:03:49.010> of<00:03:49.040> stuff<00:03:49.250> for

rewrite rules that sort of stuff for

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.190 
rewrite rules that sort of stuff for
example<00:03:49.820> and<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:50.600> we're<00:03:50.870> going<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.049> create

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
example and so we're going to create

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.960 
example and so we're going to create
that<00:03:51.530> first<00:03:51.859> of<00:03:52.010> all

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
that first of all

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.690 
that first of all
then<00:03:53.120> we're<00:03:53.300> going<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.480> paste<00:03:53.750> within<00:03:54.520> all<00:03:55.520> of

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
then we're going to paste within all of

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.530 
then we're going to paste within all of
this<00:03:55.760> light<00:03:56.000> here<00:03:57.550> now<00:03:58.550> just<00:03:58.910> one<00:03:59.030> note<00:03:59.300> on

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
this light here now just one note on

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.990 
this light here now just one note on
this<00:03:59.870> here<00:04:00.740> what<00:04:01.070> I'm<00:04:01.160> doing<00:04:01.430> is<00:04:01.580> I'm<00:04:01.760> telling

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
this here what I'm doing is I'm telling

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.160 
this here what I'm doing is I'm telling
it<00:04:02.270> that<00:04:02.420> if<00:04:02.630> somebody<00:04:02.960> puts<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.710> in<00:04:04.990> WWN<00:04:05.990> it

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
it that if somebody puts that in WWN it

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.260 
it that if somebody puts that in WWN it
will<00:04:06.290> come<00:04:06.560> out<00:04:06.590> without<00:04:07.490> all<00:04:07.760> right

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
will come out without all right

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.140 
will come out without all right
that's<00:04:08.480> a<00:04:08.600> rewrite<00:04:08.960> rule<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.350> so<00:04:10.010> if<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.610> want

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
that's a rewrite rule and so if you want

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.120 
that's a rewrite rule and so if you want
that<00:04:11.330> then<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:11.960> want<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.200> exactly<00:04:12.620> like<00:04:12.950> this

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
that then you want to exactly like this

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.310 
that then you want to exactly like this
except<00:04:13.670> exchange<00:04:14.330> way<00:04:14.600> wider<00:04:14.810> web<00:04:15.020> for<00:04:15.230> your

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
except exchange way wider web for your

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.710 
except exchange way wider web for your
domain<00:04:15.590> name<00:04:16.120> alternatively<00:04:17.120> if<00:04:17.359> you<00:04:17.510> want<00:04:17.660> it

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
domain name alternatively if you want it

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.479 
domain name alternatively if you want it
the<00:04:17.780> other<00:04:17.900> way<00:04:18.019> around<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:18.560> that<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.190> looks

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
the other way around so that it looks

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.780 
the other way around so that it looks
like<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.959> but<00:04:21.260> with<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.709> HTTP<00:04:22.340> on<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.550> front

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
like that but with the HTTP on the front

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.720 
like that but with the HTTP on the front
then<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:23.660> need<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:23.960> lose<00:04:24.560> it<00:04:24.770> there<00:04:24.980> lose<00:04:25.520> that

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
then you need to lose it there lose that

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.550 
then you need to lose it there lose that
wwa<00:04:26.660> add<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:28.070> there<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.520> add<00:04:29.390> it<00:04:29.780> there<00:04:30.050> okay

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
wwa add it there and add it there okay

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.320 
wwa add it there and add it there okay
now<00:04:30.590> if<00:04:30.920> you<00:04:31.070> not<00:04:31.400> quite<00:04:31.610> sure<00:04:31.670> about<00:04:32.000> that<00:04:32.150> -

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
now if you not quite sure about that -

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.210 
now if you not quite sure about that -
for<00:04:32.570> my<00:04:32.630> website<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.350> explains<00:04:33.410> it<00:04:33.890> a<00:04:33.950> bit<00:04:34.070> more

this is the same link to go along with

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.490 
this is the same link to go along with

that V host that virtual host staff that
we<00:04:48.620> have<00:04:49.010> provided<00:04:49.550> that<00:04:49.730> so<00:04:50.060> that's<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.570> sim

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
we have provided that so that's the sim

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.380 
we have provided that so that's the sim
link<00:04:51.140> to<00:04:51.260> go<00:04:51.380> along<00:04:51.740> with<00:04:51.890> it<00:04:52.040> and<00:04:52.250> what<00:04:53.180> it<00:04:53.300> is

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
link to go along with it and what it is

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.260 
link to go along with it and what it is
basically<00:04:53.630> is<00:04:53.990> telling<00:04:54.530> engines<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:56.060> that

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
basically is telling engines that that

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.190 
basically is telling engines that that
is<00:04:56.510> where<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:56.960> way<00:04:57.620> wider<00:04:57.830> web<00:04:58.070> comm

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
is where the way wider web comm

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.510 
is where the way wider web comm
configuration<00:05:00.200> file<00:05:00.380> is<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:00.740> V<00:05:00.890> host<00:05:01.100> file<00:05:01.340> is

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
configuration file is the V host file is

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.480 
configuration file is the V host file is
and<00:05:01.810> this<00:05:02.810> actual<00:05:03.169> symlink<00:05:03.560> file<00:05:03.830> is<00:05:04.130> going<00:05:04.400> to

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
and this actual symlink file is going to

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.130 
and this actual symlink file is going to
live<00:05:04.730> there<00:05:05.270> that's<00:05:05.720> what<00:05:05.870> it's<00:05:05.990> basically

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
live there that's what it's basically

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.260 
live there that's what it's basically
saying<00:05:06.320> okay<00:05:06.710> now<00:05:07.460> we're<00:05:07.610> going<00:05:07.730> to<00:05:07.790> get<00:05:07.910> on<00:05:08.030> to

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
saying okay now we're going to get on to

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.830 
saying okay now we're going to get on to
fast<00:05:08.690> cgi<00:05:09.140> so<00:05:09.830> that<00:05:09.979> engine's<00:05:10.460> runs<00:05:10.910> with<00:05:11.360> PHP

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
fast cgi so that engine's runs with PHP

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.260 
fast cgi so that engine's runs with PHP
on<00:05:12.320> reboot<00:05:13.130> and<00:05:13.430> so<00:05:13.580> first<00:05:13.790> of<00:05:13.880> all<00:05:13.940> we<00:05:14.090> need<00:05:14.210> to

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
on reboot and so first of all we need to

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.480 
on reboot and so first of all we need to
install<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:15.229> far<00:05:16.040> cgi<00:05:16.370> library<00:05:16.910> and<00:05:18.280> in<00:05:19.280> fact

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
install the far cgi library and in fact

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.290 
install the far cgi library and in fact
I<00:05:19.580> think<00:05:19.640> I've<00:05:19.820> already<00:05:19.910> got<00:05:20.120> it<00:05:20.180> installed

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
I think I've already got it installed

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.730 
I think I've already got it installed
but<00:05:20.690> anyway<00:05:20.960> there<00:05:21.169> you<00:05:21.200> go<00:05:21.350> that's<00:05:21.500> we<00:05:21.680> have

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
but anyway there you go that's we have

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.890 
but anyway there you go that's we have
to<00:05:21.860> do<00:05:22.040> for<00:05:22.190> that<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.630> then<00:05:23.630> create<00:05:24.080> a<00:05:24.320> file

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
to do for that and then create a file

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.790 
to do for that and then create a file
this<00:05:26.900> lot<00:05:27.140> here

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.090 

and<00:05:32.800> then<00:05:33.100> to<00:05:33.220> make<00:05:33.340> fast<00:05:34.150> CGI<00:05:34.420> on-demand

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
and then to make fast CGI on-demand

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.490 
and then to make fast CGI on-demand
we're<00:05:36.100> going<00:05:36.220> to<00:05:36.280> create<00:05:36.460> another<00:05:36.520> file<00:05:37.500> and

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
we're going to create another file and

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.860 
we're going to create another file and
we've<00:05:38.680> got<00:05:38.770> a<00:05:38.800> big<00:05:39.190> old<00:05:39.400> chunk<00:05:39.490> to<00:05:40.210> pop<00:05:41.170> in<00:05:41.380> here
