 Welcome to a mod presentation 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:13.170

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.070
 extras in germany then we have 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.960
 a handbrake fresh and display in 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:32.669
 the cabin with fittings and the disc 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.500
 Run in the rain that was already so 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.270
 I have rough once again 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.700

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.149
 to show you that we are there too 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.960
 No one makes a good light, too 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:59.460
 the expansion and ex helmet from already class 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:04.650
 the beautiful use the thing I know 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.650
 I can look at the price and 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.619
 Although the good piece costs just 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:16.700
 beginner-friendly 57 5 that's how we look 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.700
 Do not look something with you 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.570
 you throw 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.189
 Here you can also see the leds light up 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.640
 the leaves are double occupancy with the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.640
 hand to you 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.670
 So far, for example, around now 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:46.580
 The next wanted to turn on the light 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:46.580

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.380
 pinker work 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:05.020
 there is nothing 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:11.050
 then we have one more 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.050

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.280
 and from behind view is then on 6 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.930
 Looks very good by heart 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.269
 it's good in the dark, too 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.640
 work here bank has seen like out 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.609
 the sky is pressed 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.409
 when the stand is going down straight 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:48.090

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:51.079

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.079

 look in here 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.580
 also great here with the wave itself 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.580
 emotional 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.990

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.080

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.670
 very normal during the day 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.940
 So it's really fun 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.510
 you already know if I have the exchange with the 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:08.320

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.850

 is to stop once I am like that 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.760
 set chop 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.560
 I thought I had adjusted excel 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.249
 well 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.260
 Now that blows out really wide here 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.350
 ok then thankful 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.800
 So it really great 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.800
 nice thing 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.029
 we were so so times a tractor on 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:19.479
 rapid need really big 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:27.309
 shut down a bit like that and me 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:29.020
 have my tractor up here and 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:31.469
 Then take a quick look 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.469
 on 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.040
 so 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.940
 first not much in it for wall 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.800
 demonstration purposes 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:04.110
 will certainly be fat already 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.110
 clear sound that fits already back 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.490
 and also increased engine speeds 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:23.350
 Not much but I think so 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:26.560
 now okay, yes, yes 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:28.540
 my page clear recommendations for 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.860
 I certainly have to get started 

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.040
 I think that's really great , too 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.360
 put on my last card 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.610
 Let's see how the financially manage 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.380
