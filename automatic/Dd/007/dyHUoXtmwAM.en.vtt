00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
honest that price does pretty much suit

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.030 
honest that price does pretty much suit
in<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.929> be<00:00:10.019> honest<00:00:10.230> he<00:00:10.290> wasn't<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.679> best<00:00:10.830> but

it<00:00:11.340> wasn't<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.639> West<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.030> think<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.269> downside

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
it wasn't the West I think the downside

it wasn't the West I think the downside
is<00:00:12.809> too<00:00:12.929> fat<00:00:13.080> his<00:00:13.290> left<00:00:13.469> foot<00:00:13.650> on<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.280> left

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
is too fat his left foot on the left

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.070

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
switch wings with him because I wanted

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.990 
switch wings with him because I wanted
to<00:01:07.770> try<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.159> left<00:01:08.280> foot<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.700> shooting

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
to try out that left foot for shooting

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.640 
to try out that left foot for shooting
and<00:01:09.150> he's<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.659> foot<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.930> real<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.439> good

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and he's like foot is real really good

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.020 
and he's like foot is real really good
but<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.189> from<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> left<00:01:11.670> side<00:01:11.820> obviously

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
but then from the left side obviously

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.580 
but then from the left side obviously
it's<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.659> best<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.020> shoot<00:01:13.260> with<00:01:13.380> him<00:01:13.500> because

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it's not best to shoot with him because

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.990 
it's not best to shoot with him because
he's<00:01:13.799> gonna<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.070> shooting<00:01:14.310> across<00:01:14.460> girl<00:01:14.790> and
