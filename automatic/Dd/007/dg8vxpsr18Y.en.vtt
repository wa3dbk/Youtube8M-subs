problem precise bands and how to be

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.820 
problem precise bands and how to be
always<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.490> perfect<00:00:11.670> pitch<00:00:12.590> what<00:00:13.590> I'm<00:00:13.679> going

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
always in perfect pitch what I'm going

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.740 
always in perfect pitch what I'm going
to<00:00:13.860> start<00:00:14.160> off<00:00:14.370> today<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.450> I'm<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.719> to

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
to start off today is that I'm going to

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.750 
to start off today is that I'm going to
tell<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.619> long<00:00:17.010> time<00:00:17.279> ago<00:00:17.550> I

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
tell you that a long time ago I

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.230 
tell you that a long time ago I
discovered<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:19.350> bend<00:00:19.650> notes<00:00:20.240> way

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
discovered that I can bend notes way

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.349 
discovered that I can bend notes way
lower<00:00:21.750> than<00:00:22.170> they're<00:00:23.130> supposed<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.880> be<00:00:24.060> band

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
lower than they're supposed to be band

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.609 
lower than they're supposed to be band
for<00:00:25.260> example<00:00:26.269> let's<00:00:27.269> take<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.900> first<00:00:28.380> hole

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
for example let's take at first hole

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.290 
for example let's take at first hole
which<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.519> D<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:30.000> AC<00:00:30.330> harmonica<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:32.239> try<00:00:33.239> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
which is D on AC harmonica and try to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:42.930 
which is D on AC harmonica and try to
bend<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.899> see<00:00:34.469> how<00:00:34.890> low<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.550> go

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.169 

okay<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.420> tuner<00:00:44.780> shows<00:00:45.230> me<00:00:45.739> that<00:00:46.609> I<00:00:46.640> went

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
okay so the tuner shows me that I went

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.139 
okay so the tuner shows me that I went
much<00:00:47.719> lower<00:00:48.140> than<00:00:48.409> she<00:00:48.800> sharp<00:00:49.100> I<00:00:49.399> went<00:00:50.030> like

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
much lower than she sharp I went like

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.719 
much lower than she sharp I went like
about<00:00:50.449> 50<00:00:50.989> cents<00:00:51.320> or<00:00:51.409> 60<00:00:51.920> cents<00:00:52.219> lower<00:00:52.399> and

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
about 50 cents or 60 cents lower and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.259 
about 50 cents or 60 cents lower and
that<00:00:52.940> is<00:00:53.089> a<00:00:53.120> huge<00:00:53.570> falls<00:00:53.979> so<00:00:54.979> that's<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:55.969> thing

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
that is a huge falls so that's the thing

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.109 
that is a huge falls so that's the thing
that<00:00:56.329> should<00:00:56.899> be<00:00:56.930> avoided<00:00:57.469> what<00:00:58.399> we<00:00:58.699> should

00:00:59.109 --> 00:00:59.119 
that should be avoided what we should

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:01.599 
that should be avoided what we should
keep<00:00:59.299> in<00:00:59.449> our<00:00:59.600> hats<00:00:59.989> is<00:01:00.229> that<00:01:00.739> we<00:01:01.129> can<00:01:01.339> bend

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
keep in our hats is that we can bend

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.939 
keep in our hats is that we can bend
notes<00:01:02.269> much<00:01:02.839> lower<00:01:03.199> than<00:01:03.439> they're<00:01:03.710> supposed

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
notes much lower than they're supposed

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.240 
notes much lower than they're supposed
to<00:01:04.280> be<00:01:04.430> bend<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:04.879> that<00:01:05.210> works<00:01:05.689> for<00:01:06.100> every<00:01:07.100> note

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
to be bend and that works for every note

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.700 
to be bend and that works for every note
we<00:01:08.090> can<00:01:08.119> bend<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.509> second<00:01:08.930> whole<00:01:09.140> lower<00:01:09.439> than

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
we can bend the second whole lower than

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.179 
we can bend the second whole lower than
F

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.190 

we're<00:01:14.670> gonna<00:01:14.790> Bend<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.030> third<00:01:15.330> hole<00:01:15.750> lower

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
we're gonna Bend this third hole lower

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:30.870 
we're gonna Bend this third hole lower
than<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.619> flat

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.029 

now<00:01:31.880> what<00:01:32.210> do<00:01:32.329> I<00:01:32.390> recommend<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:33.020> do<00:01:33.140> lay<00:01:33.829> those

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
now what do I recommend to do lay those

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.340 
now what do I recommend to do lay those
notes<00:01:34.369> with<00:01:34.549> a<00:01:34.579> piano<00:01:34.909> that<00:01:35.570> will<00:01:35.780> help<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.200> to

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
notes with a piano that will help you to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.889 
notes with a piano that will help you to
hear<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.890> note<00:01:37.070> that<00:01:37.250> you<00:01:37.429> play<00:01:37.899> compared

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
hear the note that you play compared

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.609 
hear the note that you play compared
with<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.229> piano<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.299> eliminate<00:01:41.299> Falls<00:01:41.630> so

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
with the piano and eliminate Falls so

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:53.139 
with the piano and eliminate Falls so
let's<00:01:42.829> try<00:01:43.009> it<00:01:43.070> now<00:01:51.310> what<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.340> plate<00:01:52.579> here<00:01:52.969> is

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
let's try it now what a plate here is

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.640 
let's try it now what a plate here is
one<00:01:53.630> half<00:01:54.079> tone<00:01:54.350> Bend

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.840 

-<00:01:57.650> hold<00:01:58.640> on<00:01:58.790> Bend<00:02:00.400> three-hole<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.640> half

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
- hold on Bend three-hole and a half

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.570 
- hold on Bend three-hole and a half
tone<00:02:02.090> Bend<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:03.700> for<00:02:04.700> half<00:02:05.090> tone<00:02:05.330> Bend<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.580> the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
tone Bend and for half tone Bend and the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.740 
tone Bend and for half tone Bend and the
same<00:02:07.820> thing<00:02:08.090> going<00:02:08.390> backwards

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.530 

ah<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:16.310> thing<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.580> when<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.120> played<00:02:17.360> with

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
ah and the thing is when you played with

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.810 
ah and the thing is when you played with
a<00:02:17.600> piano<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.320> not<00:02:18.740> just<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.340> tuner<00:02:19.550> that

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
a piano and not just the tuner that

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.510 
a piano and not just the tuner that
actually<00:02:20.810> helps<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.410> hear<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.130> note<00:02:22.310> and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
actually helps you to hear the note and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.450 
actually helps you to hear the note and
compare<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.240> that<00:02:23.750> develops<00:02:24.170> your<00:02:24.290> ear<00:02:24.590> okay

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
compare it that develops your ear okay

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:36.020 
compare it that develops your ear okay
let's<00:02:25.850> try<00:02:26.060> another<00:02:26.270> exercise

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.790 

this<00:02:37.030> exercise<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.660> basically<00:02:38.260> playing<00:02:38.590> a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
this exercise is basically playing a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.170 
this exercise is basically playing a
blow<00:02:39.100> note<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:40.450> drawn-out<00:02:40.870> on<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.350> full<00:02:41.650> band

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.390 

you<00:02:46.180> can<00:02:46.270> play<00:02:46.510> higher<00:02:47.319> also<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:51.370> can

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
you can play higher also and you can

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.910 
you can play higher also and you can
involve<00:02:51.910> blow<00:02:52.390> beds<00:02:52.660> also<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:58.709> also<00:02:59.709> the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
involve blow beds also and also the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.000 
involve blow beds also and also the
piano<00:03:00.250> on<00:03:00.459> my<00:03:00.670> app<00:03:00.880> is<00:03:01.270> kinda<00:03:01.870> works<00:03:02.709> with<00:03:02.980> a

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
piano on my app is kinda works with a

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.910 
piano on my app is kinda works with a
delay<00:03:03.459> when<00:03:03.819> I<00:03:03.880> tap<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:04.600> acts<00:03:04.870> after<00:03:05.260> some

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
delay when I tap it acts after some

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.210 
delay when I tap it acts after some
milliseconds<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.209> try<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.750> find<00:03:08.220> something

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
milliseconds so try to find something

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.000 
milliseconds so try to find something
that<00:03:09.430> works<00:03:10.090> without<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.630> delay<00:03:11.019> that<00:03:11.230> is<00:03:11.530> very

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
that works without a delay that is very

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.270 
that works without a delay that is very
important<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:13.420> play<00:03:13.810> in<00:03:14.050> rhythm<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.709> you<00:03:15.160> can

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
important to play in rhythm and you can

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.880 
important to play in rhythm and you can
also<00:03:15.519> add<00:03:15.880> metronome<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:17.140> those<00:03:17.320> exercises

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
also add metronome to those exercises

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.060 
also add metronome to those exercises
all<00:03:18.760> right<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.180> next<00:03:19.360> exercise<00:03:19.890> involves<00:03:20.890> an

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
all right the next exercise involves an

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.540 
all right the next exercise involves an
open<00:03:21.820> note<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.300> then<00:03:22.900> notes<00:03:23.260> basically<00:03:24.070> here

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
open note and then notes basically here

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:38.710

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.090 
tone Bend and the same thing going up
you<00:03:56.390> can<00:03:56.570> do<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.840> same<00:03:57.050> principle<00:03:57.680> for<00:03:57.800> the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
you can do the same principle for the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.280 
you can do the same principle for the
first<00:03:58.460> and<00:03:58.700> second<00:03:59.030> holes

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.050 

ah

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.730 

and<00:04:10.060> if<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.900> really<00:04:11.140> want<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.560> challenge

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
and if you really want to challenge

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.730 
and if you really want to challenge
yourself<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:12.730> can<00:04:12.880> do<00:04:13.000> this<00:04:13.180> exercise<00:04:13.390> on<00:04:14.020> 3rd

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
yourself you can do this exercise on 3rd

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.729 
yourself you can do this exercise on 3rd
and<00:04:15.010> 2nd<00:04:15.640> holes<00:04:15.880> but<00:04:16.389> use<00:04:16.600> an<00:04:16.750> f-sharp<00:04:16.959> instead

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
and 2nd holes but use an f-sharp instead

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:31.850 
and 2nd holes but use an f-sharp instead
of<00:04:17.829> G<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.639> going<00:04:18.880> like<00:04:19.030> this

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.220 

also<00:04:32.860> if<00:04:33.760> you<00:04:34.000> already<00:04:34.120> can<00:04:34.510> do<00:04:34.660> over<00:04:35.020> burns

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
also if you already can do over burns

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.620 
also if you already can do over burns
you<00:04:35.530> can<00:04:35.740> mix<00:04:35.980> them<00:04:36.220> with<00:04:36.400> bands<00:04:36.850> and<00:04:37.060> play

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
you can mix them with bands and play

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.620 
you can mix them with bands and play
scales<00:04:38.320> in<00:04:38.620> acquisitions<00:04:39.340> that'll<00:04:40.090> also<00:04:40.330> help

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
scales in acquisitions that'll also help

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.170 
scales in acquisitions that'll also help
you<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.050> practice<00:04:41.350> your<00:04:41.590> bends<00:04:42.190> for<00:04:42.790> example

now in general playing in odd positions

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.119 
now in general playing in odd positions
makes<00:06:06.789> you<00:06:06.999> practice<00:06:07.330> your<00:06:07.749> bends<00:06:08.080> so<00:06:08.889> I

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:09.129
