the otterbox comes in two pieces you've

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.059 
the otterbox comes in two pieces you've
got<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:16.080> hard<00:02:17.080> rubbery<00:02:19.470> silicone<00:02:20.470> type

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
got this hard rubbery silicone type

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.960 
got this hard rubbery silicone type
material<00:02:21.550> for<00:02:21.850> for<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.239> impact<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:23.500> have<00:02:23.680> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
material for for the impact you have the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.280 
material for for the impact you have the
hard<00:02:24.970> shell<00:02:26.160> for<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.220> outer<00:02:27.370> portion<00:02:28.290> so

hard shell for the outer portion so

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.990 
hard shell for the outer portion so
here's<00:02:29.440> our<00:02:29.500> galaxy<00:02:29.830> note<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.400> just<00:02:30.640> slip<00:02:30.849> it

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
here's our galaxy note you just slip it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.590 
here's our galaxy note you just slip it
in<00:02:31.209> bottom<00:02:31.930> first<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.120> push<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
better than other out of boxes so let's

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.900 
better than other out of boxes so let's
just<00:02:57.310> see<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.790> actually<00:02:57.970> really<00:02:58.269> does<00:02:59.910> not

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
just see and it actually really does not

just see and it actually really does not
too<00:03:01.060> much<00:03:01.150> adjustments<00:03:01.870> needed<00:03:02.080> just<00:03:02.319> kind<00:03:02.560> of

fit it in there so you can get all the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.440 
fit it in there so you can get all the
power<00:03:09.310> button<00:03:09.489> works<00:03:09.730> really<00:03:09.940> well<00:03:10.060> with<00:03:10.329> this

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
power button works really well with this

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.320 
power button works really well with this
one

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330

about getting the outer box for the
galaxy<00:03:36.250> note<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:36.760> already<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:37.000> pretty

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
galaxy note this is already a pretty

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.750 
galaxy note this is already a pretty
large<00:03:37.300> phone<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.890> otterbox<00:03:39.489> adds

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
large phone and the otterbox adds

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.610 
large phone and the otterbox adds
thickness<00:03:40.300> and<00:03:40.560> weight<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:42.640> some<00:03:42.849> phones<00:03:43.620> like

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
thickness and weight to some phones like

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.070 
thickness and weight to some phones like
my<00:03:44.739> galaxy<00:03:45.160> s3<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:46.420> outer<00:03:46.630> box<00:03:46.870> doesn't

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
my galaxy s3 and outer box doesn't

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.380 
my galaxy s3 and outer box doesn't
really<00:03:47.290> add<00:03:47.470> too<00:03:47.650> much<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:48.190> this<00:03:49.150> one

going to say that this is definitely to

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.760 
going to say that this is definitely to
go<00:04:43.979> if<00:04:44.979> you<00:04:45.130> have<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.310> galaxy<00:04:45.610> note<00:04:45.910> 2<00:04:46.210> I<00:04:46.770> really

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
go if you have a galaxy note 2 I really

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.620 
go if you have a galaxy note 2 I really
held<00:04:48.010> off<00:04:48.190> on<00:04:48.220> getting<00:04:48.580> this<00:04:48.880> mainly<00:04:49.600> because

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
held off on getting this mainly because

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.960 
held off on getting this mainly because
the<00:04:49.990> price<00:04:50.260> I<00:04:50.560> like<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.400> commuter<00:04:51.729> series

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
the price I like the commuter series

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.390 
the price I like the commuter series
better<00:04:52.419> than<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.860> defender<00:04:53.860> series<00:04:54.070> only

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
better than the defender series only

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.379 
better than the defender series only
because<00:04:54.700> I<00:04:54.760> don't<00:04:54.910> work<00:04:55.000> on<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.180> construction

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
because I don't work on a construction

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.190 
because I don't work on a construction
area<00:04:55.870> so<00:04:56.200> I<00:04:56.410> don't<00:04:56.770> really<00:04:56.800> need<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.400> the

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
area so I don't really need the the

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.110 
area so I don't really need the the
defender<00:04:59.200> series<00:04:59.490> it's<00:05:00.490> not<00:05:00.580> just<00:05:00.669> for<00:05:00.970> the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
defender series it's not just for the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.879 
defender series it's not just for the
concealer<00:05:01.600> working<00:05:01.810> construction<00:05:02.139> but<00:05:02.410> it's

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
concealer working construction but it's

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.950 
concealer working construction but it's
just<00:05:03.070> really<00:05:03.220> bulky<00:05:03.760> and<00:05:03.970> I<00:05:04.360> don't<00:05:04.720> want<00:05:04.900> to

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
just really bulky and I don't want to

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.029 
just really bulky and I don't want to
carry<00:05:05.139> around<00:05:05.169> something<00:05:05.680> like<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:05.950> I<00:05:05.979> like
