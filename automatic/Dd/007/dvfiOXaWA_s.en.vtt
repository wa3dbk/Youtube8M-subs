00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:13.700
 I want to share with my experience today 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:17.699
 how I chose my child 1 shoes 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.529
 i have five children where so and 5 different 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.560
 experiences 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:26.519
 I will say so that the price of the experience probably 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.359
 only acquired already at the end that is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.750
 the most valuable thing I recognized was shoe 1 before 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:40.230
 it was with the last with the last door 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.149
 two girls yes and so you can be 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 I didn't want any mistakes 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.440
 share how to buy correctly yes how 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.960
 I would like to advise the place 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.030
 share network because shoe 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.910
 the stores are very much up to different and 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.079
 expensive and cheap and in every one 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.790
 everybody want to show our first shoes 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.229
 we had these shoes before 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.610
 I will say what you need to pay attention 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.549
 when you buy yes that is desirable 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.040
 shoes to be leather before 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.460
 number one because dermantine you yourself 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:26.939
 You know your child is sweating legs and would like but 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:30.420
 it's bad and up to 1 shoes all the more first 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.640
 skin before 2 was required 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.640
 inside there was an instep yes that is if we 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.189
 open here have all moms know 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.750
 if you do not know, and here as if there is such 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.800
 the thing is up to the child no i won't become no 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.710
 has become 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.270
 there was no flat feet yes that is 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.920
 it is very important for a small child 2 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.190
 to be here before 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.370
 up not up up here from behind was all three 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.110
 order when even to the bone so that all 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.280
 heel she kept well 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.010
 that is, how would it be very, very important yes 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.430
 to here and everything was firm like 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:18.390
 nowhere must the shoe be loose 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.910
 by when the legs wear that shoe up to 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.040
 she was not wide yes there when here 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.080
 these thongs are regulated there when 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.770
 sticky when i have another here 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.710
 Velcro option and always in 1 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.570
 shoes should be when you are 2 here 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.390
 fasteners yes what are they all the same 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.060
 keeps up yes foot completely she 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.920
 sort of holding on and no book is nothing 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.600
 nowhere slides there two 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.690
 Yes, and the third than to close what else should 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.390
 be a good sole before the kids creep and 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.410
 all if it is wooden, it is also nowhere 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.500
 be that as it is, it must be folded up 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.739
 be very comfortable because the baby is 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:07.790
 you are as different as he is 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:10.590
 movements until when buy i say 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.380
 I wish to buy children but 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.270
 but grew up as far as possible it 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.750
 usually one centimeter to 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.750
 to the edge that is, the baby is wearing a leg and 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.330
 here let's say how much one centimeter 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.120
 somewhere around here yes probably so 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.459
 when a child puts them on there 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.770
 kolgotochki and he gets to him on the floor 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.930
 big finger let's say change here 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.459
 then you are already somewhere but I think that 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.080
 I have already forgotten for half a year 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.450
 us year and 9 I forgot how much she has for us 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.270
 well not so long before 1 buffet another time 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.730
 in general for three months it happens that is 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.970
 such moments on which I understood that it 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:54.530
 it is very important how to choose shoes like this 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.540
 Yes, because it is desirable to do 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.880
 already then when the baby are on 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.300
 leg yes that is, as it were already holding 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.380
 legs no longer get used to the shoes and even on 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:13.430
 the leg is in the correct position 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:14.810
 that is, my observations are 2 shoes than 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.609
 didn't like it either 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.720
 this we had 2 shoes which we 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.900
 bought too 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.210
 inside and outside the skin yes here may already 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.800
 1 sticky trouble here alone here 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.800
 regulated here 2 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.530
 than I really liked it because 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.730
 skin is very soft skin too instep 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.870
 inside yes how do we know that the child is up 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.320
 be sure to tor 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:49.430
 up to 3 years so that everything is correct yes leg 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:54.919
 formed and these shoes to me falling from 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:57.890
 so that they can be worn at home and not 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.020
 need unnecessary sneakers before we say them 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:04.040
 wore a house here so small 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.480
 dots yes you see it kind of helps 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.950
 legs breathe that is it is special 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:13.640
 there is no such sole but in the style of cho mutar 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:17.150
 to which I breathe and that is, and in the summer you 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.900
 You can wear the baby on the leg without 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.540
 sock 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:25.169
 that is, they are such options 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:27.060
 comfortable that you can wear at home and in summer 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.340
 baby leg does not sweat safely 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.009
 do business there is nothing to rub and not 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.389
 sweating and as if for a long time 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:39.960
 that is, so well, this looks like shoes already 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:45.479
 more child up to orthopedic too 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.639
 also very good we would like so 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.370
 pretty so to say that by no means 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.469
 case don't buy such a wow well such 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.900
 yes baby type especially if it is 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:57.449
 some first baby shoes 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.020
 there is not a year yet 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:03.629
 staggering is like let's say 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.310
 very, very wrong shoes in my 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.860
 looking yes i think people 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.810
 agree with me that then yes that is 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:15.719
 when is this size up to maybe yes 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:18.839
 it is possible but not in the beginning, that is, these are shoes and 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:21.120
 and how of course we come close 

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:25.949
 all this can be different 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.529
 first shoes and the one that is above 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:32.729
 which we are more will give 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:35.719
 let's say sadi something must be good ira 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:40.310
 here that it helped you 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:40.310
