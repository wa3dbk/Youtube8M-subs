00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.299
 hi welcome everyone on the 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.010
 honey shock nonsense so today 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.230
 I propose you a surprise recipe 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.520
 so obviously a new recipe that 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.290
 will arrive in a few moments in 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.270
 video is the burger without bread 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.369
 wrapped in a leaf of salad 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.140
 but first of all I would like to thank 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.029
 fast food good for now makes a 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.650
 great little recipe for me so the 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.170
 Italian slices that you could 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.750
 discover on his chain and on mine 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.640
 a few days ago of that so really 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.059
 if you like everything that is burgers 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.120
 fries nuggets wrap all the sauces 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.370
 super known even the ranch really go 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.409
 seeing his chain is a great job 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.119
 the more it presents very very well so 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.739
 face good cooking now we're going 

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:54.409
 go to the recipe so I chose 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.820
 obviously something related to 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.970
 his chain so you will discover 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.530
 this video we start the recipe with 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.510
 the onions then you're going to cut some 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.920
 onions in big slices and then 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.780
 you are going to cook them in a 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.770
 small pan with olive oil from the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.720
 salt and pepper 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.860
 when they are gilded wanted to remove from 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.720
 the stove wanted to book 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.179
 then we'll go to cooking the 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.820
 steak then you put it in the pan 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:18.679
 and you crush it to prevent in 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.060
 done that is too much juice once we 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.070
 will have to stop cooking so crazy 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.259
 crushed a little bit then you go 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.670
 season because we will add the 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.799
 cheese so the seasoning is done 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.810
 now so salt black pepper pepper 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.700
 white what you want after you 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.070
 add a slice of cheddar you 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.259
 return your steak and add 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.299
 another on the top when it has 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.170
 started to melt a little bit on it 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.609
 go back on the fire have reserved 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.170
 so I just forgot to film this 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.539
 part but have to cook two 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.799
 slices of breast or bacon 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.780
 you choose what you want 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.619
 so you make them well roasted and 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.210
 wanted to book 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.829
 then after we will take care of the salad 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.749
 so I took a leaf of lettuce 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.819
 iceberg so it was not necessarily the 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.409
 more convenient than iceberg lettuce is 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.240
 went anyway she cowers 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.619
 on itself is not obvious so if 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.020
 possible rather take a nice leaf 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.630
 lettuce so then you ask the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.399
 steak on the salad you add them 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.290
 pickles after you go buy 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.000
 so either classic mustard me 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.860
 I took American mustard 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.540
 it's not obligatory you can 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.130
 add noclin i put ketchup but 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.690
 allow you to barbecue sauce late 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.080
 really 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.360
 sauces that make you feel like you 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.280
 continue adding the washers 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.230
 onions that cooked just now and 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.210
 then we will finish with bacon so 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.640
 the bacon larvae you put it on the 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.590
 on it then you will take a 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.780
 other little leaf of salad you the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.100
 put on top for the wrapped and 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.550
 then see you have more than 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.810
 close 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.090
 obviously if you take a big 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.070
 salad leaf you just have to 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.970
 roll like a like a rolled cake into 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.970
 does it's the same principle 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.800
 it will be much easier and that's it 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.020
 so once the steak is in Valais 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.640
 you present him on the other side you 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.770
 just have to turn it over like that 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.020
 will be well maintained and you serve with 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.030
 potatoes fries sweats 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.740
 even potatoes why not it's great 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.110
 good so here is a lot of 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.760
 possibilities then if level of the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.830
 tasting if you have closed well 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.540
 your little salad leaf is holding 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.560
 as well as with bread after finally 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.790
 it depends how you eat your 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.590
 burger now that he put himself 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.390
 all over 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.240
 so here I show you the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.710
 real photo that I could so the du 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.210
 burger salad actually that I was able to eat 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.570
 in the United States so the very first 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.250
 Photo 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.870
 so we see it's actually you can 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.510
 even bought tomatoes after end you 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.980
 decorate it as you wish 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.540
 otherwise burgers prepare from this 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.640
 way there so with the salad leaf 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.739
 without the bread so that is still a 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.600
 little more to say a little lighter a little 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.820
 less fat I've seen that in a single 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.020
 restaurant so it's innate note if you 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.520
 have the opportunity to eat there 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.030
 if you go to the united states it's 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.739
 pretty cool anyway until I 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.030
 wish you a good appetite 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.560
 not to make this salad recipe 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.610
 brings a lot of freshness two fangs 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.410
 when it's less heavy obviously 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.239
 with bread, it's really something 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.220
 thing to test in any case still a 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.170
