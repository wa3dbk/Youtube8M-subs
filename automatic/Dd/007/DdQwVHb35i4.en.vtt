00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.450
 hello everyone today in my recipes we are going to 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.639
 make tuna croquettes and for that 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.740
 we need all the ingredients that 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.100
 You see in the image the first thing we will do 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.710
 is to put a pot with water to boil for 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.570
 know all potatoes potatoes 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.259
 we have cut squares so that 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.150
 take less time to boil and make it 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.429
 meanwhile we grate the onion in 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.800
 a pan with hot oil while 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.110
 we have the potatoes in the fire the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.860
 onion in the pan we make the mixture 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.579
 you for that we put in a plate the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.460
 tuna crumbled egg beaten salt 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.530
 pepper xerez click and the juice of a 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.719
 lemon care here with the nuggets of the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.040
 lemon that then we do not stay and 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.560
 friends in some croquette 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.640
 When the potatoes are cooked and the 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.860
 drain and put in another large bowl 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.510
 We cut it with a spoonful of 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.360
 butter and a splash of milk 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.000
 when we have the mash it 's time to 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.930
 take out the onion add it to the mixture 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.570
 tuna 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.540
 mix it well and add everything there 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.210
 on the tuna plate to the big bowl where 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.020
 is the potato we make a mass that 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.790
 we let rest a half hour here 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.220
 I recommend a trick if the mass the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.650
 we have an hour and a half in the fridge 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.770
 the mass will be more consistent and will not 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.570
 let us fry the croquettes to let 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.420
 making the croquettes shape with 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.539
 two spoons we passed through bread crumbs 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.080
 and we put them in the pan with the oil 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.080
 very hot 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.320
