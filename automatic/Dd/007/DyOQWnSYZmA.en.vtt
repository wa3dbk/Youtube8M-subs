 album 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.970
 go and it sounds like it would seem 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.510
 would be from the eighties but no it's them 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.699
 composition from the very end of the seventies 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.160
 predicted a new decade 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:50.340
 and so the guitar is half a tone 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.479
 this starts the malt among all the way 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.930

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:07.540
 Well, I have one stroke to the mediator immediately 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:07.540
 another fast and make a slide from 5 to 8 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:17.120
 Then again slide 8 to 10 minute together 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.909
 Once again, a slide from 10 to 12 is obtained 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:42.330
 And all the way, pull two strings, that is, 1 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.790
 E flat more precisely the note sounds like a drone 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.380
 it is also called that is she adds 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.030
 constant tonks ago 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.630
 and then again the same thing 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.630
 repeated 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.090
 almost comes to the 12th fret move on 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.090

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.560
 eight 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.750
 and back 5 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.330
 refers to 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.330
 and on 13 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.950
 from eighth to 5 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.950
 back to top by 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.609
 13 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.609
 slide 15 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.069
 on 17 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.910
 and here begins what they call 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.910
 turntable 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.590
 i hit in the second string on the seventeenth 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.780
 year and pay attention all the way I 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.250
 made the slides with the index finger like 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.290
 time for my index 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.250
 the finger was at the right moment to 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.430
 turntable to this and bit on the seventeenth 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.819
 year 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.180
 hit the video fuck 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.960
 then chambers pan third finger 20 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.740
 fret 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.520
 that is, without striking the pick backwards 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.520
 18 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:20.329
 Judah with a pick up about the third string 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.329
 also 20 of you 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.720
 but 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.150
 but 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.810
 three times this happens salon from 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.360
 say twice the song sounds if you 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.100
 listen to her remember and she sounds in 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.970
 principle is the same except for those 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.970
 that in a pair not the end is different here 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.960
 in the first case, these play the turntable 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.960
 last three times 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.120
 so here and in the second case, he plays 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.319
 her only twice 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:59.190
 and does what I have on the guitar there is no lever 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:04.700

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:07.459
 who is the so-called fifth string 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.180
 a and lowers her house behind the lever 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.519
 slowly smoothly and beautifully here but we 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.950
 back 1 case what I played in the very 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:22.510
 the beginning of this video of this video it means 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.510
