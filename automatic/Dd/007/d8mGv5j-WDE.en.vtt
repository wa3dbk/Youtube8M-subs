00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 these days marks 150 years of the great 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.610
 Russian scientist Vladimir Vernadsky 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.099
 he first introduced the concept of the noosphere and considered 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.349
 that the earth is a living organism more than that 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.000
 Vernadsky was convinced life on our 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.000
 the planet is brought from space 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.960
 but 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.630
 four billion years ago earth 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.630
 exposed to powerful comet fire 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.810
 who bring life to our planet 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.470
 life yourself on earth need to bring 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.450
 only in ice comets oh right now 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.750
 when we learn already by antarctica by 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.030
 thing numbers are something siberian when we 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.730
 we know that in anabiosis 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.250
 the body can arrive for quite a while 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.520
 sometimes there are no millions then it means that 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.570
 no barriers to transportation 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.350
 the farthest places no ice can 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.150
 bring all the stuff 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.280
 the hypothesis that life on earth is brought from 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.640
 cosmos appeared at the end of the nineteenth 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.310
 century 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:19.850
 then talked about it carefully too 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.680
 Vernadsky sounded fantastic 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.229
 was a strong supporter of this 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.910
 theories like a prophet he foresaw 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.040
 development of many scientific ideas 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.120
 There are a lot of scientists today 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.790
 evidence 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.640
 life could well have appeared outside the earth 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.950
 it is just one of those organism in which 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.860
 no connection with the surface is required and 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.219
 there is no need for the presence of light, this 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.130
 topic autotrophic bacteria that take 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.810
 energy while converting 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.490
 gland 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.009
 something like this might look like the first 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.270
 stage of evolution of life on mars where how 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.850
 many times iron 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.100
 laboratories of scientists huge varieties 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.869
 microbes here they are irradiated with gigantic 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.520
 doses subjected to extreme 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.670
 vacuum creates temperatures 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.090
 but they still live if we teach 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.180
 doses of kilo gray and then 10 kilograms 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.709
 there is mega glad then we can 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.950
 recount yes how old are these 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.769
 soil microorganisms can withstand 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.610
 if one more should add up 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.410
 evidence 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.959
 meteorite images under the electronic 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.180
 microscope fossilized microbes so 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.560
 called cyanobacteria people 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.900
 blue green algae 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.090
 whether the earth is full today 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.560
 the technique allows you to see these 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.410
 wonderful things in meteorites and and there are 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.950
 opportunity these meteorites follow 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.510
 inside in such a way as to avoid 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.049
 any infections that occur in 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.500
 meteorites and it is clear that, respectively, 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:01.220
 meteorites have life it's the strings with 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.639
 the petrified cells are not what was there 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:10.220
 some puddle of mountains and lakes is not his daughter 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:11.990
 in which people lived guys 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.170
 age of meteorites with obvious signs 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.670
 more than four and a half lives 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.430
 billions of years just over age 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.320
 earth , it turns out that these microbes 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.430
 did not live on our planet 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:32.110
 appeared much earlier ssh older and 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:36.200
 so to her is that life happened 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.900
 Treasury here it is a unique collection 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.060
 meteorites of the Institute of Geochemistry which 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.670
 once founded Vernadsky himself 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.760
 scientist has always devoted space bodies 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.230
 he paid special attention to meteorites 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.209
 special group and 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.940
 and engaged and started this moment and he 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.160
 vanity meteor board and then 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.420
 meteorites meteorites committee that is 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.480
 this is the first scientist 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.130
 who singled out separated meteorites from 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.420
 other representatives of the mineral 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.810
 kingdoms and 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.880
 it is actively engaged in other studies 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.480
 meteorites and comparisons mifi with ours 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.060
 earthly 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.070
 mined and space venereology 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.900
 radiobiology biogeochemistry 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.090
 crystallography is far from complete 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.340
 list of scientific schools by the founder 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.500
 which was Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.400
 on the contribution to science vernadsky put in 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.680
 one row from lomonosov 1917 scientist was 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.360
 member of the provisional government was part of 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.370
 party cadets but even with such 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.310
 biography he took 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.570
 and the new Soviet government for linen 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.270
 take van was the largest under the term 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.620
 take a mineral singer with a singer 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.110
 and socialism in a single country by 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.660
 projects surrounded by build without 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.590
 minerals were therefore impossible 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:57.229
 take it and surrounded close your eyes 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.820
 Misty past Vernadsky situation 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.270
 in the office of the museum as in life 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.520
 Vernadsky things genuine time gives 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.470
 only a yellowed handwritten leaf in 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.140
 the house was not luxury everything was going on 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.500
 books and Vernadsky read at fifteen 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.650
 languages do not take not second in all 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.800
 consonance is complete in nature so begins 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.770
 known grams of the Vernadian biosphere 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.650
 Biosphere is one of the layers of our land 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.569
 Vernadsky living matter 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.550
 fundamental planetary force so he 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:32.110
 first substantiated a completely new 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.979
 direction in the science of biogeochemistry 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.280
 sciences show interaction and influence 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:41.110
 living matter on inanimate murder 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.780
 Vernadsky was confident of the main stage 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.690
 development of life on earth should be but 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:50.129
 sphere of mind power which was 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.129
 introduced from space
