00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello, I'm back here, I'll tell you a couple of myths that go around this 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.510
 world full of enigmas and mysteries 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.619
 put on your diapers and go ahead 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.619
 this is a myth called you will be next 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.079
 that night everything was very strange 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.150
 We were in an open field near my neighborhood 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.800
 we made a fire and we sat around the fire to chat 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.880
 when marcelo proposed us to play the game of the cup 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.920
 I was a little afraid of everything I had heard about her but 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.550
 thinking it coldly 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.540
 because I'm going to be scared it's just a game 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.550
 in the end we decided 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.220
 we put the board and everything 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.500
 and we started asking things 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.740
 surprisingly the cup was moving and I was breathless 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.420
 it was amazing 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.680
 Suddenly, the cup exploded 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.590
 that was too much 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.590
 We decided that it was time for everyone to go home 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.930
 That night I woke up several times because I found the bathroom light 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.310
 lit 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.110
 the next morning I asked my old men and they had been going 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.550
 to the bathroom at night 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.180
 they answered me that no 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.180
 I ignored that incident and did not want to give it more importance 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.840
 on the way to the institute I passed in front of a bank where there was a man 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.890
 seated 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.780
 when I went a little further I noticed that that same man was following me 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.030
 He was dressed in a black raincoat and dark hat 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.060
 it did not give me good vibrations so I accelerated the pace 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.090
 he did too 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.730
 so as not to seem paranoid I opted for another strategy I stopped in my tracks as if 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.440
 outside to tie the laces of the shoes 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.750
 erc he was making 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.070
 he came to my ear 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.320
 and in a whisper told me do not play with ghosts when you do not know what they are 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.570
 I stayed stone 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.200
 As soon as I could, I already met everyone I met that night and I told him 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.500
 We meet again in the descampate 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.720
 none of us spoke because there was nothing to say we had played 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.410
 with fire and we did not know what bad 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.300
 Suddenly, a man emerged from the shadow 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.890
 he had a sharp instrument in his hand 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.030
 He was heading towards us 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.600
 we ran away 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.110
 each one to his house 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.110
 but to marcelo and silvia we did not see them anymore 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.689
 When I look at your photos I feel like they smile at me and tell me 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.549
 the next you are 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:16.430
 what fear 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.149
 As I was so afraid, my partner will tell you the following myth 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.479
 you think you're the only one scared 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:28.059
 an old English history is situated in teruel small town near 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.949
 oxyfuel 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.329
 gives an account of a beautiful girl named stockings to a forum 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.629
 Slender body almost perfect face and but a lot of arrogance 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.670
 and as such he always intended to be the center of attention 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:47.510
 loading a girl who suffered a hump these angry and threw water 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:51.599
 boiling with what disfigured him not only the body but also the face 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.299
 by surviving and being observed in such poor condition was locked in his 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.899
 room without ever seeing anyone else 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.899
 he did not look at himself in the mirror again or go out into the streets 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.669
 she went crazy and committed suicide by cutting her veins with glass 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:08.699
 a mirror in your room 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.959
 they say that his ambulatory spirit the streets of his village 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.530
 and they also say that if a person is alone in their home and they write median 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:22.009
 in a mirror before going to bed and when he wakes up he appears broken in what is left 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:24.559
 from him the girl's face will be seen 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:26.149
 and it holds 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:29.349
 that this will lead to madness who looks like 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.549
 another myth this time Mexican 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.579
 It tells of a woman who was on the street and was hit by a gypsy woman 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.259
 told him to come back the night 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:38.510
 he ignored him 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.079
 but the next day he returned to look for her 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.989
 As he did not find her, the woman rang a bell in a house where she thought 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.839
 I had and asked for it 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:48.329
 he is not told 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.970
 but I leave this for you 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.899
 and they gave him a letter 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.689
 He did not read it at that time because he used to do it later 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.169
 when you arrive at your home 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.659
 on the way she was hit by a collective and died 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.700
 when the police opened the envelope that he had in one of his pockets he found 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:08.069
 the following text does not go out on the street all this day because it will have a 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.609
 accident and die 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.049
 lie or truth 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.639
 beyond any answer there is no doubt that these stories 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.969
 often cause some fear in those who hear them 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:22.619
 it is not known if they are true but if now it is night or you are alone in your house you 

00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:25.619
 I recommend that you look behind you not be something that 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.900
 but what is happening 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.960
 where am I what happens 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.370
 again they left me alone in a cemetery but that fucking cursed cocks 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.370
 I swear they will pay me to 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.379
 obama 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.909
