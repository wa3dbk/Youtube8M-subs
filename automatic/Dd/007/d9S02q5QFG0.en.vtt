markets well the brain hugs came last
night<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> market<00:00:29.730> trading<00:00:29.910> about<00:00:30.150> 1816

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
night with the market trading about 1816

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.560 
night with the market trading about 1816
so<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> timing<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.969> rate<00:00:33.090> hikes<00:00:33.329> was

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
so the timing of the rate hikes was

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.000 
so the timing of the rate hikes was
perfect<00:00:34.380> if<00:00:35.309> you're<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> bear<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
perfect if you're a bear the the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.350 
perfect if you're a bear the the
practical<00:00:38.489> reason<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> rate<00:00:39.030> hikes<00:00:39.239> is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
practical reason for the rate hikes is

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.810 
practical reason for the rate hikes is
to<00:00:39.480> curb<00:00:39.660> speculation<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.579> know<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
to curb speculation and you know the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.470 
to curb speculation and you know the
consensus<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.920> at<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.250> higher<00:00:44.730> levels<00:00:45.180> that

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
consensus is at the higher levels that

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.190 
consensus is at the higher levels that
speculation<00:00:46.020> was<00:00:46.230> getting<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.590> little<00:00:46.739> bit<00:00:48.200> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
speculation was getting a little bit the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.389 
speculation was getting a little bit the
market<00:00:49.469> was<00:00:49.530> getting<00:00:49.739> little<00:00:49.890> bit<00:00:49.980> overbought

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
market was getting little bit overbought

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.680 
market was getting little bit overbought
and<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> result<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.120> want<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> curb<00:00:51.539> some

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and as a result you want to curb some

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.010 
and as a result you want to curb some
speculation<00:00:52.260> there<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.280> people<00:00:53.579> who<00:00:53.699> have

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
speculation there are people who have

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.600 
speculation there are people who have
more<00:00:55.020> conspiratorial<00:00:55.559> views<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> bottom

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
more conspiratorial views but the bottom

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.670 
more conspiratorial views but the bottom
line<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> they're<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.690> trying<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.109> reduce

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
line is they're just trying to reduce

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.470 
line is they're just trying to reduce
volatility<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.430> market<00:00:59.820> and<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.300> net

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
volatility in the market and the net

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.139 
volatility in the market and the net
result<00:01:00.660> will<00:01:01.109> almost<00:01:01.350> always<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.370> cell<00:01:03.000> up

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
result will almost always be a cell up

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.609 
result will almost always be a cell up
in<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.359> market<00:01:04.040> historically<00:01:05.040> most<00:01:05.939> recently

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
in the market historically most recently

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.370 
in the market historically most recently
it<00:01:07.619> happened<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.070> silver<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.930> silver<00:01:10.140> market

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
it happened in silver the silver market

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.200 
it happened in silver the silver market
however<00:01:10.710> was<00:01:11.010> resistant<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> rate<00:01:12.000> hikes

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
however was resistant to the rate hikes

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.020 
however was resistant to the rate hikes
and<00:01:12.530> there<00:01:13.530> were<00:01:13.590> about<00:01:13.740> three<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.070> four<00:01:14.189> for

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and there were about three or four for

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.630 
and there were about three or four for
silver<00:01:15.330> fire<00:01:15.509> finally<00:01:16.200> capitulated<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:17.009> think

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
silver fire finally capitulated I think

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.480 
silver fire finally capitulated I think
these<00:01:18.180> rate<00:01:18.450> hikes<00:01:18.979> won't<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.340> happen

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
these rate hikes won't have to happen

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.730 
these rate hikes won't have to happen
four<00:01:20.939> times<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.229> market<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.530> getting

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
four times because the market is getting

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.620 
four times because the market is getting
the<00:01:22.830> message<00:01:23.100> right<00:01:23.400> away<00:01:23.430> all<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:24.390> so

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the message right away all right then so

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.450 
the message right away all right then so
what's<00:01:24.900> next<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.259> gold<00:01:25.590> depends<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.340> your

Greg soup onus believes that the 1685 to
1700<00:01:35.820> levels<00:01:36.150> are<00:01:38.570> incredibly<00:01:39.570> important

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
1700 levels are incredibly important

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.020 
1700 levels are incredibly important
support<00:01:40.320> levels<00:01:41.180> below<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.960> think<00:01:44.030> we

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
support levels below that I think we

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.350 
support levels below that I think we
have<00:01:45.060> some<00:01:45.479> serious<00:01:46.200> problems<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.100> goes

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
have some serious problems if it goes

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.050 
have some serious problems if it goes
1685<00:01:48.360> 1700<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.380> holds<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.890> area<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.790> minor

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
1685 1700 and holds that area with minor

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.899 
1685 1700 and holds that area with minor
support<00:01:51.509> at<00:01:51.570> 1720<00:01:52.259> then<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.520> could<00:01:53.729> have

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
support at 1720 then you could have

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.350 
support at 1720 then you could have
another<00:01:54.840> leg<00:01:55.140> higher<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> 2000<00:01:56.460> area<00:01:56.759> now

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
another leg higher to the 2000 area now

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.179 
another leg higher to the 2000 area now
2000<00:01:57.990> seems<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> a<00:02:00.409> random<00:02:01.409> number<00:02:01.770> just

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
2000 seems like a a random number just

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.920 
2000 seems like a a random number just
because<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.520> ends<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.759> zeros<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.719> there's

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
because it ends in zeros but there's

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.630 
because it ends in zeros but there's
some<00:02:04.110> significant<00:02:04.710> reasons<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.340> which<00:02:05.490> we

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
some significant reasons for it which we

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.700 
some significant reasons for it which we
can<00:02:05.759> get<00:02:05.880> into<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.390> yes<00:02:07.110> let's<00:02:07.409> do

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
get into it what are some of the factors

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.119 
get into it what are some of the factors
we<00:02:10.050> should<00:02:10.229> be<00:02:10.289> paying<00:02:10.440> attention<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.920> that

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
we should be paying attention to that

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.040 
we should be paying attention to that
could<00:02:11.400> push<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.879> two<00:02:12.060> thousand

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
could push it to two thousand

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.690 
could push it to two thousand
right<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.440> ties<00:02:13.620> into<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> factors<00:02:14.490> that's

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
right it ties into the factors that's

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.910 
right it ties into the factors that's
that's<00:02:14.970> actually<00:02:15.270> good<00:02:15.390> question<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:16.710> the

open interest acts like a magnet for
good<00:03:49.260> or<00:03:49.440> bad<00:03:49.830> so<00:03:50.640> we<00:03:51.570> think<00:03:51.780> we<00:03:52.530> think<00:03:52.800> a

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
good or bad so we think we think a

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.470 
good or bad so we think we think a
healthy<00:03:53.400> pullback<00:03:53.790> would<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.120> in<00:03:54.239> order

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
healthy pullback would be in order

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.620 
healthy pullback would be in order
before<00:03:55.380> going<00:03:55.739> higher<00:03:56.040> we<00:03:56.430> are<00:03:56.580> agnostic<00:03:56.760> but

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
before going higher we are agnostic but

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.140 
before going higher we are agnostic but
we<00:03:58.410> just<00:03:58.680> we<00:03:59.040> do<00:03:59.190> these<00:03:59.340> things<00:03:59.580> for<00:03:59.790> clients

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
we just we do these things for clients

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.910 
we just we do these things for clients
all<00:04:00.570> right<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:00.840> that's<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.200> bullish<00:04:01.620> side

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
all right so that's on the bullish side
