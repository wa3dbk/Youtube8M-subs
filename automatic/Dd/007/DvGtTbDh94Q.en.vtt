now this device compared to the second

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.120 
now this device compared to the second
gen<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.909> much<00:01:18.270> much<00:01:18.570> slimmer<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.920> see

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
back is now completely flat so if you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.030 
back is now completely flat so if you
light<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> ground<00:01:28.080> that's<00:01:28.290> no<00:01:28.470> wobbling

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
light on the ground that's no wobbling

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.020 
light on the ground that's no wobbling
or<00:01:29.220> anything<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:30.000> just

the sleep/wake button is now more on the
back<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.400> device<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.630> used<00:01:36.900> to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
back of the device so if we are used to

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.140 
back of the device so if we are used to
using<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.560> 2g

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
using the 2g

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.580 
using the 2g
it<00:01:39.150> might<00:01:39.420> take<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> little<00:01:39.930> while<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.259> get<00:01:40.530> used

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it might take a little while to get used

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.480 
it might take a little while to get used
to<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> new<00:01:41.610> 4G<00:01:42.649> but<00:01:43.649> also<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
to with the new 4G but also it on the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
to with the new 4G but also it on the
back<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.850> does<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.270> camera<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
back it does have camera with the

back it does have camera with the
microphone<00:01:47.040> there<00:01:47.729> now<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.420> camera<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.899> able

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
microphone there now this camera is able
