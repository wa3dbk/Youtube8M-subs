00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.830
 biofuel made from oil extracted from oilseeds 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.650
 as soy a woman already show canola the pinhÃ£o-manso cotton lump 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.269
 cultivate these seeds for the production of renewable biofuel 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.419
 is a growing activity all over the world and to the great and even presenting 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:22.900
 now 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.779
 a great opportunity for you to grow along with this new technology 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.250
 according to the producer of raw material for the production of biodisel 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.430
 oilseed processing system only double presses 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.530
 processor 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.730
 the luck of the processor 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.680
 was specially designed for the extraction of jatropha oil and 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.860
 castor bean being that for the other works of our 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.860
 we use luck seems with central processors 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.850
 the technology applied in this system is intelligent and sustainable did not use 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.379
 hood 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.540
 and do not use any chemical process 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.040
 which does not treat effluents and does not pollute the environment, the equipment 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.509
 different from all others already on the market 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.149
 luck seems to be an easy-to-install equipment 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.369
 event to be connected to the electrical grid a complete panel 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.070
 coupled to the machine with xavi starter xavi general 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.870
 reverse payments 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.120
 and operation panel 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.190
 the plant is very simple and in a small space it is possible to have a 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.650
 exceptional production of excellent quality vegetable oil 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.810
 the clean operational cost equipment without competition in the market 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.009
 Robust design designed to work 24 hours a day 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.259
 its operation is very simple, only one operator is sufficient to 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.600
 operate it safely 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.910
 softtek press is an equipment developed by the great has already 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.190
 this positioning 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.130
 to provide reliable technology for rapid return on investment. 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.230
 coating 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.930
