00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.140
 today we okay we are here 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.660
 again in the office wanting to show 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.289
 a little bit of how the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.020
 things here so you know at home there 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.189
 how is our day to day here where 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.529
 We'll talk a little bit about the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.329
 an electric scalpel which is a device that 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.030
 it features fur 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.480
 He's going to burn an old woman one. 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.620
 keratosis a lighter stain one 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.239
 hemangioma vase then it goes 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.760
 cauteriza will burn even that area 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.450
 comes from the earth and then it recovers 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.610
 a skin is normal zinho over 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.100
 so when people apply people 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.739
 feels a little burned 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.870
 usually we do beyond 13 ante 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.989
 that this is not a nasty shock 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.299
 but then we characterize and then 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.380
 skin form a crust had that cross 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.030
 had loose and scars legal matter 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.159
 this device we use a lot 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.530
 Also during surgery when it has 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.290
 one little vase bleeding which we would 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.360
 that specific void and then the people 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.240
 can continue the surgery without 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.659
 bleeding later on mainly in 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.659
 House 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.760
 there are some contraindications for 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.260
 this device as it is an energy one 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.729
 discharge of energy 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.520
 if the person has a prosthesis a 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.159
 cardiac pacemaker we can not 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.580
 because it can change the frequency of 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.290
 to control the device is the person's 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.840
 this device that we have here 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.180
 do not need wire ground some need 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.400
 that you vote a wire-ground a plaquinha 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.270
 below the person to be able to use 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.310
 so it comes like this is a little pen here 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.250
 We'll regulate if it gets stronger. 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.450
 or weaker I'll show you 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:10.590
 here in a kitten when you squeeze 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.840
 and the hillside it is characterizing 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.439
 punctually the skin of the person 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.680
 Okay, I'll try to see if I make a furinho. 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:23.410
 to show you 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.840
 it will go here and making a small hole is 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.420
 one thing is superficial we can 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.730
 use a stronger regulation or more 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.800
 We usually do not use a mother. 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.680
 for who enters does not give so much damage to 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.140
 and not hurt so much and we have 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.810
 a faster recovery in the skin of the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.420
 person without much irritation but the people 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.550
 always do with anesthesia before when 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.770
 it was that little belly that is many 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.200
 also the same as we did in the marcelo 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.330
 another day there with the child with that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.030
 old man to do with it 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.980
 people give an anesthesia 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.380
 Agulhinha same mouth anesthesia 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.610
 dentist or we pass a cream 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.530
 anesthetic 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.650
 so I step a thick layer of 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.930
 cream expects to absorb the people 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.630
 leaves waiting at least a 20 and 30 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.650
 minutes after catalyst not mind 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.100
 It's more sensitive than we can 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.110
 make with a very low energy 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.150
 cauterize directly with this apparatus 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.850
 so how sharp is his tip? 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.100
 we can get well located in Dinho 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.440
 in that something specific that we want 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.570
 in those specific continuums that the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.579
 people have a very good result then 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.070
 some injuries instead of cutting 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.829
 and from the dot we only authorize with 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.280
 it already achieves a good result has 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.860
 people who have difficulty responding to 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.650
 a point or is an area that moves 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.200
 much if point-point opens then 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.980
 we often choose to do only the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.540
 authorization with electric motor tÃ¡ 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.100
 coming to speak to you today is well 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.100
 we keep waiting 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.340
 www.clinicasilhueta.com.br and there 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.680
 fanpage on facebook

 the clinician the doctor renata waiting there 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.450
 the comments and suggestions questions 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.450
 Are you in force is more real?
