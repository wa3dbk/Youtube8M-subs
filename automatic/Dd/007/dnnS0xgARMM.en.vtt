00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
walking closer to straight underneath so

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.090 
walking closer to straight underneath so
you<00:03:18.390> don't<00:03:18.959> have<00:03:19.110> your<00:03:19.260> hands<00:03:19.470> as<00:03:19.650> low<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.920> the

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.010 

and<00:05:56.130> that's<00:05:56.820> it<00:05:57.060> for<00:05:57.300> championship<00:05:57.780> core

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
and that's it for championship core

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.110 
and that's it for championship core
training<00:05:58.230> number<00:05:58.470> three<00:05:58.770> advanced<00:05:59.460> exercises

training number three advanced exercises

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.180 
training number three advanced exercises
so<00:06:00.750> if<00:06:00.900> you<00:06:00.990> want<00:06:01.140> a<00:06:01.200> core<00:06:01.410> that<00:06:01.560> looks<00:06:01.830> good

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
so if you want a core that looks good

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.940 
so if you want a core that looks good
and<00:06:02.460> more<00:06:03.240> importantly<00:06:03.690> performs<00:06:04.380> well<00:06:04.650> like
