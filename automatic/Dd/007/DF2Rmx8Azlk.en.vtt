both signals occurred simultaneously as
you<00:02:02.720> can<00:02:02.900> see<00:02:04.150> but<00:02:05.150> let's<00:02:05.390> break<00:02:05.630> down<00:02:05.659> the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
you can see but let's break down the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.240 
you can see but let's break down the
mass<00:02:06.770> airflow<00:02:07.040> signal<00:02:07.700> first<00:02:08.739> you<00:02:09.739> can<00:02:09.950> see

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
mass airflow signal first you can see

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.030 
mass airflow signal first you can see
that<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.910> signal<00:02:11.150> Rises<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.080> at<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.860> same

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
that the signal Rises and at the same

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.560 
that the signal Rises and at the same
time<00:02:13.340> as<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.670> TPS<00:02:15.160> if<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.459> mass<00:02:16.640> airflow<00:02:16.880> signal

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
time as a TPS if the mass airflow signal

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.289 
time as a TPS if the mass airflow signal
had<00:02:17.870> lagged<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:19.220> could<00:02:19.519> have<00:02:19.730> cost<00:02:20.060> a

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
had lagged it could have cost a

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.490 
had lagged it could have cost a
hesitation<00:02:20.829> so<00:02:21.829> far<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.310> signal<00:02:22.670> looks<00:02:22.850> good

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
hesitation so far the signal looks good

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.970 
hesitation so far the signal looks good
see<00:02:24.500> where<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.890> Peaks<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.579> then<00:02:26.030> drops<00:02:26.980> this

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
see where it Peaks and then drops this

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.520 
see where it Peaks and then drops this
peak<00:02:28.310> occurs<00:02:28.730> because<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.570> intake<00:02:29.989> manifold

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
peak occurs because the intake manifold

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.059 
peak occurs because the intake manifold
was<00:02:30.680> filled<00:02:31.099> with<00:02:31.190> air<00:02:32.050> then<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.410> drops<00:02:33.830> and

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
was filled with air then it drops and

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.750 
was filled with air then it drops and
slowly<00:02:34.610> Rises<00:02:35.150> again

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
slowly Rises again

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.880 
slowly Rises again

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
this occurs as engine RPMs are

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.680 
this occurs as engine RPMs are
increasing<00:02:39.490> if<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.630> mass<00:02:40.810> airflow<00:02:41.250> sensor<00:02:42.250> is

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.170 
around the intake manifold to check for
a<00:05:04.970> vacuum<00:05:05.270> leak<00:05:06.220> so<00:05:07.220> we<00:05:07.400> reached<00:05:07.700> the<00:05:07.940> middle

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
a vacuum leak so we reached the middle

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.720 
a vacuum leak so we reached the middle
of<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.570> manifold<00:05:09.080> with<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.770> spray<00:05:10.100> the

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
of the manifold with the spray the

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.420 
of the manifold with the spray the
engine<00:05:11.330> RPMs<00:05:11.930> changed<00:05:13.360> indicating<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.540> leak

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
engine RPMs changed indicating a leak

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.610 
engine RPMs changed indicating a leak
taking<00:05:16.430> a<00:05:16.520> closer<00:05:16.790> look<00:05:17.120> we<00:05:17.510> found<00:05:17.840> a<00:05:18.169> vacuum

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
taking a closer look we found a vacuum

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.340 
taking a closer look we found a vacuum
cap<00:05:18.889> had<00:05:19.310> burnt<00:05:19.700> off<00:05:19.940> on<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.810> back<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.260> the

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
cap had burnt off on the back of the

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.670 
cap had burnt off on the back of the
intake<00:05:21.680> manifold<00:05:22.510> we<00:05:23.510> replaced<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.080> cap<00:05:24.320> and

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
intake manifold we replaced the cap and

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.800 
intake manifold we replaced the cap and
now<00:05:25.160> look<00:05:25.400> at<00:05:25.610> the<00:05:25.760> long<00:05:25.940> term<00:05:26.240> fuel<00:05:26.540> trim

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
now look at the long term fuel trim

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.870 
now look at the long term fuel trim
straw

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.850 

well<00:05:31.880> this<00:05:32.510> one<00:05:32.720> turned<00:05:32.960> out<00:05:33.050> to<00:05:33.290> be<00:05:33.410> a<00:05:33.440> simple

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
well this one turned out to be a simple

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.750 
well this one turned out to be a simple
fix<00:05:34.130> but<00:05:34.600> as<00:05:35.600> you<00:05:35.750> know<00:05:35.930> simple<00:05:36.890> fixes<00:05:37.280> are<00:05:37.490> not

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
fix but as you know simple fixes are not

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.780 
fix but as you know simple fixes are not
always<00:05:38.030> simple<00:05:38.570> to<00:05:38.720> find<00:05:39.310> that's<00:05:40.310> all<00:05:40.550> for<00:05:40.760> now

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
always simple to find that's all for now

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.420 
always simple to find that's all for now
see<00:05:41.500> you<00:05:42.500> next<00:05:42.650> time

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
see you next time

00:05:43.430 --> 00:06:05.340 
see you next time
in<00:05:43.520> the<00:05:43.760> Welles<00:05:43.940> tech<00:05:44.330> garage

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.410
