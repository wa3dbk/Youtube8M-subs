00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.920
 t 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.330
 hi friends, how are we on one occasion 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.830
 I bring you some news that 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.060
 we found in beta 5 of 7 and well 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.770
 it takes a little bit to make this video 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.590
 because I like to try betas before 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.119
 before doing a complete review and 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.680
 good on this occasion I'm just going 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.200
 to talk about the news that we are going to 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.020
 find in this new beta are some 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.570
 of importance or has itself improved 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.700
 much what is the stability of the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.160
 system is no longer restarted so much 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.440
 much improved the animations and good 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.840
 let's start quickly we're going to 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.149
 say that we have or are going to find what 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.890
 which is a new twitter icon in all 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.469
 the system as we can see 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.829
 we just go here and we will be able to 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.730
 find or we will look for the way to 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.239
 synchronize twitter to our account 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.070
 now the system is blue or good the 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.170
 twitter icon is blue 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.970
 if we want to share something simply 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.620
 and we in the group from safari you 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.000
 we give in sharing and in the same icon 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.520
 we will come out the truth looks pretty 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.850
 well and I liked it a lot also we're going 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.390
 to find what is from what is 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.550
 settings the option to disable 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.440
 control center that is the shelter control 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.470
 It is this that gives us paul to 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.220
 handle or so quick accesses more than 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.890
 nothing to achieve optimal development 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.280
 of our activities we are also going to 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.759
 can find that when switching off 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.530
 or of wanting to turn off our device 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.650
 let's find a new animation 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.479
 well not an animation but it is already 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.850
 more aesthetic change ok 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.890
 here where it says swipe to turn off already 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.619
 they change the letters no longer looks so rough 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.229
 so abrupt and it looks pretty good too 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.180
 let's find a very good novelty 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.470
 which is when we turn off our 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.030
 device from here is going off what 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.940
 We slide off if you have an iphone 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.920
 in black it will be or at the moment of 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.619
 turn on again your screen is going to 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.310
 stay in black and a manzanita in color 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.040
 white but if your iphone is white 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.769
 is going to have the white background and a 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.660
 manzanita black color this only 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.060
 has been able to verify and verify in the 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.840
 iphone 5 on the other devices at 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.450
 seem 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.250
 It seems that how good they were 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.080
 saying also what we have are the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.790
 enhanced animations throughout the system 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.930
 and I tell them there is not so much the Anguiano 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.910
 in a lag bucket 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.489
 but there are no forced restarts anymore 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.180
 there are no restarts that force you almost 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.840
 almost to have to despair it's your turn to 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.000
 get off 6 well we're also going to 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.849
 find that the camera options 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.040
 they have improved quite ok it is a little bit 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.959
 more aesthetic we can see that the hdr already 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.459
 do not put them on the top 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.349
 true that looks pretty pretty good 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.230
 what is the flash we can find 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.780
 auto yes or no more aesthetically we are going to 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.810
 can add the effects directly if 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.970
 we want to have there I'm recording this 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.560
 If we want to share the photos, it's going to 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.940
 be much easier if all 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.519
 option of the camera has improved quite 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.980
 we will also find that we are going to 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.230
 able to take photos with both the button 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.450
 volume to upload and with the button 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.739
 volume to download earlier just what 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.879
 we could do with the volume button 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.129
 to go up ok 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.370
 see let's put volume button here 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:30.139
 to upload and take a picture and now 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.650
 let's press the volume button 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.650
 for 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.860
 and we take a picture the truth that is 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.810
 pretty pretty good father let's go to 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.670
 leave the camera and we have find 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.629
 that when unlocking our 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.459
 iphone ipod touch ipad there is no sound 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.590
 to unlock more have changes and 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.500
 there is sound to block our 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.230
 good device also tell us that 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.090
 the long names of the operators are 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.980
 move back 10 forward on the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.870
 status bar ok in micros 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.690
 telcel operators is very short there is no 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.430
 no problem but if you had one 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.310
 operator with a lot more name 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.590
 long the name is going to be rotating and going 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.079
 to be always aware of the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.120
 operator that you are working with 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.739
 they also give us a new indicator in the 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.639
 calendar when we are moving 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.410
 for months ok the plain gets stuck 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.479
 absolutely nothing we can see and of 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.560
 not only can we do it from 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.600
 top down but also what 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.639
 we can apply from left to right 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.680
 for example I'm going to put here and we see that 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.330
 Automatically I'm having a month with 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.490
 month although really that has been 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.620
 quite pretty good and as I say 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.569
 you can also download dictionaries 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.099
 additional to those you already have 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.689
 operating system like we do 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.490
 we're just going to generate settings 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.860
 languages and we will find the option of 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.839
 download more things we are also going to 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.809
 can find that the labels of 

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:54.879
 erase and mark were exchanged 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:57.069
 within the mail also an option 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.990
 pretty good at the post office is that 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:01.340
 example I'm going to do an email we're going to 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.730
 put here for here 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.460
 and matter what you want and here now 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.729
 if I move the iphone in a way we're going to 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.970
 put it like this 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:16.310
 Sorry to see if you can, it's going like this 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.220
 is going to tell us if we want to undo everything 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.350
 the text if we want to eliminate everything from 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.180
 forget in cancel cancel delete 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.580
 of the draft ok this will happen to us 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.400
 also in the message option if 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.190
 we press messages and move on 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.789
 our iphone will give us the option 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.350
 to eliminate the text the truth that they are 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.419
 changes that are being quite useful 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.630
 so that we already have a golden version 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:44.090
 master a 100% final version friends 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.430
 ok I can give you my opinion of the 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.470
 beta 1 to beta 5 has occupied all the 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.680
 betas since it came out and the truth that 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:55.130
 nowadays it has improved a lot friends 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.560
 ok is very stable is faster 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.330
 transparencies are no longer so 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.039
 transparent now look more opaque 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.380
 the transparencies that also has 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.510
 very liked that you have the 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.120
 pretty opaque folders no longer so 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.669
 transparent the effects are very very 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.229
 very well there are no forced restarts and 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.030
