map<00:00:10.200> called<00:00:10.650> space<00:00:11.840> lasers<00:00:12.840> on<00:00:13.549> Jupiter<00:00:14.549> jazz

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
map called space lasers on Jupiter jazz

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.679 
map called space lasers on Jupiter jazz
this<00:00:15.540> map<00:00:15.750> was<00:00:15.900> made<00:00:15.960> by<00:00:16.550> sofa<00:00:17.550> sill<00:00:18.980> 156<00:00:19.980> and

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
this map was made by sofa sill 156 and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.660 
this map was made by sofa sill 156 and
this<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:21.990> Halo<00:00:22.260> Reach<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> very

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
this is in Halo Reach and it is a very

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.300 
this is in Halo Reach and it is a very
simple<00:00:24.330> very<00:00:24.720> straightforward<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.920> very

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
simple very straightforward but very

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.240 
simple very straightforward but very
very<00:00:26.580> fun<00:00:27.150> mini<00:00:28.050> game<00:00:28.230> which<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.039> actually

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
very fun mini game which was actually

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.420 
very fun mini game which was actually
set<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.789> zealot<00:00:30.420> now<00:00:31.050> before<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.980> had<00:00:32.160> grabbed

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
set on zealot now before we had grabbed

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.510 
set on zealot now before we had grabbed
volumes<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.540> Halo<00:00:33.870> 4<00:00:34.290> um<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:35.370> had

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
volumes and all that in Halo 4 um we had

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.280 
volumes and all that in Halo 4 um we had
a<00:00:35.550> few<00:00:35.910> Maps<00:00:36.120> back<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.510> reach<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.899> had<00:00:37.079> these

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
a few Maps back in reach that had these

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.840 
a few Maps back in reach that had these
outer<00:00:38.250> space<00:00:38.700> low<00:00:39.660> gravity<00:00:39.930> areas<00:00:40.640> zealot<00:00:41.640> was

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
outer space low gravity areas zealot was

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.049 
outer space low gravity areas zealot was
the<00:00:42.180> first<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.719> these<00:00:42.899> um<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.820> basically<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the first of these um and basically the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.139 
the first of these um and basically the
this<00:00:45.840> map<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.620> little<00:00:46.860> Arena<00:00:47.250> built<00:00:47.550> in

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
this map is just a little Arena built in

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.020 
this map is just a little Arena built in
that<00:00:48.329> low<00:00:49.050> gravity<00:00:49.350> area<00:00:49.920> above<00:00:50.460> zealot<00:00:50.940> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
that low gravity area above zealot and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.420 
that low gravity area above zealot and
you<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.079> float<00:00:52.350> around<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.129> laser

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you just float around and you laser

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.720 
you just float around and you laser
people<00:00:53.760> um<00:00:54.059> there's<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.050> little<00:00:55.379> bit<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.730> cover

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
people um there's a little bit of cover

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.430 
people um there's a little bit of cover
there's<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> couple<00:00:58.199> little

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
there's you know like a couple little

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.610 
there's you know like a couple little
shields<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.719> other<00:01:00.719> than<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.260> pretty

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
shields and other than that you pretty

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.160 
shields and other than that you pretty
much<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:02.129> float<00:01:02.789> around<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.570> fall<00:01:03.989> down

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
much just float around if you fall down

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
much just float around if you fall down
into<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:05.369> main<00:01:05.549> part<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> map<00:01:06.119> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
into the main part of the map you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.870 
into the main part of the map you
actually<00:01:06.540> get<00:01:06.659> teleported<00:01:06.960> back<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.880> it's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
actually get teleported back up and it's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.570 
actually get teleported back up and it's
just<00:01:09.210> really<00:01:09.390> fun<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:10.159> completely<00:01:11.159> goofy

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
just really fun it's completely goofy

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.990 
just really fun it's completely goofy
you<00:01:11.880> know<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.619> just<00:01:13.619> silly<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.760> it's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you know it's just silly but it's it's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.270 
you know it's just silly but it's it's
just<00:01:15.270> really<00:01:15.450> fun<00:01:16.340> um<00:01:18.200> yeah<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.500> getting

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
just really fun um yeah and getting

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.520 
just really fun um yeah and getting
crazy<00:01:21.060> multi<00:01:21.450> kills<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.780> always<00:01:22.049> awesome<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
crazy multi kills is always awesome I

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.320 
crazy multi kills is always awesome I
think<00:01:23.189> my<00:01:23.340> favorite<00:01:23.610> part<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.150> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
think my favorite part of this is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.999 
think my favorite part of this is
actually<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:24.810> watching<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> ragdoll

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
actually just watching the ragdoll

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.200 
actually just watching the ragdoll
physics<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:27.290> players<00:01:28.290> like<00:01:28.880> floating<00:01:29.880> off

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
physics of players like floating off

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.890 
physics of players like floating off
into<00:01:30.240> space<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.350> they<00:01:31.680> die<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.310> just

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
into space just as they die and just

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.429 
into space just as they die and just
slowly<00:01:33.900> cartwheeling<00:01:34.710> off<00:01:34.950> into<00:01:35.579> like

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
slowly cartwheeling off into like

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.469 
slowly cartwheeling off into like
far-off<00:01:37.439> space<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.729> always<00:01:38.909> fun<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.390> uh

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
far-off space it's always fun but uh

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.929 
far-off space it's always fun but uh
yeah<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:42.090> said<00:01:42.420> nothing<00:01:42.740> too

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
yeah it's it's like I said nothing too

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.580 
yeah it's it's like I said nothing too
complicated<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.869> pretty<00:01:46.049> much<00:01:46.140> pick<00:01:46.470> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
complicated you can pretty much pick it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.399 
complicated you can pretty much pick it
up<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.860> play<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.509> you<00:01:48.509> know<00:01:48.600> five<00:01:48.899> seconds<00:01:49.350> but

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
up and play in you know five seconds but

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.980 
up and play in you know five seconds but
uh<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:50.189> does<00:01:50.369> test<00:01:50.670> your<00:01:50.970> your<00:01:51.210> laser<00:01:51.479> skills

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
uh it does test your your laser skills

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.690 
uh it does test your your laser skills
and<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.680> actually<00:01:52.829> spawn<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> plasma

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
and you actually spawn with a plasma

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.319 
and you actually spawn with a plasma
grenade<00:01:54.299> also<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.170> warrant<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.939> plasma

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
grenade also just warrant so the plasma

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.520 
grenade also just warrant so the plasma
grenade<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.960> account<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
grenade you have to account for the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.080 
grenade you have to account for the
travel<00:01:58.950> time<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.159> stuff<00:01:59.549> if<00:01:59.700> you're<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.000> to

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
travel time and stuff if you're going to

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.910 
travel time and stuff if you're going to
try<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.270> stick<00:02:00.570> someone<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.619> actually

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
try to stick someone so it's actually

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.440 
try to stick someone so it's actually
really<00:02:02.130> hard<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.549> get<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.820> stick<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.329> it's

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
really hard to get that stick but it's

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.810 
really hard to get that stick but it's
pretty<00:02:03.570> rewarding

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
pretty rewarding

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
pretty rewarding
no<00:02:04.940> you<00:02:05.030> don't<00:02:05.180> have<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.420> worry<00:02:05.540> about<00:02:05.630> like

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
no you don't have to worry about like
