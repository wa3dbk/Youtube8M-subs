 four of their last five games and 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.160
 which points to a length only 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.450
 their evening opponent at brest presents 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.460
 the same team that was

 a match in which larsen turned had 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.689
 marked one finds Guinean as of the 2nd 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.790
 minute in this part he comes to challenge 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:37.160
 the Reims defense but his shot is not 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.390
 not framed in search of his 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.010
 first points outside this 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.080
 season brest defends and proceed in 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.700
 against launched in depth for and 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.770
 resists his defender but loses his 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.180
 duel against kossi agassa the goalkeeper 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.220
 Remois who deflects the ball to the last 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.570
 moment she is Reemois not getting to herself 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.800
 show dangerous and struggle to 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.780
 to bring together the goals of alexis thebals 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.030
 remain far strikes like 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.860
 possibilities but diego rigonato de 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.420
 frames not a strike that sounds like 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.880
 a confession of helplessness and comes to confirm 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.320
 an ins statistic has never scored in 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.950
 out of the surface this season 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.540
 0-0 at the break between reims and brest en 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.280
 beginning of second period paul baysse 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.200
 address a long center at the second post 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.390
 the care bias passes in front of his defender 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.899
 but his strike finds the transverse of 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.609
 kossi agassa opportunities ruined by 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.710
 benoît lesoimier who serves as 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.509
 sniper if we compare his accuracy to 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.179
 that of caubiac screams in a position 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.890
 similar 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:31.759
 the ball miraculously ends in 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.170
 the feet of diego rigaud dato it's 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.579
 framed but not enough to 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.579
 disrupt thelexis thebals 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.060
 She is from Brest, continues to operate in 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.070
 counters and kamel chafni goes back all the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.690
 field and strikes from afar 1 but kossi 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.810
 agassa diverts once again the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.810
 ball 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.290
 the party comes alive in these last 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.940
 minutes both teams get hit 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.410
 for blow but as often it is the 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.970
 last gesture that is not enough 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.970
 precise to tilt the meeting 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.520
 chauvin landry then throws jonathan 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.690
 yes late in the game but on this against 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.570
 brestois the duel round of a new 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.160
 once in favor of the goalkeeper remake the 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.020
 the physiognomy of this end of the game turns 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.320
 in favor of brest which multiplies the 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.850
 situations on the goal of kossi agassa 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.380
 but the goalkeeper rémois decided to keep 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.900
 his virgin purpose he defeats the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.370
 last attempt of kamel chafni with 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.450
 two of the three worst attack of the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.940
 field championship 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.890
 the score will not evolve brest takes his 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.420
 first point outside this season 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.680
 reims on his side figure at a 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.400
 surprising third place 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.400
 best home teams
