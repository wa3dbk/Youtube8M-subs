00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and then it's going to take six energy

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.440 
and then it's going to take six energy
to<00:01:32.250> build<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.210> I'll<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.329> click<00:01:33.689> along

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
to build and so I'll just click along
