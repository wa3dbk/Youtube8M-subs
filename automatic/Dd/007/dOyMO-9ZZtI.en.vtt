00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 nice and gas here palaces and welcome on 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.099
 my first channel in this new video 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.070
 of black ops two I tell you I'll explain a 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.530
 moment how played this game is 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.510
 was played with the axis with the ms mc 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.270
 with between accessories with fmg silencer e 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:24.180
 c4 handle and then how are you decision 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.750
 you guys have read born robot that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.369
 let's say I used mainly 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.470
 for demolition since it is appreciated 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.780
 in front of the bomb and therefore it seems to me a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.030
 little the ass of sat that never should 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.280
 missing in any class whatsoever 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.160
 anywhere even while eating you have to 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.530
 have the visa and the tsar that we say that 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.440
 I tried to go for a hundred more but 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.550
 obviously the match didn't make it 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.070
 guys conclude with 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.050
 let's say a score a bit painful because 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.680
 I could do much more in fact it ends 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.199
 with 58 10 but let's say this game 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.309
 which will only be used 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.809
 as background background as you mean 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.530
 of the comment that today I want to talk to you 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.549
 since we are going to talk right away is 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.229
 today guys I will talk about some 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.509
 anticipations of which we say things that you 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.250
 it could be interesting that I heard 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.080
 between theorized and greeting and from the video 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.340
 that precisely left in the link that is 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.630
 that of American miss and that anyway 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.909
 I do a linguistics let's say that 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.229
 maybe he was understood a little more than 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.119
 he or she is the same I don't know now let's see 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.880
 the boys are just let's say 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.020
 indiscretions given by precisely one 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.470
 youtubers which is part of the ign that is one 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.189
 gods after mascini but the second 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.540
 bigger network in america so more 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.120
 great too 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.580
 worldwide youtube counts 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.630
 100,000 members of it is said that precisely 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.670
 these say news must precisely from a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.680
 his close friend who works for the con 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.780
 machine 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.560
 this guys said the new call of 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.530
 duty mv 4 has changed say let's not 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:16.020
 will call modern warfare 4 but let's say that 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:19.880
 this will be called mode warfare ghost 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.040
 I honestly don't know why 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.330
 obviously the development team itself knows 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.480
 which created the other modern ones 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.430
 warfare paradis and infinity ward and I don't know 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.580
 if there is presumably there will also be 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.310
 years is also activision history 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.880
 guys I think it's always the same 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.880
 burrow 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.530
 obviously the new info elsa boys 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.050
 been told that new ones will come out 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.470
 updates around May 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.150
 obviously 2013 boys though I owe you 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.950
 to say unfortunately it was a bad thing 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.370
 since it goes well to me it is neither hot nor neither 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.010
 cold because practically next to it 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.860
 upcoming next gen and bold consoles 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.110
 play 4 and maybe I could also get the xbox 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:14.730
 720 or what is called cod 4 mv 4 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:18.480
 sorry it will only be for ps4 so 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.959
 I think we say a bad blow for 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.640
 maybe those who don't buy ps4 or 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.600
 for those who buy precisely the play 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.750
 4 not to the launch we say that they could 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.870
 also let the game out a little earlier 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.220
 towards October and then ago he came out precisely at 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.530
 person for playstation 4 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.269
 around maybe everyone at Christmas 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.720
 joyful and happy 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:47.400
 said this guys the campaign let's say 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:51.989
 that this American youtuber that that 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.870
 will be set more or less not in a 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.450
 distant future but where they will come 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.459
 just use weapons that 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:07.050
 we now use weapons 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:08.819
 current I don't know mp4 army weapons loop 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.040
 all this because he explained it 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.739
 youtuber that weapons will be used 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.390
 current because there will be a catastrophe 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.880
 caused by the man who does not 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.660
 it allows precisely to use the new ones 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.260
 technologies 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.110
 so he said guys I say do 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.080
 a report I bring you for a moment 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.700
 what I may have understood what he has 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.650
 he said 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.320
 let's move on to the sector of 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.810
 multiplayer guys I assume that 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.180
 which interests everyone the most since the 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.550
 campaign are the usual 6 7 hours 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.940
 that you make yourself in a day and then be there 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.680
 of the teeth with the online there will be many 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.840
 boy changes in the ambit of 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.750
 multiplayer especially in the movements 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.220
 because as you noted on black 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.490
 ops 2 and also black ops 1 there was the 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:03.600
 movement that of the jump of the dive 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:07.320
 in the next mv August 4 as fuck 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.700
 it will be called there are movement that is a 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.250
 say there will be no more launch but there 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.919
 it will be a slip in which we can 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.780
 move and even shoot while now with 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.330
 the salt we can make by holding 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.500
 pressed circle for at least the psp a 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.060
 three years 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.530
 goodbye I can't speak tonight a 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.010
 playstation 3 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.680
 holding down circle then guys there 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.139
 are explained that there will be a new one 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.700
 way to crouch who has already seen 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:36.090
 in the past that is to say perhaps with the 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.700
 first and perhaps best call of duty applies 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:42.840
 to say cod4 the first on the wolf in the 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.180
 which we could also crouch if 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.010
 dog mambo but well curled up and 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:52.200
 stick out your little head ie from the corners 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.599
 This, however, explained that there was 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.090
 seen precisely on the consoles but if you have 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:59.190
 seen only for gamer PCs 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.580
 so guys I don't know why not 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.370
 computer game since um 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.770
 not portable and I don't have much fun 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.539
 cool player tell me if it's true 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.639
 for those who may have played the 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:12.639
 first way wolf the news is true 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.590
 then obviously there will be guys 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.419
 let's say about the new ages of novelty 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.889
 something innovative that you never are 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:27.169
 seen in call of duty in the world of 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:29.360
 decode which does not represent nor how 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.849
 see on black ops 2 we have zombies 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.590
 also in black ops 1 then we had 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:36.310
 survival in my life but there will be 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.469
 something more innovative than we say 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:42.110
 it makes you lose those two days for 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:44.599
 complete them fan I assume they know about 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.789
 emissions a little new for the kids' environment 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:49.849
 will be very similar to battis paradis and that 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:51.400
 the buildings can be partly 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.199
 destroyed 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.879
 oh well obviously even if you pull a c4 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:00.110
 with the infantry yes with palace however 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:04.729
 much of the building could 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:08.180
 happen so he said and there will be more 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:11.060
 let's say movement compartments like ad 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.039
 example on idol water and also on now 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.319
 friend has no drama guys sorry that 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:19.129
 switch to thani in the middle there are more things 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:20.870
 of the kind that ki dong spa with a little 

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:23.120
 gamer said those guys I remind you that 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.830
 so my video came out then 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.560
 pass I leave the link in the description 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:31.370
 of the video I spoke very fast 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.409
 parliamentary I do more saliva in my mouth 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.839
 I hope you understand that they are 

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:37.759
 only rumors therefore not 

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:40.190
 tell me maybe in six months 

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:41.569
 leave a jerk is not true that there was 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.250
 this was only because there was one 

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:45.500
 are only indiscretion country damage 

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:48.620
 American youtube that has made mine 

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.509
 written and nothing then video guys 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.919
 ends here is left I like it if there is 

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:54.529
 liked if you may like them 

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:56.479
