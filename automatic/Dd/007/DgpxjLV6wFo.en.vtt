00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 which has not happened that you have to 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.250
 print a job a word but they are 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.619
 terms running against everyone who does not 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.320
 there is ink in other cases that already ink 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.710
 low and I'm printing it wrong here 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.839
 present we have a hp cartridge of 21 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.760
 black ink which clearly is 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:44.370
 spent but today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.620
 hack a hp ink cartridge of 22 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.320
 as a first step in addition to taking out 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.769
 printer cartridge was this slot 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.170
 from here with more people and make sure 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.539
 use a small piece which tape one 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.460
 slot after this ensures that 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.469
 also be a suitable size so that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.019
 can remove it without damaging the cartridge 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.899
 once done this on the same computer 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.490
 of opens be an error that does not get 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.250
 the cartridge this is completely normal 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.869
 do not be alarmed it will seem that the same 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.640
 cartridge that we are bringing does not 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.500
 can read well now for example it would be 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.020
 remove the cartridge will continue with the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.119
 next step 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.760
 keep in mind that you should not remove the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.860
 more than I pay you 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.720
 and with another one that we're going to finish this 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.760
 indicated round 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.710
 placing more people with him 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.890
 care since this is one of the areas 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.570
 most sensitive of the whole cartridge let's 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.230
 to proceed to introduce it in the 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.870
 printer by penultimate time by about 30 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.610
 seconds approximately once already 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.670
 after the 30 seconds we are going to 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.560
 take out the cartridge but this time we're going to 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.290
 take out the two pieces of masking tape 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.700
 this should be done with care of not 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.520
 damage the cartridge because if it is 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.520
 damage this whole process will be in vain 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.450
 and now let's proceed to put the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.130
 cartridge again and how can we 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.250
 observe on the computer it will appear that the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.160
 cartridge is now full or at least 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.680
 almost full and yes because having should 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.300
 try with a color cartridge because 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.520
 well he also left is also and that 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.380
 it seems also worked so it's 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.920
 checked to work color appointments 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.240
 and in black but good to test if it is 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.370
 that this really worked without 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.400
 enter something as always as a vera 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.590
 because I like pears this 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.940
 quite nice because one saves money 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.890
 2 is always useful in emergencies and 3 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.110
 it is much easier to buy one 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.670
