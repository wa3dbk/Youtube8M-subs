 turning the soil of the people in time 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.230
 spade checks we noticed that 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.790
 the optimal step is up to 10 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.839
 centimeters with larger steps will be required 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.839
 significant effort 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.330
 notice what happens to 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.140
 weeds on the screen can be seen that this is a miracle 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.509

 here's a patch of beds that we dug up 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.150
 we were asked how it would work 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.500

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.500
 now see this 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.990
 on these frames you can see that for raising 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:50.000
 spider requires considerable effort 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.000
 besides shovel strives to break 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.810
 we also noticed that picking weeds when 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.810
 work miracle shovels uncomfortable 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.780
 test completed conclusions do yourself
