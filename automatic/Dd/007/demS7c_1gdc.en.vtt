00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.109
 hello today with you again marina 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.090
 I want to introduce a slow cooker 05 27 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.860
 being the older brother of the multicooker 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.929
 we all know us 517 and so the composition 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.330
 This configuration also includes 6 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.800
 yogurt cups two spoons 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.080
 flat scoop 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 measuring cup sieve for steamer 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.519
 instruction manual and book 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.460
 recipes 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.070
 his kind for manufacturers of this 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.930
 I certainly do not use the book now 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.450
 I want to talk directly about myself 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.739
 multicooker 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.270
 the slow cooker also has an oblong 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.800
 form she has a water trap 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.660
 significantly less unlike 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.039
 Multivarki 517 small capacity 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.399
 when we leave it back 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.010
 necessarily dragged until the moisture to our 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.559
 really accumulated precisely in this 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.909
 moisture collector they are somewhere not inside 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.390
 saucepan saucepan too ordinary with handles 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.299
 which is important bowl cover 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.210
 ceramic so she more 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.000
 durable and is considered the amount claimed 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.619
 5 liters producer but real 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.920
 capacity three and a half 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.200
 for cooking not fit 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.540
 more than three liters but it is in principle 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.189
 the entire line of multicookers 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.020
 how would a real capacity be like that 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:42.049
 very comfortable removable inner cover 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:43.200
 has two mounts and here removed in the soap 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.810
 rubbed 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.159
 there are two slots that are inserted 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.020
 it's back 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.710
 just who latch external steam 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.439
 the valve is also easy to remove 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.319
 the design is also easy to understand 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.280
 rinse is very easy to insert here is 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:09.340
 the groove is a hole that is, they must be 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.519
 opposite each other only in this way 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.010
 she will lay down well here this multicooker 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.190
 more stable I already have 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.290
 rubber feet 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.579
 Here they are, that is, it is more stable 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.430
 there are also technological holes 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:30.640
 if you happen to be in a corpse without a pan 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.200
 poured water then this water will drain on these 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.879
 holes in no case 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.930
 turn the multicooker 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:40.060
 otherwise god forbid water gets on 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.540
 microcircuits and the slow cooker will stop 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.640
 I would like to stop working now 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.230
 on the features of this particular multicooker 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.810
 there are a few added here 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.510
 additional functions including 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.840
 function hot in oil want immediately 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.209
 show here the maximum temperature 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.090
 reaches 170 degrees unlike 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.609
 previous models where there is 160 it 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.650
 maximum that is for lovers of fast food 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:12.780
 for lovers of food in butter like potatoes 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:16.230
 fries and gypsum donuts well whatever 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.579
 default temperature is 160 degrees 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.889
 pressing the button the temperature is visible 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.169
 170 increase for multicooker this 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:26.079
 significant increase and so on 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:29.680
 time can be added that is any 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:32.230
 case in principle time is regulated on 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.470
 all programs that are installed in 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.480
 This default multicooker as well 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.780
 on programs hot hot in oil 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.780
 multi plus plus can be adjusted 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.780
 the temperature 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.430
 in this multicooker on the function of pilaf and 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.290
 the grits of the cooking process can 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.600
 will end earlier after 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.569
 the set time she will go to 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.810
 preheating if all the liquid evaporate 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.300
 before the appointed time 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.250
 many people often have questions that 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.569
 on some programs does not start 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.160
 start countdown start button 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.630
 Immediately I want to clarify that on such 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.320
 programs like hot hot in oil post 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.419
 steaming 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.100
 the countdown will start with 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.910
 the moment you reach the necessary 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.610
 temperatures 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.800
 that is, if you are basically in on the form 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.140
 oils on the program is hot you think that 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.240
 you can already fry you put the product they 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.669
 begin to fry countdown no 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.070
 went back then that doesn't mean that 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.500
 multicooker defective it means that 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.810
 you did not wait 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.400
 the moment when the multicooker reaches 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.979
 just the right temperature that is to 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.250
 example 160 degrees that you had 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.760
 set at power on 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.760
 programs 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.250
 in this multicooker as in all other 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.470
 multi-cook rice fields have a function 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.530
 delayed start which is very convenient 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.280
 especially when we love to cook on 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.730
 morning from the evening all laid the pot 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.920
 in the morning the porridge got ready now wanted 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.880
 to talk about small flaws 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.850
 this model 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.850
 first is my little moisture trap 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.590
 Due to this often liquid accumulates on 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.440
 inner surface of the cover 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:23.190
 if you open it sharply it is clear that the whole 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.770
 water turns on cooked dish 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.010
 to avoid this you need a cover 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:32.120
 open slowly holding and and then 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.430
 water will gradually drain on 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.550
 inner cover multicooker 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:41.430
 another disadvantage is 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:44.070
 hangs when selecting the menu button when 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.670
 we choose a program she sometimes doesn't 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.230
 immediately triggered do not immediately react 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.120
 I hope that this model will also be 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.970
 manufacturer to refine which 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.870
 the slow cooker 05 17 floor several times 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.280
 finished 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:01.020
 basically i'm a slow cooker and pretty 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.960
 cooked already more than 10 dishes in 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.970
 In principle, everything turned out great but 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.030
 and in the future I will cook like this 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.030
 multicooker models and on models on 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.030
 517 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.400
 and summing up the price and quality of this 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:20.420
 model matched with you was marina 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.420
 to new meetings
