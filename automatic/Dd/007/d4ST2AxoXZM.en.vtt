00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
than just what that one particular vs I

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.270 
than just what that one particular vs I
think<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:45.689> finally<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.950> predict<00:01:47.220> the

think it's finally to to predict the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.850 
think it's finally to to predict the
timing<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:49.229> yeah<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.439> think<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.829> great

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
timing but yeah I think it's a great
