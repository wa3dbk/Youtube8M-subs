00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.409 

about<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:01.920> year<00:00:02.159> ago<00:00:02.250> I<00:00:02.370> saw<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.730> plan<00:00:03.090> for<00:00:03.330> the

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
about a year ago I saw the plan for the

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.539 
about a year ago I saw the plan for the
reconfiguration<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.259> medians<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.950> I<00:00:05.250> learned

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
reconfiguration of medians and I learned

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.190 
reconfiguration of medians and I learned
that<00:00:05.759> we<00:00:05.910> had<00:00:06.210> trees<00:00:06.540> here<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.049> could

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
that we had trees here that we could

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.680 
that we had trees here that we could
move<00:00:07.440> instead<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.460> just<00:00:08.639> demolishing<00:00:09.300> them

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
move instead of just demolishing them

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.290 
move instead of just demolishing them
there's<00:00:10.260> about<00:00:10.469> 255<00:00:11.280> caliper<00:00:11.910> inches<00:00:12.059> of

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
there's about 255 caliper inches of

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.740 
there's about 255 caliper inches of
trees<00:00:12.570> valued<00:00:13.259> around<00:00:13.969> $50,000<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:15.599> are

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
trees valued around $50,000 and we are

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.810 
trees valued around $50,000 and we are
able<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.080> move<00:00:16.350> these<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.920> our<00:00:17.070> parks<00:00:17.520> around

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
able to move these to our parks around

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.450 
able to move these to our parks around
the<00:00:17.970> city<00:00:18.060> they're<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:19.109> nice<00:00:19.740> large<00:00:20.130> shade

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the city they're just nice large shade

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.220 
the city they're just nice large shade
trees<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:21.060> they're<00:00:21.420> going<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.600> provide<00:00:21.869> more

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
trees and they're going to provide more

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.590 
trees and they're going to provide more
shade<00:00:22.619> sooner<00:00:23.340> than<00:00:23.609> planting<00:00:24.060> some<00:00:24.300> smaller

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
shade sooner than planting some smaller

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
shade sooner than planting some smaller
say<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> three-inch<00:00:25.500> caliper<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.220> letting

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
say a three-inch caliper and letting

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.790 
say a three-inch caliper and letting
them<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.880> grow<00:00:27.090> last<00:00:28.080> year<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.470> were<00:00:28.560> able<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
them to grow last year we were able to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.700 
them to grow last year we were able to
move<00:00:29.039> about<00:00:29.279> 20<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.849> them<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.300> Evans<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.410> Ridge

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
move about 20 of them to Evans and Ridge

pull the plug at the location where we
want<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.440> tree<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:44.430> take<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> plug<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.480> to

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
want the tree we take the plug out to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.200 
want the tree we take the plug out to
where<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.930> tree<00:00:46.350> tree<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.730> want<00:00:47.969> put

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
where the tree tree is that we want put

where the tree tree is that we want put
in<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.629> location<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:50.090> back<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.300> truck<00:00:51.539> up

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
in this location we back the truck up

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.819 
in this location we back the truck up
we've<00:00:52.379> dropped<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> plug<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:54.079> dig<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.559> pre

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
we've dropped the plug and dig the pre

we've dropped the plug and dig the pre
up<00:00:56.010> pull<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> tree<00:00:56.579> up<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.000> transport<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
up pull the tree up and transport it to

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.099 
up pull the tree up and transport it to
the<00:00:58.260> site<00:00:58.590> set<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> ground<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.239> we

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the site set it in the ground and we

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.380 
the site set it in the ground and we
have<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.410> level<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.030> plant

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
have to level it and you have to plant

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
have to level it and you have to plant
it<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> little<00:01:03.899> bit<00:01:04.049> higher<00:01:04.320> because<00:01:04.619> for

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
it a little bit higher because for

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.910 
it a little bit higher because for
settling<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.750> once<00:01:06.750> that's<00:01:06.930> done<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.590> we

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
settling and once that's done then we

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.010 
settling and once that's done then we
just<00:01:08.070> water<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.549> tree<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.970> keep<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.720> keep<00:01:09.900> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
just water the tree in keep it keep it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.800 
just water the tree in keep it keep it
watered<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.640> where<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.820> pulled<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> tree<00:01:12.570> we

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
watered and where we pulled the tree we

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.990 
watered and where we pulled the tree we
have<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.560> plug<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.220> put<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> plug<00:01:14.729> back

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
have the plug and we put the plug back

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.270 
have the plug and we put the plug back
into<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.479> hole<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:16.200> decided<00:01:16.650> which<00:01:16.799> trees<00:01:17.100> to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
into that hole we decided which trees to

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.039 
into that hole we decided which trees to
move<00:01:17.430> based<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:18.030> their<00:01:18.180> health<00:01:18.390> most<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.900> all

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
move based on their health most of all

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.510 
move based on their health most of all
there's<00:01:19.500> actually<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> few<00:01:20.040> trees<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.430> have

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
there's actually a few trees that have

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.910 
there's actually a few trees that have
been<00:01:20.549> hit<00:01:20.790> by<00:01:20.820> cars<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:22.320> were<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.680> wood

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
been hit by cars and they were the wood

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.620 
been hit by cars and they were the wood
was<00:01:23.100> damaged<00:01:23.549> whatever<00:01:23.909> those<00:01:24.210> trees<00:01:24.479> were

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
was damaged whatever those trees were

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.780 
was damaged whatever those trees were
not<00:01:24.810> suitable<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.500> moved<00:01:25.830> also<00:01:26.549> there<00:01:26.700> was

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
not suitable to be moved also there was

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.569 
not suitable to be moved also there was
some<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.210> mature<00:01:27.630> pack<00:01:28.409> berries<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.460> are

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
some very mature pack berries that are

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.730 
some very mature pack berries that are
just<00:01:29.759> simply<00:01:30.150> too<00:01:30.479> big<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.930> move<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.380> they

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
just simply too big to move and they

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.830 
just simply too big to move and they
wouldn't<00:01:32.250> survive<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.700> move<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.270> trees<00:01:33.659> that

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
wouldn't survive the move so trees that

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.080 
wouldn't survive the move so trees that
were<00:01:33.930> healthy<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.770> good<00:01:35.009> condition<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
were healthy in good condition and the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.490 
were healthy in good condition and the
size<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.420> we're<00:01:36.810> able<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.320> moved

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
size that we're able to be moved

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.840 
size that we're able to be moved
successfully<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.850> was<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> consideration

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
successfully that was the consideration

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.920 
successfully that was the consideration
sometimes<00:01:41.850> when<00:01:42.119> you're<00:01:42.240> digging<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.750> hit

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
sometimes when you're digging you hit

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.200 
sometimes when you're digging you hit
that<00:01:43.110> hit<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.189> there<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.790> all<00:01:44.939> through

that hit and it's there it's all through

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.870 
that hit and it's there it's all through
