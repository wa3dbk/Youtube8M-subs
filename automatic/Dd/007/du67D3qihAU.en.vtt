00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.380
 good day 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.570
 Today I want to give you a video just before ending this earlier the Sony 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.360
 Kaiser's updated the exact model can be found in the description 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:15.739
 Like the seed for Schiesser Tafel they find it just in the beginning what it brings 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.710
 should simply expand the software update 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.419
 Most are televisions or improve similar features 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.859
 to welcome 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.960
 I said it like the club Intel set that's us 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.829
 make very well said pike 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.130
 be implemented and show what you turn on 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.990
 that's for television 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.990
 Lauterbach second that's a bit run 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.100
 awesome cool how could he not his search for the tidying up 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.210
 Dante is 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.210
 Entrance to the solution book built which would like to start 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.020
 important of course is that will take me are eleven colors defense structural 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.810
 Jump has that very important because "we omit power cord and the with the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 top-value going on is completely natural 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.680
 he still manages to be open 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.230
 and of course no one hits 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.230
 if e10 also Liam 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.340
 Soykan captains have to save 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.980
 Squares are off because it takes in the end also that everything else means 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.670
 through which the profit will be switched off by the law 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.980
 as I said before 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.350
 and what the current must not be deducted the most important 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.720
 but I think that is still most of you 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.430
 to save further as long as possible 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.980
 another break 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.069
 and I will come back again 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.120
 if Isabell is capable but of course he is the time to inform Lenz whole 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.120
 Has lasted 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.669
 so a few train accidents flow on not many his husband 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:24.729
 20 to 30 o'clock after the break 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.369
 and learns that we have come to an end with a detached one with the 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:30.939
 Completed appeal to them now fully in the text 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.569
 to the blackboard completed the songs what he came to the new function to do so 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.709
 I honestly do not know yet but of course I want to do that for now 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:39.779
 to discover you 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.499
 and accordingly he is again this draftsman as it has for every one of me 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:44.559
 to spare the assist
