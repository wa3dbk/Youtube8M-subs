00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.509
 let's go to a practical example in the 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.149
 next sheet in the next 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.870
 slide I put the following 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.960
 example says an exporter like this 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.770
 Colombian will send crafts to brazil 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.010
 the Brazilian asks that the Colombian 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.550
 charge everything 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.180
 this would be an internal dp that 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.420
 means everything included so that the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.460
 Colombian exporter is going to commission 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.760
 absolutely everything you see in the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.090
 part of down a logistics route from 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.440
 Bogota through the great port of 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.040
 Good luck to saints in Brazil and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.650
 to get to the last one to sao paulo in 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.080
 this good case probably 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.630
 the ship will have to go to the channel 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.120
 panama for good luck and then download 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.930
 towards the port of saints of Brazil that 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.530
 is going to be the Colombian exporter 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.340
 prepare the crafts 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.170
 he packs them in bogota he puts them in a 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.619
 Container loads it into a container 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.950
 that container will take care of them 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.560
 from bogotÃ¡ to buenaventura also under the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.930
 responsibility of the Colombian of that 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.300
 Port of Buenaventura will be routed 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.850
 the goods towards the port of saints 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.100
 through a shipping company or a 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.799
 shipping company and 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.200
 finally the Colombian also 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.840
 will hire a trip to sao paulo 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.850
 will fulfill all the responsibilities of 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.440
 export and import in both 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.770
 countries and in the end the Brazilian only 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.970
 will pay for the goods 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.330
 all the obligation remains in the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.899
 Colombian exporter and the obligation of 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.360
 the import is not for the Brazilian 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.850
 the Brazilian will only pay so 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.280
 that the Colombian is in charge of everything and 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.970
 the Brazilian only pays that is a 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.970
 internal 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.959
 therefore on the next slide 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.500
 we'll see that the incoder allows me 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.590
 negotiate allows to understand what the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.580
 exporter and the importer tells us 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.239
 specifically where it is received from where 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.540
 it is sent where it is put where I 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.040
 I leave the risk and the importer takes his 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.099
 own risk 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.790
 also defines the responsibilities of 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:40.030
 each one loads download and paperwork 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.190
 all those responsibilities 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.270
 now 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.400
 in the following the following comment 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.550
 it has to do with who are not the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.600
 incoterms a lot of people think that the 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:59.740
 incoterms are laws are not laws the 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.200
 laws each country is charged from its 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.990
 constitution up its laws regulations 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.630
 rules each country determines those laws 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.170
 the five terms are a law are 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:15.070
 international rules then 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.380
 you could not sue say for 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.680
 We only have one company in your country 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.690
 from some law not because it's a 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.140
 international level in any case you 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.520
 should sue for a breach 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.920
 before the international chamber of commerce 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.330
 who is the one who regulates this 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.310
 2 the 5 terms are not mandatory 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.450
 you can do the negotiation of the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.450
 way you 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.080
 it is up to everyone to use them or not 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.060
 use them in fact everyone uses it to 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.890
 except probably the Americans 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.950
 they use a very sister version 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.740
 similar of the incoterms are also not 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.050
 terms of transport 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.850
 transportation has to do with their 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.120
 own responsibilities and with the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.120
 negotiation 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.330
 it is not a means of transferring the 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.990
 merchandise is to say there is not a 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.030
 legal responsibility 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.780
 neither do the five of us have a 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.430
 contract what they are is a language 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.760
 international 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.520
 so that 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.740
 I hope that in this in this first 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.050
 session is part 1 this is the end of 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.870
 Part 1 you have learned in 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.500
 general terms that are the incoterms 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:40.750
 that regulate and that allow you to do us 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.750
 we see in the next part of the course
