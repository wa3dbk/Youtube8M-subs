00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.799
 the people today we are going to start a 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.980
 series on one of my subjects 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.990
 favorites are deadline we will see one 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.719
 little of the history of this instrument 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.509
 We'll see why the dish to 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.250
 tradition of making dishes 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.630
 developed in some regions of the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.580
 what else in the world 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.830
 we will see the main leagues of 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.289
 which are used in the manufacture of 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.599
 dishes and we'll see some examples 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.329
 of some of the most famous series 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.839
 on models made with these lines ok 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.839
 look that 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.570
 the first historical reference 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.090
 people have linked dishes religion is 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.330
 in the cult of the goddess cibeles that in asia 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.910
 less was considered the mother of all 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.970
 Gods listening happened 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.850
 the twelve centuries before Christ, and 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.890
 these goddess square celebrations do not 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.900
 happened without a time limit then during all 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.430
 the festivities of tocantins dishes 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.040
 being played all the time 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.680
 the smallest as it was known in that 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.690
 known nowadays as turkey 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.380
 another reference more or less in the same 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.740
 only era qd is the 10th century before 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.410
 Christ is in the bible in the king himself 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.670
 David when he brought the ark 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:25.070
 ark of the covenant for jerusalem is has been 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.740
 an event that unites music was very 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.530
 present all types of instruments 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.750
 including mainly the dishes one 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.380
 another reference comes later 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.179
 is in the history of china and the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.830
 very well documented china they have a 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.410
 book that is like a reference book 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.319
 for Chinese musical instruments that 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.750
 is called in Eight this book mentions 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:52.310
 more or less in the 11th century after 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.649
 Christ is that the dishes there was a 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.429
 from that time of 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.709
 tibet 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.119
 although they find the know think that 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.550
 China was one of the first countries to 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.970
 produce dishes 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.590
 It was at that time that he already imported Tibetan 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.780
 and in tibet we know that the deadlines 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.619
 closely linked with the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.619
 religious expression 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.930
 another important aspect of the story 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.770
 to which the dishes are linked to the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.540
 war 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.000
 there are records of the Chinese 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.060
 using the sound of deadlines for 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.070
 scare the enemy troops and also the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.570
 historical record that from the 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.670
 19th century 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.650
 both in the Ottoman empire that came to 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.790
 transform into today's turkey while 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.310
 in europe in general the dishes in paris are 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.570
 become an integral part of the songs 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.570
 used in military marches 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.129
 the dishes were present in several 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.329
 other aspects of the social life of 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.980
 antique 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.400
 So you've been behind since 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.890
 funerals to parties, especially in the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.079
 greece in rome where the bowls that were 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.970
 brought the work where food and drink 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.489
 was brought many times were used 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.170
 as musical instruments as a trace and the 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.510
 People see this when we look at 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.159
 the words that were used in Greek 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.500
 and the Latin dish the musical instrument 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:19.590
 there is the word kim goals from Greek and hence 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.720
 came a cymbal that was martin 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.480
 what we want to know that good 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.299
 came good cymbals which is the word in 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.200
 we see another one 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:34.230
 Latin word that is cheap 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.829
 softly that it was similar to a basin 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.799
 a larger bowl of that word came in the 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.989
 Dutch beckham and in German 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.280
 b that also with a spelling a little bit 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.459
 different right 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.159
 already the modern Italian the word plate and 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.889
 that the same word used for the 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.659
 dish used on the table for food 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.430
 they make a difference when they are 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.129
 talking about music dishes they say 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.190
 the tim to music and then there coming to 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.750
 our word dish in our 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.750
 use here in the kit 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.670
 the plates are made of metal alloys 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.540
 and the metal alloys are mixtures of 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.430
 metals 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.860
 besides the most used metallica in the 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.320
 made of silver and bronze and the types 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.980
 most used bronze when making 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.300
 dishes are the 28 because they mean 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.270
 these numbers good 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:00.010
 starting with the 8 b 8 has 8 per 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:02.740
 cent of stanley ho christmas 92% of copper and 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:07.870
 particles of silver and other metals 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:09.760
 already the b20 has 20% of tin 80% of copper 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.430
 also a little bit of other metals 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.930
 there is another alloy that is used that the 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:20.920
 brass or brass are 20% tin 20% of 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.690
 michael and 60% copper such a blah is 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.310
 used more in the simpler dishes 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.870
 wines those who come with the batteries 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.850
 for starters 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.690
 there are also other leagues that are 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.880
 used as b 23 and 25 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.220
 only that they are not used with such 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.890
 frequency because the higher the 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.810
 tin in the most difficult alloy is 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:46.290
 manufacturing of most of the 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.290
 big companies stay there until the b20 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.420
 there are two important aspects that 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.870
 differentiate dishes made with the 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.360
 20 and with the berruto alloy one is the price 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.520
 and the other is the sonority in relation to the 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.480
 price has two factors that make 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.660
 difference 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.850
 the first is that the b20 as matter 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.890
 premium is more expensive than that of 8 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.470
 and the second is that the process of 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:15.500
 making the dish with the b20 is more 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.700
 labor intensive than the content in question 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.130
 sound 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.800
 the main difference is the amplitude of 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.440
 frequencies the b20 it has a 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.140
 higher frequency then it is possible to do 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.220
 a more serious or more balanced dish 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.400
 more acute 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:35.570
 already in relation to be 8 will have a focus 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.290
 an emphasis on very high frequency 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.000
 good 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.340
 this was our first conversation about 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.560
 have several others because this is a 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.810
 Very rich subject but you can start now. 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.890
 well and we'll continue the week 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.170
 thinking of dishes 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:51.290
 let's do the following have a video of 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.150
 ceiba which is a walk where they show 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.140
 there in the factory how they manufacture 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.840
 the dishes 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.890
 This video is in English but I have already translated it. 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.840
 caption hey 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.940
 it 's there on the youtube channel, but the 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.060
 his link is not public you do not have 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:09.350
 how to access directly but if you are 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.600
 there at www.ba.com you would have brasil.com.br if 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.850
 register and send a message to me 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.710
 I'll send this link to you, you'll be able to 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.610
 watching will see how they do it 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.850
 aspects 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:22.280
 Okay, that's it, you already know if you 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.380
 liked click liked it share this 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.930
 video with your friends like that in our 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:30.010
 channel and we'll see each other in the next 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.010
 See you
