00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
this is going to be how to assemble it

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.519 
this is going to be how to assemble it
and<00:00:28.740> set<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.010> up<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.660> empty<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.929> bag<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
everything else this well obviously it's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.150 
everything else this well obviously it's
going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.320> having<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> little<00:00:37.890> bit<00:00:38.010> more

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
going to be having a little bit more

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.819 
going to be having a little bit more
packing<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.910> when<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.090> get<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:39.960> this

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
packing in it when you get it but this

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.330 
packing in it when you get it but this
is<00:00:41.040> roughly<00:00:41.489> how<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:42.239> will<00:00:42.360> be<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.350> let's<00:00:44.010> get

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
is roughly how it will be so let's get

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.690 
is roughly how it will be so let's get
it<00:00:44.460> out<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> box<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.239> set<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:46.640> okay<00:00:47.640> so

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
it out of the box and set it up okay so

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.470 
it out of the box and set it up okay so
these<00:00:48.000> are<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.300> parts<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:49.280> will<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
these are the parts that will be the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.130 
these are the parts that will be the
main<00:00:51.989> motor<00:00:52.320> unit<00:00:52.829> which<00:00:53.340> has<00:00:54.059> been<00:00:54.510> cleaned

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
main motor unit which has been cleaned

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.990 
main motor unit which has been cleaned
and<00:00:55.379> serviced<00:00:55.829> already<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.399> has<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.550> new<00:00:56.730> belt

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and serviced already it has a new belt

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.299 
and serviced already it has a new belt
in<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.480> that's<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:57.809> ready<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.170> go<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:59.160> won't

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
in it so that's all ready to go we won't

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.880 
in it so that's all ready to go we won't
have<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.640> worried<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.469> two<00:01:01.469> pieces<00:01:01.859> of

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
have to be worried about two pieces of

bolts through there then the other piece
of<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> handle<00:01:26.720> slides<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.990> right<00:01:28.259> there<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
of the handle slides on right there and

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.200 
of the handle slides on right there and
again<00:01:29.909> another<00:01:30.570> handle<00:01:31.259> bolt<00:01:31.439> through<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.210> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
goes inside the cord clip like this this

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.660 
goes inside the cord clip like this this
one<00:01:41.909> faces<00:01:42.360> down<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.189> see<00:01:44.430> there's

first and then just snap it in place the
same<00:02:02.450> with<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> top<00:02:03.810> piece<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.790> cord<00:02:06.030> goes

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
same with the top piece the cord goes

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.740 
same with the top piece the cord goes
right<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:08.000> this<00:02:09.000> goes<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.239> there<00:02:09.539> like

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
right in here this goes in there like

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.700 
right in here this goes in there like
that

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
that

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.840 
that
and<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:12.540> snaps<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.170> place<00:02:13.200> now<00:02:14.190> on<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> top

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
and that snaps in place now on the top

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.600 
and that snaps in place now on the top
piece<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:18.470> cord<00:02:19.470> relief<00:02:19.920> which<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.430> right

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
piece the cord relief which is right

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.970 
piece the cord relief which is right
here<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.540> springs<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:22.020> little<00:02:22.200> bit<00:02:22.320> bent<00:02:22.680> so

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
here the springs a little bit bent so

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.320 
here the springs a little bit bent so
this<00:02:23.130> will<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.430> be<00:02:23.520> pulled<00:02:23.850> out<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> little

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
this will have to be pulled out a little

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.860 
this will have to be pulled out a little
bit<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:26.420> goes<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:27.930> groove<00:02:29.870> like

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
bit but that goes in this groove like

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.820 
bit but that goes in this groove like
that<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.880> then<00:02:32.880> that's<00:02:33.570> snapped<00:02:34.380> onto<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
that and then that's snapped onto the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.940 
that and then that's snapped onto the
hand<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:36.600> next<00:02:36.900> thing<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.380> after<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
hand the next thing to do after the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.920 
hand the next thing to do after the
handle<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:38.910> assembled<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.600> cords

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
handle is assembled and the cords

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.570 
handle is assembled and the cords
attached<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.800> put<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.310> bag<00:02:41.520> on<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:44.250> this

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
attached is to put the bag on and this

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.790 
attached is to put the bag on and this
is<00:02:44.760> fairly<00:02:44.970> simple<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.020> shakeout<00:02:46.500> bag

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
is fairly simple this is a shakeout bag

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.750 
is fairly simple this is a shakeout bag
so<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.190> doesn't<00:02:47.550> need<00:02:47.700> any<00:02:49.040> paper<00:02:50.040> bags<00:02:50.780> and

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
so it doesn't need any paper bags and

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.700 
so it doesn't need any paper bags and
this<00:02:53.760> there's<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.600> little<00:02:54.750> metal<00:02:55.110> tab<00:02:55.380> right

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
this there's a little metal tab right

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:08.180 
this there's a little metal tab right
here<00:02:56.090> goes<00:02:57.090> into<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.540> slot<00:03:06.800> and<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.950> bags

here goes into this slot and the bags
lifted<00:03:09.090> forward<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:10.370> then<00:03:11.370> this<00:03:11.580> little

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
lifted forward and then this little

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.920 
lifted forward and then this little
latch<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:14.360> closed<00:03:16.220> it's<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.310> little<00:03:17.550> tight<00:03:17.930> like

latch is closed it's a little tight like
that<00:03:18.960> and<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.880> empty<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.570> bag<00:03:22.430> obviously<00:03:23.430> we

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
that and to empty the bag obviously we

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.630 
that and to empty the bag obviously we

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
undo the latch again which is hard to do

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.080 
undo the latch again which is hard to do
with<00:03:26.820> one<00:03:27.060> hand<00:03:27.420> because<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.550> sweeper<00:03:29.550> is<00:03:29.850> one

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
with one hand because the sweeper is one

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.820

as<00:04:26.110> on<00:04:26.260> a<00:04:26.290> Hoover<00:04:26.650> convertible<00:04:27.250> so<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:28.690> does

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
as on a Hoover convertible so it does

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.490

belts but it has a new belt on it now so

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.800 
belts but it has a new belt on it now so

that should last for a good amount of
time
