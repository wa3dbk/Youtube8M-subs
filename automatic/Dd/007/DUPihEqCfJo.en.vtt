00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
going to get a radio which is a wire

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.729 
going to get a radio which is a wire
input<00:00:58.350> output<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.809> it<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
input output and it is going to be a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.490 
input output and it is going to be a
wireless<00:01:02.250> router<00:01:03.080> that's<00:01:04.080> kind<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> big

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
wireless router that's kind of big

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.240 
wireless router that's kind of big
alright<00:01:05.460> school<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.260> make<00:01:07.260> sure<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.920> on

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
alright school and make sure is on

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.000 
alright school and make sure is on
channel<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:09.150> because<00:01:09.689> each<00:01:09.990> channel<00:01:10.500> sends

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
channel one because each channel sends

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.800 
channel one because each channel sends
another<00:01:13.280> about<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.460> value<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.540> gets

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
another about up value and it just gets

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.260 
another about up value and it just gets
confusing<00:01:16.560> after<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> while<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.280> annoying<00:01:18.020> so

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
confusing after a while and annoying so

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.609 
confusing after a while and annoying so
let's<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.450> an<00:01:21.570> explosive<00:01:22.110> out<00:01:22.229> here<00:01:22.439> because

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
let's get an explosive out here because

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.630 
let's get an explosive out here because
that's<00:01:22.770> how<00:01:22.860> my<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:25.430> there's<00:01:26.430> your

explosive and you're going to need

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:39.910 
explosive and you're going to need
another<00:01:30.140> radio<00:01:32.299> sending<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.479> channel<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> one

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.420 

okay<00:01:40.729> so<00:01:41.450> what<00:01:41.960> we<00:01:42.140> need<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.530> start<00:01:42.799> wiring<00:01:43.040> up

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
okay so what we need to start wiring up

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.030 
okay so what we need to start wiring up
now<00:01:44.080> I'm<00:01:45.080> going<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.409> yr<00:01:45.560> detonate<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.490> channel

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
now I'm going to yr detonate to channel

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.039 
now I'm going to yr detonate to channel
by<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.100> way<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.520> traffic<00:01:50.030> cone<00:01:50.420> I<00:01:50.450> forgot<00:01:50.930> to

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
by the way the traffic cone I forgot to

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.740 
by the way the traffic cone I forgot to
explain<00:01:51.170> make<00:01:51.979> sure<00:01:52.009> trigger<00:01:52.580> value<00:01:52.820> is<00:01:52.909> 1<00:01:55.750> ok

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
explain make sure trigger value is 1 ok

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.999 
explain make sure trigger value is 1 ok
so<00:01:57.619> we<00:01:58.039> are<00:01:58.070> going<00:01:58.369> to<00:01:58.610> wire<00:01:59.060> up<00:02:02.080> radio<00:02:03.080> 2

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
so we are going to wire up radio 2

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.789 
so we are going to wire up radio 2
button<00:02:04.570> yes<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.869> works<00:02:06.080> I've<00:02:06.320> done<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:06.649> like

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
button yes it works I've done this like

button yes it works I've done this like
four<00:02:07.039> times<00:02:07.189> in<00:02:07.490> it<00:02:07.610> that<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.269> button<00:02:08.539> doesn't

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
four times in it that the button doesn't

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.320 
four times in it that the button doesn't
work<00:02:08.959> sometimes<00:02:09.580> let<00:02:10.580> me<00:02:10.670> switch<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.180> around

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
work sometimes let me switch this around

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.860

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
here so you can see it explode and

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.430 
here so you can see it explode and
kaboom<00:02:15.730> alright<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.060> as<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:17.870> can<00:02:17.959> see<00:02:18.170> this

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
kaboom alright so as you can see this

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.150 
kaboom alright so as you can see this
sends<00:02:18.739> channel<00:02:19.069> one<00:02:19.450> BAM<00:02:20.450> explosion<00:02:21.110> say<00:02:22.100> you

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
sends channel one BAM explosion say you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.160 
sends channel one BAM explosion say you
want<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:22.730> multiple<00:02:23.060> radios<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.019> is

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
want to have multiple radios and this is

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.710 
want to have multiple radios and this is
where<00:02:24.380> i'm<00:02:24.470> probably<00:02:24.769> going<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.130> screw<00:02:25.370> up

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
where i'm probably going to screw up

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.449 
where i'm probably going to screw up
alright<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.049> have<00:02:27.319> an<00:02:27.410> explosive<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.100> set

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
alright so you have an explosive and set

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.520 
alright so you have an explosive and set
your<00:02:28.610> value<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.360> another<00:02:30.049> traffic<00:02:30.260> code

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
sending to that code out there and we're

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.860 
sending to that code out there and we're
going<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.170> press<00:03:58.530> meet<00:03:58.860> over<00:03:59.070> here<00:03:59.250> an

have as many of these as you want go
crazy<00:04:06.270> with<00:04:06.690> channels<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:09.030> if<00:04:09.390> use<00:04:09.690> your

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
crazy with channels and if use your

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.020 
crazy with channels and if use your
tutorial<00:04:10.530> probably<00:04:11.100> one<00:04:11.310> I'll<00:04:11.490> do<00:04:11.730> in<00:04:11.940> about

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
tutorial probably one I'll do in about

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.090 
tutorial probably one I'll do in about
five<00:04:12.450> minutes<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:12.900> put<00:04:13.110> up<00:04:13.230> in<00:04:13.380> about<00:04:13.470> ten<00:04:13.860> is

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
five minutes and put up in about ten is

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.979 
five minutes and put up in about ten is
going<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.210> be<00:04:15.360> a<00:04:15.859> wireless<00:04:16.859> car<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.609> is<00:04:18.480> pretty

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
going to be a wireless car it is pretty

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.900 
going to be a wireless car it is pretty
cool<00:04:19.320> because<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.709> can<00:04:19.890> move<00:04:20.100> with<00:04:20.430> just

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
cool because it can move with just

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.990 
cool because it can move with just
radios<00:04:21.600> I<00:04:22.019> mean<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.160> have<00:04:23.310> like<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.700> little
