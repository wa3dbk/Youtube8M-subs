00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.709
 Welcome to a new adobe tutorial 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:06.470
 photoshop in which we will be 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:10.429
 learning to pass a color image 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.589
 to black and white add some shades and 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.210
 some textures if you want to learn 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.250
 how it is done 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.250
 Stay with me because we've already started 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.640
 and good let's start the first thing 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.529
 we have to do is open the image with 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.780
 the one that we're going to work with in this case I 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.180
 I will be working with this stock and a 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.059
 Once opened our image will change 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.820
 our front color by a black color 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.750
 and our background color for a color 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.409
 white well once done this let's 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.500
 go to the menu layer new layer of settings and 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.270
 we will select the option of maps of 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.790
 degraded 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.970
 let's give ok 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:06.160
 and well our image will be changed to 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.770
 black and white the next thing we would do 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.900
 we will configure our frontal color 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.110
 white and the background color what 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.300
 we will change to a black color well a 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.940
 Once this is done, we are going to click on 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.450
 this tab and we will select the first 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.290
 degraded we click we close 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.430
 our tools by clicking 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.900
 and we are going to select the invest option 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.880
 we return to this bar we click 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.880
 and well now if we modify in 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.580
 our colors we can move this 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.460
 bar and which will be the lighting 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.850
 the white colors and the black color 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.040
 will the shadows we can move these 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.750
 bars so that the effect 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.050
 to our liking 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.140
 and well in this case I will leave it like this 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.800
 we press ok to close our panel 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.440
 and we have finished the effect in 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.690
 black and white now we will add some 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.440
 color tones for this let's go to 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.610
 menu layers fillings adjustments we give a click 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.870
 and we select the uniform color option 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.830
 we select any color whatever 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.450
 of our pleasure we will give in ok 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.710
 we change the blending mode of this layer 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.400
 to exclusion and we lower the opacity to a 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.980
 30% and as we can see we have added 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.930
 some color if we want to change some 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.340
 color or we want to test how it looks with 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.640
 Other colors 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.640
 you just double click on this part 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:49.180
 and we can modify and change the color 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.310
 for one that we like a little more 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.040
 once we have the color of 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.260
 our pleasure we press ok and so 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.810
 it's how we add color tones to 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.150
 our image the next thing we will do 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.359
 will be adding some lights some 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.620
 textures for this we open the texture 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.620
 that is to our liking 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.250
 in this case I will use this 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.250
 we press on open we give in ok 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.430
 we adjust to our image 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.870
 we adjust our image in such a way 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.630
 that is to our liking in this case 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.200
 I'll leave it like this we'll change the way 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.320
 merge this layer to frame with the 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.810
 eraser tool we can erase the 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.060
 lights that we do not want in this case I 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.540
 I'm going to erase this we adjust in such a way 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.610
 that looks good in our photography and 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.090
 if we do not want to leave the color tones 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.870
 we just uncheck and click 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.390
 in the eye of the color layer 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.330
 and we would have something like this that 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.069
 it also looks pretty pretty good and 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.629
