actually earn interest over time which
is<00:02:01.260> quite<00:02:02.190> interesting<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.850> we've<00:02:03.840> skipped

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
is quite interesting and we've skipped

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.530 
is quite interesting and we've skipped
the<00:02:04.260> head<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:04.860> little<00:02:05.100> bit<00:02:05.220> here<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:05.970> i'm<00:02:06.420> not

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
sure if it's based specifically on time

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.210 
sure if it's based specifically on time
or<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:10.289> know<00:02:10.409> sometimes<00:02:10.920> during<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
rounds so that you can't really you know

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.479 
rounds so that you can't really you know
just<00:02:13.230> create<00:02:13.500> crawlers<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.129> sit<00:02:14.340> there

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
just create crawlers and sit there

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.100

basically<00:02:49.560> kind<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.159> similar<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.870> without<00:02:51.870> you

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
basically kind of similar to without you

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.199 
basically kind of similar to without you
know<00:02:52.349> aside<00:02:52.590> from<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.859> interest<00:02:53.189> aspect<00:02:53.700> from

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
know aside from the interest aspect from

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.559 
know aside from the interest aspect from
the<00:02:54.659> hacky<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.500> hacker<00:02:55.739> on<00:02:56.099> moon<00:02:56.909> where<00:02:57.450> you

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
the hacky the hacker on moon where you

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.479 
the hacky the hacker on moon where you
could<00:02:57.750> actually<00:02:57.780> hack<00:02:58.319> somebody<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:59.159> give

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
could actually hack somebody to give

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.449 
could actually hack somebody to give
them<00:02:59.819> money<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.900> give<00:03:01.349> them<00:03:01.560> points<00:03:02.010> right<00:03:02.250> if

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
them money to give them points right if

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.399 
them money to give them points right if
they<00:03:02.639> were<00:03:02.700> low<00:03:02.939> on<00:03:02.970> points<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:04.109> really

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
they were low on points and I really

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.750 
they were low on points and I really
like<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.739> concept<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.549> like<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
like the concept of like I like the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.580 
like the concept of like I like the
concept<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.359> being<00:03:06.480> able<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.989> give<00:03:07.139> the<00:03:07.290> points

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
concept of being able to give the points

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.349 
concept of being able to give the points
and<00:03:07.739> that's<00:03:08.129> right<00:03:08.370> what<00:03:08.549> I<00:03:08.579> started<00:03:08.939> thinking

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
and that's right what I started thinking

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.319 
and that's right what I started thinking
well<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.200> don't<00:03:10.739> really<00:03:10.859> think<00:03:10.980> or<00:03:11.579> feel<00:03:11.609> that

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
well I don't really think or feel that

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.750 
well I don't really think or feel that
there<00:03:12.629> should<00:03:12.659> be<00:03:13.049> sort<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.829> this<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.370> bank

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
there should be sort of this this bank

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.569 
there should be sort of this this bank
machine<00:03:16.010> implementation<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.069> black<00:03:17.250> ops<00:03:17.280> 2

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
machine implementation of black ops 2

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.369 
machine implementation of black ops 2
i'm<00:03:17.760> thinking<00:03:18.180> more<00:03:18.359> along<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.659> lines<00:03:19.049> of

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
i'm thinking more along the lines of

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.770 
i'm thinking more along the lines of
player<00:03:19.769> trading<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.639> i<00:03:21.269> think<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.569> player

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
player trading and i think a player

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.330 
player trading and i think a player
trading<00:03:22.260> system<00:03:22.650> would<00:03:22.799> be<00:03:22.829> much<00:03:23.310> better

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
trading system would be much better

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.750 
trading system would be much better
suited<00:03:24.060> for<00:03:24.120> black<00:03:24.510> ops<00:03:24.540> 2<00:03:24.900> zombies<00:03:25.400> versus<00:03:26.400> a

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
suited for black ops 2 zombies versus a

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.670 
suited for black ops 2 zombies versus a
banking<00:03:27.419> system<00:03:27.780> such<00:03:27.989> as<00:03:28.019> this<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.500> just

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
banking system such as this so I just

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.300 
banking system such as this so I just
put<00:03:28.919> back<00:03:29.489> in<00:03:29.669> five<00:03:29.909> thousand<00:03:30.449> i'm<00:03:30.540> running

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
put back in five thousand i'm running

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.000 
put back in five thousand i'm running
6662<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.699> it<00:03:33.060> actually<00:03:33.239> gives<00:03:33.659> you<00:03:34.010> pennies

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
6662 and it actually gives you pennies

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.219 
6662 and it actually gives you pennies
in<00:03:35.310> your<00:03:35.970> at<00:03:36.180> your<00:03:36.209> points<00:03:36.780> it's<00:03:37.019> kind<00:03:37.139> of

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
in your at your points it's kind of

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:38.839

funny<00:03:37.409> actually<00:03:37.620> even<00:03:38.400> though<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.549> can't

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
funny actually even though you can't

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.719 
funny actually even though you can't
withdraw<00:03:39.449> pennies<00:03:40.079> so<00:03:40.709> player<00:03:41.069> trading<00:03:41.579> and

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
withdraw pennies so player trading and

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
plate or a player trading system that i

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.110 
plate or a player trading system that i
think<00:03:45.269> would<00:03:45.540> be<00:03:45.690> well<00:03:45.930> suited<00:03:46.229> and<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.819> a

player and another player came and
grabbed<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.070> then<00:04:23.280> that<00:04:23.460> would<00:04:23.550> kind<00:04:23.759> of<00:04:23.820> suck

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
grabbed it then that would kind of suck

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.930 
grabbed it then that would kind of suck
especially<00:04:24.090> when<00:04:24.449> you're<00:04:24.539> playing<00:04:24.830> regular

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
especially when you're playing regular

you<00:04:26.940> know<00:04:27.060> public<00:04:27.630> matches<00:04:27.810> in<00:04:28.409> zombies<00:04:29.419> now<00:04:30.419> I

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
you know public matches in zombies now I

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.260 
you know public matches in zombies now I
will<00:04:30.720> say<00:04:30.930> one<00:04:30.960> thing<00:04:31.380> that<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.620> think<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:33.150> know

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
will say one thing that I think you know

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.600 
will say one thing that I think you know
you<00:04:33.510> know<00:04:33.599> I<00:04:33.630> think<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.080> really<00:04:34.610> drives

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
you know I think it really drives

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.740 
you know I think it really drives
strategy<00:04:36.419> when

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
strategy when

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.240 
strategy when
you<00:04:36.810> don't<00:04:37.050> have<00:04:37.230> this<00:04:37.410> type<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.650> system<00:04:37.920> so

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
you don't have this type of system so

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.330 
you don't have this type of system so
what<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:38.910> would<00:04:39.330> actually<00:04:39.680> look<00:04:40.680> for<00:04:40.980> in<00:04:41.100> black

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
what I would actually look for in black

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.330 
what I would actually look for in black
ops<00:04:41.550> 2<00:04:41.670> zombies<00:04:41.790> is<00:04:42.330> in<00:04:42.690> transit<00:04:43.230> mode<00:04:43.500> in<00:04:43.860> the

ops 2 zombies is in transit mode in the
transit<00:04:44.820> game<00:04:45.060> mode<00:04:45.300> you<00:04:45.690> actually<00:04:45.900> have<00:04:46.290> the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
transit game mode you actually have the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.010 
transit game mode you actually have the
system<00:04:46.980> in<00:04:47.130> place<00:04:47.570> where<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:48.660> can<00:04:48.780> trade<00:04:48.990> with

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
system in place where you can trade with

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.690 
system in place where you can trade with
other<00:04:49.230> players<00:04:49.530> which<00:04:50.100> would<00:04:50.310> be<00:04:50.430> great

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
other players which would be great

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.550 
other players which would be great
because<00:04:50.910> I<00:04:51.120> mean<00:04:51.270> that's<00:04:51.390> you<00:04:51.870> know<00:04:51.990> sort<00:04:52.470> of

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
because I mean that's you know sort of

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.490 
because I mean that's you know sort of
an<00:04:52.680> open<00:04:52.920> world<00:04:53.160> that's<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.910> quote<00:04:54.120> unquote

suppose<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.650> campaign<00:04:56.160> for<00:04:57.090> black<00:04:57.750> ops<00:04:57.780> 2

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140

suppose of campaign for black ops 2
zombies<00:04:58.170> and<00:04:58.830> I<00:04:59.730> think<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.330> would<00:05:00.450> be<00:05:00.570> well

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
zombies and I think it would be well

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.690 
zombies and I think it would be well
suited<00:05:00.990> there<00:05:01.230> whereas<00:05:01.650> in<00:05:01.770> survival<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.460> think

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
suited there whereas in survival I think

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.880 
suited there whereas in survival I think
you<00:05:02.850> still<00:05:03.090> want<00:05:03.270> that<00:05:03.300> survival<00:05:03.870> aspect<00:05:03.990> you

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
you still want that survival aspect you

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.830 
you still want that survival aspect you
don't<00:05:05.130> necessarily<00:05:05.310> want<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.240> players<00:05:06.480> to<00:05:06.720> be

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
don't necessarily want the players to be

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.890 
don't necessarily want the players to be
able<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.140> trade<00:05:07.380> with<00:05:07.530> each<00:05:07.680> other<00:05:07.890> so<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:08.520> think

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
able to trade with each other so I think

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.570 
able to trade with each other so I think
leaving<00:05:09.900> it<00:05:10.020> out<00:05:10.110> of<00:05:10.290> the<00:05:10.410> survival<00:05:11.010> mode<00:05:11.190> per

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
leaving it out of the survival mode per

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.530 
leaving it out of the survival mode per
se<00:05:11.850> would<00:05:12.390> probably<00:05:13.260> be<00:05:13.440> okay<00:05:13.590> I<00:05:14.450> don't<00:05:15.450> know

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
se would probably be okay I don't know

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.820 
se would probably be okay I don't know
what<00:05:15.720> do<00:05:15.810> you<00:05:15.870> guys<00:05:15.990> think<00:05:16.050> what<00:05:16.650> do<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:16.770> guys

think about about player trading or or a
banking<00:05:20.400> system<00:05:20.700> or<00:05:20.820> maybe<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.180> banking

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
banking system or maybe the banking

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.320 
banking system or maybe the banking
system<00:05:21.660> is<00:05:22.140> is<00:05:22.440> good<00:05:22.770> enough<00:05:23.010> but<00:05:23.670> I<00:05:23.700> really

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
system is is good enough but I really

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.450 
system is is good enough but I really
would<00:05:24.540> definitely<00:05:25.350> would<00:05:25.470> like<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.800> see<00:05:25.980> the

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
would definitely would like to see the

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.130 
would definitely would like to see the
player<00:05:26.700> trading<00:05:27.150> system<00:05:27.540> similar<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:27.900> what

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
player trading system similar to what

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.790 
player trading system similar to what
Borderlands<00:05:28.770> 2<00:05:28.950> has<00:05:29.160> in<00:05:29.460> place<00:05:30.270> for<00:05:30.770> black<00:05:31.770> ops

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
Borderlands 2 has in place for black ops

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.260 
Borderlands 2 has in place for black ops
2<00:05:32.160> zombies<00:05:32.690> particularly<00:05:33.690> in<00:05:33.900> transit<00:05:34.470> mode

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
2 zombies particularly in transit mode

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.390 
2 zombies particularly in transit mode
no<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:36.690> even<00:05:37.260> its<00:05:37.350> survival<00:05:37.920> I<00:05:38.010> mean<00:05:38.190> I<00:05:38.250> guess

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
no and even its survival I mean I guess

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.010 
no and even its survival I mean I guess
the<00:05:38.580> argument<00:05:38.700> would<00:05:39.150> stand<00:05:39.480> even<00:05:39.810> in

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
the argument would stand even in

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.650 
the argument would stand even in
survival<00:05:40.680> at<00:05:40.830> some<00:05:41.340> times<00:05:41.640> especially<00:05:42.210> on<00:05:42.540> the

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
survival at some times especially on the

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.590 
survival at some times especially on the
custom<00:05:43.050> maps<00:05:43.260> when<00:05:44.100> some<00:05:45.000> of<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.120> players<00:05:45.330> end

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
custom maps when some of the players end

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.240 
custom maps when some of the players end
up<00:05:45.720> going<00:05:45.960> down<00:05:46.080> let's<00:05:46.320> say<00:05:46.440> they<00:05:46.590> purchase

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
up going down let's say they purchase

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.580 
up going down let's say they purchase
all<00:05:47.430> their<00:05:47.580> their<00:05:47.880> perks<00:05:48.180> and<00:05:48.480> we're<00:05:49.410> on<00:05:49.440> a

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
all their their perks and we're on a

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.210 
all their their perks and we're on a
fairly<00:05:50.220> significant<00:05:51.060> level<00:05:51.420> and<00:05:52.130> you<00:05:53.130> know

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
fairly significant level and you know

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.190 
fairly significant level and you know
they<00:05:53.400> get<00:05:53.820> down<00:05:54.120> and<00:05:54.480> they<00:05:54.570> have<00:05:54.720> to<00:05:54.840> rebuy<00:05:55.140> all

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
they get down and they have to rebuy all

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.660 
they get down and they have to rebuy all
the<00:05:55.380> perks<00:05:55.650> they<00:05:55.920> don't<00:05:56.100> have<00:05:56.220> enough<00:05:56.460> money

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
the perks they don't have enough money

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.880 
the perks they don't have enough money
and<00:05:57.060> let's<00:05:57.810> say<00:05:57.960> they<00:05:58.110> get<00:05:58.260> down<00:05:58.440> again

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
and let's say they get down again

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.230 
and let's say they get down again
because<00:05:59.310> they<00:05:59.490> couldn't<00:05:59.700> make<00:05:59.910> it<00:05:59.940> to<00:06:00.150> the

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
because they couldn't make it to the

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.570 
because they couldn't make it to the
area<00:06:00.570> where<00:06:00.720> we<00:06:00.930> were<00:06:01.080> located<00:06:01.560> at<00:06:01.710> without

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
area where we were located at without

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.820 
area where we were located at without
jug<00:06:02.880> right<00:06:03.120> well<00:06:03.720> then<00:06:03.870> they<00:06:04.110> don't<00:06:04.260> you<00:06:04.740> know

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
jug right well then they don't you know

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.350 
jug right well then they don't you know
it's<00:06:05.190> hard<00:06:05.400> for<00:06:05.610> them<00:06:05.730> because<00:06:05.850> sometimes

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
it's hard for them because sometimes

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.550 
it's hard for them because sometimes
they<00:06:06.540> don't<00:06:06.630> really<00:06:06.810> stand<00:06:07.080> at<00:06:07.230> ain't<00:06:07.410> a

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
they don't really stand at ain't a

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.550 
they don't really stand at ain't a
chance<00:06:07.890> each<00:06:08.190> time<00:06:08.430> they<00:06:08.670> they<00:06:09.330> respawn<00:06:10.170> in

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
chance each time they they respawn in

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.500 
chance each time they they respawn in
the<00:06:10.830> next<00:06:11.100> round<00:06:11.310> they<00:06:11.700> really<00:06:12.060> don't<00:06:12.270> have

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
the next round they really don't have

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.620 
the next round they really don't have
enough<00:06:13.020> money<00:06:13.280> even<00:06:14.280> if<00:06:14.730> you<00:06:15.090> know<00:06:15.180> we<00:06:15.300> sort<00:06:15.480> of

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
enough money even if you know we sort of

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.610 
enough money even if you know we sort of
try<00:06:15.780> and<00:06:15.870> protect<00:06:16.140> them<00:06:16.260> they<00:06:16.410> don't<00:06:16.470> have

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
try and protect them they don't have

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.680 
try and protect them they don't have
enough<00:06:16.830> money<00:06:17.010> for<00:06:17.340> a<00:06:17.370> weapon<00:06:17.820> they<00:06:18.360> only<00:06:18.480> have

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
enough money for a weapon they only have

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.200 
enough money for a weapon they only have
the<00:06:18.810> cold<00:06:19.080> and<00:06:19.440> it's<00:06:20.130> pretty<00:06:20.490> difficult<00:06:20.730> to

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
the cold and it's pretty difficult to

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.440 
the cold and it's pretty difficult to
get<00:06:21.360> them<00:06:21.570> back<00:06:21.840> on<00:06:22.050> track<00:06:22.080> so<00:06:23.070> again<00:06:23.820> it<00:06:24.060> sort

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
get them back on track so again it sort

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.480 
get them back on track so again it sort
of<00:06:24.510> goes<00:06:24.660> towards<00:06:25.140> the<00:06:25.320> strategic<00:06:25.950> thing<00:06:26.160> in

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
of goes towards the strategic thing in

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.280 
of goes towards the strategic thing in
helping<00:06:27.120> that<00:06:27.270> player<00:06:27.510> get<00:06:27.750> back<00:06:27.930> on<00:06:28.110> track

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
helping that player get back on track

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.220 
helping that player get back on track
but<00:06:28.920> it<00:06:29.280> would<00:06:29.670> be<00:06:29.850> pretty<00:06:30.300> good<00:06:30.630> pretty<00:06:30.930> cool

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
but it would be pretty good pretty cool

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.840 
but it would be pretty good pretty cool
if<00:06:31.500> you<00:06:31.650> could<00:06:31.740> actually<00:06:31.950> take<00:06:32.340> you<00:06:32.580> know<00:06:32.820> I

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
if you could actually take you know I

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.790 
if you could actually take you know I
have<00:06:33.000> ten<00:06:33.210> thousand<00:06:33.630> points<00:06:33.750> give<00:06:34.080> that<00:06:34.560> you

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
have ten thousand points give that you

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.980 
have ten thousand points give that you
know<00:06:34.890> give<00:06:35.130> that<00:06:35.340> teammate<00:06:35.840> some<00:06:36.840> of<00:06:36.900> those

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
know give that teammate some of those

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.750 
know give that teammate some of those
points<00:06:37.260> so<00:06:37.560> they<00:06:37.770> can<00:06:37.890> at<00:06:37.980> least<00:06:38.040> buy<00:06:38.310> a<00:06:38.340> gun

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
points so they can at least buy a gun

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.290 
points so they can at least buy a gun
and<00:06:39.120> jug<00:06:39.860> anyways<00:06:40.860> that's<00:06:41.070> it<00:06:41.400> just<00:06:41.910> want<00:06:42.120> to

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
and jug anyways that's it just want to

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.910 
and jug anyways that's it just want to
bring<00:06:42.660> that<00:06:42.690> one<00:06:42.960> to<00:06:43.080> you<00:06:43.140> guys<00:06:43.320> like<00:06:43.650> I<00:06:43.740> said

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
bring that one to you guys like I said

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.100 
bring that one to you guys like I said
it's<00:06:44.160> not<00:06:44.400> a<00:06:44.700> system<00:06:45.480> that's<00:06:45.720> actually

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
it's not a system that's actually

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.050 
it's not a system that's actually
implemented<00:06:46.770> in<00:06:46.980> custom<00:06:47.370> zombies<00:06:47.760> but<00:06:47.940> it

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
implemented in custom zombies but it

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.860 
implemented in custom zombies but it
really<00:06:48.240> grew<00:06:48.840> out<00:06:48.900> of<00:06:48.960> I<00:06:49.140> was<00:06:49.500> going

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
really grew out of I was going

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.380 
really grew out of I was going
profile<00:06:50.320> the<00:06:50.500> bank<00:06:50.740> and<00:06:51.010> I<00:06:51.370> sort<00:06:51.640> of<00:06:51.760> started

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.390 
profile the bank and I sort of started

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.510 
profile the bank and I sort of started
thinking<00:06:52.720> about<00:06:52.780> it<00:06:52.930> and<00:06:53.230> so<00:06:53.620> it<00:06:53.980> really<00:06:54.250> grew

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
thinking about it and so it really grew

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.130 
thinking about it and so it really grew
into<00:06:54.850> the<00:06:54.970> plate<00:06:55.180> the<00:06:55.210> whole<00:06:55.360> player<00:06:55.690> trading

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.140 
into the plate the whole player trading

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.500 
into the plate the whole player trading
system<00:06:56.500> like<00:06:57.100> Borderlands<00:06:57.580> 2<00:06:57.760> one<00:06:58.390> other

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
system like Borderlands 2 one other

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.150 
system like Borderlands 2 one other
thing<00:06:58.630> I<00:06:58.900> actually<00:06:59.080> had<00:06:59.410> considered<00:06:59.950> while<00:07:00.130> I

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 
thing I actually had considered while I

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.710 
thing I actually had considered while I
was<00:07:00.400> collecting<00:07:00.790> the<00:07:01.060> footage<00:07:01.360> for<00:07:01.600> this
