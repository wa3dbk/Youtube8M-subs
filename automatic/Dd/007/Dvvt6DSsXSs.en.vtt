really was getting on the bandwagon and
use<00:00:23.730> them<00:00:23.970> why<00:00:24.480> they<00:00:25.380> weren't<00:00:25.619> fun

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
use them why they weren't fun

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.550 
use them why they weren't fun
they<00:00:26.519> weren't<00:00:26.730> safe<00:00:27.090> that's<00:00:27.930> what<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> Zoomer

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
they weren't safe that's what the Zoomer

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.069 
they weren't safe that's what the Zoomer
is

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.979

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.660 
motorcycles for 17 years
and<00:00:42.059> thing<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.019> am<00:00:43.500> most<00:00:43.979> excited<00:00:44.190> about

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
and thing that I am most excited about

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.479 
and thing that I am most excited about
with<00:00:44.850> motorcycles<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.409> the<00:00:46.799> the<00:00:47.039> joy<00:00:47.280> and

with motorcycles is is the the joy and
freedom<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.120> feel<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.659> your<00:00:48.750> life<00:00:48.809> in

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
freedom that you feel in your life in

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.789 
freedom that you feel in your life in
nature<00:00:50.100> everything<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:51.570> moves<00:00:51.780> fast<00:00:52.140> leans

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:52.799 
nature everything that moves fast leans

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:56.299 
nature everything that moves fast leans
on<00:00:53.269> motorcycles<00:00:54.269> and<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.379> Zoomer<00:00:55.769> you<00:00:56.100> lean

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
on motorcycles and the Zoomer you lean

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.369 
on motorcycles and the Zoomer you lean
into<00:00:56.549> the<00:00:56.729> turn<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.390> very<00:00:57.659> intuitive<00:00:58.049> it's

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
into the turn it's very intuitive it's

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.799 
into the turn it's very intuitive it's
it's<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.430> way<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.670> nature<00:01:00.269> makes

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it's what it's the way the nature makes

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.169 
it's what it's the way the nature makes
things<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.350> fast

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
things go fast

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.570 
things go fast
so<00:01:03.179> our<00:01:03.329> lean<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.809> steer<00:01:04.049> technology<00:01:04.830> allows

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so our lean to steer technology allows

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.359 
so our lean to steer technology allows
you<00:01:05.759> to<00:01:05.880> turn<00:01:06.090> into<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.479> corner<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:08.009> slide

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
you to turn into a corner and not slide

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.430 
you to turn into a corner and not slide
out<00:01:08.429> our<00:01:08.909> vehicle<00:01:09.420> has<00:01:09.539> traction<00:01:09.899> whether

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
out our vehicle has traction whether

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.669 
out our vehicle has traction whether
it's<00:01:10.619> wet<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:11.130> dry<00:01:11.539> it<00:01:12.539> gives<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.929> the<00:01:13.049> safest
