00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.330
 all hello guys with you again ray 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.920
 Well, finally came our long-awaited 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.980
 on part 1 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.010
 and let's see what has changed with 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.680
 warriors in this patch 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.230
 let's go well and let's get started 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.140
 The main change in this patches is 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.460
 avatar talent what happened to that 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.280
 talent tell you 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.670
 and its recovery time has decreased in 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.220
 twice now it is one and a half 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.840
 minutes true same time action 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.840
 decreased by 4 seconds 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.900
 but no less than the club, he declined as much as 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.479
 twice besides if you use 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.090
 il talent control anger cooldown 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.040
 can be reduced to a minute and we 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.550
 it turns out that we can press 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.190
 avatar two or three times in time 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.500
 the restoration of the strictly speaking 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.910
 recklessness and i think it's just 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.860
 ohrenet how wonderful 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.550
 The second change concerns aram 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.330
 specs 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.850
 and this is a powerful punch his damage increased by 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.800
 50 percent well then let's see 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.729
 how strong is it 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.630
 and you know what I'll tell you the damage from sam not 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.030
 impressive 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.069
 on the third article he deals pathetic 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.679
 fifteen thousand damage while 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.319
 mortal strike deals 27,000 damage a 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:50.170
 who does yakos do 20 thousand damage 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:53.590
 it's pretty big abyss and 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.590
 spend almost 60 rage in order to 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.880
 overclock 3 stack and hit on 15000 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:05.080
 it is at least bad use 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.380
 your free time I think everything 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.500
 will also remain playing the cancer execution 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.319
 rather than with the weak part of the small changes 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.140
 the fight is not fit became the types of sudden 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.950
 death now he shows the exact 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.459
 display of procs for 1 minute that is 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.230
 you see written 2.68 times per minute on 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.560
 in fact it is not entirely correct 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.959
 it happens to me five or six times 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.939
 per minute and sometimes and really for 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.720
 one two times but in general it is 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:39.790
 pretty nice also change 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.640
 touched something at the type of skill arm 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.620
 now it shows a clear amount 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.430
 your artifice they wrong 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.860
 which was almost 60 third dimension 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.099
 warriors touched an impenetrable account 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.959
 what has changed in it before absorption 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.469
 increased by 25 percent 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.069
 let's see how much it is 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:05.500
 we have 28,000 I'll tell you it's not bad there 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.110
 consider the fact that this cheat can be pressed 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.269
 without any cooldown and in itself 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.730
 responsible moment you can under 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.620
 absorbed 100 or even one hundred and fifty thousand 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.280
 demage under good conditions 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.819
 I think it's pretty good about 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.349
 our survival rate 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.090
 also another pretty important 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.370
 the change is an increase 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.790
 index versatility on the floor etc. 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.640
 subjects of all classes are now a sign 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.269
 beside the unbridled gladiator gives 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.390
 from one and a half thousand universality on 20 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.359
 seconds is about 15 percent before the match 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.599
 really increased recovery time on 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.590
 one minute but according to their house 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.799
 grow geometrically 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.109
 progression 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.599
 small about touched and mark victory 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.280
 unbridled radiator increased here 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.840
 universality well in principle also in 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.730
 five times so pretty good 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.799
 plus 244 and on the whole th has gone up very 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.420
 essentially let's see 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.420
 how much 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:31.090
 and you know what i think guys forike 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:34.630
 not bad pile this patch 61 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.610
 pretty good for warriors but not 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.800
 without flaws as they say 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.710
 there is still such a tipchik that we 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.310
 penalty nerfili 11 percent for fields 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.560
 lobster and 14 percent for aruz need 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.900
 so it is not essential either 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.530
 builders mania well i hope this video 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.290
 enlightened you in changing yourself 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.180
 saying 61 soldiers were not looking to something 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.840
 I fussed about what 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.690
 changed so on well and thanks still 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.010
 I hope to see you soon for watching 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.010
 adios ladies and gentlemen 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.289
