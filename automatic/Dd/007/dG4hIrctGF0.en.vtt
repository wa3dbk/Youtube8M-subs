00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.860
 again 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.640
 you leave 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.080
 and novelists 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.420
 and neither is it an opposition of the novelist 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.820
 but I'm going to try and what 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.660
 he tried also with myself is not 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.660
 waste time 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.740
 dedicated is something that you have to spend 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.810
 you want 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.810
 build a novel if you want 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.580
 It takes a lot to be novelists but 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.580
 as a slope and a musician has to 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.200
 to learn 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.840
 a painter has to learn some 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.720
 things however still subsist in 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.570
 a very romantic idea of the writer of 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.489
 that is already born with being written or that 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.940
 a wine radio goes through your brain 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.329
 and you become a writer 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.489
 it's not normal to waste a lot of time and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.190
 What I want is that you do not lose it, I'm going to 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.320
 give three courses at the border 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.730
 one of initiation to the novel that what 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.280
 I call cartography of the novel 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 we depended and those companies need 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.420
 white ones left on the road for the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.729
 construction of a novel dish this 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.860
 it's a bit more advanced to rivet 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.790
 what he whose purpose is an argument 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.000
 susceptible to becoming him 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.130
 in a novel and tutorials tutorials goes 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.920
 to be much more extensive much more 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.920
 simple where I call an old 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.979
 Greek preceptor not want not 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.810
 but but if I'm going to act like a 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.770
 preceptor are already very close to you 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.110
 and this will take nine months and it will be 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.540
 only for those who have a 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.289
 argument or something like an increase in 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.750
 water that can be transformed into say 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.509
 in a situation rewards art write a 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.810
 novel and the course will be the writing of 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.570
 a novel 99 months where you would have to 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.670
 make a first version of that novel 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.069
 of that novel that you all have in the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.700
 head and you have still dared us 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:02.210
 writing writing a novel is not no 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.840
 get put to elaborate the most 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.130
 plus 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.440
 it is not to write 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.489
 in a purpose they had to build 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.489
 before a purpose 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.819
 and above all of having to know 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.709
 the end at least an idea an idea 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.739
 more than sure about how it's going to end 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.420
 the novel was in the form that if you count 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.950
 something that has happened the contact that 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.540
 you know that it has already happened so 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.540
 you know the beginning and the original medium 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.730
 my experience as a professor of 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.190
 of the story 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.940
 it's been 15 years 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.940
 maybe a little more 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.860
 the bathrooms in Havana 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.630
 where I started talking about the theory 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.610
 of the waves 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.610
 the filmmakers are storytellers 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.040
 of the nation 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.130
 or you can become a decorator of 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.130
 interiors 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.220
 iniesta 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.530
 It interested me very much maybe me every time 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.840
 that there is a workshop I learn to learn a lot 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.960
 in account of my mistakes for later 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.300
 come back again and again in europe 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.300
 it is also very useful for me is 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.230
 try 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:34.629
 let's say help to help colleagues 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.629
 Students also helped me themselves
