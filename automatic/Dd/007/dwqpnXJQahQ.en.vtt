00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.150 

all<00:00:06.330> right<00:00:06.480> so<00:00:06.660> I've<00:00:06.750> got<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.049> new<00:00:07.200> marshal<00:00:07.560> up

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
all right so I've got the new marshal up

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.740 
all right so I've got the new marshal up
slash<00:00:08.639> camp<00:00:09.210> that's<00:00:09.630> not<00:00:09.809> new<00:00:10.019> but<00:00:10.639> I<00:00:11.750> figured

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
slash camp that's not new but I figured

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.320 
slash camp that's not new but I figured
I<00:00:12.960> would<00:00:12.990> do<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> demo<00:00:13.710> on<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.309> lick<00:00:14.519> when<00:00:15.210> it

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
I would do a demo on the lick when it

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.960 
I would do a demo on the lick when it
switches<00:00:15.599> from<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.960> melodic<00:00:16.529> part<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
switches from the melodic part to the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.599 
switches from the melodic part to the
wah-wah<00:00:18.720> part<00:00:19.080> I'm<00:00:19.710> gonna<00:00:20.039> play<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.430> in

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
wah-wah part I'm gonna play it in

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.019 
wah-wah part I'm gonna play it in

I<00:00:24.240> know<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> lot<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.529> crap<00:00:25.800> plugged<00:00:26.130> in

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
I know I have a lot of crap plugged in

I know I have a lot of crap plugged in
over<00:00:26.519> there<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.849> my<00:00:27.000> amp<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:28.050> I'm<00:00:28.170> not<00:00:28.289> using

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
over there on my amp but I'm not using

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.040 
over there on my amp but I'm not using
nothing's<00:00:29.130> turned<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.849> was<00:00:30.660> doing<00:00:30.900> some

soundtrack work right now it's just the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.940 
soundtrack work right now it's just the
amp<00:00:35.489> by<00:00:35.880> itself<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:37.140> low<00:00:37.410> volume<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.860> I

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
amp by itself on a low volume the and I

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.979 
amp by itself on a low volume the and I
have<00:00:41.070> an<00:00:41.129> effects<00:00:41.430> loop<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:42.180> was<00:00:42.360> installed

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
have an effects loop that was installed

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.979 
have an effects loop that was installed
on<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.379> particular<00:00:43.710> amp<00:00:44.570> so<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.780> some

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
on this particular amp so I have some

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.410 
on this particular amp so I have some
delays<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.739> stuff<00:00:47.370> running<00:00:48.000> through<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
delays and stuff running through the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.880 
delays and stuff running through the
back<00:00:48.570> end<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.320> anyway<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:51.469> will<00:00:52.469> play<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.800> on

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
back end but anyway I will play it on

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.010 
back end but anyway I will play it on
the<00:00:53.039> strut<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.579> standard<00:00:54.059> tuning<00:00:54.300> nice<00:00:54.780> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the strut and standard tuning nice and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.319 
the strut and standard tuning nice and
slow<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.500> everyone<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.430> lick<00:00:57.230> and

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
slow so everyone can see this lick and

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.660 
slow so everyone can see this lick and
it's<00:01:00.329> slightly<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.219> notes<00:01:02.460> are

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it's slightly it's it's the notes are

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.109 
it's slightly it's it's the notes are
all<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> same<00:01:03.120> slash<00:01:03.989> doesn't<00:01:04.439> play<00:01:05.119> exactly

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
all the same slash doesn't play exactly

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.840 
all the same slash doesn't play exactly
these<00:01:06.360> notes<00:01:06.950> whenever<00:01:07.950> he<00:01:08.100> plays<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.580> lick

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
these notes whenever he plays this lick

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.670 
these notes whenever he plays this lick
because<00:01:09.060> he's<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> wah-wah<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.500> he

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
because he's got the wah-wah going so he

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.410 
because he's got the wah-wah going so he
kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.979> slurs<00:01:11.310> particularly<00:01:12.299> at<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
kind of slurs particularly at the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:02:08.900 
kind of slurs particularly at the
beginning

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.120 

so<00:02:09.910> it's<00:02:10.240> it's<00:02:10.600> basically<00:02:11.530> two<00:02:11.800> parts

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
so it's it's basically two parts

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.460 
so it's it's basically two parts
Betty<00:02:15.130> plays<00:02:15.600> when<00:02:16.600> he<00:02:16.690> kicks<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.050> wall<00:02:17.230> on

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
Betty plays when he kicks the wall on

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.130 
Betty plays when he kicks the wall on
and<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.250> it's<00:02:18.850> kind<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.150> hard<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.569> so<00:02:19.750> fast

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
and it's it's kind of hard it's so fast

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.050 
and it's it's kind of hard it's so fast
and<00:02:20.410> slurred<00:02:20.770> when<00:02:21.069> he<00:02:21.160> plays<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:21.880> the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
and slurred when he plays it on the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.350 
and slurred when he plays it on the
record<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.250> slowed<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.790> down<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.240> this<00:02:25.300> is

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
record but I slowed it down and this is

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.060 
record but I slowed it down and this is
what<00:02:25.600> I've<00:02:25.720> come<00:02:25.750> up<00:02:26.080> with<00:02:26.110> what<00:02:26.650> he's<00:02:26.770> playing

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
what I've come up with what he's playing

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.630 
what I've come up with what he's playing
and<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:29.110> guess<00:02:29.500> it's<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.100> harmonic

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
and it's I guess it's it's a harmonic

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:39.310 
and it's I guess it's it's a harmonic
minor

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.570 

and<00:02:40.320> when<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.530> kick<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.830> watt<00:02:41.010> on<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.490> you

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
and when you kick the watt on and you

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.090 
and when you kick the watt on and you
play<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.970> pretty<00:02:42.480> fast<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:43.050> sounds<00:02:43.260> pretty

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
play that pretty fast it sounds pretty

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.430 
play that pretty fast it sounds pretty
much<00:02:44.220> just<00:02:44.460> like<00:02:44.580> him<00:02:44.790> although<00:02:45.390> again<00:02:45.840> he's

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
much just like him although again he's

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.080 
much just like him although again he's
playing<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.890> half<00:02:47.040> step<00:02:47.070> they're<00:02:47.700> tuned<00:02:47.970> to

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
playing it a half step they're tuned to

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.360 
playing it a half step they're tuned to
have<00:02:48.240> stepped<00:02:48.510> down<00:02:48.770> like<00:02:49.770> all<00:02:49.950> Guns<00:02:50.190> and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
have stepped down like all Guns and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.880 
have stepped down like all Guns and
Roses<00:02:50.400> songs<00:02:51.170> actually<00:02:52.170> probably<00:02:52.680> pull<00:02:52.800> out

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
Roses songs actually probably pull out

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.860 
Roses songs actually probably pull out
my<00:02:53.130> Les<00:02:53.310> Paul<00:02:53.580> which<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:54.060> tuned<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.510> half<00:02:54.660> step

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
my Les Paul which is tuned a half step

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.490 
my Les Paul which is tuned a half step
down<00:02:55.080> but<00:02:55.290> that's<00:02:56.190> it
