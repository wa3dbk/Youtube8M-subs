00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 greet all of you my dear viewers 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.620
 at the microphone rom liri and these videos will be 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.099
 devoted to the Olympus trials in god of war 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.050
 3 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.630
 I already passed them before when I died 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.400
 dam but why not pass them yet 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.529
 again with the fact that they are easier than won 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.990
 for one angle of war 2 for you so that you 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.470
 and lights were not able to understand that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.480
 as where 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.470
 the first test of us from the lenses is not 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 allow occurrence on screen 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.650
 more than or multiple 50 opponent then 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.570
 there is everything from the horns as appears that is 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.399
 you failed the assignment you need them 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.180
 kill as quickly as possible so as not to 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.629
 admit the appearance of 50 actually i 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.969
 I advise you to just grab it so once everybody 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.030
 push them and this one really 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.239
 a certain time set works 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.030
 use estus and basically here 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.739
 honestly nothing else teller 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.920
 test in god of war 3 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.629
 from chased them by pretty easy and in 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.670
 principle difficulties may arise with 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.830
 one or two trials 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.380
 yes it and even them you will pass rather 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.240
 all from the second or third attempt of course 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.369
 There are certain techniques that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.700
 help how to get through so quickly and easily 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.830
 I will show them in this video but in 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.750
 the first test of such a technique 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.450
 certain no i grab the enemy 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.600
 beat off a little bit of c a little bit of that 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.320
 a little bit of everything and in principle you are excellent 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.090
 ready to win exactly 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.990
 this task to pass and calmly 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.270
 ended the first test 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.900
 proceed to the next as you can see 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.670
 tests for time and therefore on the very 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.920
 It may be difficult 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.079
 because by the end it's already pretty hard 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.189
 as you can see i am balancing on the verge of 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.310
 40 45 but leave all seven seconds lead 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.619
 the main thing is no not to relax last 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.820
 moment because i only passed 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.070
 because of your at the end a little bit 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.649
 relaxed but this time it did not work 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.719
 everything turned out the tests conducted late 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.299
 will show statistics every time 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.399
 but basically nothing special there 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.670
 there is no interesting move to the next 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.670
 to the test
