00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.739
 palace at August 18 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.360

 deputies pardon and lines lies 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:35.170
 all up there whose haunted program by 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:40.610
 the guards go faster my father does not 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:46.150

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.209
 second riddle rich and poor make 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:06.569
 facing the time wheel not south to 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.569
 cross the waters of the styx 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.670
 so for that there's a little something to 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.879
 take I do not know if I can the 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.739

 work it will be taken later in 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.930
 second riddle walk will have to go 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:36.549
 hop to the south we will redirect the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.549
 camera we see here will have to go here 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:49.359
 there somewhere where there is one to 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:52.939
 group a red mill that is broken 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.739
 it's good on this side I thought I was leaving 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.909
 a new email is a branch 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.909
 we were going down 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.920
 how many m 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.840
 500 m to ouidah necessarily that the assembly 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.840
 we find ourselves in front of the enigma then 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:28.620
 it will go in the water and the nums 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.620
 ccq here is that 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:39.729
 which could be a good pot terragir 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:45.870
 Plenty of sensitive then Diang 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:47.620
 interact last puzzle 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.530
 beyond the wall 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:58.360
 on the other side the men cross 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:05:01.900
 the bridge to the southern lands and 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.940
 for the last enigma up to behind 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.620
 the wall so there is a wall that can not be 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:13.690
 not this case starting here is the solution 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:22.389
