00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.949 

and<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.459> since<00:04:17.670> everybody<00:04:18.180> makes<00:04:18.390> mistakes<00:04:18.810> I

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
and so since everybody makes mistakes I

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.840 
and so since everybody makes mistakes I
got<00:04:19.170> a<00:04:19.200> little<00:04:19.260> mascara<00:04:19.769> on<00:04:19.920> my<00:04:20.130> face<00:04:20.340> here<00:04:20.640> and

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
got a little mascara on my face here and

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.400 
got a little mascara on my face here and
a<00:04:20.970> tip<00:04:21.180> for<00:04:21.360> this<00:04:21.480> is<00:04:21.750> just<00:04:21.959> wait<00:04:22.110> for<00:04:22.290> it<00:04:22.380> to

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
a tip for this is just wait for it to

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.500 
a tip for this is just wait for it to
dry<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:23.010> then<00:04:23.070> use<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.580> q-tip<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.330> comes

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
dry and then use a q-tip and it comes

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.210 
dry and then use a q-tip and it comes
right<00:04:24.630> off<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.080> then<00:04:25.680> I'm<00:04:25.800> going<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:26.040> be<00:04:26.160> using

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
right off and then I'm going to be using

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.490 
right off and then I'm going to be using
a<00:04:26.580> second<00:04:27.060> mascara<00:04:27.510> because<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.840> find<00:04:28.380> that

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
a second mascara because I find that

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.900 
a second mascara because I find that
this<00:04:28.680> really<00:04:29.040> helps<00:04:29.310> lengthen<00:04:29.790> your

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
this really helps lengthen your

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.630 
this really helps lengthen your
eyelashes<00:04:30.540> so<00:04:31.140> this<00:04:31.410> is<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.770> buxom<00:04:32.190> one<00:04:32.430> by

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
eyelashes so this is the buxom one by

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:45.380 
eyelashes so this is the buxom one by
bare<00:04:32.910> minerals<00:04:43.490> since<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:44.640> had<00:04:44.850> chapstick<00:04:45.270> on

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
bare minerals since I had chapstick on

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.030 
bare minerals since I had chapstick on
