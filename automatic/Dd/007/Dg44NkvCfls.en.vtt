00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello guys today, the recipe that you 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.809
 you asked on the mont blanc video 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.370
 in meetings, the fast recipe 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.190
 just two minutes then launched by 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.770
 then add the mont blanc e video 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.869
 this is the end result you can 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.279
 make the shapes you want 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.380
 I leave the photos and the usual 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:37.860
 environments and of course the process 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:41.190
 to the next miles per hour 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.440
 the ingredients are 100 g of egg whites and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.160
 200 grams of sugar I already divided into 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.039
 100 100 100 I'll put them just wide 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.829
 Foam match and 100 will be added 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.649
 end of the human episode I recommend 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.230
 legumes must be careful nature 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.230
 non- fig tree environment we put the egg whites 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.820
 this a little uncomfortable volunteer and the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.820
 let's start 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.190
 and commented on a dozen holes 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:33.209
 here we add the other part of 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:34.980
 sugar this is a first woman place 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.920
 a little too big for the thing 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:44.010
 I do it under urban streets without 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.550
 too liquid then I make it fit 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.550
 a little bit more 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:40.940
 the choice is above scassono none 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.940
 chopped almond hazelnuts 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.750
 and now I always do civilians instead 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:10.579
 so that's what I've done too 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:14.319
 see the mont blanc video though 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.319
 you can do whatever you want 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.370
 meanwhile I lit the oven with mortar degrees 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.789
 now I just turn the oven off in the oven and 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.490
 let's stay inside I recently from 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:35.330

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:40.699

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:44.990
 I support then see you later when 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:47.210
 he takes out a very easy ball 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.330
 these meringues the next day in e 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:55.430
 I leave all the meringues in the oven 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:58.130

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.520

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.300
 ready you have to keep a place that 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.889
 whether it is not a no because otherwise we know 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.620
 in fact being made of sugar on 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:16.990
 soft moisten soften 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:20.060
