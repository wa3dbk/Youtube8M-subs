say<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.840> simply<00:00:34.200> isn't<00:00:34.350> true<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
say that just simply isn't true and a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.400 
say that just simply isn't true and a
lot<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.100> us<00:00:35.399> know<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:37.079> things

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
lot of us know it because we do things

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.979 
lot of us know it because we do things
on<00:00:37.590> our<00:00:37.649> own<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:39.090> results<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.719> we<00:00:39.780> see

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
on our own and we see results and we see

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.639 
on our own and we see results and we see
things<00:00:40.260> happen<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:41.399> sort<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.379> rely<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.410> what

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
things happen that sort of rely on what

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.190 
things happen that sort of rely on what
we've<00:00:43.800> been<00:00:43.890> told<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.940> what<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> want<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> do

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
we've been told so what I want you to do

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.979 
we've been told so what I want you to do
is<00:00:46.469> start<00:00:47.129> rethinking<00:00:47.370> those<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.750> told

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
is start rethinking those that have told

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.630 
is start rethinking those that have told
you<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.350> cannot<00:00:49.649> target<00:00:50.160> specific

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you that you cannot target specific

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.010 
you that you cannot target specific
areas<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.120> chest<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> argument

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
areas of your chest and the argument

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.200 
areas of your chest and the argument
that<00:00:52.140> they'll<00:00:52.260> use<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.460> chest<00:00:53.760> muscle

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
that they'll use is the chest muscle

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.410 
that they'll use is the chest muscle
contracts<00:00:54.989> all<00:00:55.260> or<00:00:55.379> none<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.489> does<00:00:56.730> but

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
contracts all or none and it does but

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.000 
contracts all or none and it does but
you<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.840> acknowledge<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.800> in

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
you have to acknowledge as we have in

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.770 
you have to acknowledge as we have in
one<00:00:59.129> other<00:00:59.340> video<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.760> we've<00:00:59.879> done<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
one other video that we've done that the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.770 
one other video that we've done that the
upper<00:01:01.079> chest<00:01:01.350> actually<00:01:01.859> has<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> region<00:01:02.879> okay

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
upper chest actually has a region okay

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.660 
upper chest actually has a region okay
this<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.500> clavicular<00:01:04.680> portion<00:01:05.010> here

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
this the the clavicular portion here

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.910 
this the the clavicular portion here
that<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.689> separately<00:01:07.320> innervated

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that is actually separately innervated

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.820 
that is actually separately innervated
by<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.400> different<00:01:08.970> nerve<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:10.200> capable<00:01:10.439> of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
by a different nerve and it's capable of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.890 
by a different nerve and it's capable of
a<00:01:10.950> different<00:01:11.369> contraction<00:01:12.030> than<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> major

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
a different contraction than the major

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.499 
a different contraction than the major
in<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> PEC<00:01:13.439> major<00:01:13.619> area<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.970> muscle<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
in the PEC major area of your muscle you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.870 
in the PEC major area of your muscle you
know<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.930> chest<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.409> basically<00:01:16.890> we

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
know here in the chest so basically we

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.550 
know here in the chest so basically we
do<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> possibility<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.049> doing<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.350> but

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
do have a possibility of doing that but

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.640 
do have a possibility of doing that but
beyond<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.070> too<00:01:20.490> even<00:01:21.390> within<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.229> muscle

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
beyond that too even within a muscle

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.080 
beyond that too even within a muscle
group<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.700> different

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
group because of the different

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.460 
group because of the different
arrangement<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.600> fibers<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.170> direction

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
arrangement of fibers in the direction

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.609 
arrangement of fibers in the direction
of<00:01:25.650> fibers<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.600> different<00:01:27.600> lines<00:01:28.259> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
of fibers we have different lines of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.859 
of fibers we have different lines of
pull<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.579> attack<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.329> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
pull that we can attack it with that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.870 
pull that we can attack it with that
will<00:01:31.079> recruit<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.040> different<00:01:32.490> pattern<00:01:32.700> or

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
will recruit in a different pattern or

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.580 
will recruit in a different pattern or
motor<00:01:33.119> units<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.659> different<00:01:33.960> patterns<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.409> if

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
motor units and different patterns so if

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.249 
motor units and different patterns so if
you<00:01:34.680> think<00:01:34.950> about<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.360> possible<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you think about that it is possible to

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.310 
you think about that it is possible to
work<00:01:38.100> areas<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:39.000> inner<00:01:39.360> test<00:01:39.720> upper<00:01:40.049> chest

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
work areas like inner test upper chest

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.830 
work areas like inner test upper chest
because<00:01:40.799> we're<00:01:41.369> able<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.880> again<00:01:42.180> upper<00:01:42.570> chest

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
because we're able to again upper chest

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.230 
because we're able to again upper chest
clearly<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.670> separate

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
clearly because we have the separate

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.330 
clearly because we have the separate
innervation<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> inner<00:01:46.649> chest<00:01:47.009> because

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
innervation but the inner chest because

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.859 
innervation but the inner chest because
we've<00:01:47.490> got<00:01:47.670> different<00:01:47.939> ways<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.540> attack

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
we've got different ways we can attack

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.070 
we've got different ways we can attack
it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.950 

so<00:01:56.680> what<00:01:57.550> about<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:58.060> upper<00:01:58.330> chest<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.780> there

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
so what about that upper chest is there

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.050 
so what about that upper chest is there
a<00:01:58.990> way<00:01:59.260> we<00:01:59.290> can<00:01:59.680> incorporate<00:02:00.040> an<00:02:00.550> exercise

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
a way we can incorporate an exercise

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.420 
a way we can incorporate an exercise
that<00:02:01.090> really<00:02:01.540> targets<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.320> using<00:02:03.070> some<00:02:03.250> key

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
that really targets it using some key

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.950 
that really targets it using some key
principles<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.090> think<00:02:04.330> there<00:02:04.510> is<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.810> like

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
principles and I think there is I like

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.230 
principles and I think there is I like
to<00:02:04.990> call<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.530> crossover<00:02:06.190> shrug<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:06.820> all

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
to call it the crossover shrug and all

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.180 
to call it the crossover shrug and all
you<00:02:07.450> need<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.630> do<00:02:07.900> it<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.500> single<00:02:08.979> dumbbell

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
you need to do it is a single dumbbell

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.700 
you need to do it is a single dumbbell
before<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.119> even<00:02:10.360> pick<00:02:10.750> up<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.050> dumbbell<00:02:11.440> what

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
before I even pick up the dumbbell what

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.830 
before I even pick up the dumbbell what
I<00:02:11.740> want<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.130> show<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.580> guys<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:13.090> how<00:02:13.300> do<00:02:13.690> we

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
I want to show to you guys is how do we

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.500 
I want to show to you guys is how do we
really<00:02:14.200> activate<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.220> upper<00:02:15.520> chest<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
really activate the upper chest the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.480 
really activate the upper chest the
first<00:02:16.870> thing<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.230> we<00:02:17.380> want<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.710> get<00:02:17.890> internal

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
first thing is we want to get internal

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.060 
first thing is we want to get internal
rotation<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.870> shoulder<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.740> I've<00:02:20.860> shown

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
rotation of the shoulder so I've shown

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.890 
rotation of the shoulder so I've shown
you<00:02:21.100> before<00:02:21.250> internal<00:02:21.970> rotation<00:02:22.270> can<00:02:22.570> happen

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
you before internal rotation can happen

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.510 
you before internal rotation can happen
when<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.080> straight<00:02:23.320> arm<00:02:23.350> or<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.220> can<00:02:24.340> happen

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
when the straight arm or it can happen

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.610 
when the straight arm or it can happen
with<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.880> bent<00:02:25.120> arm<00:02:25.300> okay<00:02:26.260> these<00:02:26.410> are<00:02:26.560> all

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
with a bent arm okay these are all

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.130 
with a bent arm okay these are all
internal<00:02:27.010> rotation<00:02:27.430> but<00:02:28.240> if<00:02:28.360> we're<00:02:28.570> even<00:02:28.930> out

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
internal rotation but if we're even out

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.250 
internal rotation but if we're even out
here<00:02:29.650> okay<00:02:30.010> I'm<00:02:30.100> extremely<00:02:30.490> rotated<00:02:31.200> when<00:02:32.200> I

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
here okay I'm extremely rotated when I

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.610 
here okay I'm extremely rotated when I
internally<00:02:33.220> rotate<00:02:33.700> okay<00:02:34.420> just<00:02:35.080> in<00:02:35.230> here<00:02:35.410> like

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
internally rotate okay just in here like

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.200 
internally rotate okay just in here like
that<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:36.190> can<00:02:37.060> see<00:02:37.470> right<00:02:38.470> here<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:39.640> area<00:02:40.060> of

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
that you can see right here this area of

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.060 
that you can see right here this area of
the<00:02:40.330> chest<00:02:40.570> actually<00:02:40.930> gets<00:02:41.530> sort<00:02:41.740> of<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:41.860> line

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
the chest actually gets sort of a line

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.250 
the chest actually gets sort of a line
going<00:02:42.580> up<00:02:42.790> these<00:02:43.030> are<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.270> colliculus<00:02:43.720> fibers

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
going up these are the colliculus fibers

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.510 
going up these are the colliculus fibers
okay<00:02:44.770> just<00:02:45.340> by<00:02:45.490> internally<00:02:46.300> rotating

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.300 

like<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:52.260> should<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:52.740> able<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:53.010> see<00:02:53.280> a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
like that you should be able to see a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.640 
like that you should be able to see a
little<00:02:53.580> bit<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.880> that<00:02:53.940> activation<00:02:54.510> up<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.560> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
little bit of that activation up to the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.210 
little bit of that activation up to the
chest

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
chest

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.120 
chest
we<00:02:56.790> know<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.270> adduction<00:02:58.230> horizontal

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
we know that adduction horizontal

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.770 
we know that adduction horizontal
adduction<00:02:59.430> which<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.850> date<00:03:00.060> taking<00:03:00.480> your<00:03:00.600> arm

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
adduction which is date taking your arm

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.510 
adduction which is date taking your arm
and<00:03:00.960> bringing<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.320> across<00:03:01.560> your<00:03:01.740> chest<00:03:02.040> that

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
and bringing it across your chest that

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.480 
and bringing it across your chest that
clearly<00:03:03.120> will<00:03:04.020> activate<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.920> chest<00:03:05.190> right

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
clearly will activate the chest right

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.270 
clearly will activate the chest right
we're<00:03:05.640> contracting<00:03:05.970> it

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.250 

which<00:03:10.790> again<00:03:10.940> side<00:03:11.450> note<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:11.720> always<00:03:12.080> say

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
which again side note I always say

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.870 
which again side note I always say
that's<00:03:12.500> why<00:03:12.650> it's<00:03:12.830> much<00:03:13.070> more<00:03:13.250> important<00:03:13.730> to

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
that's why it's much more important to

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.150 
that's why it's much more important to
do<00:03:14.210> all<00:03:14.420> of<00:03:14.450> your<00:03:14.630> pressing<00:03:15.140> with<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.710> much

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
do all of your pressing with a much

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.500 
do all of your pressing with a much
narrower<00:03:16.580> grip<00:03:16.820> than<00:03:17.030> what<00:03:17.150> people<00:03:17.270> are<00:03:17.450> used

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
narrower grip than what people are used

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.420 
narrower grip than what people are used
to<00:03:17.780> because<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:18.440> simply<00:03:18.620> don't<00:03:19.010> get<00:03:19.190> that

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
to because you simply don't get that

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.460 
to because you simply don't get that
adduction<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:20.660> know<00:03:20.750> yes<00:03:20.960> you<00:03:20.990> can<00:03:21.320> with

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
adduction you know yes you can with

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.800 
adduction you know yes you can with
dumbbells<00:03:21.920> but<00:03:22.430> with<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.940> barbell<00:03:23.360> no<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:23.720> you

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
dumbbells but with a barbell no so you

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.630 
dumbbells but with a barbell no so you
want<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:23.990> be<00:03:24.080> a<00:03:24.110> little<00:03:24.260> bit<00:03:24.440> more<00:03:24.620> narrow<00:03:24.860> so

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
want to be a little bit more narrow so

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.500 
want to be a little bit more narrow so
we<00:03:25.970> can<00:03:26.180> get<00:03:26.450> this<00:03:27.020> internal<00:03:27.680> rotation<00:03:27.740> and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
we can get this internal rotation and

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.930 
we can get this internal rotation and
this<00:03:29.510> adduction<00:03:30.020> at<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.320> same<00:03:30.530> time<00:03:30.800> we<00:03:31.760> have

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
this adduction at the same time we have

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.090 
this adduction at the same time we have
a<00:03:31.970> good<00:03:32.300> contraction<00:03:33.080> which<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.590> next<00:03:33.830> key

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
a good contraction which is the next key

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.400 
a good contraction which is the next key
point<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:35.180> have<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.720> contract<00:03:36.170> your<00:03:36.380> muscles

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
point you have to contract your muscles

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.930 
point you have to contract your muscles
when<00:03:36.890> you're<00:03:37.010> trying<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.370> get<00:03:37.460> them<00:03:37.640> to<00:03:37.670> girl

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
when you're trying to get them to girl

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.180 
when you're trying to get them to girl
guys<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.720> got<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:38.960> try<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.380> make<00:03:39.740> sure<00:03:40.010> that

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
guys you got to try to make sure that

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.220 
guys you got to try to make sure that
you're<00:03:40.340> feeling<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.910> muscle<00:03:41.510> work<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.080> if

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
you're feeling that muscle work and if

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.870 
you're feeling that muscle work and if
you<00:03:42.410> aren't<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:43.250> aren't<00:03:43.490> going<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.790> be

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
you aren't you aren't going to be

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.940 
you aren't you aren't going to be
getting<00:03:43.910> nearly<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.630> results<00:03:45.050> you<00:03:45.170> could<00:03:45.650> if

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
getting nearly the results you could if

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.860 
getting nearly the results you could if
you<00:03:46.100> focused<00:03:46.550> on<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.120> we<00:03:47.660> want

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
you focused on that so we want

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.500 
you focused on that so we want
contraction<00:03:48.560> we<00:03:48.920> want<00:03:49.160> internal<00:03:49.550> rotation<00:03:49.850> we

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
contraction we want internal rotation we

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.320 
contraction we want internal rotation we
want<00:03:50.810> horizontal<00:03:51.590> adduction<00:03:51.740> and<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:53.030> third

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
want horizontal adduction and the third

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.350 
want horizontal adduction and the third
component<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:54.440> really<00:03:54.830> help<00:03:55.190> contract<00:03:55.700> the

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
component to really help contract the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.840 
component to really help contract the
chest<00:03:56.690> if<00:03:57.260> we<00:03:57.620> have<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.070> tube<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.640> we're

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
chest if we have the tube and we're

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.240 
chest if we have the tube and we're
already<00:03:59.030> through<00:03:59.420> here<00:03:59.750> we<00:04:00.380> can<00:04:00.620> bring<00:04:00.950> this

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
already through here we can bring this

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.420 
already through here we can bring this
area<00:04:01.700> of<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.209> clavicular<00:04:02.420> portion<00:04:03.040> even<00:04:04.040> more

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
area of the clavicular portion even more

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.480 
area of the clavicular portion even more
together<00:04:05.120> by<00:04:05.840> actually<00:04:06.440> shrugging<00:04:06.860> up<00:04:07.160> at<00:04:07.340> the

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
together by actually shrugging up at the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.780 
together by actually shrugging up at the
end

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
end

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.760 
end
okay<00:04:08.360> so<00:04:08.420> we're<00:04:08.630> taking<00:04:08.780> this<00:04:09.050> this<00:04:09.470> spot<00:04:09.740> you

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
okay so we're taking this this spot you

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.140 
okay so we're taking this this spot you
can<00:04:09.980> see<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.340> right<00:04:10.459> here<00:04:10.640> between<00:04:10.730> my<00:04:10.970> two

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
can see it right here between my two

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.920 
can see it right here between my two
fingers<00:04:11.990> and<00:04:12.350> if<00:04:13.010> I<00:04:13.160> do<00:04:13.459> this<00:04:13.700> we've<00:04:14.360> shortened

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
fingers and if I do this we've shortened

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.170 
fingers and if I do this we've shortened
it<00:04:14.989> even<00:04:15.260> more<00:04:15.440> so<00:04:16.040> you<00:04:16.130> talk<00:04:16.310> about<00:04:16.549> real<00:04:16.850> peak

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
it even more so you talk about real peak

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.180 
it even more so you talk about real peak
contraction<00:04:17.630> that's<00:04:18.410> what<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.739> have<00:04:18.890> to<00:04:18.919> do

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
contraction that's what you have to do

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.800 
contraction that's what you have to do
so<00:04:19.489> how<00:04:19.640> do<00:04:19.700> we<00:04:19.790> incorporate<00:04:20.180> that<00:04:20.570> with<00:04:20.720> the

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
so how do we incorporate that with the

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.290 
so how do we incorporate that with the
dumbbell<00:04:21.169> simple<00:04:21.950> we<00:04:22.040> pick<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.340> thing<00:04:22.580> up<00:04:22.730> and

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
dumbbell simple we pick the thing up and

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.570 
dumbbell simple we pick the thing up and
we<00:04:23.450> do<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.690> same<00:04:23.870> exact<00:04:24.290> thing<00:04:24.380> now<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.340> cool

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
we do the same exact thing now the cool

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.760 
we do the same exact thing now the cool
thing<00:04:25.610> about<00:04:25.910> this<00:04:26.180> exercise<00:04:26.510> is<00:04:26.930> you<00:04:27.590> will

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
thing about this exercise is you will

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.730 
thing about this exercise is you will
see<00:04:28.040> a<00:04:28.070> difference<00:04:28.700> in<00:04:28.990> what<00:04:29.990> happens<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.530> my

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
see a difference in what happens to my

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.940 
see a difference in what happens to my
chest<00:04:31.070> not<00:04:31.220> for<00:04:31.400> even<00:04:31.640> one<00:04:32.050> Rhett<00:04:33.050> one<00:04:33.380> set<00:04:33.710> of

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
chest not for even one Rhett one set of

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.130 
chest not for even one Rhett one set of
this<00:04:34.310> all<00:04:34.970> right<00:04:35.090> so<00:04:35.360> you<00:04:35.419> see<00:04:35.510> what<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:35.960> looks

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
this all right so you see what it looks

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.010 
this all right so you see what it looks
like<00:04:36.200> now<00:04:36.560> basically<00:04:37.160> take<00:04:38.150> this<00:04:38.330> across<00:04:38.750> I'm

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
like now basically take this across I'm

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.469 
like now basically take this across I'm
going<00:04:39.140> to<00:04:39.200> turn<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:39.590> dumbbell<00:04:39.919> in<00:04:40.220> first<00:04:41.120> like

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
going to turn the dumbbell in first like

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.230 
going to turn the dumbbell in first like
this<00:04:41.720> okay<00:04:42.500> then<00:04:43.250> I'm<00:04:43.520> just<00:04:43.580> gonna<00:04:43.850> bring<00:04:44.180> it

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
this okay then I'm just gonna bring it

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.400 
this okay then I'm just gonna bring it
up<00:04:44.540> in<00:04:45.040> across<00:04:46.040> so<00:04:46.790> just<00:04:47.090> like<00:04:47.270> that<00:04:47.570> okay<00:04:48.320> I'm

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
up in across so just like that okay I'm

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.740 
up in across so just like that okay I'm
shrugging<00:04:48.860> and<00:04:49.220> I'm<00:04:49.880> bringing<00:04:50.240> it<00:04:50.360> up<00:04:50.540> and

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
shrugging and I'm bringing it up and

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.650 
shrugging and I'm bringing it up and
across<00:04:51.110> my<00:04:51.380> body<00:04:51.560> as<00:04:51.890> high<00:04:52.070> as<00:04:52.250> I<00:04:52.340> can<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.880> down

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
across my body as high as I can and down

across my body as high as I can and down
up<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:55.040> down<00:04:55.970> a<00:04:56.570> peak<00:04:57.169> squeeze<00:04:57.560> at<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.669> top

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:09.840 

just<00:05:02.510> like<00:05:02.600> that<00:05:07.660> you<00:05:08.660> can<00:05:08.720> see<00:05:09.110> at<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:09.560> top

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
just like that you can see at the top

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.090 
just like that you can see at the top
here<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:11.360> hole<00:05:11.660> upwards<00:05:12.410> portion<00:05:12.919> of<00:05:13.010> the

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
here the hole upwards portion of the

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:20.950 
here the hole upwards portion of the
chest<00:05:13.310> is<00:05:14.180> contracted

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.120 

and<00:05:21.380> that<00:05:22.840> you<00:05:23.840> can<00:05:24.020> see<00:05:24.169> you<00:05:24.259> gotta<00:05:24.440> hear<00:05:24.949> that

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
and that you can see you gotta hear that

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:38.010 
and that you can see you gotta hear that
line<00:05:26.000> upper<00:05:26.990> chest<00:05:27.289> and<00:05:31.180> just<00:05:32.180> a<00:05:32.240> couple<00:05:32.449> more

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.320 

and<00:05:39.020> put<00:05:39.229> it<00:05:39.320> down<00:05:39.470> right<00:05:39.850> there

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
and put it down right there

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.770 
and put it down right there
one<00:05:41.720> set<00:05:42.050> as<00:05:42.759> I<00:05:43.759> can<00:05:43.910> track<00:05:44.150> I<00:05:44.180> can<00:05:44.360> contract

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
one set as I can track I can contract

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.129 
one set as I can track I can contract
the<00:05:44.930> left<00:05:45.139> side<00:05:45.350> does<00:05:45.979> it<00:05:46.160> near<00:05:46.490> pop<00:05:47.479> out<00:05:47.720> as

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
the left side does it near pop out as

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.260 
the left side does it near pop out as
much<00:05:48.380> as<00:05:48.530> we<00:05:48.650> have<00:05:48.830> there<00:05:49.100> was<00:05:49.759> just<00:05:49.970> a<00:05:50.060> single

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
much as we have there was just a single

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.689 
much as we have there was just a single
set<00:05:51.190> so<00:05:52.360> point<00:05:53.360> beating<00:05:53.690> guys<00:05:54.490> you<00:05:55.490> can

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
set so point beating guys you can

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.120 
set so point beating guys you can
clearly<00:05:56.199> attack<00:05:57.199> first<00:05:57.440> of<00:05:57.620> all<00:05:57.710> make<00:05:57.889> a<00:05:57.919> whole

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
clearly attack first of all make a whole

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.100 
clearly attack first of all make a whole
chest<00:05:58.400> to<00:05:58.520> track<00:05:58.729> more<00:05:58.940> by<00:05:59.479> actually<00:05:59.900> putting

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
chest to track more by actually putting

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.710 
chest to track more by actually putting
it<00:06:00.680> in<00:06:00.949> its<00:06:01.160> position<00:06:02.120> of<00:06:02.210> peak<00:06:02.389> contraction

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
it in its position of peak contraction

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.920 
it in its position of peak contraction
but<00:06:03.380> beyond<00:06:03.680> that<00:06:04.150> because<00:06:05.150> of<00:06:05.300> the<00:06:05.419> line<00:06:05.690> of

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
but beyond that because of the line of

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.200 
but beyond that because of the line of
pull<00:06:06.199> and<00:06:06.699> incorporating<00:06:07.699> the<00:06:07.789> movements

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
pull and incorporating the movements

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.870 
pull and incorporating the movements
that<00:06:08.360> are<00:06:08.660> necessary<00:06:09.169> to<00:06:09.860> target<00:06:10.400> specific

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
that are necessary to target specific

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.939 
that are necessary to target specific
areas<00:06:11.030> of<00:06:11.240> the<00:06:11.360> chest<00:06:11.599> and<00:06:12.320> recruit<00:06:12.800> the

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:12.949 
areas of the chest and recruit the

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.010 
areas of the chest and recruit the
fibers<00:06:13.430> in<00:06:13.550> a<00:06:13.849> different<00:06:14.630> manner

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
fibers in a different manner

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.620 
fibers in a different manner
it's<00:06:15.530> very<00:06:15.830> important<00:06:16.430> to<00:06:16.610> attacked<00:06:17.270> it<00:06:17.449> from
