example but I have to say I'm 40 now and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.970 
example but I have to say I'm 40 now and
I<00:00:18.600> still<00:00:18.840> have<00:00:19.050> no<00:00:19.199> idea<00:00:19.230> what<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.949> means

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.690 

what<00:00:24.700> I<00:00:24.730> find<00:00:25.090> important<00:00:25.720> is<00:00:25.930> to<00:00:26.260> to<00:00:27.190> find<00:00:27.490> with

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
what I find important is to to find with

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.519 
what I find important is to to find with
them<00:00:27.880> a<00:00:27.910> way<00:00:28.210> to<00:00:28.240> make<00:00:28.690> a<00:00:28.720> really<00:00:29.700> modern

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
them a way to make a really modern

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.200 
them a way to make a really modern
collection<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.540> I<00:00:35.170> think<00:00:35.590> my<00:00:36.010> biggest<00:00:36.520> aim<00:00:36.910> is

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
collection so I think my biggest aim is

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.200 
collection so I think my biggest aim is
to<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:38.170> try<00:00:38.410> to<00:00:38.470> open<00:00:39.010> up<00:00:39.160> their<00:00:39.309> minds<00:00:39.580> and<00:00:39.940> to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
to to try to open up their minds and to

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.920 
to to try to open up their minds and to
try<00:00:40.960> different<00:00:41.230> things<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:43.210> see<00:00:43.420> what<00:00:43.449> works

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
try different things to see what works

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.460 
try different things to see what works
best<00:00:44.910> because<00:00:45.910> maybe<00:00:46.720> that<00:00:46.989> is<00:00:47.110> something

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
best because maybe that is something

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.040 
best because maybe that is something
what<00:00:47.680> I<00:00:47.940> experienced<00:00:48.940> with<00:00:49.210> with<00:00:49.570> some<00:00:49.780> of<00:00:49.930> the

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
what I experienced with with some of the

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.500 
what I experienced with with some of the
students<00:00:50.500> is<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.800> sometimes<00:00:51.400> they<00:00:51.640> get<00:00:51.910> too

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
students is that sometimes they get too

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.160 
students is that sometimes they get too
much<00:00:52.540> stuck<00:00:53.140> in<00:00:53.530> their<00:00:53.949> head<00:00:54.129> with<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.400> concept

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
much stuck in their head with a concept

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.960 
much stuck in their head with a concept
and<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.350> think<00:00:56.589> in<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:56.920> end<00:00:57.040> fashion<00:00:57.489> is<00:00:57.760> always

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
and I think in the end fashion is always

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.079 
and I think in the end fashion is always
about<00:00:58.390> a<00:00:58.720> 3d<00:00:59.229> product<00:01:00.100> that<00:01:00.309> is<00:01:00.489> worn<00:01:00.970> by

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
about a 3d product that is worn by

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.229 
about a 3d product that is worn by
people<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:02.949> me<00:01:03.190> it's<00:01:03.370> really<00:01:03.610> important<00:01:04.120> to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
people so to me it's really important to

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.500 
people so to me it's really important to
see<00:01:04.479> if<00:01:05.199> it<00:01:05.740> works<00:01:06.010> on<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.460> person<00:01:06.940> I<00:01:07.090> mean<00:01:07.330> it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
see if it works on the person I mean it

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.020 
see if it works on the person I mean it
can<00:01:07.690> be<00:01:07.720> a<00:01:07.840> great<00:01:08.140> concept<00:01:08.740> but<00:01:08.920> in<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.670> end<00:01:09.820> as

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
can be a great concept but in the end as

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.750 
can be a great concept but in the end as
a<00:01:10.060> fashion<00:01:10.479> designer

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
