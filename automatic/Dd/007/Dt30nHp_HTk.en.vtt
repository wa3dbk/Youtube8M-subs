00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.030
 Yes I will guide the shop towards Now say the appearance 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.360
 It feels like 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:24.330
 The parking lot is almost in front of you 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:28.170
 We also have a hospital to pick up about 15 cars and we also rent a parking lot for the hospital 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.710
 So in total it will be around 50 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.520
 Yes then let's go inside 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.800
 First of all, let's say the wind room 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:45.780
 There is a little space, but basically I don't use much here 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.780
 And then enter the store 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:54.570
 And first of all you have space to the right 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.560
 There is a space of about 30 people 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.270
 I often play bands here 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.810
 And 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.170
 There is a bar counter next to this 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.170
 And 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.520
 The audience is 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.799
 Here as much as about 30 people 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.799
 It is a space to guide you 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.240
 Of this fireplace 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.400
 No more right 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.510
 Traveling multiple feelings 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.920
 Well 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.920
 A private space 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.870
 We 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.190
 And a little on the stairs 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:41.240
 Bulls Therefore we will when the edge 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:46.960
 This is less than 20 eyes 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:51.110
 The projector has a space for you to 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:56.400
 It looks like it is projected to this wall side 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:02:01.650
 The projector is installed here on the opposite side 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:06.680
 This is the space of the bride and groom for the second party of the wedding etc. 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:09.660
 Although the groom God I am sitting in this seat 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.270
 The scenery seen from here is 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.670
 Riding the bride and groom 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.670
 It looks like this in the eyes 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.380
 Finish and bake 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.740
 In the vertical line here 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.740
 Say your guide to the about 80 people 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:39.599
 And there is room after another one 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:47.900
 This person is I have become a little lounge feeling Well yeah but 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:50.769
 We will guide about 20 people if we move sofa seat for a while from about 123 people 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.769
 It is in the sea 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:59.650
 It is here 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.650
 There are shops all the way starting from here 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.730
 While looking at the fusion 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.110
 I said this 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.310

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.910
 There is cooking at this shop 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.910
 to line up 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:22.940
 And the customers take food and live on the bar counter here for heavy things 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.360
 Feeling that you come to this in exchange 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.360
 There is 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.150
 What do you think 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.290
 Well from here when leaving 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.190

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.319

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.760
