you're going to thread your elastic

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:55.889 
you're going to thread your elastic
through<00:01:54.969> your<00:01:55.090> scrunchie<00:01:55.360> which<00:01:55.659> is<00:01:55.780> now

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
through your scrunchie which is now

right side out so you just start

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.190 
right side out so you just start
threading<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.060> through<00:01:58.179> there<00:01:58.659> we'll

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
threading that through there we'll

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.569 
threading that through there we'll
scrunch<00:01:59.469> up<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.739> material<00:02:00.099> as<00:02:00.159> you<00:02:00.280> go<00:02:00.429> this

scrunch up the material as you go this

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:01.889 
scrunch up the material as you go this
is<00:02:00.700> where<00:02:00.849> the<00:02:00.909> name<00:02:01.030> of<00:02:01.149> scrunchie<00:02:01.509> comes<00:02:01.719> in

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
is where the name of scrunchie comes in

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.179 
is where the name of scrunchie comes in
you<00:02:02.289> want<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.469> make<00:02:02.560> sure<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:02.739> you<00:02:02.829> hold<00:02:02.950> onto

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.330 
shimmy the knot in the elastic around so
the<00:02:37.569> knot<00:02:37.720> ends<00:02:37.989> up<00:02:38.109> somewhere<00:02:38.380> deeper<00:02:38.919> inside

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
the knot ends up somewhere deeper inside

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.819 
the knot ends up somewhere deeper inside
the<00:02:39.489> scrunchie<00:02:39.970> then<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.660> two<00:02:40.810> open<00:02:41.109> ends<00:02:41.319> end

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
the scrunchie then the two open ends end

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.670 
the scrunchie then the two open ends end
up<00:02:42.579> on<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:43.269> plain<00:02:43.540> piece<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.870> elastic<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:47.470> like

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
up on a plain piece of elastic just like

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.430 
up on a plain piece of elastic just like
that<00:02:48.599> so<00:02:49.599> then<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.750> want<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.930> take<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.139> open

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
that so then you want to take the open

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.390 
that so then you want to take the open
ends<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.739> your<00:02:50.919> scrunchie

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
ends of your scrunchie

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.319 
ends of your scrunchie
and<00:02:51.669> fold<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.150> edges<00:02:52.329> under<00:02:53.880> do<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.150> both

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
and fold the edges under do that to both

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.220 
and fold the edges under do that to both
sides<00:02:57.419> just<00:02:58.419> about<00:02:58.599> a<00:02:58.660> quarter<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:59.019> an<00:02:59.079> inch

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
sides just about a quarter of an inch

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.839 
sides just about a quarter of an inch
under<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.340> then<00:03:00.430> you're<00:03:00.519> just<00:03:00.579> going<00:03:00.819> to

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
under and then you're just going to

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.170 
under and then you're just going to
slide<00:03:01.209> one<00:03:01.810> end<00:03:02.819> right<00:03:03.819> inside<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:07.000> other

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
slide one end right inside the other

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.920 
slide one end right inside the other
just<00:03:07.629> like<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:09.269> then<00:03:10.269> you<00:03:10.389> go<00:03:10.510> back<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
just like that then you go back to the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.629 
just like that then you go back to the
sewing<00:03:11.079> machine<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.739> just<00:03:11.799> sew<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.190> straight

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
sewing machine and just sew a straight

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.789 
sewing machine and just sew a straight
line<00:03:12.819> of<00:03:12.970> stitches<00:03:13.329> about<00:03:13.930> 1/8<00:03:14.230> from<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.650> edge

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
line of stitches about 1/8 from the edge

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.490 
line of stitches about 1/8 from the edge
of<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:15.250> outside<00:03:15.910> loop<00:03:16.209> just<00:03:16.810> sew<00:03:17.109> a<00:03:17.139> straight

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
of the outside loop just sew a straight

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:36.220 
of the outside loop just sew a straight
edge<00:03:17.709> right<00:03:18.100> down<00:03:18.340> there

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.660 

until<00:03:37.230> then<00:03:37.319> of<00:03:37.409> course<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:37.920> tie<00:03:38.220> off<00:03:38.250> both

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
until then of course just tie off both

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.280 
until then of course just tie off both
edges<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:42.750> bury<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.500> extra<00:03:43.920> threads<00:03:45.290> inside

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
edges and bury the extra threads inside

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.089 
edges and bury the extra threads inside
of<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.980> scrunchie<00:03:48.170> just<00:03:49.170> run<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.439> tails

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:59.059 

through<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.189> eye<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.819> needle<00:03:53.849> and<00:03:58.069> then

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
through the eye of the needle and then

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.270 
through the eye of the needle and then
just<00:03:59.250> pull<00:03:59.430> them<00:03:59.579> right<00:03:59.609> inside<00:04:01.220> then<00:04:02.220> you

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
just pull them right inside then you

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.690 
just pull them right inside then you
just<00:04:02.459> cut<00:04:02.609> off<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.879> excess<00:04:03.180> tail<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:07.700> then

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
just cut off the excess tail and then

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.979 
just cut off the excess tail and then
just<00:04:08.879> adjust<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.269> scrunchie<00:04:09.659> so<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:09.870> it's

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
just adjust the scrunchie so that it's

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.250 
just adjust the scrunchie so that it's
even<00:04:10.319> all<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.709> way<00:04:10.739> around
