allows the thermostat to get your local

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.169 
allows the thermostat to get your local
weather<00:01:29.009> from<00:01:29.249> the<00:01:29.280> internet<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:29.939> it's

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
weather from the internet so that it's

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.639 
weather from the internet so that it's
automatic<00:01:30.600> adjustments<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.289> shifted<00:01:31.439> to

automatic adjustments can be shifted to
accommodate<00:01:32.189> daily<00:01:32.700> changes<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.240> weather

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
accommodate daily changes in the weather

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.809 
accommodate daily changes in the weather
so<00:01:34.469> let's<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.679> a<00:01:34.770> look<00:01:34.829> at<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.130> nest<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.609> its

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
so let's have a look at the nest and its

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.399 
so let's have a look at the nest and its
features<00:01:35.969> and<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.569> if<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:36.899> payoff<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
features and see if they can payoff and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.359 
features and see if they can payoff and
heating<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:37.770> cooling<00:01:37.890> your<00:01:38.039> home<00:01:38.159> more

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
heating and cooling your home more

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.230 
heating and cooling your home more
efficiently

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.940 

so<00:01:45.240> before<00:01:45.540> purchasing<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> nest<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.530> wise<00:01:46.740> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
so before purchasing a nest it's wise to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.380 
so before purchasing a nest it's wise to
visit<00:01:47.160> the<00:01:47.250> next<00:01:47.370> website<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.090> walk<00:01:48.210> through

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
visit the next website and walk through

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.700 
visit the next website and walk through
the<00:01:48.480> compatibility<00:01:49.020> check<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.530> make<00:01:49.650> sure

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the compatibility check to make sure

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.170 
the compatibility check to make sure
that<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.160> thermostat<00:01:50.640> will<00:01:50.790> work<00:01:50.910> with<00:01:51.090> your

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
that the thermostat will work with your
