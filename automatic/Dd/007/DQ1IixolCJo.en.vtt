 I call isabel and today we'll find out together 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.860
 because the line is hyaluronic acid and 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.900
 so special the hyaluronic acid line 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.210
 is composed of products for the face and 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.070
 for the body 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.500
 today we will talk about the 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.739

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.000
 to get more benefits from 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.760
 hyaluronic acid treatment 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.650
 we start the treatment by shaking off the 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.780
 eye and lip contour with 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.390

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.800
 hyaluronic and disk oil and from 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.960
 moment that the eye contour is 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.250
 particularly sensitive and delicate 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.440
 we take a cotton pad that 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.850
 let's wet with water and that 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.329
 let's squeeze the falcon vigorously 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.579
 of biphasic makeup remover and we apply the 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:10.729
 then produced directly on our own 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:13.340
 wet cotton pad 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.799
 we apply the cotton on the contour that 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.200
 without bewitching leaving him posing for 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.479
 about ten seconds and after that 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.319
 we carry out a movement that starts 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.109
 from top to bottom and then from below 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:29.569
 upwards if there were residues 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.819

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:34.700
 cotton pad and remove the 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.100
