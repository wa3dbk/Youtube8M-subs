00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.189
 it seems the same rabbit 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.110
 look is not the same piti that is 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.540
 our actor really is this one here 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.189
 it's a rabbit bellier if you remember the 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.610
 videos that we recorded about the races 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.790
 of rabbit bunnies small rabbit and 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.070
 ears up with the young leader a 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.980
 little bit bigger and the ears towards 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.110
 down fallen ears but this video 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.989
 really is not going to talk about the races 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.449
 in this video we want to comment on 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.430
 feeding the rabbits the new 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.370
 range of natural feed the goonies 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.800
 peak is a range that is natural and that 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.630
 offers new what new offers is that 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.460
 we have really included ingredients 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.079
 that they consume directly in the 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.020
 nature and we have tried 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.240
 recreate a diet that is as natural 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.700
 possible and as faithful as possible to what 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.660
 they would really be consuming in 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.940
 your wildlife 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.750
 this includes a lot of plants 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.420
 is - from multifloral prairie a lot of 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.520
 dry grass hay from a lot of 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.830
 different plants we also include 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.540
 various stems like that of 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.080
 equine towards the milk thistle 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.760
 also carries some vegetables as 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.860
 you can find for example the 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.720
 carrot also dehydrated all this 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.330
 mixed and balanced so that the 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.060
 set so be perfect for the 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.160
 nutrition of the adult rabbit but os 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.950
 I would say that more important even of what 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.050
 what are we going to talk about that is talking 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.140
 of what it does not take and here you have it 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.960
 right next to it does not have extruded this 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.480
 we have deleted it deleted us from the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.560
 food that is the extruded then 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.409
 the extruded is food 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.790
 composed mainly of cereal that 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.990
 what is done is to undergo a 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.610
 strong heat treatment and exploits 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.220
 how we do popcorn in 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.739
 house and we keep it in the microwave and when 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.150
 they heat explode that we have a 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:23.380
 product that weighs little that is is very very 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.690
 let's say little dense and really what 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.050
 produces is that we skip a step in 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.519
 the digestion this heat treatment 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.170
 denatures cereal properties 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.540
 making it more easily 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.700
 digestible and that's very good in person 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.440
 and relatively good also for the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.510
 feeding of monogastric animals 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.280
 how can carnivores be of course 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.980
 How can the dog and the cat be? 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.519
 for herbivores and animals that 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.130
 are gastric poly is not good 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.900
 extrusion also makes losing some of 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.580
 the most important vitamins you have 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.769
 the food of course the vitamin c 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.599
 although in this case the rabbits are 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.519
 able to manufacture it by themselves 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.250
 but not only vitamin c we lose 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.670
 vitamins we lose vitamin k we lose 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.950
 vitamin b1 and also folic acid 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.720
 But what we do we can get 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.739
 in the diet is what you see here 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.049
 we can put a lot of fresh vegetables the 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.600
 fresh vegetables always with care and with 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.310
 moderation because when they are not 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.920
 accustomed all abrupt changes 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.260
 of food in rabbit can be 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.079
 harmful and we have to put a lot 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.120
 hay plus the hay the ipyc offers a 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.389
 great variety a variety of hay 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.190
 available from a bunch of plants 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.470
 different and how important the hay is 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.510
 vary what plants bring a thing 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.609
 while other plants contribute not to you 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.440
 what you can do is rotate some and 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.590
 others and fresh vegetables whatever 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.569
 green leaf because the more the better and I've 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.830
 wanted to bring here also some 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.600
 carrots 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.310
 everyone knows that rabbits 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.230
 they love carrots but what 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.410
 sure you do not know is that the most 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.360
 important to eat are the stems is 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.030
 much more important for a rabbit 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.130
 eat the stem that eat your own 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.530
 tuber feeds a lot more the 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.930
 stalk that the tuber always in 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.030
 light rabbits and we have 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.299
 including the two dehydrated too 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.780
 in the new naturalis range and I will pass 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.130
 to describe a little the picts here the 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.200
 you can see 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.630
 the fiber I will not insist more is the 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.880
 main component you also have a 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.340
 optimal balance of carbohydrates 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.220
 refer only to include the 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.080
 minimum cereal possible but yes it is 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.630
 true that to some extent it is also 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.450
 necessary for your diet the calcium 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.120
 phosphorus by which we try to compensate 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.700
 the vegetables included so that 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.050
 have little calcium against what of 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.640
 what almost everyone thinks that the 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.500
 calcium is beneficial and the more the better 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.160
 for rabbits, not rabbits have 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.200
 a very sophisticated absorption system 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.090
 of calcium and diets especially in 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.480
 adults have to be poor in calcium 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.120
 and finally the loncho is a peak that 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.010
 it describes us that we have made the feed 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.640
 with what the rabbit likes with what 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.640
 found in nature
