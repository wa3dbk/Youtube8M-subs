00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.219
 Look at my brother how long you've been standing there and swimming with the current 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.470
 Making your life what you frame with your mind And that's often 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.759
 Striking every moment the unconscious corridors Like a big powerful mallet 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.450
 Your body the recent is clouded and the sight in the glasses of your lenses 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.230
 But it's not enough and you want to keep trying Taking control of your life 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.520
 You do not want to listen to anyone, you just want to walk 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.680
 And leave aside all that will serve you And even if they say what they say 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.600
 That you do not want to take, you will not care. The thought that a mother cries every moment 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.710
 for the one who since he was in his womb put joy 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.050
 in his face And worrying have already turned his days and 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.300
 your nights and you with giant steps you move very distant 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.120
 There is an opportunity! so that your life can change 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.120
 There is an opportunity! Time is money, do not delay anymore. There is an opportunity! 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.950
 So you can reflect There is an opportunity! 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.640
 The final judgment is approaching! 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.280
 Without looking back you go to the street without giving details of place and direction 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.790
 The despapaye begins The days run as if they were seconds 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.530
 And you hungry you want to eat everything in this world 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.590
 As you dumbo you want to fly And glide through the air thinking that everything 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.700
 this reality and with humility Today I come to talk to you and tell you in this 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.530
 track You only have one chance left 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.330
 Turn and turn around and finish with this set that is well placed 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.700
 By your head and it is not a survey, but it costs you nothing 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.570
 Accept this proposal without getting hurt hurt and aggrieved 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.240
 And with such a terrible end to which you are destined 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.689
 And for a moment leaving aside vanity and arrogance 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.549
 That has been part of your ignorance But let's not go into details the time passes 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.470
 and with abundance, I want to present to you the one who looks at you from heaven 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.069
 with great love And with a lot of importance 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.099
 His name is Jesus Christ and his arms are ready and extended 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.299
 Wait for you to regain your senses And find the way through their beats 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.879
 There is an opportunity! so that your life can change 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.349
 There is an opportunity! time is gold do not take it anymore 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.569
 There is an opportunity! so you can reflect 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.859
 There is an opportunity! The final judgment is approaching! 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.010
 Because it is written: For the time of judgment has come, 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.669
 And it must begin with the house of God; And if the trial begins with us, 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:57.489
 What terrible fate awaits those who never obeyed the Good News of God? 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.849
 Furthermore, "If the just man is barely saved, what will become of sinners who live without God?
