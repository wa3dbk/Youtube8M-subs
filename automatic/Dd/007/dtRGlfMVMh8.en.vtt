00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
in powerful enough motor I thought I

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.010

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
might have to do a gear reducer but I'm

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.840

thread<00:02:15.320> so<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:15.860> had<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.490> use<00:02:16.610> my<00:02:16.790> own<00:02:16.970> boat<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.660> I

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
thread so I had to use my own boat and I

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.640 
thread so I had to use my own boat and I
needed<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.190> actually<00:02:19.490> make<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:19.970> bushing<00:02:20.650> that

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
needed to actually make a bushing that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.070 
needed to actually make a bushing that
would<00:02:21.800> fit<00:02:22.070> there<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.760> there's<00:02:23.600> already<00:02:23.840> a

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
would fit there the there's already a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.200 
would fit there the there's already a
bushing<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.560> goes<00:02:24.830> underneath<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:25.760> I

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
bushing that goes underneath this and I

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.820 
bushing that goes underneath this and I
needed<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.510> make<00:02:26.630> another<00:02:26.960> bushing<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.500> that

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
needed to make another bushing so that

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
needed to make another bushing so that
everything<00:02:28.310> would<00:02:28.400> remain<00:02:28.970> centered<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:29.840> a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
everything would remain centered so a

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.910 
everything would remain centered so a
little<00:02:32.170> adaptation<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.200> might<00:02:33.440> not<00:02:33.590> have<00:02:33.770> to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
little adaptation you might not have to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.780 
little adaptation you might not have to
do<00:02:34.070> that<00:02:34.280> if<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.790> if<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.570> hole<00:02:35.870> in<00:02:36.200> your<00:02:36.790> hand

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
do that if the if the hole in your hand

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.280 
do that if the if the hole in your hand
wheel<00:02:38.030> shaft<00:02:38.360> is<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:39.590> metric<00:02:39.980> thread<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.810> what<00:02:42.260> I

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
wheel shaft is a metric thread so what I

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.420 
wheel shaft is a metric thread so what I
did<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.710> they<00:02:43.400> simply<00:02:44.210> you'll<00:02:44.540> see<00:02:45.020> this<00:02:45.430> it's

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
did is they simply you'll see this it's

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.560 
did is they simply you'll see this it's
resting<00:02:47.030> against<00:02:47.720> my<00:02:48.400> thread<00:02:49.400> winder<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:50.420> in

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
resting against my thread winder so in

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.020 
resting against my thread winder so in
this<00:02:50.690> motor<00:02:50.960> spinning<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:52.040> remained

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
this motor spinning this remained

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.570 
this motor spinning this remained
stationary<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:54.620> motor<00:02:54.800> only<00:02:54.980> spins<00:02:55.400> one

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
stationary the motor only spins one

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.130 
stationary the motor only spins one
direction<00:02:56.090> so<00:02:56.120> that's<00:02:56.630> all<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:56.930> have<00:02:57.020> to

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
direction so that's all you have to

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.090 
direction so that's all you have to
worry<00:02:57.170> about<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:57.650> making<00:02:57.860> sure<00:02:58.070> that

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
worry about is making sure that

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.960 
worry about is making sure that
stationary<00:03:00.280> will<00:03:01.280> go<00:03:01.400> through<00:03:01.640> some<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:01.850> the

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
stationary will go through some of the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.180 
stationary will go through some of the
nice<00:03:02.120> things<00:03:02.450> about<00:03:02.570> this<00:03:03.020> one<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.130> things

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
nice things about this one of the things

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.150 
nice things about this one of the things
that<00:03:04.490> they<00:03:04.580> don't<00:03:04.730> even<00:03:05.000> mention<00:03:05.180> on<00:03:05.480> eBay<00:03:05.870> is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
that they don't even mention on eBay is

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.570 
that they don't even mention on eBay is
that<00:03:07.160> this<00:03:07.310> has<00:03:07.550> a<00:03:07.580> variable<00:03:08.570> speed<00:03:08.980> start<00:03:09.980> now

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
that this has a variable speed start now

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.600 
that this has a variable speed start now
I<00:03:10.640> have<00:03:10.910> this<00:03:11.060> machine<00:03:11.900> set<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:13.430> lowest

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
I have this machine set to the lowest

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.400 
I have this machine set to the lowest
speed<00:03:14.030> right<00:03:14.360> now<00:03:14.390> I'm<00:03:14.870> going<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.080> take<00:03:15.260> my

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
speed right now I'm going to take my

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.380 
speed right now I'm going to take my
thread<00:03:15.709> out<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:16.940> can<00:03:17.180> run<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.510> for<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.900> I

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
thread out so I can run it for you I

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.150 
thread out so I can run it for you I
have<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.510> set<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:21.100> about<00:03:22.100> 100<00:03:23.170> rpms<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.530> have<00:03:24.980> not

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
have it set to about 100 rpms I have not

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.120 
have it set to about 100 rpms I have not
even<00:03:25.370> changed<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.650> I'll<00:03:27.650> show<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.920> the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
even changed the I'll show you the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.729 
even changed the I'll show you the
pulley<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:28.459> comes<00:03:28.790> on<00:03:28.970> this<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:30.230> does<00:03:30.470> have<00:03:30.680> a

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
pulley that comes on this it does have a

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.130 
pulley that comes on this it does have a
pulley<00:03:31.310> guard<00:03:31.700> which<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.150> don't<00:03:32.209> have<00:03:32.390> mounted

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
pulley guard which I don't have mounted

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.080 
pulley guard which I don't have mounted
to<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.410> right<00:03:33.830> now<00:03:34.010> but<00:03:34.580> it's<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.820> standard

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
to it right now but it's a standard

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.440 
to it right now but it's a standard
pulley<00:03:35.630> I<00:03:35.750> believe<00:03:36.020> it's<00:03:36.200> 80<00:03:36.380> millimeter<00:03:36.950> and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
pulley I believe it's 80 millimeter and

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.880 
pulley I believe it's 80 millimeter and
I<00:03:38.590> was<00:03:39.590> able<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.920> use<00:03:40.130> my<00:03:40.540> belt<00:03:41.650> didn't<00:03:42.650> have<00:03:42.770> to

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
I was able to use my belt didn't have to

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.090 
I was able to use my belt didn't have to
get<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.100> new<00:03:43.280> belt<00:03:43.520> or<00:03:43.700> anything<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:45.830> slow

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
get a new belt or anything and the slow

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.270 
get a new belt or anything and the slow
start<00:03:46.489> what<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:46.910> does<00:03:47.239> is<00:03:47.830> it<00:03:48.830> runs<00:03:49.100> the

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
start what that does is it runs the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.580 
start what that does is it runs the
Machine<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:50.000> can<00:03:50.030> even<00:03:50.600> program<00:03:50.810> it<00:03:51.140> from<00:03:51.350> I

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
Machine you can even program it from I

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.460 
Machine you can even program it from I
think<00:03:51.920> 0<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.370> 9<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:53.060> it'll<00:03:53.750> run<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.080> at<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.290> low

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
think 0 to 9 and it'll run it at a low

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.229 
think 0 to 9 and it'll run it at a low
speed<00:03:54.500> for<00:03:55.100> a<00:03:55.130> few<00:03:55.190> seconds<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:55.880> then<00:03:56.000> go<00:03:56.180> to

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
speed for a few seconds and then go to

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.240 
speed for a few seconds and then go to
the<00:03:56.390> higher<00:03:56.570> speed<00:03:57.020> which<00:03:57.260> I<00:03:57.530> think<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.100> runs

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
the higher speed which I think it runs

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.310 
the higher speed which I think it runs
it<00:03:58.459> at<00:03:58.580> about<00:03:58.760> half<00:03:59.000> speed<00:03:59.360> and<00:03:59.660> then<00:03:59.840> doubles

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
it at about half speed and then doubles

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.780 
it at about half speed and then doubles
so<00:04:00.800> here's<00:04:00.980> how<00:04:01.130> here's<00:04:01.370> how<00:04:01.550> it<00:04:01.610> goes

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
so here's how here's how it goes

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.970 
so here's how here's how it goes
remember<00:04:02.120> I<00:04:02.180> have<00:04:02.330> this<00:04:02.480> set<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:02.750> slow

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.550 

see<00:04:07.790> how<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:08.060> gently<00:04:08.390> ramps<00:04:08.840> up<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:11.410> on<00:04:12.410> the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
see how it gently ramps up and on the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.490 
see how it gently ramps up and on the
display<00:04:13.010> on<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.310> motor<00:04:13.930> you<00:04:14.930> can<00:04:15.110> see<00:04:15.319> that

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
display on the motor you can see that

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.400 
display on the motor you can see that
it's<00:04:15.620> starting<00:04:16.100> out<00:04:16.250> at<00:04:16.609> 1<00:04:17.180> which<00:04:17.480> is<00:04:17.630> 100<00:04:18.200> and

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
it's starting out at 1 which is 100 and

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.350 
it's starting out at 1 which is 100 and
then<00:04:19.010> goes<00:04:19.910> 200<00:04:20.329> rpm<00:04:21.370> 200<00:04:22.370> rpm<00:04:22.520> seems<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.240> be

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
then goes 200 rpm 200 rpm seems to be

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.940 
then goes 200 rpm 200 rpm seems to be
the<00:04:23.479> lowest<00:04:23.660> setting<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.290> think<00:04:24.320> that<00:04:24.680> I<00:04:24.710> can

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
the lowest setting I think that I can

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.790 
the lowest setting I think that I can
physically<00:04:25.430> set<00:04:25.669> this<00:04:25.850> to<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:27.440> will<00:04:27.620> go

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
physically set this to and it will go

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.700 
physically set this to and it will go
this<00:04:28.100> motor<00:04:28.400> will<00:04:28.639> go<00:04:28.760> all<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.090> way<00:04:29.120> up<00:04:29.419> to

this motor will go all the way up to

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.879 
this motor will go all the way up to

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
4,500 rpms even without a gear reducer I

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.370 
4,500 rpms even without a gear reducer I
found<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.400> this<00:04:34.580> has<00:04:34.820> plenty<00:04:35.510> of<00:04:35.690> punching

like I am heavy heavy canvas leather or

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.430 
like I am heavy heavy canvas leather or
something<00:06:30.240> and<00:06:30.540> you<00:06:30.600> really<00:06:30.630> need<00:06:31.080> to<00:06:31.110> slow

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
something and you really need to slow

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.610 
something and you really need to slow
your<00:06:31.650> machine<00:06:31.980> way<00:06:32.250> way<00:06:32.520> down<00:06:32.820> without

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
your machine way way down without

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.740 
your machine way way down without
spending<00:06:34.620> another<00:06:34.920> $200<00:06:35.790> on<00:06:35.910> a<00:06:35.970> gear<00:06:36.240> reducer

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
spending another $200 on a gear reducer

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.840 
spending another $200 on a gear reducer
I<00:06:36.960> really<00:06:37.950> think<00:06:38.160> this<00:06:38.280> is<00:06:38.310> going<00:06:38.490> to<00:06:38.580> do<00:06:38.730> it

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
I really think this is going to do it

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.600 
I really think this is going to do it
for<00:06:39.090> you<00:06:39.210> and<00:06:39.530> I'm<00:06:40.530> thinking<00:06:41.160> just<00:06:41.190> for<00:06:41.550> the

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
for you and I'm thinking just for the

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.970 
for you and I'm thinking just for the
heck<00:06:41.790> of<00:06:41.820> it<00:06:42.000> of<00:06:42.150> buying<00:06:42.750> a<00:06:42.990> like<00:06:43.350> a<00:06:43.380> 1<00:06:43.620> and<00:06:43.800> 3

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:43.980 
heck of it of buying a like a 1 and 3

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.890 
heck of it of buying a like a 1 and 3
quarter<00:06:44.370> or<00:06:44.490> 2<00:06:44.700> inch<00:06:44.730> pulley<00:06:45.210> to<00:06:45.450> put<00:06:45.660> on<00:06:45.750> the

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
quarter or 2 inch pulley to put on the

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.980 
quarter or 2 inch pulley to put on the
motor<00:06:46.110> and<00:06:46.440> seeing<00:06:47.280> how<00:06:48.030> slow<00:06:48.450> this<00:06:48.660> up<00:06:48.840> will

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
motor and seeing how slow this up will

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.630 
motor and seeing how slow this up will
actually<00:06:49.140> go<00:06:49.560> I<00:06:49.590> think<00:06:49.740> it<00:06:50.010> will<00:06:50.100> I<00:06:50.310> think<00:06:50.370> it

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640 
actually go I think it will I think it

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.330 
actually go I think it will I think it
will<00:06:50.730> take<00:06:51.000> it<00:06:51.120> down<00:06:51.150> to<00:06:51.450> a<00:06:51.510> crawl<00:06:52.130> not<00:06:53.130> that<00:06:53.310> I

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
will take it down to a crawl not that I

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.250 
will take it down to a crawl not that I
need<00:06:53.580> it<00:06:53.610> but<00:06:53.880> that<00:06:54.120> you<00:06:54.210> know<00:06:54.300> pulley<00:06:54.600> 6<00:06:54.960> bucks

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.260 
need it but that you know pulley 6 bucks

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.290 
need it but that you know pulley 6 bucks
so<00:06:56.450> have<00:06:57.450> at<00:06:57.720> it<00:06:57.750> I<00:06:58.230> wish<00:06:58.590> you<00:06:58.770> luck<00:06:58.980> and<00:06:59.300> again

so have at it I wish you luck and again
the<00:07:00.810> great<00:07:01.050> thing<00:07:01.260> about<00:07:01.290> it<00:07:01.680> is<00:07:01.800> you<00:07:02.100> can

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
the great thing about it is you can

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.280 
the great thing about it is you can
maintain<00:07:02.490> full<00:07:03.030> speed<00:07:03.390> I<00:07:03.720> have<00:07:04.020> another

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
maintain full speed I have another

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.010 
maintain full speed I have another
machine<00:07:04.500> with<00:07:04.860> a<00:07:04.890> gear<00:07:05.160> reducer<00:07:05.670> and<00:07:06.020> you

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
machine with a gear reducer and you

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.750 
machine with a gear reducer and you
never<00:07:07.230> get<00:07:07.530> top<00:07:07.800> speed<00:07:08.160> of<00:07:08.340> course<00:07:08.550> with

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760 
never get top speed of course with

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.390 
never get top speed of course with
having<00:07:09.030> a<00:07:09.090> gear<00:07:09.300> reducer<00:07:09.720> on<00:07:09.870> the<00:07:09.990> machine

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
having a gear reducer on the machine

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.280 
having a gear reducer on the machine
this<00:07:11.400> I<00:07:11.700> can<00:07:12.030> just<00:07:12.210> reprogram<00:07:12.540> the<00:07:12.900> motor<00:07:13.110> it

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
this I can just reprogram the motor it

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.930 
this I can just reprogram the motor it
could<00:07:13.440> at<00:07:13.680> any<00:07:13.710> time<00:07:14.160> it<00:07:14.340> could<00:07:14.460> go<00:07:14.580> up<00:07:14.610> to<00:07:14.790> its

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
could at any time it could go up to its

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.680 
could at any time it could go up to its
top<00:07:15.120> speed<00:07:16.760> actually<00:07:17.760> which<00:07:17.970> is<00:07:18.120> faster<00:07:18.570> than

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690 
top speed actually which is faster than

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.550 
top speed actually which is faster than
this<00:07:19.230> machine's<00:07:19.650> rated<00:07:20.040> is<00:07:20.190> so<00:07:20.370> it<00:07:20.550> so<00:07:21.560> good

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
this machine's rated is so it so good

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.170 
this machine's rated is so it so good
luck<00:07:22.770> if<00:07:22.950> you<00:07:23.040> have<00:07:23.130> any<00:07:23.280> questions<00:07:23.700> leave<00:07:24.120> a
