with one hand the keyboard actually

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.649 
with one hand the keyboard actually
shrinks<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.350> now<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.950> keyboard<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:15.600> the

shrinks so now the keyboard is on the
left<00:01:16.470> hand<00:01:16.650> side<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.220> could<00:01:17.759> send<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
left hand side I could send it to the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.179 
right hand side if I want to hold it and
type<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.140> still<00:01:23.100> get

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
type in here like this you still get

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.789 
type in here like this you still get
that<00:01:23.220> top<00:01:23.580> row<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.850> keys<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:25.380> moves<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> up

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
that top row of keys and it moves it up

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.289 
that top row of keys and it moves it up
a<00:01:25.920> little<00:01:26.100> bit<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.790> don't<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> reach

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
a little bit so you don't have to reach

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.580 
a little bit so you don't have to reach
quite<00:01:27.750> as<00:01:27.869> low<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.530> hit<00:01:28.740> those<00:01:29.009> bottom<00:01:29.790> options

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
quite as low to hit those bottom options

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.210 
quite as low to hit those bottom options
now<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.400> want<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> make<00:01:32.729> all<00:01:33.079> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
now if I want to make all the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.890 
now if I want to make all the
interactions<00:01:35.220> smaller<00:01:35.579> once<00:01:36.540> I've<00:01:36.689> turned

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
interactions smaller once I've turned

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.520 
interactions smaller once I've turned
that<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.409> swipe<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.490> back<00:01:39.270> real<00:01:40.259> fast

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
that on I swipe in and back real fast

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.240 
that on I swipe in and back real fast
and<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.189> now<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.810> much<00:01:43.049> smaller<00:01:43.619> window

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and so now this is a much smaller window

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.399 
and so now this is a much smaller window
I<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.970> still<00:01:45.149> access<00:01:45.329> my<00:01:45.659> notifications

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
I can still access my notifications

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.889 
I can still access my notifications
basically<00:01:46.890> use<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.250> entire<00:01:47.520> phone<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.720> can

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
basically use the entire phone but I can

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.130 
basically use the entire phone but I can
