00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
so I could definitely see completed is

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.640 
so I could definitely see completed is
cutting<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:38.100> two<00:01:38.850> more<00:01:39.090> either<00:01:39.650> fencing

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
cutting it for two more either fencing

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.670 
cutting it for two more either fencing
aces<00:01:40.979> or<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.700> could<00:01:41.850> go<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.320> lion

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
aces or you could go for the the lion

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.149 
aces or you could go for the the lion
the<00:01:43.950> fleece<00:01:44.189> main<00:01:44.430> lion<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.920> would<00:01:50.130> be

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the fleece main lion and that would be

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.569 
the fleece main lion and that would be
my<00:01:50.520> probably<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:54.619> suggestion<00:01:55.619> because<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.490> is

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
my probably my suggestion because it is

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.620 
my probably my suggestion because it is
something<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.710> they<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.759> monstrous<00:02:00.390> as

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
something that they can get monstrous as

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.980 
something that they can get monstrous as
a<00:02:01.100> 44<00:02:02.100> indestructible<00:02:02.490> hexproof<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.420> then

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
a 44 indestructible hexproof and then

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.959 
a 44 indestructible hexproof and then
you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.229> throw<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.619> even<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:05.369> celestial<00:02:05.729> arm

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
you can throw like even a celestial arm

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.429 
you can throw like even a celestial arm
unflinching<00:02:06.479> courage<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.229> might<00:02:07.350> be

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
unflinching courage and it might be

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.719 
unflinching courage and it might be
something<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.770> want<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.069> put<00:02:08.220> actually<00:02:08.610> in

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
something you want to put actually in

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.600 
something you want to put actually in
the<00:02:08.819> sideboard<00:02:09.470> instead<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.190> maybe<00:02:11.400> you'd

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the sideboard instead and so maybe you'd

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.430 
the sideboard instead and so maybe you'd
want<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> bring<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.690> another<00:02:12.959> Rangers

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
want to bring in like another Rangers

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.760 
want to bring in like another Rangers
guy

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
guy

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.970 
guy
I'll<00:02:13.860> or<00:02:14.960> a<00:02:18.410> maybe<00:02:19.410> even<00:02:19.650> an<00:02:19.770> unflinching

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
I'll or a maybe even an unflinching

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.130 
I'll or a maybe even an unflinching
courage<00:02:20.310> main<00:02:20.640> board<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.210> just<00:02:21.780> throw<00:02:21.990> these

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
courage main board and just throw these

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.360 
courage main board and just throw these
in<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.320> sideboard<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.890> don't<00:02:23.040> think<00:02:23.130> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
in the sideboard I don't think the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.740 
in the sideboard I don't think the
fleece<00:02:23.580> mate<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:24.000> don't<00:02:24.180> think<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.360> wild<00:02:24.570> beast

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
fleece mate I don't think the wild beast

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.810 
fleece mate I don't think the wild beast
masters<00:02:25.140> actually<00:02:25.770> quite<00:02:26.040> work<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.550> Dec

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
masters actually quite work in this Dec

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.810 
masters actually quite work in this Dec
the<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.230> three<00:02:28.560> drop<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.070> really<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.580> want

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
the the three drop is a really you want

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.550 
the the three drop is a really you want
to<00:02:29.910> be<00:02:30.000> doing<00:02:30.330> something<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.960> mean<00:02:31.110> fourth<00:02:31.350> turn

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
to be doing something I mean fourth turn

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.770 
to be doing something I mean fourth turn
yeah<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.830> still<00:02:32.130> see<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.490> potential<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.480> giant

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
yeah I still see the potential of giant

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.330 
yeah I still see the potential of giant
growth<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.170> attacking<00:02:34.560> everything<00:02:34.890> get<00:02:35.130> plus

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
growth and attacking everything get plus

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.680 
growth and attacking everything get plus
fours<00:02:35.520> for<00:02:35.730> but<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.180> think<00:02:36.210> that's<00:02:36.480> more<00:02:36.630> of

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
fours for but I think that's more of

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.170 
fours for but I think that's more of
magical<00:02:37.170> Christmas<00:02:37.500> land<00:02:37.710> than<00:02:37.890> anything<00:02:38.280> so

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
magical Christmas land than anything so

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.170 
magical Christmas land than anything so
I'm<00:02:39.300> going<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.480> cut<00:02:39.660> these<00:02:40.250> these<00:02:41.250> wild<00:02:41.970> beast

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
I'm going to cut these these wild beast

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.850 
I'm going to cut these these wild beast
masters<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.690> we<00:02:45.780> return<00:02:46.110> these<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.650> think

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
masters so we return these and I think

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.800 
masters so we return these and I think
the<00:02:46.920> police<00:02:47.070> main<00:02:47.310> lions<00:02:47.700> are<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.540> way<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.660> go

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
the police main lions are the way to go

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.660 
the police main lions are the way to go
and<00:02:49.170> maybe<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.740> don't<00:02:49.920> want<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.100> see<00:02:50.220> now<00:02:50.490> that

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
and maybe I don't want to see now that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.280 
and maybe I don't want to see now that
the<00:02:50.820> no<00:02:51.240> those<00:02:51.480> are<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.720> way<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:51.840> think<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.140> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
the no those are the way I think that to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.950 
the no those are the way I think that to
John<00:02:52.470> Groce<00:02:52.740> in<00:02:52.890> 25<00:02:53.220> overs<00:02:53.250> are<00:02:53.810> probably<00:02:54.810> good

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
John Groce in 25 overs are probably good

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.080 
John Groce in 25 overs are probably good
enough<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.650> would<00:02:56.130> cut<00:02:56.310> these<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.760> I'd<00:02:56.880> go<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
enough so I would cut these and I'd go a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.590 
enough so I would cut these and I'd go a
full<00:02:57.690> fleece<00:02:58.260> mainline<00:02:58.680> package<00:02:59.190> so<00:03:00.120> now

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
full fleece mainline package so now

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.070 
full fleece mainline package so now
we've<00:03:00.870> got<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.350> fleece<00:03:01.530> main<00:03:01.710> lines<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.340> are

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
we've got a fleece main lines that are

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.440 
we've got a fleece main lines that are
great<00:03:04.080> against<00:03:04.350> like<00:03:04.500> Esper<00:03:05.210> they're<00:03:06.210> great

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
great against like Esper they're great

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.310 
great against like Esper they're great
against<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:08.490> other<00:03:09.360> heavy<00:03:09.780> control<00:03:10.140> decks

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
against the other heavy control decks

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.530 
against the other heavy control decks
are<00:03:10.500> still<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.710> aggressive<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.520> drop<00:03:11.790> which<00:03:12.420> is

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
are still it aggressive to drop which is

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.390 
are still it aggressive to drop which is
what<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.720> think<00:03:12.960> we<00:03:13.050> need<00:03:13.230> which<00:03:13.800> diversifies

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
what I think we need which diversifies

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.130 
what I think we need which diversifies
it<00:03:14.580> but<00:03:14.700> then<00:03:15.210> again<00:03:15.300> fencing<00:03:15.810> ace<00:03:15.930> is

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
it but then again fencing ace is

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.630 
it but then again fencing ace is
definitely<00:03:16.560> something<00:03:16.740> that<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:18.060> can<00:03:19.640> you

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
definitely something that you can you

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.330 
definitely something that you can you
can<00:03:20.820> run<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.270> think<00:03:22.110> that<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.560> gods<00:03:23.070> willing

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
can run I think that the gods willing

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.640 
can run I think that the gods willing
czar<00:03:23.520> just<00:03:23.670> better<00:03:23.910> than<00:03:24.440> Rangers<00:03:25.440> geils

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
czar just better than Rangers geils

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.140 
czar just better than Rangers geils
overall<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.310> think<00:03:26.459> we<00:03:26.640> should<00:03:26.790> add<00:03:26.940> one

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
overall so I think we should add one

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.420 
overall so I think we should add one
more<00:03:27.270> range<00:03:27.450> scale<00:03:27.720> we<00:03:28.320> need<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> I'm<00:03:29.220> going<00:03:29.370> to

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
more range scale we need a I'm going to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.340 
more range scale we need a I'm going to
add<00:03:29.700> one<00:03:29.730> more<00:03:30.090> fencing<00:03:30.480> ace<00:03:30.600> as<00:03:30.780> well<00:03:30.930> go<00:03:31.290> up

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
add one more fencing ace as well go up

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.610 
add one more fencing ace as well go up
to<00:03:31.470> 23<00:03:31.920> creatures<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.690> think<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.990> is<00:03:34.230> probably

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
to 23 creatures I think that is probably

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.880 
to 23 creatures I think that is probably
the<00:03:35.220> right<00:03:35.970> play<00:03:36.240> that<00:03:36.420> gives<00:03:36.570> us<00:03:36.690> seven<00:03:37.110> two

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
the right play that gives us seven two

the right play that gives us seven two
drops<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.520> potential<00:03:38.850> even<00:03:39.120> more<00:03:39.270> two

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
drops and the potential even more two

drops and the potential even more two
drops<00:03:39.690> makes<00:03:40.230> makes<00:03:40.590> us<00:03:40.740> a<00:03:40.860> lot<00:03:41.040> more

aggressive the sideboard now i don't

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.800

think<00:04:05.190> we<00:04:05.250> quite<00:04:05.550> need<00:04:05.940> as<00:04:06.090> many<00:04:06.209> ranges<00:04:06.510> guys

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.750 
think we quite need as many ranges guys
I<00:04:07.020> think<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.320> seven<00:04:07.770> might<00:04:07.950> be<00:04:08.070> overkill<00:04:08.490> I

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
I think that seven might be overkill I

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.690 
I think that seven might be overkill I
did<00:04:09.660> liked<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:10.020> yeah<00:04:10.230> yep<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:10.950> that<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.370> range

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
did liked it yeah yep so that the range

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.580 
did liked it yeah yep so that the range
guys<00:04:11.910> will<00:04:12.090> come<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.360> against<00:04:13.140> model<00:04:13.440> black

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
guys will come in against model black

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.710 
guys will come in against model black
and<00:04:13.830> monnel<00:04:14.100> blue<00:04:14.250> but<00:04:14.790> i<00:04:15.060> think<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.510> eight

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
and monnel blue but i think that eight

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.150 
and monnel blue but i think that eight
was<00:04:15.900> overkill<00:04:16.290> so<00:04:16.500> seven<00:04:16.799> should<00:04:16.950> be<00:04:17.010> the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
was overkill so seven should be the

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.470 
was overkill so seven should be the
right<00:04:17.280> number<00:04:17.580> this<00:04:17.970> allows<00:04:18.239> us<00:04:18.270> to

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
right number this allows us to

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.610 
right number this allows us to

of too many pump spells I like the

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.160 
of too many pump spells I like the

though<00:05:13.500> because<00:05:13.710> I<00:05:14.040> think<00:05:14.760> that<00:05:14.940> it<00:05:15.270> may<00:05:15.390> be

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
though because I think that it may be

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.200 
though because I think that it may be
taken<00:05:15.780> out<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.050> dried<00:05:16.320> militants<00:05:16.950> now<00:05:17.340> or<00:05:17.670> even

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
more pumps pills instead of fencing ace

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.530 
more pumps pills instead of fencing ace
might<00:05:20.100> be<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.370> right<00:05:20.490> play<00:05:20.790> like<00:05:21.330> another

something you definitely have to mess

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.160 
something you definitely have to mess
around<00:05:23.700> with<00:05:23.910> God's<00:05:24.510> willing<00:05:24.810> has<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:25.080> be

around with God's willing has to be

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.390 
around with God's willing has to be
considered<00:05:25.560> as<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.680> pump<00:05:25.890> spell<00:05:26.100> so<00:05:26.250> there's

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
considered as a pump spell so there's

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.420 
considered as a pump spell so there's
four<00:05:26.430> eight<00:05:27.300> twelve<00:05:28.290> there's<00:05:28.530> 16<00:05:28.980> pumps<00:05:29.280> bill

four eight twelve there's 16 pumps bill
for<00:05:29.670> 24<00:05:30.150> creatures<00:05:30.600> so<00:05:31.350> yeah<00:05:32.340> I<00:05:32.370> think<00:05:32.520> that's

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
for 24 creatures so yeah I think that's

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.310 
for 24 creatures so yeah I think that's
a<00:05:32.880> good<00:05:33.030> good<00:05:33.390> it'll<00:05:33.510> spread<00:05:33.840> I<00:05:33.900> don't<00:05:34.140> think

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
a good good it'll spread I don't think

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.990 
a good good it'll spread I don't think
we<00:05:34.410> want<00:05:34.560> to<00:05:34.620> go<00:05:34.710> much<00:05:35.130> slower<00:05:35.340> than<00:05:35.580> twenty

we want to go much slower than twenty

we want to go much slower than twenty
four<00:05:36.210> twenty<00:05:36.900> land<00:05:37.110> drops<00:05:37.410> was<00:05:37.680> incredibly<00:05:38.520> I

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
four twenty land drops was incredibly I

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.840 
four twenty land drops was incredibly I
i<00:05:39.480> I'm<00:05:39.960> thinking<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.350> critical<00:05:40.650> 19<00:05:40.980> or<00:05:41.100> even<00:05:41.310> 18

i I'm thinking a critical 19 or even 18
Lance<00:05:42.090> that's<00:05:42.450> very<00:05:42.690> very<00:05:42.870> risky<00:05:43.230> but<00:05:43.320> you

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
Lance that's very very risky but you

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.580 
Lance that's very very risky but you
curve<00:05:43.620> out<00:05:43.740> at<00:05:43.860> three<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.990> you<00:05:45.990> do<00:05:46.140> want<00:05:46.290> for

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
curve out at three and you do want for

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.020 
curve out at three and you do want for
land<00:05:46.800> so<00:05:46.980> because<00:05:47.250> sometimes<00:05:47.550> people<00:05:47.610> hero

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
land so because sometimes people hero

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.690 
land so because sometimes people hero
ends<00:05:48.330> up<00:05:48.420> being<00:05:48.600> a<00:05:48.840> a<00:05:49.200> four<00:05:49.770> drop<00:05:49.980> because<00:05:50.520> you

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
ends up being a a four drop because you

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.760 
ends up being a a four drop because you
play<00:05:50.880> fable<00:05:51.060> hero<00:05:51.390> with<00:05:51.720> a<00:05:51.750> Rangers<00:05:52.260> guile<00:05:52.500> or

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
play fable hero with a Rangers guile or

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
gods willing up to protect it so you

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.080 
gods willing up to protect it so you
gotta<00:05:56.010> kind<00:05:56.070> of<00:05:56.280> consider<00:05:56.670> you<00:05:56.820> do<00:05:56.910> have<00:05:57.030> a

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
gotta kind of consider you do have a

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.640 
gotta kind of consider you do have a
four<00:05:57.300> drop<00:05:57.510> in<00:05:57.690> here<00:05:57.900> and<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.380> placement

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
four drop in here and the placement

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.190 
four drop in here and the placement
lines<00:05:59.220> you<00:05:59.880> have<00:06:00.090> to<00:06:00.240> want<00:06:00.480> five<00:06:00.840> Manny

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
lines you have to want five Manny

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.440 
lines you have to want five Manny
eventually<00:06:01.770> but<00:06:01.980> so<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:02.640> think<00:06:02.730> 20<00:06:03.090> lands<00:06:03.240> is

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
eventually but so I think 20 lands is

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.410 
eventually but so I think 20 lands is
perfect<00:06:04.010> once<00:06:05.010> the<00:06:05.190> Skylands<00:06:05.820> for<00:06:06.060> celeste

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
perfect once the Skylands for celeste

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.670 
perfect once the Skylands for celeste
Nia<00:06:06.600> comes<00:06:06.810> out<00:06:07.020> I<00:06:07.050> don't<00:06:07.410> know<00:06:07.470> if<00:06:07.560> they're

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
Nia comes out I don't know if they're

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.810 
Nia comes out I don't know if they're
worth<00:06:07.800> it<00:06:08.010> in<00:06:08.100> here<00:06:08.220> because<00:06:08.370> the<00:06:08.430> guild<00:06:08.640> gates

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
worth it in here because the guild gates

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.970 
worth it in here because the guild gates
were<00:06:08.940> just<00:06:09.150> so<00:06:09.360> awful<00:06:09.630> but<00:06:10.410> anyway<00:06:10.830> it's

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
were just so awful but anyway it's

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.780 
were just so awful but anyway it's
something<00:06:11.250> you<00:06:11.310> could<00:06:11.430> definitely<00:06:11.520> mess

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
something you could definitely mess

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.040 
something you could definitely mess
around<00:06:11.910> with<00:06:12.120> I<00:06:12.210> think<00:06:12.390> it's<00:06:12.480> a<00:06:12.540> powerful<00:06:12.750> deck

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
around with I think it's a powerful deck

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.230 
around with I think it's a powerful deck
it<00:06:13.320> has<00:06:13.860> some<00:06:14.040> great<00:06:14.250> matchups<00:06:14.760> as<00:06:14.910> you<00:06:15.030> saw

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
it has some great matchups as you saw

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.210 
it has some great matchups as you saw
but<00:06:15.780> it<00:06:15.810> does<00:06:16.080> have<00:06:16.260> some<00:06:16.440> terrible<00:06:16.650> matchups

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
but it does have some terrible matchups

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.190 
but it does have some terrible matchups
like<00:06:17.640> mono<00:06:17.940> blue<00:06:18.210> but<00:06:18.450> mono<00:06:18.600> black<00:06:18.810> should<00:06:19.080> be

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
like mono blue but mono black should be

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.260 
like mono blue but mono black should be
a<00:06:19.230> pretty<00:06:19.620> easy<00:06:19.740> matchup<00:06:20.100> to<00:06:20.430> to<00:06:21.120> be

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
a pretty easy matchup to to be

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.760 
a pretty easy matchup to to be
especially<00:06:21.570> like<00:06:22.020> I<00:06:22.050> said<00:06:22.290> with<00:06:22.410> the<00:06:22.530> range<00:06:22.680> of
