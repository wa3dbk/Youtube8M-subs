equipment and this is the MSR flex three
and<00:00:33.330> two<00:00:34.330> debating<00:00:34.660> it<00:00:34.750> too<00:00:35.140> many<00:00:35.350> videos<00:00:36.100> on

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
weighing it out each component because I

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.430 
weighing it out each component because I
need<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.650> make<00:00:41.770> some<00:00:41.920> decisions<00:00:42.370> so<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:44.290> is

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
that so the pot see 2.57

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:26.130 
that so the pot see 2.57
two<00:02:12.970> pounds<00:02:14.430> five<00:02:15.430> point<00:02:15.850> seven<00:02:16.060> houses<00:02:17.550> or

1052 grams then the lid it snaps on the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.180 
1052 grams then the lid it snaps on the
top<00:02:48.150> that's<00:02:48.630> how<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.020> holds<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:49.410> all<00:02:49.470> together

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.350 

you<00:02:53.190> pull<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.519> off

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
you pull it off

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.830 
you pull it off
it<00:02:54.810> locks<00:02:55.019> into<00:02:55.260> place<00:02:56.330> which<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.480> definitely

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
it locks into place which is definitely

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.180 
it locks into place which is definitely
a<00:02:57.900> piece<00:02:58.290> kind<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.560> handles<00:02:58.830> something<00:02:59.130> I'm

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
a piece kind of handles something I'm

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.589 
a piece kind of handles something I'm
looking<00:02:59.310> for<00:02:59.700> something<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.420> won't

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
looking for something that that won't

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.630 
looking for something that that won't
burn<00:03:00.780> myself<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:03.090> pot<00:03:03.300> lid

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
burn myself the pot lid

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.130 
burn myself the pot lid
it's<00:03:05.640> nice<00:03:05.880> lightweight<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.569> has<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.720> strainer

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
it's nice lightweight it has a strainer

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.509 
it's nice lightweight it has a strainer
right<00:03:07.830> there<00:03:08.870> steam<00:03:09.870> vent<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.410> little<00:03:10.489> got<00:03:11.489> a

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
right there steam vent a little got a

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.059 
right there steam vent a little got a
rubber<00:03:11.760> handle<00:03:12.060> on<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.610> that<00:03:14.610> weighs<00:03:16.069> 89

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
rubber handle on it and that weighs 89

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.870 
rubber handle on it and that weighs 89
grams

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.759 

or

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.360 

3.1<00:03:31.769> ounces

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.520 

and<00:03:36.970> when<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.209> put<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.540> on<00:03:37.659> just<00:03:38.290> on<00:03:38.440> the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
and when you put it on just on the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:48.050 
and when you put it on just on the
bigger<00:03:38.739> pot<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.900> pot<00:03:40.959> is

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.370 

2.3<00:03:49.060> liters<00:03:49.660> in<00:03:49.990> a<00:03:50.050> nonstick<00:03:50.920> dura<00:03:51.280> light<00:03:52.380> and

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
2.3 liters in a nonstick dura light and

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.650 
2.3 liters in a nonstick dura light and
so<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.920> actually<00:03:54.310> has<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.790> little<00:03:54.940> clasp<00:03:55.420> right

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
so it actually has a little clasp right
