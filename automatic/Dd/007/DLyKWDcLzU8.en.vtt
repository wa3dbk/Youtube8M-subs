00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello there is a new food namely 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.160
 the beach cruiser sle and i have one 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.480
 few products sent for testing 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.460
 Thanks a lot for that, I'm glad 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.620
 me always very much and i wanted 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.680
 Just introduce yourself and yes 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.080
 is a product that I totally great 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.029
 find great that comes in the course of the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.550
 videos we will start with now 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.439
 an accessoire me here this mountain 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.410
 I also thought about that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.810
 what is that but that is actually the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.160
 function well thought out behind it 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.380
 and that's about it if you 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.270
 maybe for example with any one 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.360
 small snack to the beach is so 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.710
 some kind of a chip bag probably a child 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.629
 beware if there are only half 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.829
 Auffuttert then it is always 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.600
 a bit difficult with that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.270
 transport and with the lock 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.489
 That's why it's just a clip 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.230
 for such a bag so you can then 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.760
 click on it and then the bag is closed 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.800
 and that is actually quite a whole 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.270
 great idea as he suddenly and me 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.710
 will confessed definitely times has 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.899
 already pack in if that is in today 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.539
 the holiday goes 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.659
 and next there was one in here 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.979
 Einbeck a make-up bag and that is 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.380
 also very nice so I think so 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.290
 really beach feeling in this beach 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.180
 in this turquoise or fall with these 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.189
 opened here in front it looks like this 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.140
 So there you still have these subjects where you 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.180
 can reinstopfen something with that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.799
 not everywhere in here somehow loose in it 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.080
 So I think that's really great 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.030
 find all these cosmetic bags 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.890
 It's always very useful anyway 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.200
 I also have many and I can do that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.060
 still do not have enough and then 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.979
 There are of course still decorative 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.150
 cosmetics and here we start with 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.790
 the eyeshadow here 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.049
 I now have the color 03 short jobs 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.759
 wanna have fun 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.500
 that's not such a pretty pink too 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.259
 cool with a little light 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.060
 pietsch share and velvet in the finish the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.680
 consistency is also correct overall view 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.720
 but so I go there but I find 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.729
 does not give off so blatantly color me now 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.079
 It would not affect his eyes anyway 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.850
 wear but I think the color 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.500
 actually really great for the wall 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.329
 that's why i'll call you pale and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.460
 also works a nail polish 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.909
 get here in the color 0 2 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.100
 girls just wanna have fun so 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.929
 the product to eyeshadow but me 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.060
 find the colors are actually similar 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.580
 not so bad because the eyeshadow is very 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.629
 a lot more goes into the pixel and that is one 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.459
 yes a sand effect nail polish I think 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.769
 the color is really really nice 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.660
 as you can see in the hamlet still 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.670
 that is golden shimmer in it 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.980
 I think but applied on the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.129
 You can see this golden finger 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.230
 Do not really shimmer and all the more 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.760
 but this this country so this 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.069
 sandy so if you have the marx of 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.209
 Finnish band of these days was something 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.099
 for you I would have been more spectacular 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.780
 found if you still a bit 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.879
 seen more of this gold before 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.590
 but should have as said the 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.910
 In any case, I like color a lot 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.860
 good and is definitely beach 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.930
 suitable a bit bang 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.230
 I will be here next 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.840
 a bronze gets the bronze live 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.450
 is that's only in one color and there 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.400
 a palm on it too 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.599
 a little brighter so acts like that 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.829
 a bit as a highlighter 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.450
 or a little bit as 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.769
 shimmer i do not like palm trees like that 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.930
 pretty much destroy but I have them now 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.180
 Nevertheless, a lot going on and I think so 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.980
 brown phase see this darker color there 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.410
 I have a little orange share so I think 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.859
 there is really suitable for many 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.660
 but this palm already has 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.560
 shimmer and golden glitter 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.760
 Particles in it 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.069
 maybe that's for the one or the other 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.599
 others a bit much and me yes 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.829
 window still a bit difficult though 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.690
 one can only learn from this industry 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.750
 you would like to have somehow 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.299
 to roll around this breakdown and 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.519
 it smells like coconut and just that 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.260
 most browsers now in this 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.569
 Season that is somehow I believe 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.480
 Such a hype also with the browsers like that 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.760
 then we come to the lipgloss that it 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.579
 here the color 0 2 again that 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.959
 pontoon to eyeshadow and nail polish 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.639
 There is actually almost as good as color 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.190
 no lip on the lips for now 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.319
 you definitely do not see me there 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.470
 but even more easily gold schirmer 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.329
 glitter in it and he also smells right 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.530
 fruity so there you get really lust 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.819
 on something sweetly fruity and then 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.040
 we come to the last one 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:14.500
 This is namely decorative items 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.329
 here a waterproof liquid eyeliner that 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.720
 now a super cool color namely the 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.720
 02 keep on and go to the area this is one 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.290
 a little light shade of green, I'm popping up 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.780
 every case 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.280
 And there is also silvery glitter 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.290
 Particles in it but I think if you 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.820
 anyway such a colored liquid 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.920
 eyeliner applies then he may also 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.990
 really popping again in addition 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.010
 Glitter and I really want that very much 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.200
 So, how can I imagine 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.300
 opacity is rather mediocre but you 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.920
 can layer them to the complete 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.870
 dekra now we come to my 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.700
 personal highlights from this marriage 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.669
 and that is really nothing 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.040
 it is decorative but it is a body 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.680
 spray and that's for the moment anyway 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.320
 totally in such a body sprit to use 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.570
 instead of a slightly heavier pavlos 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.160
 and I have to say I'm excited 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.660
 of which I have never had a word 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.790
 I did not use it 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.520
 but I always wanted to test 1 but 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.090
 somehow it did not happen and that 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.710
 not really fresh fruity here 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.690
 Just make a good mood so I find 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.240
 the smell is just great that's the one now 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.100
 0 1 ticket to paradise 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.150
 I believe the functional robust 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.419
 direction I'm not quite 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.419
 for sure 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.860
 and I think the top is just great 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.810
 me about it now that I finally one 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.460
 have police spokesman and I can 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.870
 Well imagine he's in the summer 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.550
 maybe I even put them in the 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.169
 fridge i do not know and then 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.820
 discuss it with me once the fragrance 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.310
 should be on the whole day long 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.750
 keep skin and yes I'm just gone 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.460
 and away from the scent I think that's great 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.470
 definitely take care of it if there 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.300
 Maybe the stand will pass by 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.160
 This fragrance also inspires you 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.720
 very class the things I test 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.729
 may and of course there is of all 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.290
 other color products again me 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.570
 would care if i would do this 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.919
 generally appeals and whether you 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.380
 can also be such a highlight product 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.060
 have as I link now and then 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.470
 I below again my last two 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.130
 videos and then we'll see each other 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.130
 next time again
