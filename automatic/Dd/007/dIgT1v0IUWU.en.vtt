00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.750
 in this museum you can imagine not 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.060
 only a movie star but also a general 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.220
 secretary and even president for example 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.470
 this wolf was given over by a special garage 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.430
 destination never traveled on it myself 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.940
 Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev it was our leader 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.130
 countries that are fond of the body 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.250
 he himself often sat behind the wheel and according to his 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.860
 the order made five such cars on 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.010
 base 24 wolves on the machine could notice 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.230

 top management hunting economy 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.680
 jealous 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:56.400
 because we face another machine acceptance 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.230
 god 21 this second collection car 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.700
 Mikhail as Muscovite he also not 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.130
 avoided redoing it for the year we 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.069
 set started on an exhibition on it 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.250
 It turned out that I occupy the second place 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.950
 there is a second place on this car 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.010
 due to the fact that alloy wheels do not consist 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.700
 There were native drives that should be 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.359
 on this car so everything else 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.060
 it was all like 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.979
 your car interior is also original 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.169
 Scheele covers specially for the patterns 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.650
 time even the dashboard and decided 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:36.120
 make a tone to tone panel she was generally 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.400
 red numbers seriously tuva skin so 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.690
 was beautiful 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.669
 stop here michael not 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.979
 going to dream recover yet 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.990
 several cars say they have 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.250
 some unusual aura which is not 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.289
 find serial cars 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.169
 because in the old days cars were 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.880
 luxury and not a means of transportation 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.360
 indicators of the taste of the owner they way 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.360
 stand out
