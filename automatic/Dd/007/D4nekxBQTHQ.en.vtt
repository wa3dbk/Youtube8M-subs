 and she came to me as a little mozzie 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:49.150
 so it came 1 234 234 products being 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:01:07.740
 that one is a treat 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:01:11.229
 she is showing that ball is that of mabel and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.880
 Talking is hydrolyzate of tam 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:18.630

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:32.679
 of my ampoule 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:34.829

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.100

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.100
 what's up 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.490
 Look the line 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.080
 I spent too much but she stays like this if 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.210
 You put a little bit on it. 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:04.570
 if it gets more or less it will turn blue 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.670
 season and I put my arm around her 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.780
 Good that I passed her I passed once 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.019
 so in the arm 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.080
 she stayed and when she dried I would pass 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.880
 The girl does not go out so I think it's going to be 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:22.530
 a good to do 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:29.310
 I had a very good shadow base 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.310

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:57.040
 I do not know where it came from, look at ours, right? 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:03:00.390

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.390

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.100

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.410
