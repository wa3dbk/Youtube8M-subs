00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
because it gives me more time to get

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.660

ready in the morning and it's also a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.460 
ready in the morning and it's also a
little<00:01:11.909> warm<00:01:12.119> there<00:01:12.299> too

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
little warm there too

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.830 
little warm there too
just<00:01:14.470> uh<00:01:14.560> just<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.580> fact<00:01:15.820> that<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:16.240> shows<00:01:16.810> that

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
just uh just the fact that it shows that

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.700 
just uh just the fact that it shows that
San<00:01:17.500> Francisco's<00:01:17.970> paying<00:01:18.970> more<00:01:19.150> attention<00:01:19.180> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710

the<00:01:20.710> safety<00:01:20.980> of<00:01:21.190> a<00:01:21.430> cyclist<00:01:21.910> I<00:01:22.120> think<00:01:22.960> it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
the safety of a cyclist I think it

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.530 
the safety of a cyclist I think it
encourages<00:01:23.590> not<00:01:24.460> only<00:01:24.640> myself<00:01:24.820> but<00:01:25.120> even

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
encourages not only myself but even

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.330 
encourages not only myself but even

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
noticed they made it a little safer

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.680 
noticed they made it a little safer

you're not travelling down the middle or
fighting<00:01:55.979> people<00:01:56.979> parking<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.630> that's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
fighting people parking so that's

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.680 
fighting people parking so that's

I<00:02:05.800> ride<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.040> bike<00:02:06.340> because<00:02:06.790> it's<00:02:07.119> easier<00:02:07.479> to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
I ride a bike because it's easier to
