to learning the track i believe like I
can<00:01:16.070> learn<00:01:16.220> very<00:01:16.460> quick<00:01:16.729> but<00:01:17.360> for<00:01:18.170> me<00:01:18.290> they

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
can learn very quick but for me they

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.380 
can learn very quick but for me they
need<00:01:19.010> to<00:01:19.159> be<00:01:19.250> very<00:01:19.460> confident<00:01:19.909> on<00:01:20.000> my<00:01:20.150> back

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
need to be very confident on my back

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.980 
need to be very confident on my back
when<00:01:20.600> i'm<00:01:20.750> confident<00:01:21.439> i<00:01:21.650> can<00:01:21.799> t<00:01:22.040> be<00:01:22.159> preserved

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
when i'm confident i can t be preserved

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.170 
when i'm confident i can t be preserved
what's<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.229> biggest<00:01:24.770> change<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:25.970> have

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
what's the biggest change that you have

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.350 
what's the biggest change that you have
to<00:01:26.360> make<00:01:26.570> in<00:01:26.869> your<00:01:26.900> riding<00:01:27.290> on<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:28.400> 1000<00:01:29.150> from

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
to make in your riding on the 1000 from

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.380 
to make in your riding on the 1000 from
the<00:01:29.570> Supersport<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:31.100> beep<00:01:31.310> is<00:01:31.549> difficult

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
the Supersport the beep is difficult

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.200 
the Supersport the beep is difficult
point<00:01:32.689> for<00:01:33.020> me<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.369> to<00:01:34.369> stop<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.820> this<00:01:34.939> power

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
point for me and to stop to this power

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.020 
point for me and to stop to this power
and<00:01:35.859> doing<00:01:36.859> good<00:01:37.070> xed<00:01:37.399> with<00:01:37.579> this<00:01:37.759> power

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
and doing good xed with this power

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.120 
and doing good xed with this power
because<00:01:38.390> in<00:01:38.840> superbike<00:01:39.320> gives<00:01:39.350> traction

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
because in superbike gives traction

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.239 
because in superbike gives traction
control<00:01:40.340> which<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.420> like<00:01:41.630> it<00:01:41.810> had<00:01:42.020> 24<00:01:42.649> exit<00:01:43.039> but

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
control which is like it had 24 exit but

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.880 
control which is like it had 24 exit but
in<00:01:43.729> super<00:01:44.179> sport<00:01:44.509> everything<00:01:44.990> in<00:01:45.320> your<00:01:45.530> hand

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
in super sport everything in your hand

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.649 
in super sport everything in your hand
and<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.280> superbike<00:01:46.729> you<00:01:46.999> have<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.270> do<00:01:47.390> with<00:01:47.539> the

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
and a superbike you have to do with the

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.749 
and a superbike you have to do with the
traction<00:01:48.109> control<00:01:48.140> which<00:01:48.740> is<00:01:48.890> like<00:01:49.069> at<00:01:49.520> the

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
traction control which is like at the

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.899 
traction control which is like at the
moment<00:01:49.850> I<00:01:50.060> can't<00:01:50.329> control<00:01:50.749> very<00:01:50.990> good<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:51.909> but

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
moment I can't control very good and but

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.270 
moment I can't control very good and but
time<00:01:53.390> I<00:01:53.569> think<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.020> every<00:01:54.350> time<00:01:54.560> I'm<00:01:54.799> coming

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
time I think the every time I'm coming

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.929 
time I think the every time I'm coming
better<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:55.670> better<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:57.020> hope<00:01:57.979> this<00:01:58.460> is<00:01:58.609> a<00:01:58.640> time

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
better and better I hope this is a time

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.099 
better and better I hope this is a time
maybe<00:01:59.270> maybe<00:01:59.689> here<00:02:00.109> I<00:02:00.289> start<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.749> do<00:02:02.899> what<00:02:03.079> I

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
maybe maybe here I start to to do what I

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.020 
maybe maybe here I start to to do what I
learn<00:02:03.439> till<00:02:03.679> now<00:02:03.889> I<00:02:04.130> believe<00:02:04.460> like<00:02:04.819> this

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
learn till now I believe like this

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.710 
learn till now I believe like this
weekend<00:02:05.479> like<00:02:05.749> it<00:02:06.350> will<00:02:06.619> be<00:02:06.740> good<00:02:06.859> for<00:02:06.920> me<00:02:07.720> with

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
weekend like it will be good for me with

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.870 
weekend like it will be good for me with
this<00:02:08.899> big<00:02:09.170> 1000<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.250> more<00:02:10.429> difficult<00:02:10.520> to

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
this big 1000 is it more difficult to

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.630 
this big 1000 is it more difficult to
stop<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.780> easier<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.290> stop<00:02:12.560> supersport<00:02:13.400> I

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
stop is it easier to stop supersport I

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.150 
stop is it easier to stop supersport I
know<00:02:14.120> not<00:02:14.420> easy<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.840> stop<00:02:15.200> this<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:15.980> very

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
know not easy to stop this is very

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.280 
know not easy to stop this is very
difficult<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:17.150> know<00:02:17.480> what<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.840> do<00:02:17.990> wrong

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
difficult and you know what I do wrong

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.520 
difficult and you know what I do wrong
also<00:02:18.800> like<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.370> come<00:02:19.790> very<00:02:19.940> fast<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.510> I<00:02:20.720> keep<00:02:21.470> a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
also like I come very fast and I keep a
