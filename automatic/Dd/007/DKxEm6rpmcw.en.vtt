and coal as well a lot of people think
we<00:04:34.750> have<00:04:34.900> this<00:04:34.990> endless<00:04:35.380> supply<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:35.710> coal<00:04:36.040> but

we have this endless supply of coal but
the<00:04:36.490> reality<00:04:36.970> is<00:04:37.000> it's<00:04:37.450> a<00:04:37.960> resource<00:04:38.410> that<00:04:38.680> has

the reality is it's a resource that has
not<00:04:39.070> been<00:04:39.130> studied<00:04:39.610> since<00:04:39.790> 1970<00:04:40.690> for<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.500> USGS

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
not been studied since 1970 for the USGS

hasn't done an analysis of coal in this
country<00:04:44.260> since<00:04:44.590> then<00:04:44.890> and<00:04:45.240> what<00:04:46.240> we're

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
country since then and what we're

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.320 
country since then and what we're
finding<00:04:46.630> is<00:04:47.230> that<00:04:47.260> it's<00:04:47.919> not<00:04:48.130> as<00:04:48.400> not<00:04:49.090> going<00:04:49.270> to

be as easy as a lot of people think
we're<00:04:51.520> getting<00:04:51.760> down<00:04:51.880> deeper<00:04:52.360> in<00:04:52.479> coal<00:04:52.720> seams

we're getting down deeper in coal seams
you<00:04:53.530> notice<00:04:53.919> this<00:04:54.160> mountaintop<00:04:54.610> removal<00:04:54.820> is

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
you notice this mountaintop removal is

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.860 
you notice this mountaintop removal is
destroying<00:04:56.460> entire<00:04:57.460> communities<00:04:58.210> because<00:04:58.690> of

well with energy you know as everyone is

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.420 
well with energy you know as everyone is
so<00:05:09.610> focused<00:05:09.760> on<00:05:10.120> climate<00:05:10.750> change<00:05:10.780> and

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
so focused on climate change and

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.970 
so focused on climate change and
great<00:05:11.700> I'll<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.270> know<00:05:12.330> well<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.720> good<00:05:12.930> but

it's the energy that's going to fix the

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.890 
it's the energy that's going to fix the
climate<00:05:16.710> issue<00:05:16.830> so<00:05:17.580> getting<00:05:18.090> off<00:05:18.420> of<00:05:18.450> fossil

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
climate issue so getting off of fossil

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.380

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.790 
fuels before they get off of us before
they<00:05:21.540> leave<00:05:21.720> us<00:05:21.750> is<00:05:22.230> really<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.620> critical

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
they leave us is really the critical

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.040 
they leave us is really the critical
point<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:23.550> they're<00:05:24.360> going<00:05:24.450> to<00:05:24.540> leave<00:05:24.690> us<00:05:24.870> much

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
point and they're going to leave us much

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.870 
point and they're going to leave us much
more<00:05:25.110> quickly<00:05:25.860> than<00:05:26.160> people<00:05:26.490> think<00:05:26.670> they<00:05:26.850> are

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
more quickly than people think they are

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.760 
more quickly than people think they are
but<00:05:27.480> it<00:05:27.600> doesn't<00:05:27.750> have<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:28.080> be<00:05:28.110> equally

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
but it doesn't have to be equally

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.040 
but it doesn't have to be equally
disastrous<00:05:29.310> transition<00:05:30.270> it's<00:05:30.810> just<00:05:30.990> that

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
disastrous transition it's just that

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.960 
disastrous transition it's just that
people<00:05:31.200> need<00:05:31.710> to<00:05:31.740> be<00:05:31.920> educated<00:05:32.070> enough<00:05:32.910> in

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
people need to be educated enough in

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.480 
people need to be educated enough in

order to make the decisions they have to

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.100 
order to make the decisions they have to

of people like to talk about this as a

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.100 
of people like to talk about this as a
manhattan<00:05:38.970> project<00:05:39.150> or<00:05:39.480> an<00:05:39.540> Apollo<00:05:39.840> project

manhattan project or an Apollo project

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.840 
manhattan project or an Apollo project
or<00:05:40.440> something<00:05:40.470> like<00:05:40.800> that<00:05:40.860> but<00:05:41.250> the<00:05:41.400> reality

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
or something like that but the reality

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.510 
or something like that but the reality
is<00:05:41.880> that<00:05:42.270> was<00:05:42.810> a<00:05:42.840> few<00:05:43.170> or<00:05:43.560> more<00:05:44.100> than<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.280> few

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
is that was a few or more than a few

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.040 
is that was a few or more than a few
really<00:05:44.790> great<00:05:45.120> scientists<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:45.960> engineers

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
really great scientists and engineers

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.220 
really great scientists and engineers
who<00:05:46.640> worked<00:05:47.640> on<00:05:47.760> those<00:05:47.880> projects<00:05:48.420> but<00:05:48.900> we<00:05:49.050> need

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
who worked on those projects but we need

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.810 
who worked on those projects but we need
the<00:05:49.320> whole<00:05:49.500> country<00:05:50.040> working<00:05:50.370> on<00:05:50.490> this<00:05:50.610> so

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
the whole country working on this so

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.030 
the whole country working on this so
this<00:05:50.910> is<00:05:51.090> more<00:05:51.300> of<00:05:51.330> a<00:05:51.540> world<00:05:52.140> war<00:05:52.320> two<00:05:52.620> effort

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
this is more of a world war two effort

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.780 
this is more of a world war two effort
it<00:05:53.730> kind<00:05:54.000> of<00:05:54.090> you<00:05:54.570> know<00:05:54.600> everybody<00:05:55.170> got<00:05:55.230> behind

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
it kind of you know everybody got behind

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.120 
it kind of you know everybody got behind
this<00:05:56.790> and<00:05:57.030> you<00:05:57.480> know<00:05:57.600> important<00:05:58.350> mission<00:05:59.010> that

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
this and you know important mission that

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.470 
this and you know important mission that
we<00:05:59.250> had<00:05:59.460> and<00:05:59.640> they<00:05:59.790> need<00:05:59.970> to<00:06:00.000> do<00:06:00.150> the<00:06:00.270> same

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
we had and they need to do the same

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.010 
we had and they need to do the same
thing<00:06:00.720> on<00:06:00.870> energy<00:06:01.230> and<00:06:01.440> everybody<00:06:02.280> get<00:06:02.490> behind

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
thing on energy and everybody get behind

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.930 
thing on energy and everybody get behind
conservation<00:06:04.020> and<00:06:04.170> efficiency<00:06:04.260> as<00:06:05.010> we<00:06:05.610> try<00:06:05.910> to

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
conservation and efficiency as we try to

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.480 
conservation and efficiency as we try to
find<00:06:06.330> something<00:06:06.690> that<00:06:06.930> will<00:06:07.050> help<00:06:08.040> us<00:06:08.190> get<00:06:08.370> out

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
find something that will help us get out

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.430 
find something that will help us get out
of<00:06:08.640> this<00:06:08.700> hole<00:06:08.940> we've<00:06:09.120> dug<00:06:09.150> for<00:06:09.480> ourselves<00:06:09.630> is

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
of this hole we've dug for ourselves is

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.500 
of this hole we've dug for ourselves is
that<00:06:10.680> a<00:06:10.890> message<00:06:11.370> voters<00:06:11.550> want<00:06:12.090> to<00:06:12.150> hear<00:06:12.360> or

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
that a message voters want to hear or

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.550 
that a message voters want to hear or
they<00:06:12.900> stop<00:06:13.320> I<00:06:13.740> think<00:06:14.130> Shorter's<00:06:14.460> well<00:06:15.560> because

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
they stop I think Shorter's well because

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.460 
they stop I think Shorter's well because
gas<00:06:17.400> prices<00:06:18.120> have<00:06:18.210> gone<00:06:18.240> up<00:06:18.360> so<00:06:18.720> high<00:06:19.140> so<00:06:19.440> you

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
gas prices have gone up so high so you

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.030 
gas prices have gone up so high so you
know<00:06:19.920> so<00:06:20.160> quickly<00:06:20.520> so<00:06:20.730> that<00:06:21.000> they've<00:06:22.040> decided

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
know so quickly so that they've decided

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.650 
know so quickly so that they've decided
I<00:06:23.250> think<00:06:23.490> they<00:06:23.580> finally<00:06:23.760> realized<00:06:24.120> that<00:06:24.390> well

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
I think they finally realized that well

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.180 
I think they finally realized that well
maybe<00:06:24.870> there<00:06:25.080> is<00:06:25.200> something<00:06:25.440> to<00:06:25.620> this<00:06:25.740> and

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
maybe there is something to this and

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.510 
maybe there is something to this and
maybe<00:06:26.700> this<00:06:26.940> really<00:06:27.090> is<00:06:27.240> the<00:06:27.840> final<00:06:28.350> shock<00:06:28.650> the

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
maybe this really is the final shock the

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.120 
maybe this really is the final shock the
final<00:06:29.880> oil<00:06:30.060> crisis<00:06:30.660> and<00:06:30.900> so<00:06:31.260> I'm<00:06:31.500> seeing<00:06:31.770> a<00:06:31.890> lot

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
final oil crisis and so I'm seeing a lot

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.390 
final oil crisis and so I'm seeing a lot
more<00:06:32.160> people<00:06:32.790> engaged<00:06:33.150> on<00:06:33.360> this<00:06:33.390> and<00:06:34.400> many

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
more people engaged on this and many

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.740 
more people engaged on this and many
more<00:06:35.610> people<00:06:35.910> coming<00:06:36.120> to<00:06:36.270> the<00:06:36.360> campaign

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
more people coming to the campaign

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.630 
more people coming to the campaign
because<00:06:36.960> they<00:06:37.350> know<00:06:37.590> that<00:06:37.830> I'm<00:06:37.980> energy<00:06:38.340> smart

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
because they know that I'm energy smart

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.940 
because they know that I'm energy smart
and<00:06:38.970> they<00:06:39.480> want<00:06:39.660> to<00:06:39.690> learn<00:06:39.840> more<00:06:40.110> about<00:06:40.140> this

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
and they want to learn more about this

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.770 
and they want to learn more about this
as<00:06:41.250> well<00:06:41.400> as<00:06:41.580> the<00:06:41.700> campaign<00:06:41.940> what<00:06:42.420> they<00:06:42.540> can<00:06:42.690> do

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
as well as the campaign what they can do

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.780 
as well as the campaign what they can do
to<00:06:42.810> help<00:06:43.020> so<00:06:43.380> that<00:06:44.130> I<00:06:44.310> think<00:06:44.550> the<00:06:44.610> message

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 
to help so that I think the message

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.430 
to help so that I think the message
message<00:06:45.240> is<00:06:45.480> finally<00:06:45.780> getting<00:06:45.960> through<00:06:46.260> to

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
message is finally getting through to

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.020 
message is finally getting through to
people<00:06:46.590> tell<00:06:47.550> me<00:06:47.610> about<00:06:47.700> what<00:06:47.880> you're<00:06:47.970> doing

know this is a group met roots as a
grassroots<00:06:53.000> movement<00:06:54.000> it's<00:06:54.120> kind<00:06:54.390> of<00:06:54.420> where<00:06:54.630> I

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
grassroots movement it's kind of where I

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.410 
grassroots movement it's kind of where I
come<00:06:54.870> from<00:06:54.930> I<00:06:55.230> come<00:06:55.440> from<00:06:55.530> grassroots<00:06:55.830> and<00:06:56.420> we

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
come from I come from grassroots and we

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.060 
come from I come from grassroots and we
think<00:06:57.630> that<00:06:57.750> this<00:06:57.960> is<00:06:58.170> where<00:06:58.620> we're<00:06:58.860> going<00:06:58.950> to

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
think that this is where we're going to

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.290 
think that this is where we're going to
have<00:06:59.190> such<00:06:59.460> amazing<00:06:59.850> changes<00:07:00.540> in<00:07:00.810> the
