00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello everyone today in our review 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.240
 legendary motorcycle as you understand already 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:19.010
 by badge it is bmw f 650 gs bmw 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:23.100
 enduro motorcycle well what is this motorcycle 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.340
 rotax engines cubic capacity 632 cubic 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.939
 centimeters such engine was set 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.450
 also on pegaso 650 as you know 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.100
 very well-known model of consumption 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.920
 engine about 4 4 and a half liters 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.170
 in Ukraine on our gasoline about our 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.140
 roads and contain a speed of about a hundred 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.190
 kilometers if you drive in europe then 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.219
 speed 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.809
 that is, gas mileage will be somewhere 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.300
 about three and a half liters at 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.370
 data and speed maximum speed 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.370
 us one hundred sixty five kilometers 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.179
 and trustees 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.710
 strange but this particular motorcycle which 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:02:01.829
 before you in 2000 with mileage 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:06.170
 Now I will show you how you run 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:10.289
 you see we run 27 27 thousand 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.140
 Immediately tell you how to tidy 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.890
 see the standard set 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:21.450
 here we are talking about with that is inclusion and 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:25.849
 off here we have heated handles 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:30.030
 steering the motorcycle once again remind the year 2000 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.190
 Dangerous goes in the standard ie its all 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.900
 prepared by dps only need 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:40.079
 put a blink here 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.220
 turn signal in the far 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:47.160
 dipped on those passport to the engine 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.380
 whether you need 2 and 4 liters but in fact 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.410
 it turns out to be completely different 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.889
 pour 2 and 6 liters 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.060
 yes we forgot to say thank you very much 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:02.480
 our friend maryana who 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.480
 provided this bike for review 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:10.650
 we have 19-19 rear wheels 17 rear 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.209
 radius has brembo brakes 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.209
 now show near plan 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:23.790
 two - piston front on arable land and behind 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.829
 what has changed over the years ie in 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.720
 the standard already goes thousands fourth 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.959
 years here we go already wing in 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.700
 The standard is not so dirty motorcycle 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.640
 swamp and 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.349
 in the rain of course much more comfortable ride 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.730
 many exactly concerns the version of dakar 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.780
 now tell you what this bike 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.150
 different from dakar version 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.599
 dk region has more powerful moves 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.360
 suspension and front twenty first 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.280
 the wheel is otherwise identical with that 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.110
 a motorcycle 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.230
 suspension yes I forgot to tell him the suspension 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.930
 here we have regulated 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.230
 stiff rear suspension lelka massive 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.440
 soft suspension is very loyal on this 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:14.340
 motorcycle and very nice to ride it 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.769
 a seat in no competition I have nowhere else 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.739
 Met so soft seat like 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:24.570
 there is a very loud exhaust system 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.970
 if you remove it well and put something for 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.540
 tuning then you are very losing weight 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.910
 motorcycle since he is very heavy 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.550
 we have a tank on a motorcycle under 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.850
 sitting outside the box here as on 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.250
 most motorcycles by the way this part 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.919
 we have plastic and no 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.169
 opportunities to put bags on magnets 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:50.850
 that is, here you need to put on the platform 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:55.020
 different digits of tank size but owner 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.960
 This motorcycle told me that 21 liters 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.900
 since 17 he was leaving and switched to 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.110
 reserve and reserves another 4 liters that is 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.190
 total we go 21 liter 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.190
 now we will drive a motorcycle 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:22.919
 here's the standard motorcycle job 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:38.060
 By the way it is one hundred percent native 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:38.060
 engine mileage 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.730
 so clearly work 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:58.890
 now turn off the light I want to say 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.860
 Of course this is not night but I was driving at night 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.440
 this motorcycle and the light is very credible then 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.410
 there is far in sight everything looks around 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.020
 maximum viewing angles are very me 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:13.230
 liked the light on this bike 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:16.710
 Petrovich og embed more since he 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:23.730
 somewhere you wizard 5 wind you wizard at 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:28.350
 height 180 beats yes little failure here 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:31.200
 when we did you review something dropped 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:36.560
 a little motorcycle and it fell off on the left 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:41.370
 side and turn signal as you can see lapnul 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:45.750
 general motorcycle can only respond 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:49.460
 from the best of course his coming 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:53.190
 competitors this honda transalp 650 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:58.500
 600 and what's the difference between trans 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:07:03.140
 alps and this motorcycle is small there i am 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:08.750
 I think grams to grams 500 fuel consumption 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:13.530
 softer suspension than transalp and 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:16.970
 softer seat than on there chain well 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.970
 this is bmw of course
