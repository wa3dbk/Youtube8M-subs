know this with my old my sideboard I

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.330 
know this with my old my sideboard I
could<00:00:23.670> only<00:00:23.820> get<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> 240<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.529> core<00:00:25.740> like

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
could only get a 240 on the core like

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.259 
could only get a 240 on the core like
Max<00:00:27.090> core<00:00:27.480> voltage<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.890> time<00:00:29.189> I'm<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:30.119> to

artifacts<00:00:52.579> we're<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> hard<00:00:53.940> set<00:00:54.180> perfectly

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
artifacts we're on a hard set perfectly

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.400 
artifacts we're on a hard set perfectly
stable<00:00:56.600> so<00:00:57.600> now<00:00:57.870> I'm<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.020> going<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.230> run<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
stable so now I'm just going to run a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.150 
stable so now I'm just going to run a
quick<00:00:59.000> Haven<00:01:00.000> benchmark<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.010> check

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
quick Haven benchmark and we can check

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.140 
quick Haven benchmark and we can check
out<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.550> mac<00:01:02.879> stamps<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.420> whatnot<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.880> that's

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
out the mac stamps and whatnot so that's

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.249 
out the mac stamps and whatnot so that's
just<00:01:10.040> what<00:01:11.040> did<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.310> with<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.610> there<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.179 

turn<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.409> too<00:01:16.560> extreme<00:01:17.869> 1680<00:01:18.869> x<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:19.500> 1920<00:01:20.100> x

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
turn that too extreme 1680 x at 1920 x

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:33.630 
turn that too extreme 1680 x at 1920 x
1200<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:23.570> run

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.370 

and<00:01:33.760> then<00:01:34.479> I<00:01:34.600> will<00:01:34.780> throw<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.140> camera

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
and then I will throw the camera

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.460 
and then I will throw the camera
breakfast<00:01:35.710> is<00:01:35.950> where<00:01:36.220> I<00:01:36.400> get<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.790> end<00:01:39.390> so

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
breakfast is where I get to the end so

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.280 
breakfast is where I get to the end so
now<00:01:41.470> that<00:01:41.500> runs<00:01:41.920> down<00:01:42.130> we<00:01:42.369> got<00:01:42.690> 31.1<00:01:43.690> frames

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
now that runs down we got 31.1 frames

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.550 
now that runs down we got 31.1 frames
per<00:01:44.800> second<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.909> score<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:47.130> 782<00:01:49.410> so<00:01:50.410> now

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
per second and a score of 782 so now

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.990 
per second and a score of 782 so now
let's<00:01:50.860> close<00:01:51.160> out<00:01:51.430> of<00:01:51.460> this<00:01:51.580> real<00:01:51.970> quick<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
let's close out of this real quick and

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.440 
let's close out of this real quick and
go<00:01:58.150> check<00:01:58.420> out<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.630> temps<00:01:59.610> oops<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:01.270> wrong

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
go check out the temps oops the wrong

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:19.259 
go check out the temps oops the wrong
button<00:02:06.840> Taz<00:02:07.840> you're<00:02:08.050> not<00:02:08.200> helping<00:02:15.570> ok<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
button Taz you're not helping ok so the

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.710 
button Taz you're not helping ok so the
CPU<00:02:20.170> peaked<00:02:20.980> at<00:02:21.310> 39<00:02:22.060> degrees<00:02:24.000> then<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.390> video

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
CPU peaked at 39 degrees then the video

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:37.530 
CPU peaked at 39 degrees then the video
card<00:02:26.260> got<00:02:27.010> up<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:28.140> 60<00:02:29.140> degrees

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.350 

and<00:02:37.780> that's<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.799> pretty<00:02:39.280> damn<00:02:39.400> good<00:02:39.579> overclock

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
and that's a pretty damn good overclock

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.410 
and that's a pretty damn good overclock
for<00:02:40.659> still<00:02:40.989> being<00:02:41.019> on<00:02:41.319> stock<00:02:41.680> voltages<00:02:42.420> from

for still being on stock voltages from
what<00:02:43.599> I<00:02:43.629> was<00:02:43.840> reading<00:02:44.140> most<00:02:44.319> people<00:02:44.590> can't<00:02:44.799> get

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
what I was reading most people can't get

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.319 
what I was reading most people can't get
over<00:02:45.189> 850<00:02:46.530> guess<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.709> got<00:02:48.159> a<00:02:48.189> better<00:02:48.430> gtx<00:02:48.939> 480

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
over 850 guess I got a better gtx 480

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.990 
over 850 guess I got a better gtx 480
than<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.569> thought<00:02:49.780> at<00:02:49.959> first<00:02:51.000> hope

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000

camera turned it off by accident mainly

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.640
