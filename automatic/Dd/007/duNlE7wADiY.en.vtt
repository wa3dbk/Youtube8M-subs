00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.990
 hello how are you good I really wanted 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.480
 record then another makeup video 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.060
 but before that I will record as I 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.590
 I do my cleaning my skin hygiene and 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.760
 which is super important that you 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.720
 do every day 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.490
 day and night, I'm going to start 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.960
 with the cleaning milk is the phone 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.060
 boat is good actually I bought it 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.589
 is because I met her when we were 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.539
 doing good we are still in 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.339
 cosmetology so I know these 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.650
 products are for professional use of 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.320
 apross you can get one in 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.510
 any pharmacy and I make a milk 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.170
 cleaning 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.489
 I applied it to the back of my hand 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.840
 I 'm going to do I 'm going to first as a typical 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.270
 like the cream 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.570
 We are going to distribute it in little circles 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:54.489
 ascending already to take 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.559
 all all the dead cells all the 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.170
 that because at night the skin 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.770
 regenerates already then we have to withdraw 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.770
 all those cells 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.170
 As I said, they are good for 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.990
 If the skin can continue to breathe well 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.860
 and they are demanded and everything else then we go 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.860
 to withdraw 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.170
 we withdraw out 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.100
 I wanted to do this now because 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.170
 that they know about this since always before 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.540
 to put on makeup we must clean our 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.770
 face already and after that we're going to do 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.770
 a hydration 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.660
 and they can also use a protector 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.130
 one more sunscreen now in this 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.190
 time especially skins that are more 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.300
 sensitive whiter 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.280
 already there we retired 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.770
 well actually and I get a little bit 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.380
 of coffee because I had an absent author 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.320
 already actually with these cleaning milk 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.700
 it goes away much faster the 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.410
 tolerance that does not last long in 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.080
 reality is dark but as I have not 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.990
 taken sun are actually harmful and that 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.520
 will not affect to edit now and for 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.490
 Last you can expose yourself to the sun 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.350
 but on schedule after the 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.270
 that is before 11 o'clock in the morning and 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.480
 after 4 o'clock in the afternoon where 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.290
 uv baby rays that are the most 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.690
 more harmful ones are already starting to fall as 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.710
 what happens the day they start to go down and then 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.270
 baby to not see anymore those are the ones 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.550
 Millo tanning is maintained throughout the day 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.320
 same so what it looks like is 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:41.340
 super important, we're just ready 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:45.170
 we are ready then with the face 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.069
 and after that to finish because 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.430
 let's say milk starts you have a 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:55.530
 emergency effect already to slow down and 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.380
 that we are going to occupy other of these 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.220
 I bought this in the salcobrand, it 's good 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.220
 find it in any pharmacy 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.230

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.120
 make-up remover we will apply 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.099
 then the lotion that I will occupy a 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.959
 lotion is the virgin milk is a 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.469
 moisturizing lotion already and lotion 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.720
 astringent for oily and tonic skin 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:21.760
 the autonomic but I like I have the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.689
 skin a little dehydrated 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.689
 I'm going to apply it 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.610
 and so also from the forums that were 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.270
 open with cleaning milk 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.190
 with small taps 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.290
 we remove all the product that can 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.290
 stay of milk cleaning 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.720
 but I have not stayed in any 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.590
 cotton in the face because typical that I 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.590

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.320

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.330
 then there I stayed and now what I 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.340
 I explain good this is personal in 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.990

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.040

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:16.900
 Very little look look 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.919
 the p and the p then we go to the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.799
 ring finger 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:24.639
 I am going to distribute here already in the part 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.320
 of the eyecup because here I also have 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.680
 new lines of 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:34.350
 special so he takes advantage of and there 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.350
 with taps there to penetrate 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.539
 there 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.810
 let's apply here because here also 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.810
 I'm usually marked with a line 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.710
 for the expression of anger 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:00.020
 already then we apply here to the other side 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.660
 and of course in the born in the furrow 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.580
 nasogenian that is this already with the 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.300
 smile is set that says covers the shot 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:12.529
 well all these lines are for the ball 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:16.419
 by the so-called expressions we have 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.419
 sexuality already 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:25.440
 the two hands to make it faster 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.750
 and we put faces is not the typical this 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.140
 when we are in front of the mirror 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.880
 We do not distribute what I know and we hope 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.020
 how good in this way do we 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.979
 penetrate much faster 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.639
 and finally I apply a cream of 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.900
 collagen this is also a use pot 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.319
 professional that you can use 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:50.650
 any day and eye moisturizer 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:54.460
 with this good collagen is a 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.379
 active prince very pleasant before and by 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.229
 that's what I use it and what 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:02.819
 we always distribute out pulling 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.819
 upwards 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.009
 already 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.749
 and I try to maneuver so that 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.099
 penetrate well on that side where because in 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:14.080
 actually the special lines are produced 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.219
 for the dehydration of the skin and those 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.259
 sad super port have them so 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.610
 We must both care for and hydrate 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.830
 our skin and we also have 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.610
 hydrate ourselves and take 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.289

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.529

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.460
 minutes and we start with 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.990
