00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello everybody is one more tip about slavery in brazil colonial one 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.609
 the theme of slavery in colonial Brazil that have appeared in the 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.119
 the fruits of new research and studies 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:15.569
 is the control of slave behavior 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:21.519
 that is, how to do to have control over it or about things at 10 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:22.720
 millions of slaves 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.339
 how to control expected behavior 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.529
 there are several state immigration policies 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.170
 one of the best known 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 the most famous domain policy two blackheads 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.550
 is the violence present in textbooks in textbooks you have a notion 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.420
 reasonably good use of violence against the state 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.460
 However 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.519
 violence with slaves 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.270
 follows with the type of irregularity you can not beat 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.690
 and how could not at least in theory freely by a dam it is like wanting 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.299
 a slave 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:57.090
 example 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.450
 the punishment of the elbow down the knee down or even the taste of the 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.510
 slave 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.930
 by law for royal nations order was prohibited by what struck the slave of the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.200
 elbow down on hand face 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.320
 slave to work and therefore would generate 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.609
 he sugar plantations for example 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.120
 however the punishment when slave happens 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.610
 it happens in the chest in the thigh or the buttocks in a specific place of the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.910
 Colonial cities a place called pelourinho the pillory is a truculento 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.490
 is a concept that resembles a tree trunk 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.450
 including it has an origin is in Latin is the same origin in the word by iarc 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.570
 in Spanish which means is to attack for fighting with the then pelourinho hit 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.780
 is the place where punishment will punish a major punishment if 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.610
 highlight either a punishment 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.760
 public usually in the busiest place in the city simón bolívar a 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.250
 mind 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.200
 the pillory also understood and was why it was symbolically 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.470
 means 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.360
 just punishment in the eyes of God 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.770
 so in front of the church and in the eyes of the laws of men so forth 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.979
 to the forum 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.289
 the pillory 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:19.049
 public punishment with three each is important to realize 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.269
 that public punishment is very effective 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.100
 I hit a bishop and put fear in 500 six hundred slaves 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.629
 who are watching this punishment 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:29.629
 Besides that 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.590
 the study of scars is a recent study of slavery in the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.540
 brazil colony 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.659
 is the idea that a body is a form of protest 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:38.599
 and that therefore 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.829
 in him in the body I am able to print in ten days for example a scar 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.859
 represents memory 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.419
 a slave looks at her and do not forget her condition I am a slave 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.489
 a scar 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.970
 represents with a slave that is worth less 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.820
 Slaves with many scars are worth less because they rebelled 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.680
 more and to close with a scar to look at her I remember why I 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.309
 I was punished and when 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.459
 the scar 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.779
 also makes the helm of the law 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.100
 the mark on the body 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.250
 is the state law companies 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.329
 in my body 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.319
 however the approval 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.629
 the violence is quite large and also 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.769
 violence controls some slaves violence punish several strata but 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.569
 several slaves respond to this same violence all right 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.929
 other forms of politics of slave domination, we 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:31.779
 another required tip
