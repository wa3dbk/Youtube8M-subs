00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.400

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.969
 God of letters to him , I took an online course 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.219
 readings on the site of the legend with . which 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.870
 website when we read we do not read 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.270
 every word is our look 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.219
 covers several words at once so here 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.809
 fast reading technique based on 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.910
 so that this scope of words was even wider and 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.579
 all exercise lessons are built on 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.710
 expansion of this angle 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.530
 of course sometimes exercises seem 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.180
 boring because they repeat but 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.409
 while the complexity is growing me 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.850
 progress was not very fast i mean i 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.479
 from lesson to lesson 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.820
 gradually raised its level now 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.189
 I am very interested in how fast I am 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.799
 learned to read and i think about it i 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.900
 I can only tell you in a month or two 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.000
 practice is not very pleasant 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.790
 the news is that I broke my 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.790
 e-reader but good news 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.070
 is that I recently had 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.210
 birthday and my spouse give me a present 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.880
 new reader 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.520
 this is the same pocketbook firm and in contrast 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.579
 from my old reading room which was 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.680
 very, very simple in this reader is 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.970
 Wi-Fi and multi light 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.010
 touch control 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.690
 now i 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.970
 tell about the techniques that I 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.550
 I read in May, I already wrote about this 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.100
 book on your blog you can read 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.140
 review there when you get married what are you 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.930
 think you found your prince and 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.730
 since you love him and he loves you 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.610
 everything will always be wonderful it is on 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.980
 indeed so with this respect it 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.480
 really labor daily and very 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.000
 we often forget about it 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.460
 like this this book is a great help for 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.460
 all young girls as well as for all 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.170
 women who are married this book 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.730
 I enjoyed reading and I gave 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.310
 read it to your mom 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.010
 we liked her nickname is divided into three 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.400
 parts of the relationship with the spouse 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.050
 children and part about herself undressed 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.270
 a lot of marks and I will be her 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.910
 reread the next book which I 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.240
 would like to tell a naive super erland 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.390
 lou 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.340
 this book has a very tempting title and 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.200
 I have long wanted to read it 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.270
 at first she disappointed me in the plot 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.130
 25 year old guy quits his job 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.220
 leaves her parents 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.550
 just sitting in his brother's apartment 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.700
 empty apartment and idle apakova 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.470
 children's toys ball beat cookie 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.019
 which is depicted here here and 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.870
 just spending time doing nothing 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.000
 then the book really grabbed me and bye 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.890
 I went around the house doing my own 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.970
 by deeds it was not interesting what 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.730
 happen next 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.800
 the end of the book I finally understood why she 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.050
 Received so many rave reviews 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.750
 why and she became a bestseller it on 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.030
 really naive book she picks up 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.100
 such problems as why we have forgotten 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.110
 dream why if in childhood us 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.940
 interested in all the example how much 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.550
 we saw animals now we are not 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.100
 think about it after reading 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.110
 This book many people 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.540
 the world began to make lists of 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.100
 what do they like to do i think everyone 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.650
 of us need some point 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.750
 stop stop running up to chase 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.480
 for something and remember that we 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.820
 happy that makes us happy and here 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.500
 this book is just about it if you started 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.750
 read it you did not like it 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.820
 find the strength to read it to the end 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.530
 and then share your opinion 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.840
 did you like it or not 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.320
 optimistic book recommend 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.350
 reading the third book that I read 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.880
 this is the rose and cross of eleonora pahomovoy or 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.980
 it came out to me on facebook 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.440
 sent me this book this is young 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.900
 the writer she lives in Moscow and me 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.570
 it was very interesting to read her book 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.610
 the rose and the cross is a detective but at the same time 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.710
 there is a share of mysticism 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.870
 the top psychotherapist is found dead 

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:22.900
 in his office while killing is very 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.710
 similar to ritual and major mission with 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.510
 another psychotherapist in young 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.920
 takes up an investigation of this case with 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.830
 every day there is more 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.110
 kills and pipes 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.990
 similar to an image of tarot cards 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.270
 so in this detective story a lot 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.060
 a lot of mystics of occultism 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.020
 describes the rituals associated with maps 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.540
 tarot tota 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.270
 in places it was unpleasant and very creepy 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.340
 read but the author is very good at times 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.870
 spins the storyline beautifully 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.150
 writes use wonderful metaphors 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.780
 pavel this book is a solid four why 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.650
 because it seemed to me a little bit 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.440
 illogical ending 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.230
 and then i wrote off eleanor herself in 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.290
 Facebook started asking her questions 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.480
 why did you do everything just so why 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.150
 the ending is this for the first time. 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.870
 when I talked to a writer about her 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.700
 books i would recommend reading this 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.520
 a book to all detective lovers 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.130
 trailer scary stories swirling 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.500
 plots if you like a little magic 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.930
 then surely read this 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.910

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.400

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.320

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.350
 Alabama 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.230

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.910

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.630

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.450

 a hero you recognize each language 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.200
 the stories are great 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.930
 sometimes you want stories 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.700
