00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:13.299
 the last time out play the 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.309
 penultimate part of the season the tsg 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.410
 occurs in dortmund 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.600
 at that bvb at the last one 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.230
 season secured the relegation place 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.580
 has on the 34th of last day 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.160
 second, so to speak 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.220
 I believe it to be a fun-been 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.220
 that nobody will forget anymore 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.710
 no matter what age you look 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.770
 you will be with this game 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.970
 incredibly positive feelings in 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.820
 connection, and then install for us 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.380
 of course, a collaboration 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.510
 extreme highlight also what the 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.110
 emotions to go in this partie of 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.450
 Therefore, something special now 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.940
 but come back to the happiness and 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.550
 completely different conditions in 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.300
 winning dortmund that's something 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.440
 very extraordinary he is dortmund 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:12.280
 one of the two exception teams in the 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.840
 league and there must absolutely everything 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.210
 match each to there ever a 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.540
 to be able to make point 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.380
 then of course you need an extreme 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.470
 extraordinary day if there too 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.120
 should be more but first of all must 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.900
 I say I'm glad that 's what 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.520
 I just said that then 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.049
 basic requirements are slightly different 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.640
 Of course we already play such games 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.409
 also want to use again and again 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.210
 to see 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.670
 where are we in comparison to 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.020
 absolute topteams yes the show he 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.260
 always good 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.850
 different limits on and therefore 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.030
 Of course we are happy about that 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.080
 now our last away game is 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.479
 Really want us again 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.729
 totally focused in the Dortmunder 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.619
 to deliver good performance because one is 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.180
 Clear if you go to dortmund and 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.340
 at dortmund it is now also say 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.770
 not too much anymore 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.659
 purely from the table view but if 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.310
 both teams theoretically not with 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.320
 100 percent voltage would be there in 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.759
 this game you have no chance too 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.369
 if you have both teams few 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.170
 tension had so I'll go 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.970
 assuming that first of all dortmund 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.280
 with 100% commitment last 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.959
 home game wants to deny the last 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.360
 that I'm from the domestic audience 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.870
 show before you then dfb cup final 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.129
 also play and therefore I reckon there 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.930
 again with one with a 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.700
 really good team who took there 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.670
 last but not least many great results 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.010
 I'm really good at running 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.540
 that is only possible you can only existing 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.769
 or fully on air and that is 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.510
 the same applies for a week 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.370
 later but almost monsters with it 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.489
 if we are then before the 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.950
 stand Brunswick so it's right 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.079
 one after the other the play in the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.190
 Incidentally, last calendar year ended with 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.190
 a 2 to 2 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.340
 At the time, Sven Schipplock and Kevin met 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.340
 Volland
