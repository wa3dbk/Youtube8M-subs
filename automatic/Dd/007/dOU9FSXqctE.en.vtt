00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.950 

hello<00:00:07.930> guys<00:00:08.170> it's

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.180 

see<00:00:12.050> if<00:00:12.110> this<00:00:12.260> works<00:00:12.470> and<00:00:12.890> Steven

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
see if this works and Steven

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.420 
see if this works and Steven
to<00:00:14.400> create<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.849> new<00:00:15.269> elevator<00:00:15.890> using<00:00:16.890> trapdoors

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
to create a new elevator using trapdoors

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.630 
to create a new elevator using trapdoors
so<00:00:18.390> here's<00:00:18.840> an<00:00:19.110> example<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.250> outside<00:00:20.580> of

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
so here's an example is just outside of

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.839 
so here's an example is just outside of
my<00:00:20.880> place<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.509> the<00:00:21.539> top<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:22.310> where<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.369> have<00:00:23.820> a

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
my place at the top of where I have a

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.319 
my place at the top of where I have a
farm<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.419> so<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.750> I've<00:00:25.169> got<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:26.369> well<00:00:27.119> two

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:27.329 
farm and so on so I've got just well two

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.130 
farm and so on so I've got just well two
columns<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.840> dirt<00:00:28.079> and<00:00:28.759> across<00:00:29.759> trapdoors<00:00:30.329> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
columns of dirt and across trapdoors to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.900 
columns of dirt and across trapdoors to
use<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.500> elevator<00:00:31.860> all<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.610> climb

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
use the elevator all you do is you climb

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.200 
use the elevator all you do is you climb
in<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:34.280> you<00:00:35.280> basically<00:00:35.460> closed<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:36.000> first

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
in and you basically closed the first

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.190 
in and you basically closed the first
chapter<00:00:36.600> climb<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.219> 2nd<00:00:38.219> 3rd<00:00:38.910> 4th<00:00:39.809> 5th<00:00:41.059> 6th<00:00:42.200> 7th

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
chapter climb up 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.700 
chapter climb up 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th
and<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.469> i<00:00:44.070> am<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> top<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.969> my<00:00:45.710> elevator

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and here i am at the top of my elevator

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.259 
and here i am at the top of my elevator
column<00:00:47.129> obviously<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.120> much

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
column obviously I can do that much

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:55.720 
column obviously I can do that much
quicker<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:49.050> go<00:00:49.170> down<00:00:52.579> easy<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.269> again<00:00:54.629> you

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
quicker to go down easy and again you

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.630 
quicker to go down easy and again you
can<00:00:56.730> jump<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:58.010> guess<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.159> can<00:00:59.309> time<00:00:59.609> it

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
can jump I guess you can time it

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.549 
can jump I guess you can time it
properly<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.839> is<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.260> quick

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
properly you can do is really quick

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
properly you can do is really quick
quite<00:01:01.859> quickly<00:01:02.159> and<00:01:02.550> get<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.269> top<00:01:03.510> top<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
quite quickly and get to the top top of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.310 
quite quickly and get to the top top of
your<00:01:04.229> column<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.120> are<00:01:08.390> this<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.570> as

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
your column and here you are this is as

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.960 
your column and here you are this is as
high<00:01:10.500> as<00:01:10.530> i<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.800> reach<00:01:11.190> actually<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.790> this

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
high as i can reach actually on this

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.060 
high as i can reach actually on this
particular<00:01:12.240> occasion<00:01:12.450> because<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.920> at

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
particular occasion because this is at

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.030 
particular occasion because this is at
opposite<00:01:14.490> up<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> world<00:01:15.120> as<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.600> see

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
opposite up of the world as you can see

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.790 
opposite up of the world as you can see
after<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.280> new<00:01:17.460> update<00:01:17.640> my<00:01:18.120> trees<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.690> been

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
after the new update my trees have been

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.510 
after the new update my trees have been
limited<00:01:20.270> because<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.560> high<00:01:22.980> as<00:01:23.010> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
limited because this is as high as the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.420 
limited because this is as high as the
the<00:01:23.910> world<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.330> map<00:01:24.510> girls<00:01:24.900> now<00:01:25.260> my<00:01:25.980> trees<00:01:26.250> were

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the world of map girls now my trees were

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.010 
the world of map girls now my trees were
actually<00:01:26.700> growing<00:01:26.910> and<00:01:27.240> growing<00:01:27.480> bigger<00:01:27.840> than

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
actually growing and growing bigger than

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.460 
actually growing and growing bigger than
this<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.410> look<00:01:28.970> make<00:01:29.970> off<00:01:30.300> a<00:01:30.540> ceiling<00:01:31.110> level

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
this but look make off a ceiling level

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.320 
this but look make off a ceiling level
and<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.040> high<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.430> possibly<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.210> them

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
and as high as it possibly can get them

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.180 
and as high as it possibly can get them
on<00:01:33.420> top<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.750> mountain<00:01:33.870> any<00:01:34.650> wake<00:01:34.800> up<00:01:34.980> they

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
on top of a mountain any wake up they

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.370 
on top of a mountain any wake up they
got<00:01:35.520> some<00:01:35.910> ideas<00:01:36.300> I'm<00:01:36.600> guessing<00:01:36.930> redstone

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
got some ideas I'm guessing redstone

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.730 
got some ideas I'm guessing redstone
guys<00:01:37.680> will<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.100> able<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:39.080> cable<00:01:40.080> these<00:01:40.230> up<00:01:40.500> with

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
guys will be able to cable these up with

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.160 
guys will be able to cable these up with
repeaters<00:01:41.160> so<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:41.940> all<00:01:42.120> you<00:01:42.300> do<00:01:42.510> is<00:01:42.810> you

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
repeaters so that all you do is you

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.790 
repeaters so that all you do is you
simply<00:01:44.450> press<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.570> button<00:01:45.840> when<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.440> get<00:01:46.590> in

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
simply press a button when you get in

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.010 
simply press a button when you get in
and<00:01:47.540> of<00:01:48.540> course<00:01:48.770> what<00:01:49.770> would<00:01:49.890> happen<00:01:50.190> there<00:01:50.460> is

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
and of course what would happen there is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.310 
and of course what would happen there is
you<00:01:52.020> would<00:01:52.170> simply<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:54.420> timing<00:01:55.110> sequence

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
you would simply the timing sequence

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.770 
you would simply the timing sequence
would<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.920> simply<00:01:56.340> make<00:01:56.550> it<00:01:56.730> so<00:01:56.910> that<00:01:57.090> all<00:01:57.450> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
would you simply make it so that all you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.770 
would you simply make it so that all you
do<00:01:57.900> is<00:01:58.050> press<00:01:58.320> jump<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.640> would<00:01:59.790> rise

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
do is press jump and you would rise

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.340 
do is press jump and you would rise
majestically<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.830> top<00:02:02.840> there<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.900> go<00:02:04.080> it

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
majestically to the top there you go it

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.620 
majestically to the top there you go it
probably<00:02:05.040> goes<00:02:05.460> somewhere<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.090> help<00:02:06.300> solve

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
probably goes somewhere to help solve

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.600 
probably goes somewhere to help solve
the<00:02:07.039> water<00:02:08.039> elevator<00:02:08.550> problem<00:02:10.340> I'm<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.519> to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.520 
the water elevator problem I'm going to
have<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> go<00:02:12.000> at<00:02:12.030> making<00:02:12.269> a<00:02:12.510> proper<00:02:12.780> one<00:02:12.900> thank

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
have a go at making a proper one thank

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.040
