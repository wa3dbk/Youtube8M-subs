what kind of philosophies will stay

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.950 
what kind of philosophies will stay
onboard<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.369> mean<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> Moto<00:01:06.060> X<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> crowd

favorite a lot of people like that phone
so<00:01:08.909> it'll<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.150> interesting<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.720> how<00:01:09.930> much

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
so it'll be interesting to see how much

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.260 
so it'll be interesting to see how much
of<00:01:10.200> those<00:01:10.560> philosophies<00:01:11.250> carry<00:01:11.670> over<00:01:12.060> into

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
of those philosophies carry over into

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
of those philosophies carry over into
the<00:01:12.720> next<00:01:13.290> Moto<00:01:13.530> X<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.189> know<00:01:14.280> about

to the z1 there are also some camera
software<00:02:31.890> improvements<00:02:32.519> so<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.760> has<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:33.030> same

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
20 megapixel sensor as a z1 but it joins

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.479 
20 megapixel sensor as a z1 but it joins
the<00:02:36.150> ranks<00:02:36.299> now<00:02:36.569> of<00:02:36.780> smartphones<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.560> shoot<00:02:37.830> 4k

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
the ranks now of smartphones to shoot 4k

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.309 
the ranks now of smartphones to shoot 4k
video<00:02:38.879> so<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.360> z2<00:02:39.629> is<00:02:39.780> shaping<00:02:39.989> up<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> be
