every every few inches every few

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.850 
every every few inches every few
centimeters<00:01:52.620> I'm<00:01:52.830> going<00:01:53.010> to<00:01:53.100> stop<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.860> just

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
centimeters I'm going to stop and just

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.550 
centimeters I'm going to stop and just
check<00:01:56.190> that<00:01:56.340> my<00:01:56.460> binding<00:01:56.910> is<00:01:57.060> still<00:01:57.560> gently

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.020 

now<00:02:09.110> it's<00:02:09.319> important<00:02:09.860> not<00:02:10.039> to<00:02:10.100> pull<00:02:10.460> this<00:02:10.610> too

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
now it's important not to pull this too

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.520 
now it's important not to pull this too
much<00:02:11.240> or<00:02:11.600> you'll<00:02:11.720> end<00:02:11.870> up<00:02:11.959> with<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.110> puckered

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
much or you'll end up with a puckered

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.970 
much or you'll end up with a puckered
neckline<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.310> if<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.490> don't<00:02:13.670> pull<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:13.970> enough

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
neckline and if you don't pull it enough

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.760 
neckline and if you don't pull it enough
you'll<00:02:15.980> end<00:02:16.160> up<00:02:16.280> with<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.490> fait<00:02:17.450> with<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.770> neck

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
you'll end up with a fait with a neck

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.500 
you'll end up with a fait with a neck
band<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.340> sort<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.640> stands<00:02:19.940> out<00:02:20.120> from<00:02:20.360> the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
band that sort of stands out from the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.690 
band that sort of stands out from the
body<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:21.620> don't<00:02:21.770> really<00:02:21.890> want<00:02:22.190> either<00:02:22.459> of

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
body you don't really want either of

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.360 
body you don't really want either of
those<00:02:22.850> things<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:25.520> that<00:02:25.760> it's<00:02:26.000> why

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.880 

jumps<00:02:31.330> right<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:31.810> front<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.290> where<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.709> going

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
jumps right in front of where and going

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.009 
jumps right in front of where and going
this<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.280> now<00:02:33.640> this<00:02:34.060> part<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.629> neck<00:02:34.780> line

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
this so now this part of the neck line

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.899 
this so now this part of the neck line
here<00:02:36.330> is<00:02:37.330> straight<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:39.430> I'm<00:02:39.549> not<00:02:39.700> actually

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
here is straight so I'm not actually

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.490 
here is straight so I'm not actually
going<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.420> stretch<00:02:40.780> this<00:02:41.019> you<00:02:41.230> want<00:02:41.379> to<00:02:41.440> be

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
going to stretch this you want to be

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.610 
going to stretch this you want to be
really<00:02:41.830> careful<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.629> support<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.440> neck

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
really careful that you support the neck

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.149 
really careful that you support the neck
line<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:45.040> fabric<00:02:45.489> with<00:02:46.209> one<00:02:46.480> hand<00:02:46.950> while<00:02:47.950> you

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
line of fabric with one hand while you

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.890 
line of fabric with one hand while you
control<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.790> binding<00:02:49.209> with<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.480> other<00:02:49.629> hand

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
control the binding with the other hand

00:02:49.900 --> 00:03:01.309 
control the binding with the other hand
it<00:02:50.560> takes<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.920> little<00:02:51.040> bit<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.340> coordination

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:12.850 

works<00:03:02.319> for<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:08.250> here<00:03:09.250> at<00:03:09.370> the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.190 

because<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.670> finding<00:03:14.180> will<00:03:14.300> go<00:03:14.420> smoothly<00:03:14.840> on

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
because the finding will go smoothly on

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.620 
because the finding will go smoothly on
there<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.830> if<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:16.760> stretch<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.180> you'll<00:03:17.510> end

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
there and if you stretch it you'll end

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.070 
there and if you stretch it you'll end
up<00:03:17.720> with<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.900> puckered<00:03:18.380> I'm<00:03:18.830> not<00:03:18.980> going<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:20.750> just

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
up with a puckered I'm not going so just

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:33.880 
up with a puckered I'm not going so just
just<00:03:21.980> keeping<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.490> a<00:03:22.550> little<00:03:22.700> bit<00:03:22.880> firm

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.100 

okay<00:03:34.040> now<00:03:34.730> when<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:34.940> get<00:03:35.000> here<00:03:35.540> I'm<00:03:35.750> going<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:35.990> be

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
okay now when I get here I'm going to be

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.920 
okay now when I get here I'm going to be
really<00:03:36.470> careful<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:37.880> this<00:03:38.090> curve<00:03:38.660> is

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
really careful that this curve is

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.050 
really careful that this curve is
sitting<00:03:39.440> up<00:03:39.590> on<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.770> machine<00:03:40.220> like<00:03:40.459> this

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
sitting up on the machine like this

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.559 
sitting up on the machine like this
okay<00:03:41.750> support<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:42.680> curve<00:03:43.430> don't<00:03:43.610> let<00:03:43.850> it<00:03:43.880> get

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
okay support that curve don't let it get

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.300 
okay support that curve don't let it get
stretched<00:03:45.050> out<00:03:45.290> you<00:03:45.860> need<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.130> maintain

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
stretched out you need to maintain

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.350 
stretched out you need to maintain
control<00:03:46.910> of<00:03:47.330> this<00:03:47.480> area<00:03:48.459> okay<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:50.090> see

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
control of this area okay so you see

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.070 
control of this area okay so you see
here<00:03:50.720> how<00:03:50.750> I've<00:03:51.020> set<00:03:51.290> this<00:03:51.470> up<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:56.780> if<00:03:56.900> you

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
here how I've set this up and if you

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
start feeling the fabric slipping from

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:09.870 
start feeling the fabric slipping from
your<00:03:59.180> control<00:03:59.600> just<00:03:59.989> stop<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.500> reset

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.390 

okay<00:04:11.500> right<00:04:12.500> on<00:04:13.160> around<00:04:13.580> that<00:04:14.030> curve<00:04:15.370> okay

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
okay right on around that curve okay

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.090 
okay right on around that curve okay
don't<00:04:16.760> dumb<00:04:17.090> don't<00:04:17.989> stretch<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.530> fabric<00:04:18.739> out

vital place at one side of the curve

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.980 
vital place at one side of the curve
what<00:04:47.060> I'm<00:04:47.150> going<00:04:47.330> to<00:04:47.389> do<00:04:47.569> is<00:04:47.750> I'm<00:04:47.840> going<00:04:47.930> to

what I'm going to do is I'm going to
finish<00:04:48.199> up<00:04:48.469> the<00:04:48.680> whole<00:04:48.830> straight<00:04:49.310> piece<00:04:49.759> which

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
finish up the whole straight piece which

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.779 
finish up the whole straight piece which
is<00:04:50.090> easy<00:04:50.509> and<00:04:50.900> then<00:04:51.560> I<00:04:51.650> will<00:04:51.830> go<00:04:52.009> back<00:04:52.370> and

is easy and then I will go back and

00:04:52.789 --> 00:05:19.270 
is easy and then I will go back and
check<00:04:53.210> for<00:04:53.270> any<00:04:53.539> errors<00:04:54.020> and<00:04:54.050> correct<00:04:54.379> them

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.830 

you<00:05:20.280> just<00:05:20.490> said<00:05:20.640> the<00:05:20.790> edge<00:05:20.910> now<00:05:21.300> you<00:05:21.630> see<00:05:21.780> I

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
you just said the edge now you see I

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.140 
you just said the edge now you see I
have<00:05:21.900> heaps<00:05:22.290> left<00:05:22.650> here<00:05:23.010> because<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.580> just<00:05:23.790> cut

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
have heaps left here because I just cut

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.780 
have heaps left here because I just cut
a<00:05:24.510> long<00:05:25.410> strip<00:05:25.890> that<00:05:26.130> is<00:05:26.250> about<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.640> right

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
a long strip that is about the right

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.630 
a long strip that is about the right
width<00:05:27.060> I<00:05:27.390> didn't<00:05:27.900> measure<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.950> exactly<00:05:29.070> and

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
width I didn't measure it exactly and

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.070 
width I didn't measure it exactly and
that's<00:05:29.820> fine<00:05:30.060> you<00:05:30.090> just<00:05:30.300> trim<00:05:30.720> off<00:05:30.840> what<00:05:30.990> you

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
that's fine you just trim off what you

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.470 
that's fine you just trim off what you
don't<00:05:31.290> need<00:05:31.520> now<00:05:32.520> I'm<00:05:32.670> gonna<00:05:32.760> come<00:05:33.060> back<00:05:33.210> over

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
don't need now I'm gonna come back over

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.620 
don't need now I'm gonna come back over
here<00:05:33.630> and<00:05:34.470> I'm<00:05:35.250> going<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.490> lay<00:05:35.730> this<00:05:35.910> flat<00:05:36.210> to

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
here and I'm going to lay this flat to

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.070 
here and I'm going to lay this flat to
check<00:05:36.960> it<00:05:37.610> and<00:05:38.610> see<00:05:39.030> if<00:05:39.270> it<00:05:39.420> looks<00:05:39.630> you<00:05:39.960> know

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
check it and see if it looks you know

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.990 
check it and see if it looks you know
relatively<00:05:40.860> even<00:05:41.430> relatively<00:05:42.150> symmetrical

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
relatively even relatively symmetrical

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.660 
relatively even relatively symmetrical
how's<00:05:45.000> that<00:05:45.330> going<00:05:45.870> that<00:05:46.710> looks<00:05:46.980> pretty<00:05:47.520> good

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
how's that going that looks pretty good

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.970 
how's that going that looks pretty good
to<00:05:47.910> me<00:05:48.360> it<00:05:48.720> seems<00:05:49.020> like<00:05:49.110> it<00:05:49.320> has<00:05:49.350> a<00:05:49.470> tendency<00:05:49.920> to

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
to me it seems like it has a tendency to

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.130 
to me it seems like it has a tendency to
want<00:05:50.130> to<00:05:50.160> flip<00:05:50.370> out<00:05:50.520> just<00:05:50.790> a<00:05:50.940> little<00:05:51.210> bit<00:05:51.390> but

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
want to flip out just a little bit but

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.380 
want to flip out just a little bit but
often<00:05:52.530> that'll<00:05:52.830> go<00:05:52.980> away<00:05:53.130> with<00:05:53.520> your<00:05:53.790> with

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
often that'll go away with your with

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.770 
often that'll go away with your with
pressing<00:05:54.720> and<00:05:55.320> if<00:05:55.410> I<00:05:55.530> look<00:05:55.740> over<00:05:55.860> here<00:05:56.510> on<00:05:57.510> the

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
pressing and if I look over here on the

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.000 
pressing and if I look over here on the
other<00:05:57.810> side<00:05:59.600> now<00:06:00.600> that's<00:06:00.810> a<00:06:00.960> problem<00:06:01.410> area<00:06:01.620> I'm

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
other side now that's a problem area I'm

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.950 
other side now that's a problem area I'm
probably<00:06:02.340> just<00:06:02.700> going<00:06:02.880> to<00:06:03.000> unpick<00:06:03.420> those<00:06:03.660> few

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
probably just going to unpick those few

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.890 
probably just going to unpick those few
stitches<00:06:04.500> pull<00:06:05.430> that<00:06:05.670> raw<00:06:05.880> edge<00:06:06.090> up<00:06:06.390> to<00:06:06.420> here

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
stitches pull that raw edge up to here

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.020 
stitches pull that raw edge up to here
and<00:06:07.080> then<00:06:07.260> just<00:06:07.530> rista<00:06:08.040> CH<00:06:08.070> that<00:06:08.340> area<00:06:08.730> that's

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
and then just rista CH that area that's

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.550 
and then just rista CH that area that's
all<00:06:09.270> you<00:06:09.420> have<00:06:09.600> to<00:06:09.780> do<00:06:09.960> when<00:06:10.260> you<00:06:10.350> have<00:06:10.380> a

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
all you have to do when you have a

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.560 
all you have to do when you have a
little<00:06:10.740> error<00:06:11.040> like<00:06:11.370> that<00:06:11.400> I'll<00:06:12.150> probably<00:06:12.330> do

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
little error like that I'll probably do

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.820 
little error like that I'll probably do
the<00:06:12.660> same<00:06:12.690> thing<00:06:13.110> at<00:06:13.200> the<00:06:13.230> other<00:06:13.440> edge<00:06:13.620> of<00:06:13.770> the

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
the same thing at the other edge of the

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.730 
the same thing at the other edge of the
curve<00:06:14.070> and<00:06:14.400> that<00:06:14.660> is<00:06:15.660> all<00:06:16.110> you<00:06:16.260> have<00:06:16.290> to<00:06:16.590> do

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
curve and that is all you have to do

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.100 
curve and that is all you have to do
when<00:06:17.730> you<00:06:17.820> have<00:06:17.880> a<00:06:18.030> little<00:06:18.330> problem<00:06:18.690> area<00:06:18.930> like

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
when you have a little problem area like

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.320 
when you have a little problem area like
that<00:06:19.140> it's<00:06:19.890> perfectly<00:06:20.310> fine<00:06:20.550> just<00:06:20.940> on<00:06:21.090> paper

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
that it's perfectly fine just on paper

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.750 
that it's perfectly fine just on paper
that<00:06:21.390> area<00:06:21.810> fix<00:06:22.560> it<00:06:22.740> up<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:23.040> stitch<00:06:23.310> it<00:06:23.340> and

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
that area fix it up and stitch it and

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.940 
that area fix it up and stitch it and
it's<00:06:24.180> often<00:06:24.510> easier<00:06:24.870> to<00:06:24.960> do<00:06:25.290> that<00:06:25.530> than<00:06:25.920> to

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
it's often easier to do that than to

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.650 
it's often easier to do that than to
stress<00:06:26.460> yourself<00:06:26.610> out<00:06:27.060> into<00:06:27.270> doing<00:06:27.570> it

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
stress yourself out into doing it

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:33.020 
stress yourself out into doing it
perfectly<00:06:28.050> the<00:06:28.200> first<00:06:28.230> time<00:06:29.840> that's<00:06:30.840> it
