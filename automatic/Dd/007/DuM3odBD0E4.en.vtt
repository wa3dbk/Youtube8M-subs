00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
back lights out near the speedometer and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.470 
back lights out near the speedometer and
the<00:00:30.599> fuel<00:00:30.929> gauge<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.820> gonna<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.120> working

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the fuel gauge so I'm gonna be working

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.010 
the fuel gauge so I'm gonna be working
on<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:35.000> figuring<00:00:36.000> out<00:00:36.239> how<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.570> can't

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
on that and figuring out how we can't

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.880 
on that and figuring out how we can't
get<00:00:37.920> some<00:00:38.129> new<00:00:38.250> bulbs<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.790> there<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.890> think

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
get some new bulbs in there so I think

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.530 
get some new bulbs in there so I think
about<00:00:41.100> firing<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.390> it's

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
about firing up there but you know it's

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.060 
about firing up there but you know it's
actually<00:00:42.690> not<00:00:42.989> too<00:00:43.200> bad<00:00:43.410> if<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.649> need<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.890> take

actually not too bad if I need to take

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.400 
actually not too bad if I need to take
the<00:00:44.219> chill<00:00:44.460> off<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.940> might<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.450> yep
