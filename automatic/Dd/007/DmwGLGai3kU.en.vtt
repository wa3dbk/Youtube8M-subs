believe seriously that he can win a slam
and<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.410> think<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.680> he<00:01:04.770> wins<00:01:04.890> one<00:01:05.220> slam<00:01:05.610> that's

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180

my personal opinion he will go on to win
win<00:01:08.670> more<00:01:08.880> than<00:01:08.910> one<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.830> think<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.979> Wimbledon

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
win more than one I think that Wimbledon

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.730

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and the US Opens still give him the best

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.190 
and the US Opens still give him the best
chance<00:01:14.090> yet<00:01:15.090> there's<00:01:15.270> no<00:01:15.390> reason<00:01:15.660> in<00:01:15.750> my<00:01:15.900> mind

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.500 
chance yet there's no reason in my mind
why<00:01:16.380> he<00:01:16.560> shouldn't<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.979> well<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.970> Australia

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510
