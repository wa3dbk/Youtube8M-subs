00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:18.410
 good morning from lorenzo where the masses 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.620
 come to Sicily slowed by the precarious 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.740
 please follow us 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.170
 by diana come come to this beautiful 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.210
 scale is made there are some ramps 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.340
 this stone staircase instead is one 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.200
 stone from here very old among other things 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.130
 was is one of the few things I have 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.510
 kept that he owed in the stone house 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:44.059
 pitch and between instead of a thing at gun 2 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.530
 of the legacies read is local then 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.430
 inside there is another type of stone 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.760
 that the famous title of modest thanks in 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.040
 caldara sandstone drop wires completely 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.739
 in contrast to the black here white inside 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.739
 as the later ones lanterns 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.850
 the uncomfortable you have since then here we are 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.340
 here many changes 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.500
 yes once not only 8 and but rises from 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.660
 December winter lunch though not 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.760
 with summer we use more salt 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.860
 Internet 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.380
 also because wireless is here too 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.580
 what latrine has come to this house 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.530
 this house was the home notary dvd is a 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.220
 then a middle class family so there 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.110
 a part of the top where the servants were 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.680
 also under their ownership there is liszt 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.560
 a bar 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.470
 therefore it has a plant quite like 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.530
 say to be in civilian clothes with high school and le 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.110
 kitchens with its completion of the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.680
 role of the factors that everything was 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.740
 devastated like many things still free 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.980
 fortunately, many others are 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.980
 restoring 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.190
 show us this then the space 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.920
 as I said this stone that I love 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.530
 here I found some majolica from 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.510
 caltagirone and in the land that house 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.500
 that the house dates back to the seventeenth century however 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.530
 house of 200 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.410
 yes the first part is because it was part 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.140
 let's say late sixteenth because 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.540
 in fact that church of san domenico e 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.540
 of the end of the seventeenth century it began 7 th 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.550
 Modica stone seemed to me 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.890
 obligatory to put it and then it 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.440
 contrasted with my things between modes 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.959
 this sandstone that heats you is 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.670
 very almost velvety if you go barefoot and 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.250
 very fresh and soft and proper 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.080
 then I made this turtledove 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.470
 because I wanted to give an idea between the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.330
 I do n't know the Sicilian colonial 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.060
 clearly I don't like anything with me 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.790
 that has been labeled that you know that 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.370
 we have given a precise gender precise 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.950
 I am the one who always mixes things are 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.740
 defined a versatile and therefore eclectic 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.870
 once again I didn't deny it and 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.390
 worn in black where black seems 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.780
 Sicily is also out of place 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.690
 that of process ideas e 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.550
 so in my opinion the dramatic black in 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.709
 a rest so alone comes from those 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.480
 well-known stylists who dress the ladies 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.630
 all of Sicilian black we don't do 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.630
 names 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.480
 this is the largest room and the most 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.670
 beautiful of the world is a numerous on purpose 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.040
 so the nice noisy compatibly 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.709
 to the arms we are the known we are not a 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.510
 new york the view is amazing the view e 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.620
 beautiful because there is the church of san 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.750
 Sunday by the way, you do n't even know 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.910
 deconsecrated then we talk about it is 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.150
 one college was deconsecrated 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.340
 school when there are book exhibitions 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.290
 also the theater and store indicating the 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.030
 church no but not for those who indicated the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.299
 church because I can do it and the electro 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.950
 without revenge or not of the church and the 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.730
 curtains resume the curtains colors 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.930
 I am an English tour is present on 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.690
 practically colony and like one 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.729
 mosquito net a hook like you want it 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.850
 in short, to call a network I didn't want the 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:27.139
 tent but a growth that would make from 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.539
 filter with air and insects there is a 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.810
 bug problem then the room 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:36.700
 double room with the se se tub 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.169
 you want there are these two chests of drawers 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.210
 funny a little punk 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.810
 just to counter this idea of 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.360
 the grandmother of romantic Sicilian things 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.639
 clearly comes here instead instead 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.080
 I get another story with mine 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.620
 things I have my luggage with 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.620
 contamination
