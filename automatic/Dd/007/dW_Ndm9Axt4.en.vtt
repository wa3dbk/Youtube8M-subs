00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.029

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.010
 pursues the local where is intact and homomor 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.020

 Well, we all have time to level the way 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.430
 called the shadow of the colossal donuts 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.450
 a la that kind of hints something here 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.030
 parody of the game 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.350
 shadows for the colossus that went on 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.729
 ps2 and ps3 are there too and wait for the publication you 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.790
 in fact, they tried to apparently 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.970
 transfer the mechanics of this game from the fact that 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.500
 Type need climb on enemy and there 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.900
 remove the ambassador would be point 2 but in this 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.940
 level it turns out that this gadget 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.570
 constantly goes helter-skelter on the valley 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.210

 jump him there sometimes the first time 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.420
 sometimes it turns out 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.420
 10 and opened new cliches 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.329
 obviously weak points well, naturally as 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.759
 how will I know how to kill 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.640

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:01.240

 haunting homorra and 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.580
 boards constantly from this he constantly 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.430
 can get up how stupid places like 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.230
 new time where there is no way 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:22.560

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.890
 runs at one stroke like this no 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.190
 see seed gallardo kill 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.480
 really gone let yourself look for it 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.780
 not to wait for us to be here 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.370
 will actually find you who herself 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.470
 comfortable place that was to get here 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.549
 and you can only see the completion 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:48.370
 places to climb the statue 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:52.980
 where are you and out and behind the craster bit such 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:58.299
 a crowd of troubles which is not funny kids 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.730
 laugh so listen to the show half an hour crazy 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.410
 come down like this time we need to 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.190
 the middle of it climb too principle 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.190
 easy enough 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:15.150
 get on it try jumping off the top 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:18.500
 in fact, this time we were even lucky 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.500
 so could get 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.850
 now the hardest part from in my head 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.160
 which is us now he is again 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.690
 and try to escape this business for Gomorrah 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.430
 but he doesn't need this level yet 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.790
 because only god can attack 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.790
 him 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.310

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.790
 probably give well oh morning sick 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.790
 you can climb 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:56.080
 Be sure not to have something really good 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.320
 the place is he defended himself or a little tooth 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.320
 was 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.990

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.710
 book that level damn I'm so glad that I 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:13.580
 it would not have gone easily as usual 200 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.150
 Once the building jumped here to you big fucking 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.150

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.170

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.610

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:51.190

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:51.190
 I ruined it you are right I blame you 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.379
 I invested even faster than in 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.789
 developers time to 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.490

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.560
 passed on the floor and 4 generally fucking 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.689
 it turned out a 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.460
 although the series is also short if I'm all 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.779
 I will still be equal in level because 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.340

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:17.900

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.909

 for the sake of no better than the other by and large 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:39.259
 Well, the farther in the game playing with that 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:41.300
 everything becomes more complicated for the leasing 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.389
 equal walk to get to next 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.050
 level so happened that I quickly 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:53.029
