00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
strings so that'll be four slides into

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.270 
strings so that'll be four slides into
that<00:00:47.489> twelfth<00:00:47.970> fret<00:00:48.199> and<00:00:49.760> then<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.970> play<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
that twelfth fret and then you play the

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.850 
that twelfth fret and then you play the
strings<00:00:53.280> G<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.150> B<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:55.019> 4th<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> 5th<00:00:55.769> strings

strings G and B the 4th and 5th strings

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.560 
strings G and B the 4th and 5th strings
and<00:00:59.570> then<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:01.830> 4th<00:01:02.220> string<00:01:02.670> where<00:01:03.420> does

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and then on the 4th string where does

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.719 
and then on the 4th string where does
the<00:01:03.720> G<00:01:03.960> slide<00:01:04.409> down<00:01:05.240> and<00:01:06.650> then<00:01:07.729> right

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the G slide down and then right

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.960 
the G slide down and then right
underneath<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.290> 3rd<00:01:10.560> fret<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:13.970> then

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
underneath this the 3rd fret and then

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.149 
underneath this the 3rd fret and then
you<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.299> slide<00:01:15.570> into<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.140> third<00:01:16.380> fret<00:01:16.710> twice

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.960 

so<00:01:20.159> again<00:01:20.430> all<00:01:20.549> together<00:01:20.700> this

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.600 

and<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:27.960> crossroads<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:29.250> really

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and just like crossroads it's really

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.180 
and just like crossroads it's really
important<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.120> get<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.540> slide<00:01:31.170> down<00:01:31.620> and

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
important to get that slide down and

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.770 
important to get that slide down and
then<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.120> slide<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> make<00:01:36.420> sure<00:01:36.450> you

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
then that slide up so make sure you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.750 
then that slide up so make sure you
train<00:01:37.140> work<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.710> get<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.100> sound<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
train work to get that sound of the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:47.030 
train work to get that sound of the
slide<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:42.140> then<00:01:43.140> he<00:01:43.350> plays<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:46.470> that'll<00:01:46.830> be

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
slide and then he plays a so that'll be

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.740 
slide and then he plays a so that'll be
the<00:01:47.190> second<00:01:47.610> string<00:01:47.910> in<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.150> third<00:01:48.390> string

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the second string in the third string

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.920 
the second string in the third string
open<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.880> then<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.910> slide<00:01:52.520> into<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:54.540> fourth

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
open and then a slide into the fourth

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.060 
open and then a slide into the fourth
fret<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:56.910> that<00:01:57.360> third<00:01:57.630> string<00:01:57.960> open

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.650 

then<00:02:02.070> he<00:02:02.310> plays<00:02:02.550> his<00:02:02.880> typical<00:02:03.210> turnaround

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
then he plays his typical turnaround

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.320 
then he plays his typical turnaround
where<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:05.220> third<00:02:05.520> string<00:02:05.910> he'll<00:02:06.180> be

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
where on the third string he'll be

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.690 
where on the third string he'll be
descending<00:02:06.900> chromatically<00:02:07.500> downwards<00:02:10.700> with

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
descending chromatically downwards with

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.890 
descending chromatically downwards with
an<00:02:11.880> open<00:02:12.330> fourth<00:02:12.690> string<00:02:12.780> right<00:02:13.650> above

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.960 

and<00:02:18.440> then<00:02:18.590> he<00:02:18.709> does<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.980> same<00:02:19.159> slide

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
and then he does the same slide

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:33.250 
and then he does the same slide
so<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.050> intro<00:02:22.440> altogether<00:02:22.980> is

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.580 

and<00:02:35.150> really<00:02:36.150> throughout<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.630> song<00:02:36.900> Robert

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
and really throughout the song Robert

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.559 
and really throughout the song Robert
Johnson<00:02:37.980> plays<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.489> same<00:02:38.760> sort<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.270> thing

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
Johnson plays the same sort of thing

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.100 
Johnson plays the same sort of thing
which<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.520> which<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.670> Texas<00:02:42.209> style<00:02:42.510> sort<00:02:42.959> of

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
which is which is a Texas style sort of

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.870 
which is which is a Texas style sort of
bass<00:02:44.239> monotonous<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.660> on<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.489> second

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
bass monotonous that is on the second

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.630 
bass monotonous that is on the second
and<00:02:48.000> third<00:02:48.180> strings<00:02:48.980> hitting<00:02:49.980> them<00:02:50.130> both<00:02:50.340> with

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
and third strings hitting them both with

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.509 
and third strings hitting them both with
this<00:02:50.819> stuff<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.069> a<00:02:53.160> little<00:02:53.310> bit

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
this stuff and this is a little bit

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.309 
this stuff and this is a little bit
different<00:02:53.940> from<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.300> playing<00:02:54.569> one<00:02:54.840> string

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
different from just playing one string

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.860 
different from just playing one string
so<00:02:55.650> trying<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.519> get<00:02:56.670> an<00:02:56.760> even<00:02:57.209> sound<00:02:57.480> across

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
so trying to get an even sound across

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.479 
so trying to get an even sound across
both<00:02:58.140> strings<00:02:58.650> when<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.010> hit<00:02:59.160> them<00:02:59.310> with<00:02:59.340> your

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
both strings when you hit them with your

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:07.699 
both strings when you hit them with your
thumb<00:02:59.849> and<00:03:01.220> then<00:03:02.220> he<00:03:02.430> plays<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.730> sort<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:06.709> where

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
thumb and then he plays a sort of where

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.490 
thumb and then he plays a sort of where
he<00:03:07.769> slides<00:03:08.100> into<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.400> 12th<00:03:08.910> fret<00:03:09.209> on<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.780> 5th

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
he slides into the 12th fret on the 5th

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.210 
he slides into the 12th fret on the 5th
string<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.630> then<00:03:12.630> hits<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.989> top<00:03:13.620> two<00:03:13.890> strings

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
string and then hits the top two strings

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.640 
string and then hits the top two strings
together<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:18.330> get<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.780> actual<00:03:19.170> sound<00:03:19.470> of

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
together and to get the actual sound of

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.970 
together and to get the actual sound of
it<00:03:19.860> if<00:03:20.580> you<00:03:20.760> want<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.000> get<00:03:21.090> into<00:03:21.209> details<00:03:21.980> get

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
it if you want to get into details get

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.520 
it if you want to get into details get
that<00:03:23.160> first<00:03:23.670> sort<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.120> attack<00:03:24.540> note<00:03:24.900> really

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
that first sort of attack note really

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.280 
that first sort of attack note really
short<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.220> brief<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.810> then<00:03:27.810> hit<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.019> double

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
short and brief and then hit a double

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.940 
short and brief and then hit a double
start<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:33.110> that<00:03:34.110> will<00:03:34.230> give<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.590> sort<00:03:34.830> of

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
start and that will give it a sort of

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.610 
start and that will give it a sort of
bite<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.510> wouldn't<00:03:36.840> otherwise<00:03:37.049> have

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
bite that you it wouldn't otherwise have

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.819 
bite that you it wouldn't otherwise have
so<00:03:38.390> really<00:03:39.390> he<00:03:39.510> just<00:03:39.540> scatters<00:03:40.230> this<00:03:40.470> all<00:03:40.650> over

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
so really he just scatters this all over

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.300 
so really he just scatters this all over
the<00:03:40.980> place<00:03:41.100> on<00:03:41.640> all<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.209> beats<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:43.100> when<00:03:44.100> we

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
the place on all the beats so when we

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.250 
the place on all the beats so when we
actually<00:03:44.459> play<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:44.970> right<00:03:45.150> now<00:03:45.390> it's<00:03:45.600> just<00:03:45.870> an

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
actually play it right now it's just an

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:58.980 
actually play it right now it's just an
example<00:03:46.470> of<00:03:46.950> what<00:03:47.190> he<00:03:47.340> might<00:03:47.489> play<00:03:47.730> so

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:08.050 

so<00:03:59.990> in<00:04:00.320> that<00:04:00.650> sense<00:04:01.070> we're<00:04:01.340> playing<00:04:06.850> with<00:04:07.850> that

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
so in that sense we're playing with that

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.570 
so in that sense we're playing with that
slide<00:04:08.390> starting<00:04:08.900> at<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.110> tenth<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:10.250> then

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
slide starting at the tenth and then

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.010 
slide starting at the tenth and then
twelve<00:04:11.390> frets<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:13.750> he'll<00:04:14.750> actually

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
twelve frets and he'll actually

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.590 
twelve frets and he'll actually
sometimes<00:04:15.470> come<00:04:15.980> down<00:04:16.250> after<00:04:16.730> he<00:04:17.150> does<00:04:17.299> one<00:04:17.480> of

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
sometimes come down after he does one of

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.080 
sometimes come down after he does one of
those<00:04:17.690> slides<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.320> play<00:04:18.680> this<00:04:21.670> so<00:04:22.670> that<00:04:22.850> will<00:04:22.940> be

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
those slides I play this so that will be

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.450 
those slides I play this so that will be
first<00:04:23.720> finger<00:04:24.200> on<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:24.500> second<00:04:24.920> fret<00:04:24.950> of<00:04:25.250> the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
first finger on the second fret of the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.050 
first finger on the second fret of the
third<00:04:25.790> string<00:04:27.250> of<00:04:28.250> course<00:04:28.580> playing<00:04:28.850> the

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
third string of course playing the

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.040 
third string of course playing the
second<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:29.930> third<00:04:30.110> strings<00:04:30.440> together<00:04:33.700> and

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
second and third strings together and

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.810 
second and third strings together and
another<00:04:36.050> way<00:04:36.260> you<00:04:36.320> can<00:04:36.470> get<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.740> an<00:04:37.100> even<00:04:37.430> more

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
another way you can get a an even more

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.610 
another way you can get a an even more
authentic<00:04:38.360> sound<00:04:38.540> is<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:38.780> get<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.050> up<00:04:39.200> strokes

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
authentic sound is to get the up strokes

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:59.470 
authentic sound is to get the up strokes
in<00:04:39.830> there<00:04:39.980> too<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:58.640> you'll<00:04:59.000> really<00:04:59.180> have<00:04:59.330> to

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
in there too and you'll really have to

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.380 
in there too and you'll really have to
work<00:04:59.690> at<00:04:59.840> getting<00:05:00.050> that<00:05:00.290> slide<00:05:00.650> up<00:05:01.130> here<00:05:01.730> and

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
work at getting that slide up here and

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.360 
work at getting that slide up here and
also<00:05:02.630> kind<00:05:03.050> way<00:05:03.290> back<00:05:03.560> down<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:04.010> play<00:05:04.220> that

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
also kind way back down to play that

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.790 
also kind way back down to play that
bass<00:05:04.610> line<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.210> then<00:05:05.690> going<00:05:05.930> way<00:05:06.169> back<00:05:06.500> up

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
bass line and then going way back up

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.570 
bass line and then going way back up
without<00:05:07.490> getting<00:05:07.700> too<00:05:08.060> many<00:05:08.770> beats<00:05:09.770> lost<00:05:10.160> or

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
without getting too many beats lost or

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.840 
without getting too many beats lost or
too<00:05:11.000> many<00:05:11.830> extraneous<00:05:12.830> sounds<00:05:13.340> being<00:05:13.550> played

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
too many extraneous sounds being played

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.480 
too many extraneous sounds being played
so<00:05:14.570> you<00:05:14.630> can<00:05:14.840> work<00:05:14.990> at<00:05:15.200> that<00:05:15.410> the<00:05:16.040> other<00:05:16.070> thing

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
so you can work at that the other thing

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.630 
so you can work at that the other thing
he<00:05:17.150> played<00:05:17.480> is<00:05:17.630> when<00:05:17.810> he<00:05:17.930> actually<00:05:18.640> deviates

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
he played is when he actually deviates

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.590 
he played is when he actually deviates
from<00:05:19.790> this<00:05:20.590> theme<00:05:21.590> is<00:05:22.310> he'll<00:05:22.640> play<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.180> top

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
from this theme is he'll play the top

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.870 
from this theme is he'll play the top
two<00:05:23.930> strings<00:05:24.350> at<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.530> third<00:05:24.860> fret<00:05:25.220> and<00:05:25.520> you

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
two strings at the third fret and you

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.720 
two strings at the third fret and you
can<00:05:26.030> bar<00:05:26.270> this<00:05:26.510> with<00:05:27.010> for<00:05:28.010> example<00:05:28.070> your<00:05:28.490> third

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
can bar this with for example your third

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:40.970 
can bar this with for example your third
finger<00:05:28.940> any<00:05:29.450> places

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.180 

and<00:05:41.980> so<00:05:42.780> you'll<00:05:43.780> want<00:05:44.050> to<00:05:44.110> get<00:05:44.260> a<00:05:44.290> really<00:05:44.590> some

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
and so you'll want to get a really some

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.930 
and so you'll want to get a really some
extra<00:05:46.180> staccato<00:05:46.630> sound<00:05:46.960> here<00:05:47.380> and<00:05:47.640> snap<00:05:48.640> the

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
extra staccato sound here and snap the

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.510 
extra staccato sound here and snap the
strings<00:05:49.330> with<00:05:49.900> your<00:05:49.930> top<00:05:50.530> with<00:05:50.950> your<00:05:51.100> index

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
strings with your top with your index

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.120 
strings with your top with your index
and<00:05:51.730> middle<00:05:51.820> fingers<00:05:53.730> and<00:05:55.530> then<00:05:56.530> with<00:05:56.860> your

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
and middle fingers and then with your

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.620 
and middle fingers and then with your
thumb<00:05:57.610> you'll<00:05:57.820> want<00:05:58.090> to<00:05:58.150> have<00:05:58.330> a<00:05:58.360> really

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
thumb you'll want to have a really

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:05.670 
thumb you'll want to have a really
bouncy<00:05:59.350> bass<00:05:59.890> line<00:06:03.060> and<00:06:04.260> notice<00:06:05.260> how<00:06:05.530> we're

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
bouncy bass line and notice how we're

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.200 
bouncy bass line and notice how we're
still<00:06:06.100> adding<00:06:06.370> in<00:06:06.700> that<00:06:06.940> little

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
still adding in that little

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:19.020 
still adding in that little
embellishment<00:06:07.840> on<00:06:07.930> the<00:06:07.990> bass<00:06:08.260> line<00:06:17.520> so<00:06:18.520> master

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
embellishment on the bass line so master

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.770 
embellishment on the bass line so master
Robert<00:06:19.300> Johnson<00:06:19.900> plays<00:06:20.320> that<00:06:21.220> theme<00:06:24.780> he'll

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
Robert Johnson plays that theme he'll

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.970 
Robert Johnson plays that theme he'll
play<00:06:26.110> a<00:06:26.980> turnaround<00:06:27.610> that<00:06:28.650> is<00:06:29.650> a<00:06:29.710> bit

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
play a turnaround that is a bit

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.470 
play a turnaround that is a bit
different<00:06:30.190> than<00:06:30.400> what<00:06:30.670> he<00:06:30.850> plays<00:06:31.150> in<00:06:31.390> the

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
different than what he plays in the

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.280 
different than what he plays in the
intro<00:06:31.980> so<00:06:32.980> this<00:06:33.250> will<00:06:33.460> involve<00:06:33.790> the<00:06:34.660> 3rd<00:06:35.020> and

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
intro so this will involve the 3rd and

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.080 
intro so this will involve the 3rd and
4th<00:06:35.770> strings<00:06:36.130> playing<00:06:36.790> that<00:06:37.000> same<00:06:37.180> sort<00:06:37.480> of

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
4th strings playing that same sort of

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.400 
4th strings playing that same sort of
but<00:06:40.090> this<00:06:40.300> time<00:06:40.540> we're<00:06:40.720> going<00:06:40.810> to<00:06:40.900> be<00:06:40.990> adding

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
but this time we're going to be adding

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.380 
but this time we're going to be adding
the<00:06:41.530> octave<00:06:42.070> on<00:06:42.220> the<00:06:42.370> first<00:06:42.670> string<00:06:43.090> the

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.390 
the octave on the first string the

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.540 
the octave on the first string the
bottom<00:06:43.750> string<00:06:44.020> so<00:06:44.980> that<00:06:45.100> way<00:06:45.280> we'll<00:06:45.460> be

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
bottom string so that way we'll be

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.660 
bottom string so that way we'll be
playing<00:06:45.760> is<00:06:49.920> that's<00:06:50.920> really<00:06:51.340> the<00:06:51.460> general

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.670 
playing is that's really the general

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.450 
playing is that's really the general
sound

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.540 

and<00:06:56.200> so<00:06:57.200> of<00:06:57.500> course<00:06:57.800> he'll<00:06:57.950> be<00:06:58.040> playing<00:06:58.310> the

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
and so of course he'll be playing the

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.460 
and so of course he'll be playing the
top<00:06:58.790> two<00:06:59.060> strings<00:06:59.120> first<00:06:59.570> and<00:06:59.930> then<00:07:00.080> the<00:07:00.260> bass

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
top two strings first and then the bass

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:06.660 
top two strings first and then the bass
and<00:07:00.860> so<00:07:01.550> this<00:07:01.760> is<00:07:01.910> how<00:07:02.060> we<00:07:02.120> actually<00:07:02.360> plays<00:07:02.840> it

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:06.670 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.520 

and<00:07:07.670> he'll<00:07:07.970> always<00:07:08.390> kind<00:07:08.660> of<00:07:08.720> change<00:07:09.050> it<00:07:09.260> up<00:07:09.410> a

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
and he'll always kind of change it up a

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.420 
and he'll always kind of change it up a
bit<00:07:09.560> but<00:07:10.340> in<00:07:10.460> general<00:07:10.490> if<00:07:11.180> he<00:07:11.480> does<00:07:11.980> offset<00:07:12.980> the

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
bit but in general if he does offset the

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.110 
bit but in general if he does offset the
bass<00:07:13.700> and<00:07:14.060> the<00:07:14.810> the<00:07:15.500> mid-range<00:07:15.920> strays<00:07:16.460> he'll

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
bass and the the mid-range strays he'll

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.240 
bass and the the mid-range strays he'll
play<00:07:17.270> the<00:07:17.300> mid-range<00:07:17.780> strings<00:07:18.200> first<00:07:18.470> so<00:07:18.890> for

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.250 
play the mid-range strings first so for

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.700 
play the mid-range strings first so for
example
