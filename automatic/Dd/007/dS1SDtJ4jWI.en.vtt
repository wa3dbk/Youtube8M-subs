00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.259
 good below I bring you this 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:09.630
 motorcycle model triumph 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.490
 600 series 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.730
 Well, well, there is a detail of the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.000
 directional lack of a screw and in the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.000
 fairing 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.630
 the tire, I think that still 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.360
 it's okay 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.160
 This'm out there on the seat 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.820
 and if it's cracked as you can see it 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.000
 I have a roof and that's why it affects you 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.270
 Apparently this with child then good was 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.730
 something repainted because 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.730
 the color there is very very well still 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.079
 the charges are the original 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.910
 they are complete missing a screw and 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.030
 down 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.670
 another up here missing vents the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.820
 tube is not loose but if it does 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.910
 missing the pair of lies 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.309
 the strangers are the originals the achievement 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.530
 that are some little details then of 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.270
 normal aesthetics of uses are not 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.969
 fractured 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.969
 and the moons, well, they are whole 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.009
 scream the bike is cold touched me 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.430
 it's completely cold the exhaust I think 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.930
 what is accessory is your brothers 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.930
 and well, we are going to learn it 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.480
 more green 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.790
 clutch 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.790
 what is 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.790
 switched on 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.060
 and nothing 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.950
 the typical noise of a tribe 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.380
 He commented on our hot 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.909
 in the always celebrate 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.260
 in the original macro 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.280
 terrible 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.150
 only if they work 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.380
 in the size of the directional 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.220
 no antifreeze vats here still 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.220
 see all green 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.260
 will work board 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.230
 here in the front mirror is sung 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.230
 in front of the low 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.069
 directional 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.069
 do they work 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.370
 it is not on 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.420
 course to temperature 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.830
 it seems the narration 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.830
 I will accelerate a little here 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.209
