either personally I love the art in this
title<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.370> think<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.700> art<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.059> very

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
title I think that art is very

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.060 
title I think that art is very
experimental<00:00:51.899> very<00:00:52.379> different<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
experimental very different to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.590 
experimental very different to
everything<00:00:53.340> else<00:00:53.610> DC's<00:00:54.030> doing<00:00:54.270> at<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> moment

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
everything else DC's doing at the moment

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.209 
everything else DC's doing at the moment
and<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.170> feel<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.469> everyone<00:00:55.770> should<00:00:55.920> just

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
and I feel like everyone should just

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.189 
and I feel like everyone should just
pick<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.820> issue<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> series<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:58.079> the

art alone support that artist but the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.390 
art alone support that artist but the
writing<00:01:02.120> it's<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.449> bad<00:01:03.750> I'm<00:01:04.199> sorry<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.070> idea

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400

phenomenal I love the idea of technology
versus<00:01:11.010> magic<00:01:11.450> but<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:13.290> really<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.680> does<00:01:14.100> not

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
versus magic but it really just does not

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.910

go<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:14.909> Clarion<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> witch<00:01:15.689> boy<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.290> think<00:01:16.619> DC

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
go with Clarion the witch boy I think DC

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.469 
go with Clarion the witch boy I think DC
might<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.490> aware<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.240> they<00:01:18.299> just

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
might be aware of that and they just

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.810 
might be aware of that and they just
might<00:01:18.689> want<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> raise<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.130> from<00:01:20.400> Clarion

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
might want to raise this from Clarion

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.600 
might want to raise this from Clarion
history<00:01:21.360> which<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:22.320> than<00:01:22.530> justified<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
history which is more than justified the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.520

next<00:01:23.880> Batwoman<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.450> being<00:01:24.659> cancelled<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.409> I'm

next Batwoman is being cancelled and I'm

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
next Batwoman is being cancelled and I'm
really<00:01:26.490> sad<00:01:26.850> about<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:27.689> I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
really sad about this one because I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.440 
really sad about this one because I
loved<00:01:28.560> its<00:01:28.890> initial<00:01:29.430> run<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.820> pieces<00:01:30.270> I

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
loved its initial run to pieces I

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.510 
loved its initial run to pieces I
thought<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.020> was<00:01:31.170> amazing<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.890> thought<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.400> was

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
thought it was amazing I thought it was

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.490 
thought it was amazing I thought it was
a<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:32.640> mature<00:01:33.000> comic<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.380> thought

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
a very mature comic and I just thought

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.100 
a very mature comic and I just thought
it<00:01:34.680> was<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.490> groundbreaking<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.659> its<00:01:36.780> time

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
it was so groundbreaking for its time

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.560 
it was so groundbreaking for its time
and<00:01:37.380> now<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.920> ending<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:39.180> wanted<00:01:39.450> it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and now it's ending and I just wanted it

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.380 
and now it's ending and I just wanted it
to<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.869> next<00:01:40.729> long-running<00:01:41.729> comic<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
to be that next long-running comic that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.300 
to be that next long-running comic that
has<00:01:42.540> some<00:01:42.720> good<00:01:42.930> bits<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.409> bad<00:01:43.619> bits<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.100> for

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
has some good bits and bad bits but for

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.780 
has some good bits and bad bits but for
some<00:01:44.520> reason<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.329> keeps<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.920> but

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
some reason it just keeps on going but

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.249 
some reason it just keeps on going but
it's<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.509> because<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.049> being

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it's not that because it's being

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.530 
it's not that because it's being
cancelled<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.009> next<00:01:50.430> Secret<00:01:50.909> Origins<00:01:51.149> is

cancelled and next Secret Origins is
being<00:01:51.810> cancelled<00:01:52.170> which<00:01:52.619> brings<00:01:52.920> me<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.220> a

being cancelled which brings me on to a

new point could Secret Origins be

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.859 
new point could Secret Origins be
getting<00:01:56.130> cancels<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:56.729> DC<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.509> bringing

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
getting cancels because DC is bringing

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.080 
getting cancels because DC is bringing

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
to the new 52 I don't want it to be like

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.230 
to the new 52 I don't want it to be like
the<00:02:39.170> lesser<00:02:39.650> DC<00:02:40.250> universe<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.820> want<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.150> be

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
the lesser DC universe I want it to be

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.840 
the lesser DC universe I want it to be
equal<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.350> love<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.920> old<00:02:43.040> universe<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.700> did

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
equal I love the old universe and it did

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.090 
equal I love the old universe and it did
so<00:02:44.240> much<00:02:44.510> for<00:02:44.570> comics<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.650> could<00:02:45.800> not<00:02:46.040> be

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
so much for comics that it could not be

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.880 
so much for comics that it could not be
the<00:02:46.580> lesser<00:02:47.000> one<00:02:47.210> just<00:02:47.780> due<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.200> its<00:02:48.500> history

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
the lesser one just due to its history

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.340 
the lesser one just due to its history
and<00:02:49.280> due<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.700> its<00:02:49.850> nature<00:02:50.180> now<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:50.810> love<00:02:51.140> the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
and due to its nature now I love the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.960 
and due to its nature now I love the
ultimate<00:02:51.680> universe<00:02:51.980> don't<00:02:52.340> get<00:02:52.550> me<00:02:52.670> wrong<00:02:52.700> I

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
ultimate universe don't get me wrong I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.230 
ultimate universe don't get me wrong I
think<00:02:53.240> it's<00:02:53.360> fantastic<00:02:54.310> but<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.550> was<00:02:55.700> made<00:02:55.940> so

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
think it's fantastic but it was made so

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.060 
think it's fantastic but it was made so
writers<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.690> artists<00:02:57.140> could<00:02:57.260> experiment<00:02:57.709> and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
writers and artists could experiment and

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.980 
writers and artists could experiment and
reimagine<00:02:58.700> characters<00:02:59.209> but<00:02:59.600> they<00:02:59.720> wouldn't

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
reimagine characters but they wouldn't

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.720 
reimagine characters but they wouldn't
really<00:03:00.170> be<00:03:00.320> able<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.530> play<00:03:00.830> with<00:03:01.070> in<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.459> main

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
really be able to play with in the main

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.390 
really be able to play with in the main
universe<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:02.930> that<00:03:03.080> being<00:03:03.290> said<00:03:03.350> wouldn't<00:03:04.280> the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
universe so that being said wouldn't the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.610 
universe so that being said wouldn't the
new<00:03:04.580> 52<00:03:04.970> be<00:03:05.360> DC's<00:03:05.780> equivalent<00:03:06.350> of<00:03:06.470> the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
new 52 be DC's equivalent of the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.980 
new 52 be DC's equivalent of the
ultimate<00:03:07.070> universe<00:03:07.520> by<00:03:07.940> its<00:03:08.180> nature<00:03:08.270> because

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
ultimate universe by its nature because

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.170 
ultimate universe by its nature because
it<00:03:09.020> was<00:03:09.290> made<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:09.770> writers<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.250> artists<00:03:10.760> could

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
it was made so writers and artists could

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.570 
it was made so writers and artists could
experiment<00:03:11.630> with<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.260> reimagine<00:03:12.950> characters

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
experiment with and reimagine characters

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.180 
experiment with and reimagine characters
and<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.390> old<00:03:14.540> universe<00:03:14.930> has<00:03:15.110> such<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.380> huge<00:03:15.830> and

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
and the old universe has such a huge and

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.199 
and the old universe has such a huge and
such<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.640> long<00:03:16.970> history<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:18.170> can't<00:03:18.530> really

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
such a long history you can't really

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.759 
such a long history you can't really
experiment<00:03:20.209> with<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.570> you<00:03:20.930> can<00:03:21.110> create<00:03:21.260> new

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
experiment with it you can create new

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.250 
experiment with it you can create new
characters<00:03:22.070> to<00:03:22.580> add<00:03:22.760> things<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.480> mix<00:03:23.750> but

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
characters to add things to the mix but

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.170 
characters to add things to the mix but
it's<00:03:24.380> not<00:03:24.500> really<00:03:24.739> there<00:03:24.920> for<00:03:24.980> reimagining<00:03:25.970> or

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
it's not really there for reimagining or

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.390 
it's not really there for reimagining or
for<00:03:26.480> playing<00:03:26.810> with<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.650> being<00:03:27.830> said<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.160> like

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
for playing with that being said I like

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.130 
for playing with that being said I like
the<00:03:28.610> new<00:03:28.730> 52<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.209> think<00:03:29.480> it's<00:03:29.600> done<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.750> lot<00:03:30.019> of

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
the new 52 I think it's done a lot of

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.100 
the new 52 I think it's done a lot of
really<00:03:30.560> good<00:03:30.769> fun<00:03:31.370> things<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:32.390> I<00:03:32.690> would<00:03:32.989> like

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
really good fun things so I would like

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.440 
really good fun things so I would like
to<00:03:33.290> see<00:03:33.470> both<00:03:33.830> universes<00:03:34.580> being<00:03:34.970> treated<00:03:35.209> as

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
to see both universes being treated as

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.590 
to see both universes being treated as
equal<00:03:36.050> running<00:03:36.590> alongside<00:03:36.950> each<00:03:37.700> other<00:03:38.000> and

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
equal running alongside each other and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.140 
equal running alongside each other and
because<00:03:39.019> of<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.350> nature<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.890> new<00:03:40.010> 52<00:03:40.400> it

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
because of the nature of the new 52 it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.170 
because of the nature of the new 52 it
would<00:03:41.510> be<00:03:41.720> DC's<00:03:42.290> equivalent<00:03:42.860> of<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.610> Ultimate
