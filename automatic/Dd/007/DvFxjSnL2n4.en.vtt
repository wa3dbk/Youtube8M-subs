00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
your car automatic oil level so that you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.149 
your car automatic oil level so that you
take<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.140> stick<00:01:01.830> and<00:01:01.860> you<00:01:02.839> pull<00:01:03.839> that<00:01:04.619> out

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
take this stick and you pull that out

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.410 
take this stick and you pull that out
and<00:01:05.690> here<00:01:06.690> here<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.030> oil

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and here here you have this the oil

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.349 
and here here you have this the oil
stick<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.369> purest<00:01:11.940> idea<00:01:12.530> that

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359 
stick and there is the purest idea that

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:19.399 
stick and there is the purest idea that
first<00:01:15.799> you<00:01:16.799> need<00:01:17.100> cotton<00:01:17.820> cloth<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.079> can

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
first you need cotton cloth that you can

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.999 
first you need cotton cloth that you can
clean<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.479> stick<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.289> that<00:01:22.560> when<00:01:22.799> you

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
clean this stick in in that when you

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.419 
clean this stick in in that when you
clean<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.969> cotton<00:01:24.390> coat<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:26.070> check

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
clean the cotton coat and then you check

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.969 
clean the cotton coat and then you check
that<00:01:26.570> but<00:01:27.570> there<00:01:27.840> are<00:01:27.869> two<00:01:29.149> two<00:01:30.170> marks<00:01:31.170> this

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that but there are two two marks this

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.069 
that but there are two two marks this
lower<00:01:32.280> rubber<00:01:33.000> part<00:01:34.100> in<00:01:35.100> here<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
lower rubber part in here this is the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.429 
lower rubber part in here this is the
clove<00:01:37.859> level<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.609> then<00:01:39.179> this<00:01:39.359> upper<00:01:39.869> part<00:01:40.200> is

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
clove level and then this upper part is

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.340 
clove level and then this upper part is
the<00:01:40.729> full<00:01:41.729> level<00:01:42.149> and

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.660 

your<00:01:46.010> oil<00:01:46.340> must<00:01:46.760> be<00:01:47.119> always<00:01:47.479> in<00:01:48.080> this<00:01:48.670> pool

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
your oil must be always in this pool

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.960 
your oil must be always in this pool
level<00:01:52.479> area<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:53.720> how<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.590> measure<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.190> now

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
level area and how to measure it now

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.510
