00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.480
 so that of the unemployed terrier of 2008 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.100
 2009 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.380
 that's the way it is but you can pull that 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.410
 with what begins like too much on it 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:35.390
 we put the thinnest and x 185 and it takes 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.390
 not me yes he emphasizes it very well 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:47.730
 in 309 27 in they are workers you 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.309
 see you must not right to the agreement they 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.340
 are workers for it's for better 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.010
 mixture agrees and you feel that there is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.550
 a real effect of offering or is it a 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.289
 mix well yeah yeah so that's it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.670
 an art also to know in what order 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.439
 you have to put your teeth when you 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.030
 mounted 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:10.580
 there is a plan no no it is passed 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.140
 no matter how 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.570
 there is a row of wind that is in a 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.409
 sense a row of downtown streets that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.140
 is in the other direction and put it away 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.020
 behind it's one on two left right 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.570
 to balance balanced time so you 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.060
 do not aim 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.320
 no I suppose the claws the state no 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.159
 but let's say that 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:44.850
 question of unemployment, that's fine 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.340
 in stubble farming according to words are 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.300
 stubble very little at first we do not bury 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.460
 no we take ten centimeters what's up 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.710
 and after when we're there for the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.390
 fall sowing in December as long as we 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.979
 can what if we can go to 15 matches 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.259
 but hey right now you have to go for the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.140
 shoot one so that's already 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.209
 happened that there are fields I am 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.200
 forced to work like that man 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.300
 in this configuration there let's say that 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.110
 if we wanted stubble and that he 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.610
 had to go at a certain speed 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.060
 so I preferred to work tools 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.130
 closed then there the savoie the speed he 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:32.310
 it has necessarily me I see ggd unemployed but 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.290
 Beets there but if so it goes to 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.570
 to say we're bald is like that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.080
 safran fra a land that will not be 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.880
 burst too hungry or too big in the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.739
 purse that makes that we did semi 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.910
 super 4 to jo toys that have already been 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:54.720
 changed once task in gt you 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.630
 why because use them band of 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.140
 rolling he is completely at the 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.360
 scrap locke party so much it wears 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.400
 He hectares of mud and 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.720
 bottles to him 1 that's normal that 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.799
 end of four thousand hectares we change 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.310
 the roads which also had that is that 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.930
 last year 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.570
 given that there has been a lot of 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.579
 tired the builder mister terrier 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:25.019
 No one came to us when reinforcements 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:27.420
 here it did not exist at the monte 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.820
 the origin of the interesting spar was 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.500
 not been no yes because they were 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.459
 they began to crack on 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.850
 lorthioir so sir earthen us 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.069
 handed it over with a tyrant there and then 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.499
 the device 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.560
 driving on the other side so that's it 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:47.569
 could move one you see you see that has moved 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.969
 there but that's because painting 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.189
 remained thus see he made 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:55.790
 the equivalent of the other side 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:57.319
 so the builder terrier ca me 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.340
 terrel I think it's in the flank 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.900
 right not even been queen have you see him 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.900
 donations that strengthen you 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.590
 so he reinforced he came to us 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.560
 resolder 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.719
 since his ad or g and it's not too much 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.750
 heavy for the tractor for 1,180 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:19.729
 horses 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.950
 I guess he's making his weight 180 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.250
 horses 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.230
 you do not need me there would be 200 horses 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.430
 it would be better 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.420
 is what it is not too much of a draw 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.420
 unemployed side
