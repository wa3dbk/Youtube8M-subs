 I could make use of 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.059
 within others 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.089

 and today he has placed 1 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.569
 this we give you respect the syntax of the file 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 author a point in his then I have to stay about 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:37.419
