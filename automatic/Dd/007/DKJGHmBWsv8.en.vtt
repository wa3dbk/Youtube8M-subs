00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.270
 the case allows us to evaluate the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.830
 our genetic predisposition a 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.250
 develop related diseases 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.250
 power 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.840
 the test is carried out at the level 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.060
 outpatient taking a swab of 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.790
 saliva and explaining damonte writing in 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.619
 a special analysis laboratory is 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.989
 necessary to take the test to understand the 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.250
 genetic susceptibility to develop 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.079
 some pathologies 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.059
 in fact the foods that we 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.950
 we introduce may favor or 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.820
 prevent the onset of these 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.950
 diseases 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.559
 so the genomic cast is one 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.719
 Screening at the genetic end evaluated 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.300
 thus the genetic susceptibility of the 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.640
 patient it is possible to provide him with 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.219
 protective molecules in a manner 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.050
 natural of the food we take in so 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.480
 such that these go to delay 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.469
 the onset of that pathology for the 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.469
 which we are prepared for 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.640
 the test must not be understood and played 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.920
 mind but must be inserted into a contraction 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.690
 overall of the patient taking into account 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.250
 here white of his exams of 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.910
 laboratory and its lifestyle 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.910
 current 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.360
 in practice the genetic test serves to 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.310
 know our age religions then 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.810
 our weaknesses to have the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.540
 possibility to counter it 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.790
 effectively slowing down or even 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.470
 avoiding the needs of these pathologies 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.780
 therefore it is possible with the power supply 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.780
 change our metabolic fate 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.470
 the test was said in the study ad 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.390
 andria in via montegrappa number 4 for 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.580
 information or reservations is possible 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.130
 contact by telephone or through 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.759
