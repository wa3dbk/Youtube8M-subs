okay let's just try to play let's go

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.620 
okay let's just try to play let's go
ahead<00:02:58.200> five<00:02:59.200> you<00:03:00.010> want<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.190> go<00:03:00.250> first<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.880> just

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
ahead five you want to go first you just

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.990 
ahead five you want to go first you just
roll<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.840> dice<00:03:01.959> just<00:03:02.350> move<00:03:02.620> all<00:03:02.950> right<00:03:03.160> one

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
roll the dice just move all right one

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.440 
roll the dice just move all right one
two<00:03:04.299> three<00:03:04.870> four<00:03:05.260> five<00:03:06.000> okay<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.209> there's<00:03:07.360> an

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
two three four five okay and there's an

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.420 
two three four five okay and there's an
arrow<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.900> points<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.590> red<00:03:08.769> thing<00:03:09.070> I

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
arrow that points to the red thing I

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.220 
arrow that points to the red thing I
think<00:03:09.730> that's<00:03:09.970> just<00:03:10.209> that's<00:03:10.930> just<00:03:11.019> the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
think that's just that's just the

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.840 
think that's just that's just the
director<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:11.920> can<00:03:12.130> read<00:03:12.430> do<00:03:12.579> you<00:03:12.670> read

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
director you can read do you read

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.039 
director you can read do you read
Chinese<00:03:13.320> yes<00:03:14.320> but<00:03:14.470> I'm<00:03:14.590> choosing<00:03:14.920> those<00:03:15.040> okay

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
Chinese yes but I'm choosing those okay

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.090 
Chinese yes but I'm choosing those okay
now<00:03:17.049> while<00:03:17.230> you're<00:03:17.350> rolling<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.769> just<00:03:17.920> want<00:03:18.040> to

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
Spearman characters you can see all over

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.479 
Spearman characters you can see all over
this<00:03:21.989> yeah<00:03:22.989> there's<00:03:23.290> there's<00:03:23.829> Mary<00:03:24.250> Jane

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
Watson it's from the Clone Saga there's

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.750 
Watson it's from the Clone Saga there's
this<00:03:29.860> one's<00:03:30.100> actually<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.489> clone<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:30.850> hydro-man

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
this one's actually a clone of hydro-man

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.490 
this one's actually a clone of hydro-man
yes<00:03:33.760> when<00:03:34.420> this<00:03:34.570> one's<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.870> an<00:03:34.930> ultimate

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
yes when this one's in an ultimate

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.550 
yes when this one's in an ultimate
that's<00:03:35.650> just<00:03:35.920> Ben<00:03:36.070> Riley<00:03:36.900> right<00:03:37.900> there<00:03:38.320> you

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
that's just Ben Riley right there you

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.599 
that's just Ben Riley right there you
can<00:03:38.769> see<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.959> tree<00:03:41.290> there's<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.100> face<00:03:42.340> on<00:03:42.579> it

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
can see the tree there's a face on it

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.000 
can see the tree there's a face on it
there's<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.739> dr.<00:03:44.739> dine<00:03:45.489> octopus<00:03:46.410> yeah<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.769> think

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
there's a dr. dine octopus yeah I think

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.680 
there's a dr. dine octopus yeah I think
that's<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.250> Rhino

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
that's the Rhino

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.690 
that's the Rhino
there's<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.989> derpy<00:03:50.410> horse<00:03:50.650> in<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.340> river

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
there's the derpy horse in the river

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.420 
there's the derpy horse in the river
I<00:03:51.780> think<00:03:52.780> that's<00:03:52.930> hydro-man<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:54.130> could<00:03:54.310> be

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
I think that's hydro-man that could be

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.010 
I think that's hydro-man that could be
high<00:03:54.550> german<00:03:54.880> hydro-man<00:03:55.540> there's<00:03:55.750> clearly

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
high german hydro-man there's clearly

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.990 
high german hydro-man there's clearly
Kraven<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.440> hunter<00:03:56.739> yeah<00:03:57.459> there's<00:03:57.849> the

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
Kraven the hunter yeah there's the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.490 
Kraven the hunter yeah there's the
Shocker<00:03:58.300> yeah

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
Shocker yeah

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.270
