00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
welcome back to sin - red corner today

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.710 
welcome back to sin - red corner today
we're<00:00:02.490> going<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.669> talk<00:00:02.790> about<00:00:03.000> lead<00:00:03.240> guitar

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
we're going to talk about lead guitar

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.930 
we're going to talk about lead guitar
harmonization<00:00:04.290> there's<00:00:05.220> two<00:00:05.400> ways<00:00:05.580> about

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
harmonization there's two ways about

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.380 
harmonization there's two ways about
this

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
this

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.940 
this
there's<00:00:06.779> plain<00:00:07.080> old<00:00:07.290> scalar<00:00:07.919> or

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
there's plain old scalar or

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.980 
there's plain old scalar or
harmonization<00:00:08.880> which<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.240> what<00:00:09.389> Iron<00:00:09.570> Maiden

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
harmonization which is what Iron Maiden

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.900 
harmonization which is what Iron Maiden
and<00:00:10.139> bossed<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.860> usually<00:00:11.160> do<00:00:11.370> where<00:00:11.790> they're

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
and bossed and usually do where they're

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.430 
and bossed and usually do where they're
playing<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.210> same<00:00:12.269> pattern<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:12.990> one<00:00:13.139> guitar

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
playing the same pattern that one guitar

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.379 
playing the same pattern that one guitar
is<00:00:13.559> playing<00:00:13.799> up<00:00:14.160> or<00:00:14.429> down<00:00:14.580> two<00:00:14.880> notes<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
is playing up or down two notes in the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.980 
is playing up or down two notes in the
scale<00:00:15.570> like<00:00:16.379> on<00:00:16.590> Aces<00:00:16.920> High<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:21.840> other

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
scale like on Aces High we get the other

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.070 
scale like on Aces High we get the other
guitar<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.470> doing

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.330 

all<00:00:26.080> right<00:00:26.170> see<00:00:26.619> how<00:00:26.710> that<00:00:26.920> works<00:00:27.130> it's<00:00:27.310> just

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
all right see how that works it's just

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.999 
all right see how that works it's just
up<00:00:27.609> two<00:00:27.789> notes<00:00:28.000> in<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.240> scale<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.650> second

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
up two notes in the scale the second

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.310 
up two notes in the scale the second
kind<00:00:30.099> of<00:00:30.220> harmonization<00:00:30.759> I<00:00:31.119> like<00:00:31.300> to<00:00:31.420> call<00:00:31.599> our

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
kind of harmonization I like to call our

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.500 
kind of harmonization I like to call our
pgo<00:00:32.860> harmonization<00:00:33.340> so<00:00:34.059> if<00:00:34.150> you're<00:00:34.270> playing

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
pgo harmonization so if you're playing

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.939 
pgo harmonization so if you're playing
something<00:00:34.809> that's<00:00:35.110> more<00:00:35.290> like<00:00:35.470> in<00:00:35.620> our<00:00:35.710> page

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
something that's more like in our page

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.939 
something that's more like in our page
view<00:00:36.160> than<00:00:36.579> a<00:00:36.699> scalar<00:00:37.180> riff<00:00:37.500> instead<00:00:38.500> of<00:00:38.620> going

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
view than a scalar riff instead of going

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.850 
view than a scalar riff instead of going
and<00:00:39.190> playing<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:39.940> second<00:00:40.390> position<00:00:41.260> up<00:00:41.500> from

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
and playing the second position up from

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.009 
and playing the second position up from
there<00:00:42.180> opportunities<00:00:43.180> on<00:00:43.269> the<00:00:43.360> scale<00:00:43.629> which

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
there opportunities on the scale which

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.009 
there opportunities on the scale which
is<00:00:44.170> probably<00:00:44.440> a<00:00:44.530> minor<00:00:44.890> arpeggio<00:00:45.610> you<00:00:46.089> play

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
is probably a minor arpeggio you play

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.250 
is probably a minor arpeggio you play
the<00:00:47.140> same<00:00:47.379> major<00:00:47.920> chord<00:00:48.370> same<00:00:49.210> finger<00:00:49.629> pattern

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
the same major chord same finger pattern

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.189 
the same major chord same finger pattern
but<00:00:51.190> up<00:00:51.339> an<00:00:51.489> inversion<00:00:51.820> or<00:00:52.180> down<00:00:52.660> an<00:00:52.900> inversion

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
but up an inversion or down an inversion

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:54.990 
but up an inversion or down an inversion
and<00:00:53.860> I<00:00:53.949> like<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.220> way<00:00:54.280> that<00:00:54.430> sounds<00:00:54.489> better

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
and I like the way that sounds better

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.850 
and I like the way that sounds better
you<00:00:55.239> don't<00:00:55.390> have<00:00:55.480> a<00:00:55.510> major<00:00:55.780> in<00:00:56.050> a<00:00:56.110> minor<00:00:56.350> mixing

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
you don't have a major in a minor mixing

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.529 
you don't have a major in a minor mixing
they're<00:00:57.039> both<00:00:57.280> major<00:00:57.640> that<00:00:57.969> both<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.300> same

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
they're both major that both the same

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.660 
they're both major that both the same
chord<00:00:58.989> so<00:00:59.680> let's<00:00:59.829> show<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.010> an<00:01:00.160> example<00:01:00.460> of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
chord so let's show you an example of

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:29.100 
chord so let's show you an example of
that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.600 

so<00:01:30.110> what<00:01:30.229> I<00:01:30.260> did<00:01:30.350> there<00:01:30.620> was<00:01:30.740> straight<00:01:31.070> scalar

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
so what I did there was straight scalar

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.340 
so what I did there was straight scalar
harmonization<00:01:32.030> except<00:01:32.600> for<00:01:32.720> that<00:01:32.780> very<00:01:33.080> last

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
harmonization except for that very last

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.170 
harmonization except for that very last
lick<00:01:33.770> because<00:01:34.100> that<00:01:34.250> was<00:01:34.340> an<00:01:34.430> arpeggio

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
lick because that was an arpeggio

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.630 
lick because that was an arpeggio
I<00:01:35.210> used<00:01:35.600> arpeggio<00:01:35.930> harmonization<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.490> the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
I used arpeggio harmonization so the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.780 
I used arpeggio harmonization so the
main<00:01:37.820> guitar<00:01:38.180> was<00:01:38.570> doing<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:41.830> this<00:01:42.830> arpeggio

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.330 

the<00:01:46.790> harmony<00:01:47.210> guitar<00:01:47.479> was<00:01:47.690> doing<00:01:47.930> this

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.010 

because<00:01:52.340> this<00:01:53.170> is<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.350> next<00:01:54.740> version<00:01:55.580> of<00:01:56.020> of

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
because this is the next version of of

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.389 
because this is the next version of of
that<00:01:58.630> both<00:01:59.630> major<00:01:59.960> chords<00:02:00.500> same<00:02:00.770> major<00:02:01.009> chord

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
that both major chords same major chord

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.010 
that both major chords same major chord
now<00:02:02.210> I'm<00:02:02.270> going<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.509> show<00:02:02.660> you<00:02:02.690> what<00:02:02.899> it<00:02:02.990> sounds

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
now I'm going to show you what it sounds

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.830 
now I'm going to show you what it sounds
like<00:02:03.350> if<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:03.740> continue<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.970> use<00:02:05.000> scaler

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
like if I continue to use scaler

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.590 
like if I continue to use scaler
harmonization<00:02:06.649> on<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:07.130> last<00:02:07.399> lick<00:02:07.850> I<00:02:08.179> think

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
harmonization on that last lick I think

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.999 
harmonization on that last lick I think
you'll<00:02:08.720> agree<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.110> doesn't<00:02:09.259> sound<00:02:09.560> nearly<00:02:09.800> as

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
you'll agree it doesn't sound nearly as

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:38.850 
you'll agree it doesn't sound nearly as
good<00:02:10.220> here<00:02:10.970> goes

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.229 

so<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.129> next<00:02:40.310> time<00:02:40.489> you<00:02:40.610> have<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.849> harmonize

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
so the next time you have to harmonize

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.119 
so the next time you have to harmonize
something<00:02:41.750> see<00:02:41.989> if<00:02:42.110> there's<00:02:42.260> any<00:02:42.409> arpeggios

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
something see if there's any arpeggios

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.619 
something see if there's any arpeggios
in<00:02:43.310> there<00:02:43.489> that<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:43.700> can<00:02:43.849> use<00:02:44.000> our<00:02:44.239> page<00:02:44.480> view

harmonization<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.640> even<00:02:46.640> if<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.849> lead<00:02:47.030> uses

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
harmonization on even if the lead uses

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.660 
harmonization on even if the lead uses
mostly<00:02:48.170> arpeggio<00:02:48.739> notes<00:02:48.950> but<00:02:49.459> there's<00:02:49.610> a

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
mostly arpeggio notes but there's a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.100 
mostly arpeggio notes but there's a
couple<00:02:49.940> notes<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.330> aren't<00:02:50.510> in<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:50.690> chord

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
couple notes that aren't in the chord

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.559 
couple notes that aren't in the chord
see<00:02:51.920> if<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.159> can<00:02:52.340> use<00:02:52.819> those<00:02:53.090> particular
