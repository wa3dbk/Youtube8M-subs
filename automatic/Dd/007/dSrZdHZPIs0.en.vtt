00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.160
 This time I want to do the led illuminations of the wiring of the headlight of DeLorean 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.160
 I will 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.300
 Until the last time i did some soldering of this LED 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.330
 This time, let's make this headlight part LED 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.289
 I want to incorporate it into the body of the area 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.739
 Well then 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.039
 I think this part is a bit black, but 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:36.920
 Because the place where I did soldering was exposed 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:39.140
 It is made of rubber which is said to be under Ness employment, and after that thick use vinyl tape well 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.149
 It is insulated with such feeling 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.020
 At the same but is Rubiamubodi in the here and open the other one hole to log in this part 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.530
 State official 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.280
 We have the Aga issue a wiring to one additional 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.280
 Well then 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.129
 When 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.129
 We hope to do this defeat, though it is finally 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.719
 You do 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.870
 Good good 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:30.880
 I 'm thinking of fixing a cold meal a 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:36.100
 Temporarily stop using the glue gun 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.630
 I hope that this Kobe class will be fixed by pasting with mapping tape . 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.750
 I 'm sorry 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.750
 Nice nice nice nice nice nice 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.510
 Put 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.510
 Pop 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.700
 Hmm 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.820
 That's the first time I 've done that light 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.409
 I did not go around so much, but still this is 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.980
 It is not we have to made a little more compact machine circuit itself of the incumbent 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.300
 This after all code gets in the way 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.470
 Because I'm messing around here 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.790
 this 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.709
 Lighting ed Incorporate this 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.849
 I'm sure according to the size of this code or here also really a little more home 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.510
 I bought near to you 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:27.420
 The ridge is a bit 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:30.480
 This time though is okay because the space is large in the anti-car kit 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.470
 When incorporating into a tiny part 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.900
 I have to be careful with this side 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:43.430
 I thought I would do it for a while now 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:44.970
 In this state, the LED is totally different, so the light is full. 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.720
 It is likely to end 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.510
 So the gap between the lake surface and the lake surface is likely to leak bang light from around 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.210
 Here is a little led 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:02.400
 Do a little way eight Kana example 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:05.510
 I 've fixed it for a while, but I'll take off 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.590
 I change a little bit 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:15.319
 It is this part of the light of the LED 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:19.970
 It is in the state of being wrapped around this black vinyl tape, and it is only this part that is vacant in the future 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:24.950
 You're So though that this is Tikal'm only on the overall 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.500
 This is done so that light does not leak from this side part by winding small milk no tape 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.490
 illumination 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:35.160
 I tried to make the qualifications not to shine. With this setting , maybe the light is omnidirectional 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.650
 Because I do not think that it leaks to 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:44.489
 I will do it with this 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:51.439
 For the time being, I used this glue gun after temporarily fixing the wiring . 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:51.439
 I think that I want to organize this line 6 or a little while fixing this wiring 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.180
 It was difficult Uno where there was a ghoul 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.180
 After all cherry blossoms 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.390
 As wiring is messed up 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.390
 It is quite difficult for Grugan mother 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:24.770
 Pretty threading 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.880
 Fixed work of defeat with glue 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.380
 Though it's a little terribly bad eye seen 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:36.930
 It turned out to be something like this 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:40.050
 In something mess and have been open-minded feeling kinda way it is also Tsukekata tool Luger 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:44.250
 It looks really bad but it's just this 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:47.760
 Not be taken in about pulling a little lawsuit also really it is a fixed force glue is of great 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.249
 Than is firmly fixed to about 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:55.830
 It is such a state 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:05:01.260
 For Iutoko when it is operating Toka line is properly that fixed 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.040
 After pat is I'm so went to this crawl on the outside but is this bar war 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.400
 Ne 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.670
 Not only red line that this electricity is through 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:13.910
 For chocolate decoration 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:19.360
 I 3 is present also this is also not laid together I'd have been bought the same kind of line three the 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:25.630
 The real thing of the form that goes together collectively is only this red line 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.689
 These remaining two sounds are black and the lines are fake 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:32.279
 I think that I want to proceed 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:34.289
 First of all, this part is part from the top but these parts 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.180
 I feel put from the top 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.830
 so 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.340
 Because I have to take out the wiring 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:45.540
 Is this part a little good or this part 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:49.110
 I already cut it to put out the wiring 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.680
 So I finished this part again 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:56.860
 Something like this 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.790
 It is behind this portion is Hachisaku fixed to like this 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.520
 From the back part 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:06.510
 A line will come out like this 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.220
 So for the time being this part 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:13.810
 It is time not to bond with adhesive 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:17.760
 It became like this by attaching this part part 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:21.729
 The code comes out like this when viewed from the side 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:26.289
 Location itself the code is out has led to something like 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:29.289
 In even though I was able to put out both actions like this 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:31.830
 It this itself is whether and that properly function 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:37.040
 I would like to check 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:42.860
 Or the way in the line of this and You're wiring is or accidentally disconnected 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:46.450
 If you do, the light does not turn on after a while, so is it okay to work here ? 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.450
 I will check it 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:56.069
 Me with your wishes 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:56.069
 Otsu Itao Otsuki directly below 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.360
 I was a little relieved 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:12.009
 I think that the amount of light is less than when I tried before, but this is already here 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:17.979
 We put a clear plastic so a little will feel as light is to withstand the 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:21.580
 This line it is the next in the says on track a little work up to this point by saying 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:26.249
 Well, let's use these two lines with these two 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.249
 I think that I want to carry out the work that goes along 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.220
 yeah
