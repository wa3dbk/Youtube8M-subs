 beat the heart of a ransom that you do not 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.210
 I thought as much as possible that's why I have 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.479
 wanted to thank before spreading them 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.479
 Rome 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.720
 a citizen's question for press 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.110
 death his reading 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.060
 yes yes but I don't have it and that in life 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.160
 there is always the good the evil the order and the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.800
 disorder love and hatred and therefore the 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.110
 city is not that they are more corrupt and that 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.020
 there is more people indeed the protagonist of 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.610
 this book that goes in June because 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.570
 the city ​​has corrupted him because he has 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.590
 want things usually then when 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.600
 they asked tolu about one woman but three 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.550
 Mr. the user why paint the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.610
 women so long because women are 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.140
 lady ready and therefore the cities is not 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.890
 what ugly I have seen and city 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.870
 thanking the organizers of the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.680
 Campello vis precise that I did not think 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.390
 never see from my initiative not 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.120
 because I had prejudices but for 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.120
 sloth seen in Naples seen in Palermo there 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.320
 knows where there is the rome czardas rave channels 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.959
 beautiful cities 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.770
 so for me it has already been a 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.690
 prize 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.270
 I thank the literary jury that has 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.270
 had the courage to hunt win 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.770
 so things are two or there are 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.660
 wrong the book is worth in order e 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:55.959
 so the story of this book is a lot 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:03:00.190
 simple last year was the 50 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.410
 years of mahjong and beyond so many things 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.920
 made well done but I also made them 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.019
 I find there was not one 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.110
 for what, however, this masses this 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.780
 it is the story of a people that does not exist 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.910
 more because today's people up there don't 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.069
 they have more to the features and the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.950
 story of a people that was not marked 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.860
 not even on old maps 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.680
 to the thani of up there segregated in a valley 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.110
 nici clear where to survive 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.500
 they used what the brain and hands 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.730
 They were capable of an absolute autonomy 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.200
 they made the houses from the ground up the 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.860
 mobile roof shingles cover 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.349
 they made shoes spun havana 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.870
 run over all the coffins 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.160
 pulle for children who may be there 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.989
 cherries that was rosy life is that 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.450
 they lived segregated who their strength was 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.250
 driving the torrent that does not 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.780
 they never hurt anyone 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.730
 until someone stops him and comes back in 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.190
 earth your fa engine did turn 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.090
 the sun laughed the bayonne there was a country 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:14.299
 of mills sawmills the mad iron the lathes 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.060
 they looked like people who were sure of these 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.910
 wheels that turn a whole mechanism if 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.220
 we also think of the sawmills in which there is 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.210
 already and I saw a friend calling you 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.789
 This first sawmill is finished seterie 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.560
 in the united where the wood provided me 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.900
 when I had no money and mail it 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.760
 gave to make the structures will repay me the 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.539
 which hung a structure paid the 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:43.430
 girls did it and so there was 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:45.500
 this torrent gave this strength 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.930
 these people then survive it 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.430
 taking and led to irrigate 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.060
 warm fields gen 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.889
 a small town was born and then it was 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.550
 at some point he finds himself happy 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:02.330
 questori that this paradise and come 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.560
 here roma nola fondo does not have this 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
 people who see more than there is no 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.419
 torrent, then you must walk 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.490
 go look for it and go and find a 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.880
 this is a concrete wall 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.479
 that put it alone is a sign that even today 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.940
 and the prevarication of 50 years ago 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.370
 two thousand people 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.210
 they entered into nothingness by ambition 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:28.600
 Cynicism interest then remember 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:32.640
 these people had only one way or 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:35.370
 point the finger and get angry finding 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.440
 find witnesses find find 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.620
 documentation a research work 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.600
 this was already done 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.370
 however, we also risk doing so by 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.080
 point the finger to get angry with 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:54.150
 temporary workers is insulting Emilian killers 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:57.750
 instead not done in the weakest form e 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.610
 human the fairy tale and it hurts even more if 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.630
 there is still a conscience in the world 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.250
 elect someone reads this book ago 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.250
 even worse because there is no one 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.310
 prosthesis but there is a backwash from the 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.280
 network without anyone but there are also 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.610
 of values inside the memory I dressed 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.710
 they forced that evening to recite 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.510
 what they had done was that of importance 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.479
 of memory if there is still one 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.160
 important memory because I don't know 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:28.380
 then what happened the important one 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.130
 they wrote in a rattlesnake sculpted 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.900
 because they had to remember who he was 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.940
 past first who had reported the 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.210
 street is a book of resistance 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.280
 the snow that snows always is nothing else 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.860
 that the metaphor of the misfortune of the 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.010
 misfortune of the persecution of the 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.110
 nature receives person nature never yes 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.570
 remembers and therefore even from there they came 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.160
 avalanches swept away their convinced 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.930
 of avoiding to the war went a little more 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.360
 down to rebuild the country until 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.349
 a guy comes up who says no to 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.510
 death does not escape 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:02.849
 we must reason to look for how much 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.160
 possible accidents avoid them on 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:07.380
 as much as possible 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.270
 in short, it is accessing a lot of things that 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.520
 the use of hands we are losing a 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.680
 solemn and handles there is a staff attention 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.220
 erpen di cai do not lose use 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.370
 of the hands for which james acute the rom and 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:24.280
 between the lines I tried to 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:35.880
 in short, to save by remembering this 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:38.680
 King genocide is 50 years old 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.150
 this also in view of the dishes of 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.150
 novels about this
