have won the great game like how it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.460 
have won the great game like how it
yes<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:04.059> time<00:01:04.330> pressure<00:01:04.570> got<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:04.960> us<00:01:05.080> and<00:01:07.470> so

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
yes the time pressure got to us and so

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.920 
yes the time pressure got to us and so
so<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:08.980> were<00:01:09.820> in<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.300> really<00:01:10.570> tight<00:01:10.780> with

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
so you were in it really tight with

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.110 
so you were in it really tight with
Zenit<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:11.470> artists<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.160> doing<00:01:12.940> their

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
Zenit and artists and doing their

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.400 
Zenit and artists and doing their
because<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:13.600> lost<00:01:13.750> their<00:01:13.990> first<00:01:14.229> two<00:01:14.380> matches

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
because you lost their first two matches

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.350 
because you lost their first two matches
practically<00:01:15.400> against<00:01:15.790> trust<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:19.000> join<00:01:19.210> it

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
practically against trust and join it

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.930 
practically against trust and join it
yeah<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:20.320> then<00:01:20.500> later<00:01:20.740> on<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.070> argue<00:01:21.369> and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
yeah and then later on the argue and

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.980 
yeah and then later on the argue and
you'll<00:01:22.060> be<00:01:22.150> arguably<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.690> two<00:01:22.810> detectives

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
you'll be arguably the two detectives

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.150 
you'll be arguably the two detectives
and<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:26.200> how<00:01:26.350> do<00:01:26.410> you<00:01:26.560> feel<00:01:26.740> about<00:01:26.830> your

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
and so how do you feel about your

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.910 
and so how do you feel about your
training<00:01:27.880> performance<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.720> we<00:01:28.810> said<00:01:29.410> it

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
training performance and we said it

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.880 
training performance and we said it
because

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
because

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.370 
because
dating<00:01:32.280> issue<00:01:32.400> or<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:33.300> getting<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.170> scoot

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
dating issue or just getting you scoot

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.020 
dating issue or just getting you scoot
over<00:01:34.500> Fisher

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
over Fisher

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.740 
over Fisher
I<00:01:36.060> guess<00:01:37.550> so<00:01:38.580> some<00:01:38.910> of<00:01:39.030> our<00:01:39.120> players<00:01:39.330> choked

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
I guess so some of our players choked

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.700 
I guess so some of our players choked
but<00:01:40.140> cause<00:01:40.440> like<00:01:40.890> us<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.430> underperform<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.710> feel

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
but cause like us to underperform I feel

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.040 
but cause like us to underperform I feel
like<00:01:43.980> we<00:01:44.250> could<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.729> won<00:01:44.970> those<00:01:45.570> two<00:01:45.600> teams

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
like we could have won those two teams

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.090 
like we could have won those two teams
easily<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.460> had<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:49.620> right<00:01:49.770> mindset

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
easily if we had like the right mindset

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.680 
easily if we had like the right mindset
and<00:01:50.900> no<00:01:51.900> one<00:01:52.110> underperforming<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.550> yeah<00:01:54.360> well

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
and no one underperforming but yeah well

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.540 
and no one underperforming but yeah well
we<00:01:55.050> couldn't<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.380> much<00:01:55.530> anything<00:01:55.830> so<00:01:56.190> we<00:01:56.340> tried

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
we couldn't do much anything so we tried

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.760

to<00:01:56.580> recover<00:01:56.910> and<00:01:57.300> we<00:01:57.540> were<00:01:58.350> able<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.590> win

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
