 working dogs without necessarily 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.180
 we have to develop activities 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.520
 physical ones that keep the dog with a 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.340
 Temperament balanced activities

 a Friday do not subject it to an exercise 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:04.060
 forced to be big dogs is not 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.670
 advisable to put them to jump 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.890
 very high obstacles yes because when falling 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.989
 dogs can hurt their 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.920
 joints fascinate them water 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.379
 they see a river a lagoon they go and they 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.900
 they bounce instinctively in the water but not 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:24.049
 is the dog to catch a bicycle and 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.660
 start running with him 5 kilometers 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.970
 because they are not made for that if 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.030
 soon says one with a Friday make a 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.340
 very strenuous marathon is not race 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.459
 ideal for that type of exercises a 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.900
 exercise in family the exercise that 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.780

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.060

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.740
 positive on Fridays are very dogs 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.260
 sensitive yes then that if we are going to 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.890

 Friday in your training that can 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.600
 cause that we damage the temperament 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.750
