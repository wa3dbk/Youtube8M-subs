can see that okay turning round as well

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.730 
can see that okay turning round as well
there<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:11.939> double-sided<00:01:12.750> automatically

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
there it is double-sided automatically

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.359 
there it is double-sided automatically
so<00:01:14.610> she's<00:01:14.790> a3<00:01:15.240> a4<00:01:15.600> duplex<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.650> promo<00:01:16.920> copier

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
so she's a3 a4 duplex in promo copier

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.789 
so she's a3 a4 duplex in promo copier
