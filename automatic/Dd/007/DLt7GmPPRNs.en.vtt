00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:14.180
 First of all, I am studying Buddhist university in this way, 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.449
 Well, I've been studying scripture lately. 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:23.480
 There are 6 things to do 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:27.260
 Oh, when I tell you the end of the boundary Oh what the heck Do not run and believe it eats 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.590
 I have studied a lot and it is now in reality 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:36.379
 To 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:43.670
 Well many friends do or what to do when meeting people or so 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:45.199
 If you go have a person that truly come from that cow every time it means that the premise 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:53.120
 In that mind 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:58.249
 The risk of heart to do this, who appears in the mind wasnt anything negative 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:01.789
 Haetgeodeunyo so painful when I talk about two verbs been laid in addition to their Nha 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:06.409
 I 've been thinking about it since I was a kid . 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:11.300
 Since I was really a parent yesterday 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:16.400
 So we also, when our parents were doing what all the well-known saying in 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:21.800
 What do something financially fit Ã‚ richly salmyeonseodo 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.750
 How do you see our home and thus rattling rattling in dwitjip YOUNG 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:29.360
 Pulled and closed 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:32.990
 Well, it's getting kind of rough and my parents wrote it like that. 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.640
 There are a lot of things that have not really taken off. 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:41.810
 Among them, Sun Yat-sen is marrying a grand-grandson and living in a society. 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.580
 Then the house every time you move in. I said yesterday what chamsori defeated in the House 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.020
 I 've been hung . 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.370
 For just pull the dog ugly people these days are dangerous people that life is what What 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.800
 He lived. 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:02:00.900
 This is the reason why when there is such a thing like these days, 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:06.420
 I am very much in my own way, 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:10.770
 This is good for people who study and go out pretending to be good 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.270
 So there I want you to be a true example brings this idea is also true in eopja 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.200
 There's a lot 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:21.060
 Sometimes when a person who is idle is talking about it, 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:26.730
 I think if I look like this, I will think of that tangent gear . 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:30.450
 I have to take care of it and pray and fix it. 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:36.120
 Oh, there are so many times that it's really hard. 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:41.670
 It's not just about the mouth, it 's about everyone. 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:45.030
 For example, I have a group of ten people gathered in the main , 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.360
 One or two people , the rest of the party. 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:53.640
 Slow and One Loan 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:58.700
 I mean, there's someone like this. 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:04.550
 This is natural. It is natural in itself . 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:13.400
 I mean, I have a student who has a problem with it. 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:17.930
 no.2 people that Monk 10 people and areas also true that very good, 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.330
 Fingerprints are pastors. Some of these people are famous people. What 's our meeting ? 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.250
 chart 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.330
 Always 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:31.670
 One or two people I am a good person 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.360
 This man is lifting this idea and there are one or two problems that he 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.120
 I'm talking. 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:41.120
 But do it without a guide kkareuma probability to one or two is perfect, without M 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.100
 There is a man and the rest is just a moderate 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.100
 There are people who do not fit the rest 2 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:56.550
 So this is my kkareuma seen it all, and I say without my group 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:01.640
 I want to talk about this personality , 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:03.300
 Dear little toad who did not look at me Oh lord That I do anything just 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.130
 Constitutionally 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:12.120
 If you refuse, then you have this carma in me. 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:15.870
 The man everyone to everyone is that the group salgetjyo 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:21.690
 Huh laugh else is fine again 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:25.979
 Well , if 10 people are going to investigate each other, I'm right. 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:29.449
 Haebomyeon these people investigating the way I am yet another person who is first 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:35.479
 People do not seem like this. 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:40.099
 So, rather than his problem 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:41.270
 So if you are looking for something that when this is the problem of those who 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:47.360
 Heightened heart 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:51.710
 Oh look at me, tell me when I do that without parting Putting these things called Mr. 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:56.479
 When one party put up all the food we eat, as 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:59.240
 Make delicious foods even higher as delicious as I can I state 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:04.129
 There 's a misunderstanding . 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:09.740
 At that time, this food is delicious and not delicious. 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:13.020
 The palate tastes are different so close to each other, both are delicious. What gun 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:18.590
 In the courts, 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.590
 So we have something in common with the others. 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:27.280
 So there are two food processing score five people have in common is that in common 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:32.020
 It is not unconditional delicious. 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:36.970
 What about the mother of foreigners that can not be delicious 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:39.850
 So, the person in charge of Gyeongsang Gyeongsang Province is also common as it is delicious 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:45.070
 How can it be tasteless when people see it ? 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:48.580
 So this is just the mean magnetic kkareuma So this is my Goa kkareuma 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:52.780
 It is not the problem that is the map that fits more g 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:58.529
 So without my yireonge Putting it all my kkareuma ah see him 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:02.930
 When every Duro without my wife refuses to respect these yireongeo 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:08.690
 Look at me like this. Do not look at it. 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:13.880
 So when the writings are gathered Oh ah ah Where do I refuse without this 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:18.140
 So I can go without my recent Spring Well ah through several different experiences 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.970
 Then I have not been able to do something about this since 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:25.620
 There is something you like. 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:30.230
 That 's how I formed my way. 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.230
 That's how you know yourself. 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.090
 Do not go to study 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:41.780
 Oh, my first thing to say is that the economy is up. 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:47.450
 If you hate when you look like that , it 's not the end of the game. 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:52.820
 When I wake up, my wife is crossed and now I am reacting to this, 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:55.120
 I do not want to blame people. Just look at my carma. 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.120
 It's possible 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.910
 There is
