00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello, I want to talk a little bit today. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.379
 about coconut fertilization 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.510
 a lot of people are curious 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.650
 What is the ideal pair to use on coconut palms? 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.809
 and what stage should be used with 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.350
 the adobe while how much time should 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.519
 be used then let's start from 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.590
 how does it change in the case of a year 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.740
 Let's lose a year on the coconut tree. 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.990
 you should fold the coconut palm fairly 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.899
 nitrogen and hydrogen will 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.170
 that the leaves look beautiful and stay 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.050
 it grows more vigorously than more 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.570
 most beautiful dressing is then a fertilizer 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.570
 every three months on the coconut 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.660
 It's when it changes that it will help him a lot. 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.579
 in part on the part of them in the part 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.010
 it was his look that will make him 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.309
 be a little healthy and beautiful 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.989
 as time goes by three or 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.859
 four years since he's already gone 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.860
 start producing in this case a year 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.460
 before beginning the year of production would be 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.390
 four years is for me to start putting 25 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.479
 20 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.020
 a little more potassium chloride is the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.750
 The solution that is made is 700 grams of 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.189
 25/20 and 300 grams of 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.729
 potassium, thereby forming one kilogram of the 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.189
 fertilizer for coconut is because more quantity 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.850
 of potassium that it makes with 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.740
 may the fruit taste better 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.740
 help in flowering 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.110
 it also helps in the absorption of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.570
 plant nutrients it will do with 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.060
 that the body does not fall, or one of the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.720
 main agents of insuring the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.970
 fruits in plants salt is potassium 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.450
 so if you need to leave the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.759
 his strong body so that he will have 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.140
 good coconuts that these cuts will not fall 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.869
 You're inviting him to the right nutrition. 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.399
 he will succeed in giving good fruit and 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.060
 will hold these fruits 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.410
 the fertilizer 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.940
 Here, however, is 20 but potassium chloride 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:17.430
 sodium and potassium chloride 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:21.099
 red fertilizer should be placed 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.290
 one meter to one meter from the trunk of a 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.739
 coconut tree and making a crown around the 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.989
 Why do not you put the fertilizer on? 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.239
 in the trunk of a coconut tree because 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.459
 roots of the trunk that I will not we will not 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.840
 being there at the roots they grow 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.830
 according to any will grow in 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.470
 height 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.330
 so if you have any the high you 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.540
 must put one meter and a half 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:48.000
 away from the trunk the fertilizer 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.280
 recapping you will use fertilizer 25 20 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.980
 700 grams plus 300 grams of fertilizer 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.590
 potassium chloride to one kilogram 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.750
 You'll mix it up and give it a pound. 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.099
 will use a pound per pound each 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.620
 three months 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.660
 This is for the whole plant life and 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.599
 with that you will surely have a 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.239
 fertilizer that will be giving result that 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.430
 will hold the coconut of yours 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.370
 coconut tree that will leave him with grief 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.829
 very sweet and delicious and everyone goes 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.060
 be happy in this heat by drinking water 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.620
 coconut ice cream 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.209
 I hope you have enjoyed it very much. 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.209
 Thank you and see you next time.
