00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello friends c is the well back from 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.130
 holidays and here we are finally in September 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.710
 you weren't from September among the most 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.110
 young is especially the month in which it is 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.049
 he starts going to school again as he already does 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.820
 you will know having already surely seen the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.020
 my video on the baccalaureate exam ho 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.119
 finished high school 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.430
 and here who if not I can give her 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.010
 tips on how not to go back to school 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.900
 neither daisy nor years of experience you have as it is 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.119
 known in the school in the sense of how 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.759
 we must approach the school of the three 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:38.879
 better knots as to go there we believe 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:41.090
 all more or less and not in all then 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.220
 as point 1 you absolutely must 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.930
 avoid the good type predictions 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.730
 this year the studio just arrived home 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.680
 I miss the time to eat that I'm already 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.850
 studying 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.410
 this year the teeth are not really 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.410
 no one sells one 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.330
 I live 80 late because once 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.610
 realized that you will never succeed in 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.030
 keep you or the second day of 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.860
 school 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.150
 the disappointment will be too great and therefore 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.159
 rather try to be more 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.359
 realistic 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.249
 this year south just arrived home 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.810
 after eating slept I saw a 

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:15.130
 little television checked notifications 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.500
 on facebook thought good in the middle 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.899
 east wonder michael jackson ed 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.909
 having regretted a little for not having 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:28.090
 studied before 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:30.100
 this year unpublished 12 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.229
 this year the exam 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.659
 let's get there then you should 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.100
 going back to school is a problem with 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.869
 bigger and above all from the first ones 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.149
 days when you move from a period 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.909
 dedicated presumably almost all 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.850
 therefore nothing of god those 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.740
 nights spent watching movies and TV series 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.630
 and to all those hours spent with 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.729
 video games best managed red 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.520
 hours of sleep to avoid a classic 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.049
 typical situation 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.210
 although I see rather quickly only 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.929
 another installment of my favorite e 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.929
 then I go to sleep 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.660
 after seeing two whole seasons that 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.660
 we have to go to sleep or commit suicide 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.210
 last night I was late but fortunately 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.210
 he has no sleep face 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:41.610
 your sister is above all this is a 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.280
 advice that he avoided throughout the course 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.350
 of the year but above all of the first 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.140
 school days and invite yours 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.090
 friends it is understood well I said of 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.740
 avoiding them does not mean that 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.690
 you have to become the strength of 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.200
 hermits apart we close all the 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.030
 created 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.070
 but then try to limit the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.470
 afternoons spent studying together at 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.209
 hard from where too often they start like this 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.800
 or that I recommend concentrates e 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.870
 we have a lot of things to study 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:14.220
 so a remarkable page becomes ok 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.820
 other 382 are missing to move to 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.820
 passive final 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.390
 regretting not 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.760
 it was the day before promising you 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.860
 that the next time we study in short 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.230
 that the big mess having to go back to 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.790
 school will also blame a professor 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.040
 that too often they don't make us feel 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.870
 other than numbers or machines whose 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.090
 task is exclusively I take of 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.520
 study without ever having a contact anymore 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.890
 directed not once more growth 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.630
 and education because it was this for 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.430
 always from the school to help us grow 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.500
 and above all educate ourselves in the world of 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.810
 tomorrow the school environment 15 looks like 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.700
 our greater oppression and other not 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.650
 we would like you to run away from it 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.720
 first possible to drain in the meantime 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.850
 it should be where we grow up 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.830
 our culture and should stimulate us 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.480
 so much else does nothing but stress 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.040
 throughout the course of its duration but 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.380
 then suddenly once over not 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.570
 let's do nothing but think of everyone 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.520
 those afternoons spent studying things 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.110
 got a good grade on the chats in 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.640
 bathroom with your classmates a 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.800
 those afternoons we don't have 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.390
 designed for the mind but we had fun 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.840
 like crazy, thanks to our friends 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.489
 class 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.870
 here then suddenly all of it 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.730
 life associated with school 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.890
 disappears and given it did not want then that 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.780
 go back to relive every 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.190
 single moment of one of the longer periods 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.720
 beautiful in our lives 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.550
 I realize that there are some 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.870
 exceptions that really don't 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.790
 bear not seeing one finish one 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.770
 once finished maybe it will also feel 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.970
 better but in my opinion we are too many that 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.710
 we would like to be able to go back to school again 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.630
 I recommend cycle you know the house 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.860
 video you liked put you do not like 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.349
 and will mark my channel 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.060
 I 'm not kidding with a visit to one 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.530
 vision a little decided a comment do 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.729
 always very very pleased especially 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.099
 because no quarrel 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.930
 a huge thanks as much as a home but 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.849
 my sleeve kitchen that helped me so 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.479
 so much in the same video thanks matica 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:04.289
 I'll send you some 2 euro leads and that's it 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.289
 receive start again 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.949
 sure that though thinking of it, that is, it is beautiful 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.080
 school and good memories all these 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.720
 things though all those afternoons 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.800
 passed to study giants and bad grades 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.889
 the bullshit that in effect is not that then 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.260
 I miss you so much and it never has me that 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.570
 I don't care so much now by now 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.970
 to our face 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.150
 I've finished the march already shows a nice one 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.630
 no you have to do the common university that 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:44.389
 the university and is still worse 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:44.389
 what was naked therefore mallorca
