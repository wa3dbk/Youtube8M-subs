the receiver on the 100 series I talked

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.760 
the receiver on the 100 series I talked
about<00:00:14.500> the<00:00:14.620> scanner<00:00:15.960> they<00:00:16.960> look<00:00:17.200> at<00:00:17.349> the<00:00:17.439> menu

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
about the scanner they look at the menu

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.580 
about the scanner they look at the menu
system<00:00:18.160> in<00:00:18.279> here<00:00:18.520> there's<00:00:19.390> a<00:00:19.480> bank<00:00:19.810> well<00:00:20.380> each

receiver<00:00:21.070> throughout<00:00:21.610> the<00:00:21.759> series<00:00:22.119> have

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
receiver throughout the series have

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.109 
receiver throughout the series have
eight<00:00:22.570> banks<00:00:22.900> and<00:00:23.400> eight<00:00:24.400> of<00:00:24.550> those<00:00:24.640> banks

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
eight banks and eight of those banks

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.570 
eight banks and eight of those banks
have<00:00:25.330> pre-programmed<00:00:26.289> pre<00:00:26.859> coordinated

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
have pre-programmed pre coordinated

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.609 
have pre-programmed pre coordinated
frequencies<00:00:28.119> and<00:00:28.359> in<00:00:28.510> the<00:00:28.600> 100<00:00:29.050> series<00:00:29.260> each

frequencies and in the 100 series each
Bank<00:00:29.949> Bank<00:00:30.310> one<00:00:30.580> would<00:00:31.240> have<00:00:31.390> four

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
Bank Bank one would have four

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.960 
Bank Bank one would have four
pre-programmed<00:00:32.400> frequencies<00:00:33.400> that<00:00:33.670> you<00:00:33.730> know

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
pre-programmed frequencies that you know

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.970 
pre-programmed frequencies that you know
work<00:00:34.239> together<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:35.230> benefit<00:00:35.710> of<00:00:35.739> that<00:00:35.860> is

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
work together the benefit of that is

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.350 
work together the benefit of that is
that<00:00:36.250> if<00:00:36.340> you<00:00:36.370> have<00:00:36.610> four<00:00:36.850> channels<00:00:37.239> of

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
that if you have four channels of

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.630 
that if you have four channels of
wireless<00:00:37.570> systems<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:38.379> you<00:00:38.980> scan<00:00:39.340> your

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
wireless systems and you scan your

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.030 
wireless systems and you scan your
receiver<00:00:40.089> and<00:00:40.390> there<00:00:40.930> comes<00:00:41.170> up<00:00:41.320> with<00:00:41.470> Bank<00:00:41.710> 1

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
receiver and there comes up with Bank 1

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.310 
receiver and there comes up with Bank 1
it's<00:00:42.909> going<00:00:43.000> to<00:00:43.150> you'll<00:00:43.449> know<00:00:43.659> that<00:00:43.870> if<00:00:44.019> I<00:00:44.110> use

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
it's going to you'll know that if I use

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.829 
it's going to you'll know that if I use
4<00:00:44.979> of<00:00:45.250> those<00:00:45.460> frequencies<00:00:45.820> in<00:00:46.180> bank<00:00:46.390> 1<00:00:46.600> they're

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
4 of those frequencies in bank 1 they're

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.000 
4 of those frequencies in bank 1 they're
going<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.019> work<00:00:47.140> together<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.710> I<00:00:47.799> don't<00:00:47.920> have

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
going to work together and I don't have

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.530 
going to work together and I don't have
to<00:00:48.129> worry<00:00:48.309> about<00:00:48.430> interference<00:00:48.820> within

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
to worry about interference within

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.360 
to worry about interference within
themselves<00:00:49.989> so<00:00:50.290> it<00:00:50.559> makes<00:00:50.710> it<00:00:50.830> very<00:00:50.949> easy<00:00:51.220> to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
themselves so it makes it very easy to

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.180 
themselves so it makes it very easy to
do<00:00:51.610> a<00:00:51.850> quick<00:00:52.390> setup<00:00:52.629> when<00:00:53.409> you<00:00:53.500> go<00:00:53.619> up<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.830> a<00:00:53.860> 300

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
do a quick setup when you go up to a 300

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.789 
do a quick setup when you go up to a 300
series<00:00:54.790> or<00:00:54.970> a<00:00:55.000> 500<00:00:55.540> series<00:00:55.750> you<00:00:56.350> get<00:00:56.500> more

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
series or a 500 series you get more

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.160 
series or a 500 series you get more
pre-programmed<00:00:57.610> frequencies<00:00:58.210> in<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.720> 300

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
pre-programmed frequencies in the 300

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.049 
pre-programmed frequencies in the 300
series<00:00:59.409> in<00:00:59.680> one<00:01:00.070> bank<00:01:00.280> I<00:01:00.519> would<00:01:00.610> get<00:01:00.850> 8

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
series in one bank I would get 8

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.390 
series in one bank I would get 8
pre-programmed<00:01:02.019> frequencies<00:01:02.559> so<00:01:03.159> if<00:01:03.280> you're

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
pre-programmed frequencies so if you're

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.829 
pre-programmed frequencies so if you're
doing<00:01:03.489> a<00:01:03.610> larger<00:01:04.000> set<00:01:04.210> up<00:01:04.330> it<00:01:04.479> makes<00:01:04.600> it<00:01:04.750> very

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
doing a larger set up it makes it very

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.760 
doing a larger set up it makes it very
very<00:01:05.080> easy<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.979> set<00:01:06.189> up<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.490> channels<00:01:07.770> going

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
very easy to set up a channels going

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.830 
very easy to set up a channels going
into<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.040> menu<00:01:09.310> as<00:01:09.460> well<00:01:09.670> I<00:01:09.729> can<00:01:10.150> set<00:01:10.360> up<00:01:10.479> the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
into the menu as well I can set up the

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.390 
into the menu as well I can set up the
channel<00:01:11.229> that's<00:01:11.439> the<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.830> channel<00:01:12.130> within

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
channel that's the the channel within

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.210 
channel that's the the channel within
the<00:01:12.520> bank<00:01:12.730> I<00:01:13.050> can<00:01:14.050> tune<00:01:14.290> it<00:01:14.470> though<00:01:14.650> to<00:01:14.710> any<00:01:15.070> of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
the bank I can tune it though to any of

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.070 
the bank I can tune it though to any of
the<00:01:15.280> 1,400<00:01:15.910> frequencies<00:01:16.330> if<00:01:16.510> I<00:01:16.600> don't<00:01:16.810> want<00:01:16.990> to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
the 1,400 frequencies if I don't want to

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.720 
the 1,400 frequencies if I don't want to
stick<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.560> pre-programmed<00:01:17.950> frequencies

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
stick to the pre-programmed frequencies

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.140 
stick to the pre-programmed frequencies
I<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.960> also<00:01:20.230> scan<00:01:20.980> and<00:01:21.370> we<00:01:21.460> talked<00:01:21.700> about<00:01:21.820> that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
I can also scan and we talked about that

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.010 
I can also scan and we talked about that
and<00:01:22.330> then<00:01:22.860> AF<00:01:23.860> output<00:01:24.520> that's<00:01:24.810> German<00:01:25.810> code

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
and then AF output that's German code

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.550 
and then AF output that's German code
for<00:01:26.290> audio<00:01:26.620> output<00:01:27.070> AF<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.990> we<00:01:29.200> can<00:01:29.350> set<00:01:29.530> up

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
for audio output AF but we can set up

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.070 
for audio output AF but we can set up
our<00:01:29.710> free<00:01:29.950> audio<00:01:30.730> output<00:01:31.360> as<00:01:31.510> well<00:01:31.780> and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
our free audio output as well and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.970 
our free audio output as well and
remember<00:01:32.230> what<00:01:32.500> I<00:01:32.560> said

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
remember what I said

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.800 
remember what I said
set<00:01:33.190> up<00:01:33.280> your<00:01:33.310> transmitter<00:01:33.850> first<00:01:34.090> nice<00:01:34.540> hot

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
set up your transmitter first nice hot

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.230 
set up your transmitter first nice hot
level<00:01:35.170> then<00:01:35.710> let's<00:01:36.070> set<00:01:36.190> up<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.400> receiver<00:01:36.820> level

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
level then let's set up a receiver level

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.910 
level then let's set up a receiver level
output<00:01:37.690> going<00:01:38.050> to<00:01:38.260> your<00:01:38.380> mixing<00:01:38.710> board

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
output going to your mixing board

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.410 
output going to your mixing board
squelch<00:01:41.920> now<00:01:42.430> there<00:01:42.610> is<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.730> squelch<00:01:43.090> setting

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
squelch now there is a squelch setting

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.690 
squelch now there is a squelch setting
on<00:01:43.540> here<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:44.050> that<00:01:44.320> tells<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.740> receiver<00:01:45.070> when

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
on here and that tells the receiver when

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.670 
on here and that tells the receiver when
to<00:01:45.970> open<00:01:46.300> up<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:46.600> accept<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.110> transmitter

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
to open up and accept the transmitter

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.580 
to open up and accept the transmitter
signal<00:01:48.580> coming<00:01:48.760> from<00:01:48.940> my<00:01:49.090> transmitter<00:01:49.659> we<00:01:50.350> can

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
signal coming from my transmitter we can

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.649 
signal coming from my transmitter we can
set<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:51.040> though<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.280> off<00:01:51.610> if<00:01:51.880> we<00:01:51.970> want<00:01:52.150> or<00:01:52.420> at

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
set that though to off if we want or at

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.219 
set that though to off if we want or at
a<00:01:52.690> lower<00:01:52.990> setting<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.540> display<00:01:55.960> do
