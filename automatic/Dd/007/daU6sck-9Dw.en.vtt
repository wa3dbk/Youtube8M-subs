this<00:04:22.340> year<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.780> my<00:04:24.500> thoughts<00:04:24.770> building<00:04:25.610> that

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
this year and my thoughts building that

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.029 
this year and my thoughts building that
turns<00:04:26.060> me<00:04:26.240> off<00:04:26.270> is<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.539> paint<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.229> mean<00:04:27.979> I

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
turns me off is the paint I mean I

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.760 
turns me off is the paint I mean I
really<00:04:28.310> wish<00:04:28.490> they<00:04:28.639> went<00:04:29.150> with<00:04:29.270> um<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.770> silver

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
really wish they went with um a silver

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.710 
really wish they went with um a silver
vinyl<00:04:31.190> but<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.639> don't<00:04:32.210> think<00:04:32.360> they<00:04:32.449> would<00:04:32.630> have

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
vinyl but I don't think they would have

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.750 
vinyl but I don't think they would have
done<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.139> metallic<00:04:33.680> look<00:04:33.949> so<00:04:34.220> I<00:04:34.250> guess<00:04:34.550> that's

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
done the metallic look so I guess that's

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.029 
done the metallic look so I guess that's
kind<00:04:34.910> of<00:04:35.330> forgivable<00:04:35.870> but<00:04:36.470> I<00:04:36.530> just<00:04:36.740> really

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
kind of forgivable but I just really

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.500 
kind of forgivable but I just really
don't<00:04:37.130> like<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.400> silver<00:04:37.669> paint<00:04:37.820> because<00:04:38.240> my

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
don't like the silver paint because my

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.379 
don't like the silver paint because my
