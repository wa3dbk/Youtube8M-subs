00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
modifying it so that it'll work with my

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.130 
modifying it so that it'll work with my
TV<00:00:18.020> by<00:00:18.440> changing<00:00:18.949> it<00:00:19.130> from<00:00:19.699> the<00:00:20.060> normal<00:00:20.690> RCA

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
TV by changing it from the normal RCA

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.560 
TV by changing it from the normal RCA
jack<00:00:21.560> which<00:00:22.310> wasn't<00:00:22.550> working<00:00:22.790> on<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:23.240> system

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
jack which wasn't working on the system

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.910 
jack which wasn't working on the system
it<00:00:23.690> was<00:00:23.750> fuzzy<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:24.620> a<00:00:25.030> coaxial<00:00:26.030> type<00:00:26.450> Jack<00:00:26.920> you

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
it was fuzzy to a coaxial type Jack you

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.350 
it was fuzzy to a coaxial type Jack you
know<00:00:28.070> so<00:00:28.370> the<00:00:28.520> first<00:00:28.700> thing<00:00:28.850> I<00:00:28.910> did<00:00:28.970> is<00:00:29.120> I<00:00:29.210> went

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
to RadioShack Niwas and I picked up this

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.580 
to RadioShack Niwas and I picked up this
guy<00:00:32.029> here<00:00:32.390> if<00:00:32.599> you<00:00:32.689> guys<00:00:32.809> can<00:00:33.050> read<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.350> part

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
original Atari player the RCA jack

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.669 
original Atari player the RCA jack
originally<00:00:55.609> plugged<00:00:55.819> in<00:00:55.999> was<00:00:56.179> right<00:00:56.359> here

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
originally plugged in was right here

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.390 
the end off of this it was exposed to
the<00:01:11.630> wires<00:01:11.810> bought<00:01:12.740> myself<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:13.190> cheap

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
the wires bought myself a cheap

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.510 
the wires bought myself a cheap
soldering<00:01:13.940> iron<00:01:14.620> you<00:01:15.620> guys<00:01:15.860> now<00:01:16.280> what<00:01:16.430> I'm

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
soldering iron you guys now what I'm

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.820 
soldering iron you guys now what I'm
gonna<00:01:16.610> do<00:01:16.730> is<00:01:16.820> I'm<00:01:16.910> gonna<00:01:17.000> flip<00:01:17.240> it<00:01:17.330> over<00:01:19.690> and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
gonna do is I'm gonna flip it over and

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.190 
gonna do is I'm gonna flip it over and
I'm<00:01:21.830> going<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:22.190> solder<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.820> right<00:01:23.330> here<00:01:23.600> my

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
I'm going to solder it right here my

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.050 
I'm going to solder it right here my
signal<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.680> being<00:01:24.920> right<00:01:25.160> there<00:01:25.370> and<00:01:25.850> then<00:01:25.970> my

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
signal of being right there and then my

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.440 
signal of being right there and then my
ground<00:01:26.270> being<00:01:26.510> right<00:01:26.720> there<00:01:27.100> yeah<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:28.760> let<00:01:29.360> me

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
ground being right there yeah so let me

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.520 
ground being right there yeah so let me
go<00:01:29.510> ahead<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.660> get<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:29.840> soldered<00:01:30.200> on<00:01:30.320> and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
go ahead and get that soldered on and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.030 
go ahead and get that soldered on and
we'll<00:01:30.620> continue

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
we'll continue

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.430 
we'll continue
so<00:01:31.880> many<00:01:32.030> ways<00:01:32.210> why<00:01:32.600> I<00:01:32.630> started<00:01:33.170> this<00:01:33.260> little

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
so many ways why I started this little

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.120 
so many ways why I started this little
project<00:01:33.650> up<00:01:34.180> was<00:01:35.180> because<00:01:35.540> I<00:01:38.680> was<00:01:39.680> using<00:01:39.890> the

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
project up was because I was using the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.340 
project up was because I was using the
old<00:01:40.340> RF<00:01:41.230> module

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
old RF module

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.650 
old RF module
you<00:01:42.740> know<00:01:42.800> as<00:01:42.860> converter<00:01:43.160> box<00:01:43.400> it<00:01:44.270> was<00:01:44.480> to

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
you know as converter box it was to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.210 
you know as converter box it was to
actually<00:01:45.080> go<00:01:45.230> from<00:01:46.100> my<00:01:46.340> TV<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.750> Atari<00:01:48.410> but

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
actually go from my TV to the Atari but

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.760 
actually go from my TV to the Atari but
it<00:01:49.880> was<00:01:50.000> really<00:01:50.210> super<00:01:50.330> snowy<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.590> was<00:01:51.740> I

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
it was really super snowy so it was I

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.020 
it was really super snowy so it was I
was<00:01:51.860> trying<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.070> figure<00:01:52.220> something<00:01:52.430> out<00:01:52.760> so

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
was trying to figure something out so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.070 
was trying to figure something out so
then<00:01:53.720> I<00:01:53.810> tried<00:01:53.870> just<00:01:54.590> doing<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.400> straight<00:01:56.080> from

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
then I tried just doing a straight from

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.600 
then I tried just doing a straight from
there<00:01:57.980> to<00:01:58.430> a<00:01:58.600> female<00:01:59.600> RCA<00:02:00.160> you<00:02:01.160> know<00:02:01.250> as<00:02:01.370> an

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
there to a female RCA you know as an

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.070 
there to a female RCA you know as an
unplugged<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.030> Atari<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.540> that<00:02:02.720> way<00:02:02.840> know

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
unplugged and Atari in that way know

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.630 
unplugged and Atari in that way know
that<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.620> improved<00:02:04.010> but<00:02:04.220> it<00:02:04.310> was<00:02:04.430> still

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
that that improved but it was still

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.339 
that that improved but it was still
snowy<00:02:05.260> so<00:02:06.260> my<00:02:07.010> next<00:02:07.340> attempt<00:02:07.760> is<00:02:08.229> what<00:02:09.229> we're

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
snowy so my next attempt is what we're

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.840 
snowy so my next attempt is what we're
doing<00:02:09.530> right<00:02:09.619> now<00:02:09.800> so<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.440> I've<00:02:12.920> soldered<00:02:13.519> on

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
doing right now so so I've soldered on

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.030 
doing right now so so I've soldered on
the<00:02:14.000> wires<00:02:14.650> right

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
the wires right

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.940 
the wires right
you<00:02:17.040> know<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.959> now<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.049> next<00:02:19.230> thing<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.739> went

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
you know is now the next thing is I went

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.570 
you know is now the next thing is I went
