leads to catastrophe and then some sense

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
but but always in in in a slightly

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.949 
but but always in in in a slightly
different<00:03:35.019> way<00:03:35.769> it's<00:03:36.220> is<00:03:36.849> compromised<00:03:37.540> in

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
different way it's is compromised in

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.229 
different way it's is compromised in
some<00:03:37.989> way<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:39.040> doesn't<00:03:39.340> he<00:03:39.579> doesn't<00:03:39.730> end<00:03:40.030> in

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
some way it doesn't he doesn't end in

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.569 
some way it doesn't he doesn't end in
the<00:03:40.359> same<00:03:40.540> ke<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:41.170> he<00:03:41.290> began<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:42.400> that's

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
the same ke that he began and that's

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.390 
the same ke that he began and that's
actually<00:03:42.939> quite<00:03:43.030> important<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.840> me<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:45.340> you

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
actually quite important to me that you

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.289 
actually quite important to me that you
can't<00:03:45.819> quite<00:03:46.150> regain<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.970> opening

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
can't quite regain the the opening

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.869 
can't quite regain the the opening
tonality<00:03:49.900> but<00:03:50.709> there's<00:03:50.920> another<00:03:51.189> aspect<00:03:51.310> to

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
tonality but there's another aspect to

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.300 
tonality but there's another aspect to
this<00:03:52.000> because<00:03:52.359> I<00:03:52.659> figured<00:03:53.049> that<00:03:53.310> sitting

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
this because I figured that sitting

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.220 
this because I figured that sitting
there<00:03:54.519> in<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.849> Albert<00:03:55.180> Hall<00:03:55.329> listening<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.870> 20

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
there in the Albert Hall listening to 20

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.369 
there in the Albert Hall listening to 20
bands<00:03:56.650> playing<00:03:56.980> this<00:03:57.190> piece<00:03:57.430> if<00:03:58.359> if<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:58.930> starts

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
bands playing this piece if if it starts

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.170 
bands playing this piece if if it starts
and<00:03:59.590> ends<00:03:59.769> in<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.190> second<00:04:00.519> key<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.909> gets<00:04:01.090> very

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
and ends in the second key it gets very

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.339 
and ends in the second key it gets very
very<00:04:01.420> wearing

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
very wearing

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.000 
very wearing
so<00:04:02.920> obviously<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.700> effect<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:05.010> performance

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
so obviously the effect of performance

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.009 
so obviously the effect of performance
finishing<00:04:06.549> and<00:04:06.760> then<00:04:07.349> starting<00:04:08.349> again<00:04:08.819> in<00:04:10.019> the

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
finishing and then starting again in the

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.849 
finishing and then starting again in the
tone<00:04:11.230> higher<00:04:11.560> when<00:04:12.010> he<00:04:12.069> finishes<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.549> would

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
tone higher when he finishes that would

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.229 
tone higher when he finishes that would
that<00:04:14.859> would<00:04:14.920> be<00:04:15.069> quite<00:04:15.189> a<00:04:15.310> satisfying<00:04:15.939> thing

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
that would be quite a satisfying thing

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.759 
that would be quite a satisfying thing
to<00:04:16.389> do<00:04:16.539> and<00:04:16.780> how<00:04:16.959> did<00:04:17.139> the<00:04:17.199> band<00:04:17.349> this<00:04:17.530> fellow

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
to do and how did the band this fellow

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.439 
to do and how did the band this fellow
generally<00:04:18.400> with<00:04:18.609> your<00:04:18.760> music<00:04:19.060> did<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.299> think

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
generally with your music did you think

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.320 
generally with your music did you think
on<00:04:19.690> that<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:20.620> varied<00:04:21.099> enormously<00:04:21.340> I<00:04:21.820> mean<00:04:22.150> that

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
on that it varied enormously I mean that

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.270 
on that it varied enormously I mean that
you<00:04:22.780> know<00:04:22.870> everybody<00:04:23.500> gave<00:04:23.800> it<00:04:23.979> that<00:04:24.160> all

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
you know everybody gave it that all

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.400 
you know everybody gave it that all
there's<00:04:25.060> no<00:04:25.259> question

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.320 

the<00:04:29.410> piece<00:04:29.650> really<00:04:30.130> is<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.280> struggling<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:31.120> mean

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
the piece really is a struggling I mean

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.360 
the piece really is a struggling I mean
anybody<00:04:31.570> who's<00:04:31.870> ever<00:04:32.050> playing<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.650> knows<00:04:33.310> that

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
anybody who's ever playing it knows that

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.360 
anybody who's ever playing it knows that
but<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.240> struggle<00:04:34.690> is<00:04:34.870> actually<00:04:35.290> part<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.740> the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
but the struggle is actually part of the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.240 
but the struggle is actually part of the
pieces<00:04:36.880> it's<00:04:37.419> what<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.870> piece<00:04:38.080> is<00:04:38.440> is<00:04:38.860> about

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
pieces it's what the piece is is about

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.940 
pieces it's what the piece is is about
he's<00:04:39.580> copped<00:04:39.880> out<00:04:40.030> in<00:04:40.330> this<00:04:40.450> sense<00:04:40.840> of<00:04:41.169> you

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
he's copped out in this sense of you

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.250 
he's copped out in this sense of you
know<00:04:42.340> become<00:04:42.700> an<00:04:42.820> all-or-nothing<00:04:43.389> quality

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
know become an all-or-nothing quality

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.310 
know become an all-or-nothing quality
the<00:04:44.440> moment<00:04:44.889> you<00:04:45.040> lose<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.669> urgency<00:04:46.419> then

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
the moment you lose that urgency then

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.900 
the moment you lose that urgency then
the<00:04:47.950> drama<00:04:48.250> begins<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:49.180> begins<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:50.110> sag<00:04:50.669> yeah<00:04:51.669> I

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
the drama begins to begins to sag yeah I

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.060 
the drama begins to begins to sag yeah I
can<00:04:52.240> fully<00:04:52.540> relate<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.110> that<00:04:53.290> later

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
can fully relate to that later

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.010 
Passage the chaos passage which which is
a<00:05:00.040> real<00:05:00.280> tour<00:05:00.580> de<00:05:00.730> force<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.270> it's<00:05:01.450> really

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
a real tour de force and it's really

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.480 
a real tour de force and it's really
puts<00:05:02.260> all<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.560> players<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.070> conductor

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
puts all the players and the conductor

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.890 
puts all the players and the conductor
through<00:05:03.669> the<00:05:03.820> mill<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.270> I<00:05:04.419> cannot<00:05:04.690> always

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
through the mill and I cannot always

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.600 
through the mill and I cannot always
remember<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.470> palpable<00:05:05.950> sense<00:05:06.010> of<00:05:06.310> relief

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
remember the palpable sense of relief

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.880 
remember the palpable sense of relief
that<00:05:06.940> is<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:07.480> conductor<00:05:07.930> of<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.260> scare<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.740> end

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
that is the conductor of a scare the end

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.200 
that is the conductor of a scare the end
of<00:05:09.100> that<00:05:09.250> section<00:05:09.520> even<00:05:09.880> though<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.030> is<00:05:10.120> still

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
of that section even though it is still

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.020 
of that section even though it is still
about<00:05:10.480> five<00:05:10.690> minutes<00:05:10.960> of<00:05:11.340> music<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.460> go<00:05:12.610> that

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
about five minutes of music to go that

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.240 
about five minutes of music to go that
but<00:05:13.360> that's<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.930> point<00:05:14.140> that<00:05:14.560> really

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
but that's the point that really

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.120 
but that's the point that really
separates<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:16.120> bands<00:05:16.330> for<00:05:16.930> me<00:05:17.140> because

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
separates the bands for me because

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.400 
separates the bands for me because
having<00:05:18.430> done<00:05:18.940> that<00:05:18.970> really<00:05:19.540> difficult

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
having done that really difficult

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.400 
having done that really difficult
strenuous<00:05:20.910> stuff<00:05:21.940> you<00:05:22.630> then<00:05:22.870> have<00:05:23.080> to<00:05:23.110> play

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
strenuous stuff you then have to play

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.300 
strenuous stuff you then have to play
beautifully<00:05:24.130> and<00:05:24.580> quietly<00:05:25.180> yeah<00:05:25.660> and<00:05:26.040> for<00:05:27.040> me

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
beautifully and quietly yeah and for me

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.250 
beautifully and quietly yeah and for me
that<00:05:27.580> is<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:28.150> biggest<00:05:28.360> challenge<00:05:28.690> because

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
that is the biggest challenge because

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.250 
that is the biggest challenge because
very<00:05:29.500> often<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.639> tonal<00:05:31.120> quality<00:05:31.660> and<00:05:32.140> the

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
very often the the tonal quality and the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.800 
very often the the tonal quality and the
focus<00:05:32.800> goes<00:05:33.220> at<00:05:33.520> that<00:05:33.669> point<00:05:34.000> yes<00:05:34.540> I<00:05:34.750> think

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
focus goes at that point yes I think

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.840 
focus goes at that point yes I think
that's<00:05:35.110> absolutely<00:05:35.530> right<00:05:35.860> because<00:05:36.310> there<00:05:36.700> is

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
that's absolutely right because there is

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.350 
that's absolutely right because there is
almost<00:05:37.180> a<00:05:37.510> sense<00:05:37.750> of<00:05:38.130> we've<00:05:39.130> done<00:05:39.160> the<00:05:39.640> most

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
almost a sense of we've done the most

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.300 
almost a sense of we've done the most
difficult<00:05:40.780> technical<00:05:41.260> part<00:05:41.470> even<00:05:41.979> though<00:05:42.190> the

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
difficult technical part even though the

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.860 
difficult technical part even though the
next<00:05:42.460> bits<00:05:42.729> technically<00:05:43.090> not<00:05:43.210> so<00:05:43.390> difficult<00:05:43.720> I

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
next bits technically not so difficult I

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.630 
next bits technically not so difficult I
think<00:05:44.080> it<00:05:44.320> really<00:05:44.530> does<00:05:44.740> get<00:05:44.950> to<00:05:45.100> the<00:05:45.190> heart<00:05:45.400> of

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
think it really does get to the heart of

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.279 
think it really does get to the heart of
the<00:05:45.820> piece<00:05:46.030> isn't<00:05:46.240> it<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:46.479> lament<00:05:46.810> section

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
the piece isn't it the lament section

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.690 
the piece isn't it the lament section
which<00:05:47.470> yeah<00:05:47.770> as<00:05:47.950> you<00:05:48.070> say<00:05:48.250> building

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
which yeah as you say building

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.580 
which yeah as you say building
confidence<00:05:48.940> towards<00:05:49.630> them<00:05:49.780> and<00:05:50.050> also<00:05:50.229> their

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
confidence towards them and also their

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.540 
confidence towards them and also their
long<00:05:50.830> phrases<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:52.410> demanding<00:05:53.410> of<00:05:53.590> stamina

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
long phrases and demanding of stamina

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.760 
long phrases and demanding of stamina
the<00:05:55.030> intervals<00:05:55.570> are<00:05:55.840> often<00:05:56.169> very<00:05:56.350> wide

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
the intervals are often very wide

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.210 
the intervals are often very wide
they're<00:05:57.280> quite<00:05:57.550> they're<00:05:58.390> quite<00:05:58.600> awkward

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
they're quite they're quite awkward

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.310 
they're quite they're quite awkward
intervals<00:06:00.220> so<00:06:00.970> it's<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.539> moments<00:06:02.140> like<00:06:02.289> that

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
intervals so it's a moments like that

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.580 
intervals so it's a moments like that
that<00:06:02.800> bands<00:06:03.190> can<00:06:03.490> actually<00:06:03.880> fail<00:06:04.350> yeah<00:06:05.350> I

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
that bands can actually fail yeah I

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.060 
that bands can actually fail yeah I
agree

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
agree

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.740 
agree
we'll<00:06:06.310> be<00:06:06.490> trying<00:06:06.850> our<00:06:07.060> hardest<00:06:07.210> to<00:06:07.570> get

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
we'll be trying our hardest to get

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.300 
we'll be trying our hardest to get
through<00:06:08.020> moments<00:06:08.710> like<00:06:08.860> that<00:06:08.890> in<00:06:09.160> that

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
through moments like that in that

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.680 
through moments like that in that
performance<00:06:09.580> I'm<00:06:10.000> sure<00:06:10.360> you'll<00:06:10.510> do<00:06:10.660> a
