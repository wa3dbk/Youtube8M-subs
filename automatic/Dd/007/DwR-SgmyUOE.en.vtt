00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.369 

I<00:00:05.330> mean<00:00:06.330> obviously<00:00:06.690> this<00:00:06.839> is<00:00:07.020> an<00:00:07.140> exciting

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
I mean obviously this is an exciting

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.280 
I mean obviously this is an exciting
time<00:00:07.710> for<00:00:08.220> women<00:00:08.490> soccer<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.420> mean<00:00:10.050> it's<00:00:10.230> just

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
time for women soccer I mean it's just

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.280 
time for women soccer I mean it's just
to<00:00:10.860> have<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.219> first<00:00:11.490> game<00:00:11.849> ever<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.660> NWSL

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
to have the first game ever in the NWSL

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.600 
to have the first game ever in the NWSL
I<00:00:13.349> think<00:00:13.679> all<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.980> players<00:00:14.160> are<00:00:14.370> really

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
I think all the players are really

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.369 
I think all the players are really
excited<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.089> go<00:00:15.179> down<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.360> Kansas<00:00:15.780> City<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.020> be

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
excited to go down to Kansas City and be

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.560 
excited to go down to Kansas City and be
a<00:00:16.410> part<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.890> history<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.330> first

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
a part of history and that of that first

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.140 
a part of history and that of that first
game<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.080> i<00:00:19.320> think<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.189> my<00:00:20.699> guess<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
game so i think the my guess is the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.490 
game so i think the my guess is the
first<00:00:21.330> five<00:00:21.539> minutes<00:00:21.570> will<00:00:21.960> be<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.109> little<00:00:22.320> bit

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
first five minutes will be a little bit

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.320 
first five minutes will be a little bit
more<00:00:22.650> frantic<00:00:22.949> than<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.460> should<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.300> i

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
more frantic than it should be but i

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.910 
more frantic than it should be but i
think<00:00:24.660> both<00:00:24.810> teams<00:00:24.840> will<00:00:25.230> settle<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.800> i

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
think both teams will settle in and i

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.500 
think both teams will settle in and i
think<00:00:26.099> everyone<00:00:26.340> will<00:00:26.580> be<00:00:26.789> surprised<00:00:27.300> at<00:00:27.480> how

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
very good in in the attack and then

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.810 
very good in in the attack and then
they're<00:01:49.440> strong<00:01:49.710> defensively<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.400> well<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
they're strong defensively as well and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.249 
they're strong defensively as well and
then<00:01:50.910> with<00:01:51.060> Barney<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.509> goal<00:01:51.720> their

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
then with Barney and goal their

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
then with Barney and goal their
outstanding<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.100> they're<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> good<00:01:53.940> team<00:01:53.970> all

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
outstanding so they're a good team all

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.450 
outstanding so they're a good team all
over<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> field<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.560> we've<00:01:56.040> got<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.369> be

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
over the field so we've got to be

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.830 
over the field so we've got to be
prepared<00:01:56.490> obviously<00:01:57.479> everyone's<00:01:57.720> been

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
prepared obviously everyone's been

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.969 
prepared obviously everyone's been
talking<00:01:57.960> about<00:01:58.170> our<00:01:58.290> attack<00:01:58.650> so<00:01:58.830> that's

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
talking about our attack so that's

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.770 
talking about our attack so that's
definitely<00:01:59.190> a<00:01:59.400> strength<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.729> us<00:01:59.940> but<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.539> think

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
definitely a strength for us but I think

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.910 
definitely a strength for us but I think
we<00:02:00.840> also<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.140> good<00:02:01.289> players<00:02:01.440> all<00:02:01.680> over<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
we also have good players all over the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.469 
we also have good players all over the
field<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.310> know<00:02:02.369> our<00:02:02.729> defensive<00:02:03.149> line<00:02:03.300> is

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
field you know our defensive line is

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.960 
field you know our defensive line is
solid<00:02:03.840> straight<00:02:04.740> from<00:02:04.950> kk<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.580> back<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
solid straight from kk in the back to

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.550 
solid straight from kk in the back to
the<00:02:06.000> front<00:02:06.180> line<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.479> think<00:02:06.780> we'll<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:06.960> solid

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the front line I think we'll be solid

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.040 
the front line I think we'll be solid
over<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.890> field<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:09.090> will<00:02:09.750> come<00:02:09.869> together

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
over the field and we will come together

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.570 
over the field and we will come together
and<00:02:10.320> be<00:02:10.410> okay<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.860> first<00:02:11.070> game<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.370> mean

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and be okay in this first game I mean

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.729 
and be okay in this first game I mean
when<00:02:11.850> we<00:02:12.000> were<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:13.110> Germany<00:02:13.380> in<00:02:13.709> the

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
when we were in Germany in the

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.490 
when we were in Germany in the
Netherlands<00:02:14.400> we're<00:02:15.300> all<00:02:15.480> talking<00:02:15.690> about<00:02:15.930> our

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
so I think there's definitely a big

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.220 
so I think there's definitely a big
level<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.100> excitement<00:02:23.690> with<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.870> national
