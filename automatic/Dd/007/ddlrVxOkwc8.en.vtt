00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.270
 Hello friends with you in contention 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.990
 today into the game the next mechanism you 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.160
 and cream calf legs from edishen on version 09 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.250
 4095 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.410
 and 010 0 but now we have a beta version 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.119
 there will be 5 build was the most in 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.150
 currently among us we are 4 11 and 14 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.070
 so but before you start watching this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.590
 mechanism I want to say the greatest 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.609
 thank you for being on my channel 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.679
 plucked up 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.360
 they say million viewing you just don't 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:39.149
 Can you imagine how happy I was to 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.390
 saw just wanted to break something but 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.450
 it was very cool but the mechanism is called 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.890
 us hidden ashes pass in the cabin not 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.739
 saw this mechanism on 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.809
 yet version but it could not 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.340
 thought and thought and decided his yolks 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.719
 do on dust and version so go in 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.570
 room and here we see here our cameras and 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:06.659
 hide and here us for the stove so but 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.390
 so then another someone we need 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.270
 something to break and break we need here 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.790
 this one here so we'll wait a little bit 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.750
 let's wait a little bit for now 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.060
 water drop 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.070
 all and Odessans can go to another 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.510
 to whom 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.450
 us, too, chests so here well, and now I 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.960
 I will show how to build this mechanism but 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:33.170
 pause and resume it so 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.710
 here I again resumed the mechanism and now 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.790
 I show how it works but now 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.950
 I'll break here 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.880
 Here for these block which I broke at us 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.729
 is a sign 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.610
 and on the plate again holds the signs and 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.360
 gestures sand here is public lag 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.060
 lags lags 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.810
 so here here I have aids cactus on 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.880
 cactus 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.229
 I basis is terrible in PM 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.539
 lead here on 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.890
 she keeps these quotes in the sand 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:04.009
 who was behind the wall will show this one 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.450
 the sand is not where they keep on here 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:14.660
 here we have this tablet again 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:17.600
 became such a signal already conducts here to 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.780
 this and toyota how to say the term so 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:26.260
 how can I become the same here 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.140
 that is, when we break down that block 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.930
 top model these labels and we immediately 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.600
 shinai flow water but when it starts flowing 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.069
 then fall overhead blocks and overlaps 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.930
 water to never flow 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:45.280
 that is, here and the water flows here 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.410
 so the plates she rises and here comes 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.220
 here is the signal here I built in specially 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.940
 in order to 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.420
 Well, it was not raining since there is a version 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.070
 rain 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.620
 they are very simple cool but there is rain 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.590
 Well, in general, here is the whole mechanism 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.620
 very simple who understood put huskies 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.910
 who did not understand too put huskies just 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.550
 write comments who do not understand and I 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.230
 trying to answer your question but in 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.720
 general view now the signature on the channel 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.750
 put likes write comments 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.709
 and the greatest humus with the greatest 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.739
 thank you for half a million good luck and 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.739
 bye everyone
