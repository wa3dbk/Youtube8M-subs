00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.260
 hello now you will see 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.580
 what can replace the standard lamp 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.670
 head light 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.410
 if you are not satisfied with the lighting 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.470
 roadbed or you want 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.700
 unload your scooters electrical system 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.300
 and motorcycles 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:39.370
 well, or both in this box 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.360
 packaged arriving stones 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.219
 from China 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.579
 is that same diode lamp 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.100
 it cost me about 350 rubles 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.320
 free shipping 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.329
 box contains the complete set 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:01.109
 lamp reflector nut for mounting 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.600
 radiator lamp and ring for mounting 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.680
 reflector nut lamp consist of 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.860
 high power diodes 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.110
 which at near fire 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.980
 and at 20 watts when working far 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.079
 lighting is also here 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:22.020
 aluminum radiator in which 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:25.810
 there is a fan there is a block 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.790
 stabilization of the power section to the far 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.759
 dazzle light intensity 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.090
 flow at maximum power 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.619
 is 2000 lumens which of course 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.439
 an order of magnitude more than standard headlamps and 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.600
 which use incandescent bulbs as 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.570
 simple and halogen and 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.690
 In a scooter for example, basically they put 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.930
 simple lamps 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:59.030
 Here is the assembled lamp 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.030
 and now we will connect it check 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.390
 so well and finally I would like to add 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.240
 that you should not chase a very big 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.820
 headlight brightness is appropriate to rule 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.260
 the golden mean that is necessary to 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.200
 the light was good and oncoming the same time 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.990
 he did not blind anyone liked 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.800
 finger top who does not like it press 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.800
 finger down
