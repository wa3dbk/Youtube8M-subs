00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.509 
I'm quickly going to search up his price
actually<00:00:12.630> because<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.960> think<00:00:13.290> he's<00:00:13.920> gone<00:00:14.309> up

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
actually because I think he's gone up

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.279 
actually because I think he's gone up
quite<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.179> bit<00:00:15.570> because<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.839> think<00:00:16.020> one<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.199> my

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
quite a bit because I think one of my

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.170 
quite a bit because I think one of my
friends<00:00:16.650> has<00:00:16.680> him<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.070> he's<00:00:17.220> paid<00:00:17.460> like<00:00:17.640> 1.3

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
friends has him and he's paid like 1.3

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.279 
friends has him and he's paid like 1.3
mil<00:00:18.359> oh<00:00:19.039> Jesus<00:00:20.039> he's<00:00:20.279> about<00:00:20.720> 11<00:00:21.720> point<00:00:21.960> two<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
mil oh Jesus he's about 11 point two and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.769 
mil oh Jesus he's about 11 point two and
a<00:00:22.320> half<00:00:22.529> I'd<00:00:22.830> say<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:24.000> could<00:00:24.210> get<00:00:24.420> him<00:00:24.510> before

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
a half I'd say we could get him before

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.529 
a half I'd say we could get him before
but<00:00:24.810> hopefully<00:00:25.380> he'll<00:00:25.560> drop<00:00:25.859> because<00:00:26.490> if<00:00:27.090> he's

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
but hopefully he'll drop because if he's

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.980 
but hopefully he'll drop because if he's
that<00:00:27.779> price<00:00:28.109> he<00:00:28.439> will<00:00:29.220> take<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.670> longer<00:00:30.449> time<00:00:30.480> to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
that price he will take a longer time to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.020 
that price he will take a longer time to
get<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:31.740> anyway<00:00:32.099> since<00:00:32.309> last<00:00:32.550> episode
