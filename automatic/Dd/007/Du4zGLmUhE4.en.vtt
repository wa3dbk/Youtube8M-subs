00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
so we're gonna stay on the couch

so we're gonna stay on the couch
biological<00:00:16.619> station<00:00:16.800> property<00:00:17.369> we're

biological station property we're
heading<00:00:18.029> out<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.330> our<00:00:18.480> main<00:00:18.690> research<00:00:19.320> saying

our<00:00:20.130> ideas<00:00:20.550> about<00:00:20.580> perennial<00:00:21.180> wheat<00:00:21.330> are<00:00:21.570> that

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
our ideas about perennial wheat are that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.640 
our ideas about perennial wheat are that
we<00:00:23.880> want<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> management<00:00:25.230> system<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
we want to get to a management system a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.189 
we want to get to a management system a
crop<00:00:25.890> system<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.609> looks<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.539> functions

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
crop system that looks and and functions

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.779 
crop system that looks and and functions
a<00:00:28.260> little<00:00:28.470> bit<00:00:28.590> more<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.220> natural

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
a little bit more like a natural

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.299 
a little bit more like a natural
ecosystem<00:00:29.910> they'd<00:00:30.599> see<00:00:30.840> around<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:32.160> for

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
ecosystem they'd see around here so for

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.680 
ecosystem they'd see around here so for
example<00:00:32.399> if<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.850> weren't<00:00:33.000> growing<00:00:33.270> crops

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
example if we weren't growing crops

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.130 
example if we weren't growing crops
you'd<00:00:34.380> probably<00:00:34.680> see<00:00:35.219> some<00:00:36.180> sort<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.450> prairie

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
you'd probably see some sort of prairie

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.760 
you'd probably see some sort of prairie
and<00:00:37.590> then<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> forest<00:00:38.309> through<00:00:38.730> time<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.770> that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
and then a forest through time and that

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.020 
and then a forest through time and that
ecosystem<00:00:43.370> functions<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.520> its<00:00:44.670> own<00:00:44.820> without

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
ecosystem functions on its own without

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.900 
ecosystem functions on its own without
management<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.649> figure<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.070> those

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
management and so we figure if those

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.600 
management and so we figure if those
plants<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.570> mostly<00:00:48.870> perennial<00:00:49.469> at<00:00:50.190> most<00:00:50.489> of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
plants are mostly perennial at most of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.000 
plants are mostly perennial at most of
our<00:00:50.730> crop<00:00:50.940> plants<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.390> annual<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.890> idea

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
our crop plants are annual so the idea

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.220 
our crop plants are annual so the idea
would<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.520> maybe<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.239> perennial<00:00:54.780> plant<00:00:55.050> would

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
would be maybe a perennial plant would

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.779 
would be maybe a perennial plant would
help<00:00:55.469> us<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.890> little<00:00:56.039> bit<00:00:56.129> closer<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
help us get a little bit closer to the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.270 
help us get a little bit closer to the
natural<00:00:57.770> ecosystem<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.800> would<00:00:59.100> be

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
natural ecosystem that would be

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.929 
natural ecosystem that would be
occurring<00:00:59.730> here<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.329> step<00:01:00.719> through<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:02.570> in

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
occurring here the step through here in

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.250 
occurring here the step through here in
2007<00:01:06.140> we<00:01:07.580> started<00:01:08.580> working<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.600> this

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
2007 we started working with this

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.649 
2007 we started working with this
perennial<00:01:10.590> wheat<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:12.090> bit<00:01:12.240> slightly

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
perennial wheat on a little bit slightly

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.120 
perennial wheat on a little bit slightly
bigger<00:01:12.900> scale<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.500> we're<00:01:13.619> able<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.920> put<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
bigger scale so we're able to put it

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.330 
bigger scale so we're able to put it
into<00:01:14.430> our<00:01:14.460> long<00:01:14.700> term<00:01:14.880> organic<00:01:15.119> trial<00:01:15.979> we<00:01:16.979> see

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
into our long term organic trial we see

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.100 
into our long term organic trial we see
it<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> brand<00:01:17.970> new<00:01:18.119> way<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.570> organic

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
it as a brand new way that organic

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.859 
it as a brand new way that organic
farmers<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.880> any<00:01:20.880> farmer<00:01:21.270> interested<00:01:21.780> in

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
farmers and any farmer interested in

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.700 
farmers and any farmer interested in
sustainability<00:01:22.409> could<00:01:23.840> grow<00:01:24.840> crops<00:01:25.140> without

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
sustainability could grow crops without

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.819 
sustainability could grow crops without
having<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:27.270> worry<00:01:27.479> about<00:01:27.570> replanting<00:01:28.290> every

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
having to worry about replanting every

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.120 
having to worry about replanting every
year<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.930> protect<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> soil<00:01:31.590> for

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
year and so we can protect the soil for

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.249 
year and so we can protect the soil for
three<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:32.820> four<00:01:32.850> years<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.450> don't<00:01:33.630> sure<00:01:33.840> quite

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
three or four years we don't sure quite

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.219 
three or four years we don't sure quite
how<00:01:34.290> long<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:36.060> training<00:01:36.509> will<00:01:36.630> keep<00:01:36.960> coming

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
how long this training will keep coming

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.090 
how long this training will keep coming
back<00:01:37.400> but<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.090> far<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.689> good<00:01:39.720> as<00:01:40.350> we're<00:01:40.650> really

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
back but so far so good as we're really

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.999 
back but so far so good as we're really
thrilled<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.840> USDA<00:01:43.799> Organic<00:01:44.570> research

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
thrilled that the USDA Organic research

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.670 
thrilled that the USDA Organic research
project<00:01:47.009> has<00:01:47.630> just<00:01:48.630> informed<00:01:48.810> us<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.229> our

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
project has just informed us that our

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.149 
project has just informed us that our
grant<00:01:50.009> proposal<00:01:50.990> was<00:01:51.990> funded<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.040> this

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
grant proposal was funded and so this

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.859 
grant proposal was funded and so this
will<00:01:53.399> give<00:01:53.579> us<00:01:53.610> about<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.509> million<00:01:54.720> dollars

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
will give us about a million dollars

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.719 
will give us about a million dollars
over<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> next<00:01:55.530> four<00:01:55.860> years<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.399> try<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
over the next four years to try and

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.910 
over the next four years to try and
develop<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.210> new<00:01:57.270> experimental<00:01:57.899> crop<00:01:58.229> for

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
develop this new experimental crop for

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.950 
develop this new experimental crop for

Michigan in the Upper Midwest organic
farmers<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.619> other<00:02:02.159> farmers<00:02:02.579> will<00:02:02.729> benefit

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
farmers and other farmers will benefit

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.230 
farmers and other farmers will benefit
from<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.329> as<00:02:03.509> well<00:02:03.560> one<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.680> my<00:02:04.770> students<00:02:05.250> has

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
from this as well one of my students has

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.540 
from this as well one of my students has
already<00:02:06.509> tried<00:02:07.350> out<00:02:07.560> chocolate<00:02:07.920> chip<00:02:08.190> cookies

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
already tried out chocolate chip cookies

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.360 
already tried out chocolate chip cookies
and<00:02:09.239> we<00:02:09.390> compared<00:02:09.810> them<00:02:09.959> with<00:02:10.190> regular<00:02:11.190> annual

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
and we compared them with regular annual

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.530 
and we compared them with regular annual
wheat<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.239> perennial<00:02:12.569> weeds

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
wheat and this perennial weeds

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.649 
wheat and this perennial weeds
and<00:02:13.629> I<00:02:14.049> have<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.409> say<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.620> they<00:02:15.489> were<00:02:15.659> equally

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
and I have to say that they were equally

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.300 
and I have to say that they were equally
preferred<00:02:17.140> some<00:02:17.439> people<00:02:17.680> like<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:17.950> slightly

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
preferred some people like the slightly

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.069 
preferred some people like the slightly
nutty<00:02:18.609> or<00:02:18.700> taste<00:02:18.969> of<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.269> perennial<00:02:19.689> weed<00:02:19.840> and
