00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.450
 as a shot 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.330
 how are you and well, well, welcome 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.040
 here this new good video well in this 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.260
 I bring you the gameplays that 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.470
 because they saw a moment ago what 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.930
 it was the 3 exclusive naruto gameplays 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.820
 shippuden ultimate ninja storm 4 and good 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.920
 Well, I'm going to occupy these gameplays for 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.570
 ready then now that the changes 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.910
 what are we going to be seeing with respect to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.770
 what are the ancestors both in the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.379
 graphic issue as in the question of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.699
 combat the changes the modifications and 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.350
 all these things that they have done to the 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.379
 title that's good, we'll see if they are 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.239
 for good or bad, ok and good in this 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.670
 they are watching a bit of gameplay 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.470
 of what it is so good the truth is 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.300
 which is a change of musset as it was 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.040
 obvious is the new zas that like 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.650
 the new naruto that good since you already know 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.690
 that add one in each version that comes out 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.699
 of what is storm ok and good as 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.920
 we can see we have the return of the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.080
 pill of what is the word break that 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.880
 well remember that is that attack that 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.650
 allows us to break the defense of what 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.049
 is our enemy to be able to execute 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.180
 some ultimate youtube or some combo 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.080
 etc. ok 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.210
 unfortunately I 'm not going to much 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.830
 utility in what is this style of 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.900
 gameplay because good is 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.240
 combined what is the awakening mode the 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.920
 last use and reinforcement then then 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.510
 having the three combined really 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.070
 I do not see much need 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.380
 what is this pill 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.120
 let's hope that what is in progress 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.160
 what is the development of this game what 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.500
 remove because good, it was a little more 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.450
 useful in what is the aspect that each 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.280
 one had his special item and that good 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.200
 people will get used to what was 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.640
 this type of items that gave you certain 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.790
 end benefit of the character that 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.170
 you will use not then in that sense the 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.490
 truth is that I hope they remove what 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.140
 what is this pill not so 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.420
 but because it actually causes longer 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.310
 has any use either already really 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.050
 It will not give you any benefit 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.759
 comparison of how good you got that and 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.520
 can put the last one on YouTube or 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.530
 something of that nature then 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.660
 well from my point of view you can see 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.420
 a bit useless and good because here is 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.550
 where we see what is the second 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.770
 dynamic the second change not naruto 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.900
 I wanted to appear in what was the evo not 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.330
 I wanted to focus a little bit more on being 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.550
 a more competitive and good game then of 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.400
 some way you see a little more 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.900
 achieved this aspect that they seek and 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.240
 Well, what do I mean by this? 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.280
 I mean what is the double round ok 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.230
 how good we can see below what 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.210
 what they are or rather what time is 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.220
 what has elapsed or what is missing so that 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.710
 finish the game there are two shuriken 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.750
 shockey on each side 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.550
 this represents what is each of 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.600
 the rounds that are presented in what is 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.160
 in the departure 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.960
 obviously or I suppose that it's going to 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.240
 be able to expand to three or five as in 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.310
 the other fighting games not but good 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.990
 because something important that is seen is that 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.270
 good at winning a round 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.150
 they reset what bars are 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.430
 combat now let's hope these bars 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.690
 how good are the storm bars or 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.540
 the storm bars that good 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.430
 include what is the damage for what 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.590
 is the ultimate youtube or what is the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.900
 way to wake up that good so that for 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.900
 that has the increase in power that 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.450
 requires ok but good something important 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.610
 with respect to this is that good and 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.320
 would be here a matter of question and 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.050
 wonder if when entering 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.819
 way to wake up and win the round is going to 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.549
 prescribe what is the expert mode 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.859
 are going to emerge a couple of two are going to go up and 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.510
 questions regarding what this is 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.040
 new system obviously let's hope that 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.930
 we begin to clarify all this type of 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.359
 doubts throughout what is this 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.129
 week maybe in some seat that we 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.920
 tell or tell us what is going to 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.239
 go through these changes not because here to 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.219
 the time to see what is the change of 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.469
 round we see how the bars are reset 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:49.269
 however, well, we can not see or 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:51.189
 in these times you did not get to see that 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.919
 was in export mode that win 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.239
 the round and it would end ok in that 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.010
 moment that will end and move on to 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.079
 next role and see what happens because if 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.329
 good you are in awakening mode and good 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.180
 you finish the round and without it is the way 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.129
 export would not be something too because 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.199
 balanced in a certain way and the truth 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.120
 is that it would be something a bit boring 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.969
 a little tedious that out this way 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.359
 no then well we can see what they are 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:17.530
 and what is the role breaking armor that 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.660
 Well, it 's time to be 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.669
 good hitting too close to the enemy 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.430
 will see the damage the damage what is the 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.530
 battle not scratches loss of by 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.870
 example of the armors of the 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.160
 clothes on some characters you see from this 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.020
 no way 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.880
 and unfortunately this always yes good 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.100
 they will reveal many things to us 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.750
 respect to what is the gameplay that if 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.730
 we can see that there are still three 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.770
 combos we will not have the fourth combo 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.900
 back what good thing it would look like 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.360
 come for a long time it was good 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.460
 something that they mentioned to us and does not look 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.110
 what is the counterattack then I do not know 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.000
 it is and well it just does not come 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.500
 implemented I say here does not use the 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.200
 person because good this is simply 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.270
 showing what the museum is then 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.410
 Well now let's say that there we do 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.790
 there is a little more what is the 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.950
 aspect of the information that we have 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.110
 so far but good if the 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.850
 guard break we will have the counter attacks 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.690
 something like that half obvious only 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.630
 let's hope they do the 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.830
 relevant modifications ok and with 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.840
 regarding what is the change of 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.180
 characters only was seen in the 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.500
 trailer that was the e3 the good agent 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.390
 then to enter the namco channel to 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.370
 perform what is the trailer there you see 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.200
 more or less how it works what is the 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.900
 let's hope it's good 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.000
 of dynamic as seen in what is that 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.250
 trailer no and well we can see the change 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.600
 what is the museum and the last this 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.520
 cure that good so it is a little 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.590
 missing the truth is that it was already a little 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.270
 needed to be given a pretty set 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.460
 but pretty good 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.770
 the people because these are the changes that 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.750
 we have here we have what is double 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.490
 round we have what is the restart of 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.340
 the storm bars to the change of 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.620
 round we have the new many sets and 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.030
 Well, the truth is that they are changes 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.370
 that come pretty well obviously 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.990
 we lack a lot of information that good 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.150
 let's hope we can analyze what it is 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.100
 this kind of videos to see what is it 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.990
 that awaits us in the future 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.760
 what is the storm saga we hope that 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.530
 everything is quite good here is where 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.660
 see the break tree that mentioned them 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.640
 where he loses what is the vest not 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.990
 but good in this case nothing more and good 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.270
 people, I hope you liked it 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.590
 this video I think that many will already notice 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.150
 the differences that there are with 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.010
 previous versions and why they can not 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.580
 be in the generation consoles 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.170
 passed not too many 60 fps particles and 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.540
 well then so I hope you have them 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.730
 liked this little video well now yes 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.650
 that mentioning the new qualities 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.240
 that will have this storm and good title 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.360
 people, so here I say goodbye, see you 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.360
 the next 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.230
 Y
