the<00:00:17.699> hook<00:00:18.380> basically<00:00:19.380> we're<00:00:19.529> going<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> put<00:00:19.859> it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
the hook basically we're going to put it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.200 
the hook basically we're going to put it
right<00:00:20.160> here<00:00:20.220> at<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.609> front<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> hook

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
right here at the front of the hook

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.509 
right here at the front of the hook
where<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.720> basically<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> head<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
where the basically the head and the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.279 
where the basically the head and the
chest<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> fly<00:00:24.359> would<00:00:24.630> be<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.109> just

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
chest of the fly would be and you just

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.040 
chest of the fly would be and you just
kind<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.650> want<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.310> hold<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.640> end<00:00:27.000> wrap<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
kind of want to hold one end wrap the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.870 
kind of want to hold one end wrap the
other<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> other<00:00:28.769> hand<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.699> there's

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
other with the other hand so there's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.870 
other with the other hand so there's
maybe<00:00:30.060> eight<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:30.390> nine<00:00:30.710> wraps<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:32.009> thin<00:00:32.640> wire

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
maybe eight or nine wraps of thin wire

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.069 
maybe eight or nine wraps of thin wire
light<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> front<00:00:35.690> once<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:36.899> that

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
light on the front once you get that

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.310 
light on the front once you get that
twisted<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:40.129> like<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:42.020> we're<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> go

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
twisted on like that we're going to go

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.279 
twisted on like that we're going to go
ahead<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.649> take<00:00:43.829> our<00:00:43.860> thread<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:45.110> lock<00:00:46.110> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
ahead and take our thread and lock it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.160 
ahead and take our thread and lock it
down<00:00:46.850> basically<00:00:47.850> starting<00:00:48.360> behind<00:00:48.660> between

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
down basically starting behind between

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350 
down basically starting behind between
the<00:00:49.320> eye<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.250> hook<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> lead<00:00:50.940> itself

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the eye of the hook and the lead itself

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.380 
the eye of the hook and the lead itself
and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.260> wrap<00:00:52.440> backwards<00:00:52.980> kind<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.850> weave<00:00:54.180> in

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
and then wrap backwards kind of weave in

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.029 
and then wrap backwards kind of weave in
the<00:00:54.539> thread<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.140> out<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.289> those<00:00:55.500> coils<00:00:55.949> of

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the thread in and out of those coils of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.040 
the thread in and out of those coils of
lead<00:00:56.219> basically<00:00:57.149> that's<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.840> lock

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
lead basically that's going to just lock

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.250 
lead basically that's going to just lock
it<00:00:58.079> down<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.710> doesn't<00:00:59.190> move<00:01:00.140> through<00:01:01.140> the

it down so that doesn't move through the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.229 
it down so that doesn't move through the
rest<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> tying<00:01:02.219> processes<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.030> tie<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
rest of the tying processes we tie the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.390 
rest of the tying processes we tie the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
going to lay that on the hook shank and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.910 
going to lay that on the hook shank and
lock<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.850> some<00:01:38.880> wraps<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.479> thread
