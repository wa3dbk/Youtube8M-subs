good<00:02:31.300> normal<00:02:31.750> tricks<00:02:32.020> and<00:02:32.320> everything<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.920> I

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
good normal tricks and everything and I

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.890 
good normal tricks and everything and I
was<00:02:33.250> really<00:02:33.459> respecting<00:02:34.030> them<00:02:34.209> for<00:02:34.630> what<00:02:34.750> they

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
was really respecting them for what they

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.070 
was really respecting them for what they
did<00:02:34.959> because<00:02:35.280> that's<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.459> real<00:02:37.150> riding<00:02:37.660> from

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
did because that's the real riding from

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.949 
did because that's the real riding from
for<00:02:38.500> what<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:38.860> think<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.430> really<00:02:39.910> focus<00:02:40.269> on<00:02:40.450> whips

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
for what I think I really focus on whips

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.380 
for what I think I really focus on whips
because<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.709> think<00:02:41.920> that's<00:02:42.280> way<00:02:42.790> harder<00:02:43.209> than

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
because I think that's way harder than

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.940 
because I think that's way harder than
doing<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.870> back<00:02:44.019> field<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.970> game<00:02:49.239> is<00:02:49.950> pretty

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
doing a back field this game is pretty

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.940 
doing a back field this game is pretty
much<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.820> main<00:02:52.000> event<00:02:52.390> it's<00:02:53.350> in<00:02:53.620> u.s.<00:02:55.950> that's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
much the main event it's in u.s. that's

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.100 
much the main event it's in u.s. that's
where<00:02:57.370> everything

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
where everything

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.060 
where everything
I<00:02:59.910> started<00:03:00.910> freestyle<00:03:01.390> I've<00:03:01.870> done<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:02.260> twice

that's<00:03:10.570> what<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.750> like<00:03:10.990> because<00:03:11.230> that's<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.890> lot

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
that's what I like because that's a lot

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.180 
that's what I like because that's a lot
of<00:03:12.160> pressure<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:13.390> I'm<00:03:13.540> going<00:03:13.810> there<00:03:14.190> there's
