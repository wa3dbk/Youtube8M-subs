00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.090
Tango-Endo

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.730
Now it only takes two!

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.740
The Technology

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.900
This design reduces instrument
engagement allowing faster advancement with less resistance.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.740
Creates space for dental debris.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.540
Reduces compressive and tensile
stresses during use,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.500
enabling improved instrument durability.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.259
Increased flexibility without
sacrificing strength.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.310
Tango-Endo instruments are tough and
reusable

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.330
providing you dramatic savings compared
to single use systems.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.070
You can save thousands of dollars per
year.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.540
SAFETY

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.960
The Tango-Endo reciprocating system moves in a truly reciprocating motion.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.960
Unlike 360-degree reciprocation

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.829
the Tango-Endo system prevents excessive binding.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.829
Unlike 360-degree reciprocation and
rotary systems

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.140
you can safely work lateral canal walls
while preserving canal anatomy.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.470
The Technique

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.940
Start by preparing straight line access
the canal orifice

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.320
explore the canal using small size hand
instruments

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.180
Or,  SafeSiders

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.140
Determine working length. Verify patency,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.880
and confirm a smooth reproducible glide
path.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.440
We recommend the use of SafeSiders for
glide path creation

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.690
always irrigate and enlarge the glide
path to a minimum 20/02 preparation.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.020
In the presence of irrigant, follow
along the glide path

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.040
and shape the wider extensions of oval
canals with the Tango-Endo shaping instrument

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.770
The Tango-Endo shaping instrument has a single blue band on the latch head

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.130
Use a gentle inward packing motion with
short two to three millimeter amplitude strokes

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.939
until the working length is reached.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.219
Clean the flutes frequently during
instrumentation and inspect for unwinding

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.880
or abnormalities.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.480
Always utilize minimal apical pressure. Do not force the instrument
down the canal.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.810
Use the tango finishing instrument in
the same manner.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.480
The Tango-Endo finishing instrument features the double blue band
on the latch head.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.640
If you cannot achieve link recapitulate
with the Tango-Endo shaping instrument.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.220
Confirm the Tango finishing instrument
reaches the apical measurement.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.240
Move the instrument continuously against
the canal walls until there is no resistance.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.450
The precision Tango-Endo gutta purcha 
point is now fit

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.970
Verify the gutta percha point fits the
length.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.740
As you can see the reusable Tango-Endo performs superior
canal shaping in minutes saving you valuable chair
time.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.440
The System

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.440
The Tango-Endo Introductory Kit

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.590
contains everything you need to complete
a great endo procedure.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.140
The kit includes three Tango-Endo Shaping

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.620
and three Tango-Endo Finishing
instruments.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.940
The Tango-Endo latch-type reciprocating handpiece

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.080
A box of precision matched Tango-Endo gutta percha points
