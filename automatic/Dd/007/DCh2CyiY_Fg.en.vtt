00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.880
 the first advice would be to choose trees that do not have resin this is 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.239
 particularly important because restinga tends to burn the roots of 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.939
 the forks then criticized the marble under the conditions that allow 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.120

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.050
 tree then place the marquillas so that she is in front effectively

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.890
 resistant direct light direct sun however it is not convenient that the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.160

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.790
 they do not delay more in their flowering and that they grow a little less 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.729
 that what they would do if you put a very little conditions 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.460
 better with some of that it is important that you take this detail into account 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.330

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.340
 and in these same conditions that only for what you achieve with a good rhythm 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.620
 the second advice would be additional take care of the forms and prevent them from 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.380
 get sick with bacteria with a taste info with a face for example 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.460
 some pests that the year 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.180
