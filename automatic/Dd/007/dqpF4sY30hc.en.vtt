00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.929 
its text to shut down the computer and
then<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.769> will<00:00:22.949> double<00:00:23.340> click<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.730> button

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
then I will double click this button

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.980 
then I will double click this button
here<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:25.650> here<00:00:26.269> first<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.390> all<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.599> will

here and in here first of all I will
write<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> try-catch<00:00:29.670> block<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
write a try-catch block so this is a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.760 
write a try-catch block so this is a

we<00:01:51.990> will<00:01:52.200> pass<00:01:52.670> us<00:01:53.990> argument<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.860> will<00:01:56.009> write

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
we will pass us argument so I will write

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.460 
we will pass us argument so I will write
double<00:01:56.939> flip<00:01:57.210> coat<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.840> right

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
double flip coat and right

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:07.830 
double flip coat and right
shut<00:02:00.990> down<00:02:02.040> space<00:02:03.240> -<00:02:04.240> s<00:02:04.480> space<00:02:05.110> -<00:02:05.800> T<00:02:06.090> space<00:02:07.090> zero

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
shut down space - s space - T space zero

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.160 
shut down space - s space - T space zero
so<00:02:08.830> this<00:02:09.040> is<00:02:09.250> basically<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:10.030> command<00:02:10.960> line

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
so this is basically a command line

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.890 
so this is basically a command line

this button now this is the code for
shutting<00:02:43.540> down<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.840> computer<00:02:44.230> let's<00:02:44.410> try<00:02:44.710> and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
shutting down the computer let's try and

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.430 
shutting down the computer let's try and
run<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.310> program<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:49.110> will<00:02:50.110> right<00:02:50.410> click

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
run the program and I will right click

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.800 
run the program and I will right click
and<00:02:50.890> run<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.250> program<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.020

second because I have given the weight

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.330 
second because I have given the weight
