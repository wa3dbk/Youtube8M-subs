okay<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.450> next<00:03:51.570> test<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.110> going<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.470> be

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
okay so the next test is going to be

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.800 
okay so the next test is going to be
down<00:03:53.040> this<00:03:53.310> car<00:03:53.610> oh<00:03:53.640> we<00:03:54.030> want<00:03:54.209> some<00:03:54.420> distance

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
down this car oh we want some distance

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.080 
down this car oh we want some distance
this<00:03:55.560> studio<00:03:55.950> was<00:03:56.280> originally<00:03:56.700> built<00:03:56.850> as<00:03:57.030> a

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
this studio was originally built as a

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.729 
this studio was originally built as a
functional<00:03:57.600> feta<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.019> it's<00:03:58.170> full<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.470> concrete

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
functional feta so it's full of concrete

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.220 
functional feta so it's full of concrete
and<00:03:59.190> rebar<00:03:59.430> which<00:03:59.970> plays<00:04:00.269> havoc<00:04:00.540> with<00:04:00.690> signals

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
and rebar which plays havoc with signals

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.680 
and rebar which plays havoc with signals
so<00:04:02.040> we<00:04:02.100> have<00:04:02.190> about<00:04:02.340> 25<00:04:02.730> feet<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.269> corridor

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
so we have about 25 feet of corridor

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.500 
so we have about 25 feet of corridor
here<00:04:03.870> which<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.140> about<00:04:04.320> 75<00:04:04.920> feet<00:04:05.190> I've<00:04:06.120> got<00:04:06.330> one

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
here which is about 75 feet I've got one

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.360 
here which is about 75 feet I've got one
life<00:04:06.690> hiding<00:04:07.260> under<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.590> stairs<00:04:07.890> down<00:04:08.100> there

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
life hiding under the stairs down there

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.550 
life hiding under the stairs down there
and<00:04:08.850> I've<00:04:09.360> got<00:04:09.570> my<00:04:09.690> assistant<00:04:09.870> Dilip<00:04:10.410> with

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
and I've got my assistant Dilip with

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
hundred shots in their fight every time

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.500 
hundred shots in their fight every time
it's<00:04:29.320> 100%<00:04:29.710> great<00:04:30.220> that's<00:04:30.910> great<00:04:31.120> in<00:04:31.390> these

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
conditions okay so that brings us to the

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.700 
conditions okay so that brings us to the
