hi there my name is ice coaster and in
this<00:00:11.879> tutorial<00:00:12.000> we're<00:00:12.420> gonna<00:00:12.510> be<00:00:12.600> talking

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
this tutorial we're gonna be talking

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.529 
this tutorial we're gonna be talking
about<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.990> few<00:00:13.080> things<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> dinosaur

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:15.539 
about a few things this is a dinosaur

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.770 
about a few things this is a dinosaur
that<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.320> built<00:00:16.770> for<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.970> demo<00:00:18.240> for<00:00:18.480> one<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.630> my

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
that I built for as a demo for one of my

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.749 
that I built for as a demo for one of my
classes<00:00:19.349> a<00:00:19.380> while<00:00:19.529> back<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:20.039> don't<00:00:20.670> have<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:22.759> in

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
classes a while back I don't have the in

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.609 
classes a while back I don't have the in
progress<00:00:24.150> versions<00:00:24.839> of<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.109> well<00:00:25.259> I<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.380> this

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
progress versions of it well I do this

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.450 
progress versions of it well I do this
is<00:00:25.679> actually<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.310> progress

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
is actually one of the in progress

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.370 
is actually one of the in progress
versions<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.750> fitness<00:00:28.019> version<00:00:28.259> is

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
versions and the the fitness version is

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.230 
versions and the the fitness version is
right<00:00:28.529> here<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.400> wanted<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.669> show<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
right here but I wanted to show you the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.740 
right here but I wanted to show you the
the<00:00:30.679> Z<00:00:31.679> spheres<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.520> can<00:00:32.669> still<00:00:32.880> see<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the Z spheres you can still see the the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.520 
the Z spheres you can still see the the
legacy<00:00:35.540> polygroups<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.810> resulted<00:00:37.320> from<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
legacy polygroups that resulted from the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.500 
legacy polygroups that resulted from the
z<00:00:37.740> spheres<00:00:38.540> okay<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.530> that's<00:00:41.010> pretty<00:00:41.390> good<00:00:42.390> on

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
z spheres okay so that's pretty good on

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.390 
z spheres okay so that's pretty good on
that<00:00:42.540> side<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.950> know<00:00:44.010> I've<00:00:44.190> got<00:00:44.310> the

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
that side but you know I've got the

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.590 
that side but you know I've got the
other<00:00:44.520> side<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.760> deal<00:00:44.880> with<00:00:45.000> there's<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.330> very

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
other side to deal with there's a very

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.540 
other side to deal with there's a very
very<00:00:45.780> useful<00:00:46.410> plugin<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.190> comes

and I'm going to actually need to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.600 
and I'm going to actually need to
reconstruct<00:01:03.420> my<00:01:03.720> subdivision<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.610> second

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610

the fewer Polly's you have the faster
the<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:11.070> UV<00:01:11.900> unwrap<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.080> going<00:01:13.230> to<00:01:13.290> go

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the the UV unwrap is going to go

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.910 
the the UV unwrap is going to go
and<00:01:15.180> I'm<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.870> to<00:01:15.930> collapse<00:01:16.230> the<00:01:16.500> septal

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and I'm going to collapse the septal

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.100 
and I'm going to collapse the septal
master<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.550> now<00:01:17.820> I'm<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.300> go<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.480> the<00:01:18.810> UV

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
master and now I'm going to go to the UV

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.920 
master and now I'm going to go to the UV
master<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.790> all<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.570> click<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
master and all you do is click the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.500 
master and all you do is click the
unwrap<00:01:22.320> button<00:01:22.680> that's<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.300> quick<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
unwrap button that's for the quick and

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.270 
unwrap button that's for the quick and
dirty<00:01:24.660> which<00:01:25.410> is<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.740> first<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.130> I'll

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
dirty which is the first one that I'll

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.010 
dirty which is the first one that I'll
show<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.640> I'll<00:01:26.729> show<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.210> variation

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
show you and I'll show you one variation

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.600 
show you and I'll show you one variation
on<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> quick<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:28.979> dirty<00:01:29.010> that's<00:01:29.340> also

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
on the quick and dirty that's also

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.000 
on the quick and dirty that's also
pretty<00:01:29.760> great<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.870> morph<00:01:31.080> UV<00:01:31.410> it

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
pretty great but if I have morph UV it

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.090 
pretty great but if I have morph UV it
will<00:01:32.160> actually<00:01:32.400> go<00:01:33.150> ahead<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:34.500> lay

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
will actually go ahead and just lay

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.310 
will actually go ahead and just lay
everything<00:01:35.520> flat<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.050> what<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
everything flat and this is what the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.950 
everything flat and this is what the
actual<00:01:37.470> UVs<00:01:37.860> look<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:39.180> they<00:01:39.300> morph<00:01:39.630> evn

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
actual UVs look like so they morph evn

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.830 
actual UVs look like so they morph evn
go<00:01:40.140> back<00:01:40.410> if<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.490> select<00:01:41.729> attract<00:01:42.150> they're

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
go back if you select attract they're

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.570 
go back if you select attract they're
going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.080> be<00:01:43.140> painting<00:01:43.320> blue<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.220> anywhere

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
going to be painting blue so anywhere

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.859 
going to be painting blue so anywhere
that<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.760> paint<00:01:44.970> blue<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.420> model<00:01:45.690> it's

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that you paint blue in the model it's

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.389 
that you paint blue in the model it's
gonna<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.440> that's<00:01:46.619> where<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.009> want<00:01:47.250> your

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
gonna think that's where you want your

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.120 
gonna think that's where you want your
seam<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.790> go<00:01:47.910> and<00:01:48.560> if<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.680> want<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:49.890> erase<00:01:50.100> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
seam to go and if you want to erase it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.969 
seam to go and if you want to erase it
it's<00:01:50.550> just<00:01:50.729> white<00:01:50.910> so<00:01:51.509> red<00:01:52.170> protects<00:01:52.560> blue

you want to you want to tile a texture

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.080 
you want to you want to tile a texture

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
tiling alpha that's possible if you

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
don't have a tiling alpha and you just

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.320 
don't have a tiling alpha and you just
make<00:02:09.950> in<00:02:10.950> Photoshop<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:11.430> instance<00:02:11.820> like<00:02:11.910> use

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
make in Photoshop for instance like use

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.270 
make in Photoshop for instance like use
a<00:02:12.360> procedural<00:02:12.989> which<00:02:13.650> I'll<00:02:13.770> show<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.040> a

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
a procedural which I'll show you just a

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.070 
a procedural which I'll show you just a
moment<00:02:15.530> what<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.680> can<00:02:16.830> see<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.459> where<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.570> is

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
moment what you can see is where it is

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.530 
moment what you can see is where it is
black<00:02:19.560> on<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.920> texture<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.610> pushes<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
black on the texture it pushes in on the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.780 
black on the texture it pushes in on the
surface<00:02:21.989> now<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.830> essentially<00:02:23.400> acting

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
surface now this is essentially acting

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.810 
surface now this is essentially acting
the<00:02:24.510> same<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.530> bump<00:02:26.130> map<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.580> isn't

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
the same as a bump map but isn't

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.150 
the same as a bump map but isn't
actually<00:02:27.390> deforming<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.049> geometry<00:02:28.680> it's

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
actually deforming the geometry it's

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160 
actually deforming the geometry it's
just<00:02:29.400> changing<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.970> lighting<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.750> appears

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
just changing the lighting so it appears

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.140 
just changing the lighting so it appears
to<00:02:31.350> be<00:02:31.470> deforming<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.890> geometry<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.910> we<00:02:33.030> can

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
to be deforming the geometry but we can

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.729 
to be deforming the geometry but we can
go<00:02:33.239> ahead<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.480> take<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> look<00:02:34.260> at<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> seam

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
go ahead and take a look at the seam

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.270 
go ahead and take a look at the seam
here

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
here

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.320 
here
with<00:02:36.880> morph<00:02:37.330> target<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:38.470> can<00:02:38.620> either<00:02:38.740> switch

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
with morph target you can either switch

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.390 
with morph target you can either switch
so<00:02:40.330> I've<00:02:40.420> got<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.690> noise<00:02:40.870> turned<00:02:41.230> off<00:02:41.380> now<00:02:41.410> so

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
so I've got the noise turned off now so

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.710 
so I've got the noise turned off now so
I'm<00:02:42.460> just<00:02:42.640> switching<00:02:43.000> back<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.360> forth<00:02:43.570> from

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
I'm just switching back and forth from

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.800 
I'm just switching back and forth from
the<00:02:43.870> current<00:02:44.230> state<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.270> saved<00:02:46.270> morph

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
the current state to the saved morph

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.010 
the current state to the saved morph
target<00:02:47.200> state<00:02:48.480> another<00:02:49.480> thing<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.690> can<00:02:49.780> do<00:02:49.900> is

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
target state another thing you can do is

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.740 
target state another thing you can do is
you<00:02:50.110> can<00:02:50.230> actually<00:02:50.850> paint<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.390> if<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.630> go

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
you can actually paint it in so if I go

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.920 
you can actually paint it in so if I go
to<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.959> brushes<00:02:53.640> click<00:02:54.640> em<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.450> select<00:02:55.840> the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
to the brushes click em to select the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.290 
to the brushes click em to select the
morph<00:02:56.140> target<00:02:56.440> brushes<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:56.860> find<00:02:57.130> morph<00:02:57.459> what

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
morph target brushes and find morph what

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.760 
morph target brushes and find morph what
I<00:02:58.330> can<00:02:58.480> do<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.959> just<00:03:00.150> paint<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:02.230> original

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
I can do is just paint in the original

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.850 
I can do is just paint in the original
state<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.430> saved<00:03:03.730> morph<00:03:04.180> state<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.709> that

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
state the saved morph state so that

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.680 
state the saved morph state so that
about<00:03:06.070> does<00:03:06.190> it<00:03:06.250> for<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:06.670> tutorial<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.360> the
