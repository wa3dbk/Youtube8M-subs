00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.040
 hi repeating we have said it 500 times 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.690
 not everything in the world of android are 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.510
 high- end devices and ships 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.070
 badge there are also very offers 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.139
 interesting within the range of 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.530
 input and that's what we're going to talk about today 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.940
 specifically the new series of lg 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.240
 electric 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.140
 or the ls axis of stress that is composed 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:31.949
 by lg l 40 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.989
 the lg the 70 and the lg the 90 of them we go 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.239
 to talk in the next video do not tell 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.160
 miss this new series was presented 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.470
 during 9 world congress this year 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.670
 As you can see, they all follow the same 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.160
 design lines 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.520
 this is a plastic fabrication with 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.510
 the matte back 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.150
 lg the smallest encounter but the most 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.670
 thick I have to say that I quite like 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.010
 the finish they present and that they 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.870
 they feel very good in their hands besides 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.450
 they all have in common that in their 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.430
 Inside let's find android 4.4 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.620
 point two kitkat 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.630
 we can rarely enjoy the last 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.410
 Android version on devices 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.410
 input range 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.580
 now let's go to see one by one their 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.670
 Specifications 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.740
 we begin with the lg l 40 the youngest of 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.870
 all in terms of design this 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.480
 device is quite compact and 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.300
 I personally find it thick but 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.040
 is the usual thing in this range is 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.130
 Made of plastic and housing 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 Rear back forgiveness can be removed 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.540
 It has a 3.5 inch 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.660
 resolution of 480 x 320 pixels unsuitable 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.180
 for the most demanding eyes neither for 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.650
 the biggest hands to me that I have 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.380
 small hands it costs me a little 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.149
 use it 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.890
 in your interior we are going to have a 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.549
 1.2-core dual processor 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.189
 gigahertz with 512 mb of ram and 4 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.159
 gigabytes of expandable internal memory 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.250
 through micro sd finally a 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.229
 1,540 milliamp battery now 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.800
 main camera is 3 megapixels and 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.870
 there is no front camera the result is not 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.330
 it's wrong but it's not to throw rockets 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.819
 between the settings we will find the 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.800
 curved shot some color effects and 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.720
 we can also configure the iso on 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.640
 brightness or white balance by 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.830
 last is the software we will not find 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.780
 functional of the high- end but yes 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.810
 some interesting as the well-known 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.360
 cut memo the guest mode and other 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.400
 motion functions by the way that 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.010
 this range includes in the new function of 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.959
 unlocking call that does not code with the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.079
 that we can unlock our phone 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.680
 through four strokes like 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:51.799
 a mix of what cnooc on and a code 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.290
 we continue with lg l 70 that presents a 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.530
 4.5 inch ips screen with 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.930
 resolution of 800 x 480 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.790
 pixel screen means that we 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.440
 is very clear especially if the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.890
 we compare directly with his brother 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.459
 higher 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.459
 90 as you can see if I approach 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.490
 the letters of the axis screen 70 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.260
 they do not look as clear as his 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.080
 90 axis 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.879
 we continue with your specifications this 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.159
 smartphone has a dual processor 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.739
 core to 1.2 gigahertz with a 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.510
 gigabytes of ram the internal memory is 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.239
 of 4 gigabytes expandable through 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.720
 micro sd finally your battery has a 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.310
 capacity of 2100 milliamps now the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.340
 camera improves considerably in 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.319
 comparison with lg l 40 it's about 5 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.420
 megapixels and in them if we go to 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.000
 find some shooting modes like 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.909
 the panoramic continuous shooting or 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.530
 sports in settings we will find the 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.090
 voice shot and we can also 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.530
 change the white balance brightness and 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.750
 the rest 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.090
 among its software functions we have 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.010
 once again quick memo and mode 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.500
 guest but also the screen 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.750
 smart 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.850
 with which the device is maintained 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.970
 active while we are looking and 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.160
 as not once more than not with two 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.890
 touch to turn off the screen and not 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.890
 code the code to unlock it 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.620
 finally we have the l90 axis to a 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.729
 compact smartphone with dimensions 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.040
 of 131 x 66 millimeters and a thickness of 97 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.970
 millimeters the screen is an ips panel 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:35.979
 of 4.7 inches with resolution qhd this 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:38.470
 is 960 x 540 pixels of course it is not 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.110
 of the best but as we could 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.520
 check compared to lg the 70 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.040
 shows higher quality 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.070
 your processor increases to 4 cores to 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.229
 1.2 gigahertz combined with a 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.690
 gigabyte of ram 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.940
 its battery reaches 2 thousand 540 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.979
 milliamps now keeping in mind 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.650
 that the screen resolution that has 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.870
 and that the nexus 5 has a capacity of 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.780
 2,300 milliamps I think it's 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.800
 pretty good the internal memory is 8 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.139
 gb expandable through micro sd the 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.960
 camera is 8 megapixels and adds a 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.120
 mode plus the retroactive shot that what 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.030
 What it does is make a series of shots 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.070
 so that we can then choose the best 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.950
 the only software functions that 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.440
 brings the link l90 and the rest are not 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.000
 smart video that makes the video 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.870
 when we stop to look at the 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.970
 screen and also the operation with a 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.440
 hand that as its name indicates we 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.770
 will allow us to control our smartphone 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.390
 with one hand up here our brief 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.780
 introduction of these three devices 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.240
 mid-range input very interesting 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.540
 especially by incorporating a software 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.210
 almost to the last and for its price per 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.370
 course it's the 40 lg slope 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:59.860
 approximately approximately forgiveness 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:05.590
 with the 100 euros the lg the 70 about 175 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:08.470
 euros and finally the lg el in 90 225 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.570
 euros personally that's for me the 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.100
 best offer for having the best camera and 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.460
 a screen with a pretty resolution 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.639
 good 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.850
 despite not being so high to be a qhd 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.460
 which one would you like as always 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.349
 comment what you want, share the video 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.900
 if you feel like it and subscribe to our 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.789
 channel I say goodbye by juggling 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.210
 with these three devices until the 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.210
 next 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.170
 or not
