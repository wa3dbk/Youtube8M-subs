00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.220
 hello today we will tell you 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.170
 company burial site on site 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.020
 motherboard and charms again 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.020
 day under eighty 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.259
 This motherboard is based decide 4 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.240
 55 victory and modern 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.699
 intel core i5 core i7 processors performed by coldplay 1 56 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.919
 also the front is equipped with proprietary technology 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:28.740
 find on site 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.750
 coming home 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.850
 type of units but among them for delfi 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.700
 that is, some more useful for payment 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.050
 as we write in which 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.110
 stop 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.690
 well let's look at 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.690
 complete set fee 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.620
 in the kit we have 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.690
 quick install guide 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.850
 user guide 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.560
 description of the main points and principle 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.230
 actions from information 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.520
 club leadership like drums 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.940
 description of proprietary state functions 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.020
 dyskin and earlier and additional 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.870
 of programs 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.310
 also the fact that she is not a panel 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.550
 shells 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.550
 just look at your skill 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 we were attacked and beaten 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 we have an apa exit panel 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.140
 a large number of reduced will complete 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.140
 as well as adapters pray 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.730
 set of market in which 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.930
 and a set of piebalgs options 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.580
 t rolled 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.160
 not really short in aesthetic package 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.160
 lies the motherboard itself 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.550
 you may notice 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.640
 worth 1 56 significantly different in size 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.640
 appearance to sue 13 66 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.159
 on the back there is a set 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.800
 required volumes 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.329
 skoda poetry in half for keyboard and mouse 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.079
 optical and coaxial 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.749
 audio output 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.109
 ford breaking 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.999
 July 8, the portal is one of which sex fit 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.449
 then i sata 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:19.409
 two gigabit network audio portal 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.219
 connector 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.029
 core i5 core i7 processors 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:25.369
 reality 56 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:27.529
 having gu channel memory controller 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.189
 therefore, there is only four on the board 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.019
 slots for operational 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.779
 since this motherboard model 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:33.809
 designed specifically for 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:35.559
 there are a number of overclockers 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.979
 useful technology features 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.959
 one of these technologies is diagnostician 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.709
 which people often call doctor 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.319
 mom 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.769
 actually an abbreviation 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.669
 stands for growth driver 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.109
 i.e. assets managed by mop 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.289
 transistors 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.399
 jarmo siim more beijing uses energy 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:51.849
 lowers the temperature 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.069
 power elements 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.019
 technology all hit nothing more than 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.419
 heat pipe enlarged 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:57.319
 diameter 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.209
 due to the large diameter not found 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.969
 removes heat from the board's power system 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.849
 the assurance of the company allows to reduce 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.819
 element temperature 50 degrees 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.159
 celsius 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.709
 Now for the most interesting 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.299
 features we considered 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.079
 pay 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.809
 reality and 4 pin plug 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:15.229
 power is difficult even to relieve tension 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.099
 connecting them the right to give a set those who 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.729
 him 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:19.059
 can recall multimeters 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.659
 controls voltage 23 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.319
 RAM 4 on the left of the point of removal 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.299

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.130
 switch 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.620
 with which you can easily understand 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.630
 process voltages memory 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.589
 China 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:32.729
 and of course the main feature of the portal 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.329
 for approval 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:35.529
 which automatically without 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:36.259
 participation in the settlement 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.309
 conflict 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:41.219
 to activate his information ie 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:42.509
 press a button 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:44.199
 and next time you start maternal 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.019
 the board broke three four processors and 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.149
 RAM and the world's secret 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:51.369
 if users of devices that as 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:52.779
 first three years 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:53.869
 can always use

 further after lowering the base frequency 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:01.559
 the beginning of the match 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:03.279
 before checking out the practice work 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.779
 technology to this day is russian 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.459

 cooling system by the way 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.609
 screw ancestors 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:15.939
 where traditionally 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.250

 american cooling 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.479
 well it's time to create a system 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:51.569
 at first glance it may seem that 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.050

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.650
 plastic 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.000
 but it is worth clicking for example on 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.990
 power button image and board 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.540
 reacted immediately call

 blue led concern will start 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.839

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:08.769
 showing the number of face 

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:10.659
 power supplies used by the processor 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.229
 currently 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.449
 first thing karelin hours 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.059
 current processor frequency 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:19.699
 is 2500 35 years old 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.360
 bus frequency 103 3 5 years 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.060
 spend than the system and activated 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.589

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:27.389
 after launching payment note that 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.749
 technology is included as well as warn 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:31.109
 what a change in settings 

00:05:31.109 --> 00:05:33.559
 out of sight menu extremely undesirable 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:35.739
 So let's see what our general was 

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:37.619
 make the system processor frequency 

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:40.449
 swaps 3,733 megahertz 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.449
 and the system bus frequency 196 01 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.719
 finally check the broken opportunity 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:48.569
 instantly caught on raise now was

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.089
 CPU voltage changed 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:02.430

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.699
 two-tenth shuttle 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.990
 we covered the main features 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.430
 55-day motherboard 8 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.280
 It remains to wait for October to evaluate 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.400
 new performance as well as 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.599
 overclocking potential 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:17.149
 I'll see you
