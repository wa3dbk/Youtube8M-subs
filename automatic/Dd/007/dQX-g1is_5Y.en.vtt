the history of the chromakey stems from

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:07.480 
the history of the chromakey stems from
the<00:00:05.779> desire<00:00:06.109> of<00:00:06.439> attaining<00:00:06.529> the<00:00:06.950> regulation

usually a result restrictions that would
stem<00:00:14.809> from<00:00:15.020> filming<00:00:15.440> the<00:00:15.500> scene<00:00:15.709> where<00:00:15.980> it

stem from filming the scene where it
takes<00:00:16.190> place<00:00:16.340> basically<00:00:16.789> that<00:00:17.240> means<00:00:17.359> the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
takes place basically that means the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.029 
takes place basically that means the

chromakey allows filmmakers to create
the<00:00:19.130> film<00:00:19.310> scenes<00:00:19.730> in<00:00:19.970> settings<00:00:20.480> that<00:00:20.599> would

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
the film scenes in settings that would

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.179 
the film scenes in settings that would
be<00:00:20.839> difficult<00:00:21.019> impossible<00:00:21.740> to<00:00:21.800> reach<00:00:21.980> an

be difficult impossible to reach an

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.589 
be difficult impossible to reach an
example<00:00:22.640> would<00:00:22.759> be<00:00:22.789> if<00:00:22.999> the<00:00:23.119> scene<00:00:23.359> were

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
example would be if the scene were

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.060 
example would be if the scene were
supposed<00:00:24.050> to<00:00:24.109> take<00:00:24.289> place<00:00:24.470> in<00:00:24.769> space

obviously<00:00:25.759> filmmakers<00:00:26.269> are<00:00:26.390> not<00:00:26.509> going<00:00:26.689> to<00:00:26.749> go

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:26.839 
obviously filmmakers are not going to go

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.359 
obviously filmmakers are not going to go
into<00:00:27.019> space<00:00:27.289> to<00:00:27.439> film<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.710> scene<00:00:27.890> so<00:00:28.189> they

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
into space to film the scene so they

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.800 
into space to film the scene so they
would<00:00:28.519> use<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.759> chroma<00:00:28.970> keying<00:00:29.210> process<00:00:29.659> to

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
would use the chroma keying process to

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.689 
would use the chroma keying process to
make<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.109> illustration<00:00:30.679> the<00:00:30.859> actors<00:00:31.279> are<00:00:31.460> in

make the illustration the actors are in

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.490 
make the illustration the actors are in

filmmakers<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.190> process<00:00:40.610> was<00:00:40.700> not<00:00:40.730> perfect

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
filmmakers the process was not perfect

when<00:00:41.390> I<00:00:41.420> originally<00:00:41.660> invented<00:00:42.440> but<00:00:42.620> it<00:00:42.710> was

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
when I originally invented but it was

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.410 
when I originally invented but it was
taken<00:00:43.100> very<00:00:43.130> much<00:00:43.490> and<00:00:43.850> was<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:44.030> big<00:00:44.240> step

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
taken very much and was a big step
