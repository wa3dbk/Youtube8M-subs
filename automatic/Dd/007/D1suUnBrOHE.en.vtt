of the silver is embedded in a layer of
gelatin<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> paper<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.890> once<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.279> have

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
gelatin on the paper so once you have

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.000 
gelatin on the paper so once you have
exposed<00:00:20.970> your<00:00:21.330> paper<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.470> course<00:00:22.710> under

going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.369> put<00:00:26.670> your<00:00:26.849> print<00:00:27.470> paper<00:00:28.470> into<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
going to put your print paper into the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.080 
going to put your print paper into the
developing<00:00:29.849> solution<00:00:31.579> now<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.759> piece<00:00:32.969> of

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
developing solution now this piece of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.030 
developing solution now this piece of
paper<00:00:33.210> has<00:00:33.570> been<00:00:33.809> exposed<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.469> daylight<00:00:34.829> so

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
paper has been exposed to daylight so

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740 
paper has been exposed to daylight so
it's<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> turn<00:00:35.640> completely<00:00:36.149> black<00:00:36.420> but

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
it's going to turn completely black but

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.990 
it's going to turn completely black but
you<00:00:37.500> agitate<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.160> print<00:00:38.370> back<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.730> forth

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
you agitate your print back and forth

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.600 
you agitate your print back and forth
and<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.390> allow<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.750> generally<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.800> about

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
and you allow you generally for about

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.790 
and you allow you generally for about
two<00:00:41.910> minutes<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.690> developer<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.500> time

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
two minutes in the developer so you time

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.250 
two minutes in the developer so you time
your<00:00:44.010> exposure<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.690> do<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> full

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
your exposure so that you can do a full

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.850 
your exposure so that you can do a full
two<00:00:46.590> minute<00:00:46.920> development<00:00:48.410> once<00:00:49.410> your<00:00:49.559> print

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
two minute development once your print

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.369 
two minute development once your print
is<00:00:50.039> developed<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> tray<00:00:51.170> you're<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.289> to
