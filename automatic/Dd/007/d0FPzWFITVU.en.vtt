00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 have to a bottle of 3 liters that 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.069
 but far to see cut by the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.519
 obviously 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:15.030
 so after I used a pvc tube of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.090
 40 years you plastic me that they had 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.760
 on a gravity vacuum so all that stuff 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:34.649
 so you have to go boxed and you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:37.140
 have to beat then I saw do 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.719
 Melt a little also because the job 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.739
 otherwise it did not come back he collapses from 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.739
 the height that 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:59.680
 [Music] 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:05.650
 clothes with sand in the bucket on 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:08.900
 can see we can see that it sticks here 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.049
 a bucket so it does not matter we take 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.049
 a glass 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.990
 so any clothes you take a drink 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.260
 you dive into your tray we put in 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.370
 the sand what goes for purpose of doing 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.720
 get off your room here so we can 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.140
 see it in the tube we pay these 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.820
 two there I get up a little and it goes down 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:47.220
 very slowly it avoids putting 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.900
 full everywhere so obviously me 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.000
 I had already put the sand so that's fine 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.650
 do some smoke 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.030
 it does not matter in 10 minutes safe and 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:05.400
 nothing with the kummer so for this 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:08.540
 well it's in front of the sink so we 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.840
 can see a slight fog obviously 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.270
 but good that disappears on a night I 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.530
 lived nothing so do not forget it's good 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.140
 rinse your sand 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.490
 obviously and after at least with this 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.860
 system we can put a little bit everywhere 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.480
 without it flying in all directions duo 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.640
 brewing good I had stopped the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.230
 brewing when I loved it and after I 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.700
 restart so that's okay you want a 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.700
 little bit but nothing very embarrassing what
