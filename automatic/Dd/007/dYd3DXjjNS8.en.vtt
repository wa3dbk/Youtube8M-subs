out<00:00:38.899> now<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.079> weird<00:00:40.290> because<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:41.480> I

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
out now this is weird because like I

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.660 
out now this is weird because like I
think<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.320> pretty<00:00:43.829> much<00:00:43.950> played<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.370> game<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
think I pretty much played this game I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.790 
think I pretty much played this game I
two<00:00:44.730> days<00:00:45.180> ago<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:46.050> I've<00:00:46.140> already<00:00:46.289> forgotten

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
two days ago and I've already forgotten

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.690 
two days ago and I've already forgotten
why<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> blocked<00:00:48.149> my<00:00:48.809> own<00:00:49.050> show<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.250> Protoss

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
why I blocked my own show as a Protoss

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.479 
why I blocked my own show as a Protoss
player<00:00:51.020> exactly<00:00:52.020> quite<00:00:52.680> strange

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.690 

like<00:00:57.489> I<00:00:57.579> know<00:00:57.670> this<00:00:57.970> guy<00:00:58.149> is<00:00:58.329> staring<00:00:59.400> so<00:01:00.400> why

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
like I know this guy is staring so why

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.250 
like I know this guy is staring so why
would<00:01:00.790> I<00:01:00.880> do<00:01:00.940> that<00:01:01.030> usually<00:01:01.600> against<00:01:01.870> tarun<00:01:02.170> I

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
would I do that usually against tarun I

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.160 
would I do that usually against tarun I
just<00:01:02.440> rush<00:01:02.770> a<00:01:03.100> robe<00:01:03.670> obey<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.210> get<00:01:04.659> immortals

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
just rush a robe obey and get immortals

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.550 
just rush a robe obey and get immortals
right<00:01:05.440> away<00:01:05.680> but<00:01:06.640> this<00:01:06.820> time<00:01:06.880> I<00:01:07.090> didn't<00:01:07.600> so

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
right away but this time I didn't so

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.230 
right away but this time I didn't so
that's<00:01:08.890> quite<00:01:09.010> concerning<00:01:09.460> I'm<00:01:10.030> probably

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
that's quite concerning I'm probably

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.880 
that's quite concerning I'm probably
checking<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:10.659> something<00:01:11.020> weird<00:01:11.259> like<00:01:11.320> air<00:01:11.710> or

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
checking to something weird like air or

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.080 
checking to something weird like air or
something<00:01:12.009> and<00:01:12.490> as<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:12.759> can<00:01:12.880> see<00:01:12.910> he's

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
something and as you can see he's

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.490 
something and as you can see he's
already<00:01:13.119> got<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.660> marine<00:01:13.840> in<00:01:14.080> my<00:01:14.140> face<00:01:14.290> and<00:01:14.440> I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
already got a marine in my face and I

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.249 
already got a marine in my face and I
don't<00:01:14.650> have<00:01:14.740> diddly-squat<00:01:16.110> he's<00:01:17.110> getting

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
more Marines this probably his cue to

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.210 
more Marines this probably his cue to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
add-on to his barracks which shouldn't

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.639 
add-on to his barracks which shouldn't
be<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.190> problem<00:01:48.460> if<00:01:48.820> he's<00:01:49.200> yeah<00:01:50.200> that's<00:01:50.500> what

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
be a problem if he's yeah that's what

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.680 
be a problem if he's yeah that's what
he's<00:01:50.740> doing<00:01:50.979> he's<00:01:51.310> gonna<00:01:51.429> go<00:01:51.700> metal<00:01:52.149> or

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
he's doing he's gonna go metal or

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.050 
he's doing he's gonna go metal or
something<00:01:52.979> he's<00:01:53.979> got<00:01:54.190> his<00:01:54.340> two<00:01:54.490> refineries<00:01:54.759> up

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
something he's got his two refineries up

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.130 
something he's got his two refineries up
his<00:01:55.660> Factory<00:01:56.080> has<00:01:56.110> broom<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:57.810> foreign<00:01:58.810> add-on

his Factory has broom to foreign add-on

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.010 
his Factory has broom to foreign add-on
so<00:02:00.130> chances<00:02:01.060> are<00:02:01.179> he's<00:02:01.390> probably<00:02:01.420> gonna<00:02:01.750> come

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
so chances are he's probably gonna come

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.290 
so chances are he's probably gonna come
with<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.410> bunch<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.679> hellions<00:02:02.920> or<00:02:03.700> tanks<00:02:04.209> or

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
with a bunch of hellions or tanks or

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.639 
with a bunch of hellions or tanks or
something<00:02:04.539> like<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:04.869> try<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.200> roll<00:02:05.470> me

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
something like that and try to roll me

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.710 
something like that and try to roll me
before<00:02:06.069> my<00:02:06.550> tech<00:02:06.789> comes<00:02:07.090> out<00:02:07.300> because<00:02:07.569> it's

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
before my tech comes out because it's

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.449 
before my tech comes out because it's
pretty<00:02:07.869> obvious<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.259> I'm<00:02:08.440> teching<00:02:08.860> since<00:02:09.369> I

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
pretty obvious that I'm teching since I

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.000 
pretty obvious that I'm teching since I
blocked<00:02:09.819> there's<00:02:10.420> my<00:02:10.539> cyber<00:02:11.010> cybernetics

core<00:02:12.540> okay<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.569> remember<00:02:13.870> what<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.020> did<00:02:14.080> now<00:02:14.349> this

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
core okay I remember what I did now this

is<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.040> twilight<00:02:15.370> council<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.209> lets<00:02:16.330> me

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
is a twilight council and it lets me

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.760 
is a twilight council and it lets me
build<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.810> temple<00:02:16.989> our<00:02:17.200> building<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:17.680> I'm

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
build the temple our building so I'm

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.130 
build the temple our building so I'm
probably<00:02:17.860> going<00:02:18.099> to<00:02:18.190> drop<00:02:18.340> DTS<00:02:18.819> on<00:02:19.000> him<00:02:19.180> which

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
probably going to drop DTS on him which

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.720 
probably going to drop DTS on him which
are<00:02:20.290> cloaked<00:02:20.590> units<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:21.069> do<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.190> shitload<00:02:21.550> of

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.510 
are cloaked units that do a shitload of
damage<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.650> next<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:23.980> charging<00:02:24.370> this

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
since I blocked myself in I need to be

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
since I blocked myself in I need to be
able<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.360> use<00:02:29.630> my<00:02:29.660> gateways<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.620> warp<00:02:31.340> units

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
able to use my gateways to warp units

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.270 
able to use my gateways to warp units
outside<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.260> my<00:02:33.380> base<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:35.740> what<00:02:36.740> this<00:02:36.950> does<00:02:37.010> is

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
outside of my base and what this does is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.480 
outside of my base and what this does is
it<00:02:37.310> turns<00:02:37.520> your<00:02:37.820> gateways<00:02:38.300> into<00:02:38.660> warp<00:02:39.110> gates

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
it turns your gateways into warp gates

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.560 
it turns your gateways into warp gates
which<00:02:40.490> allows<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.030> do<00:02:41.150> just<00:02:41.180> that

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
which allows you to do just that

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.600 
which allows you to do just that
anywhere<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.170> have<00:02:42.290> pylon<00:02:42.800> energy<00:02:43.190> your

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
anywhere you have pylon energy your

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.420 
anywhere you have pylon energy your
units<00:02:43.910> can<00:02:44.060> warp<00:02:44.360> in<00:02:44.810> there<00:02:45.440> instead<00:02:46.370> of

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
units can warp in there instead of

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.880 
units can warp in there instead of
coming<00:02:47.330> out<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.630> Gateway<00:02:47.840> all<00:02:48.230> trapped<00:02:48.740> in

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
coming out of the Gateway all trapped in

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.460 
coming out of the Gateway all trapped in
your<00:02:48.920> base<00:02:49.160> or<00:02:49.430> whatnot<00:02:50.200> which<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.320> pretty

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
your base or whatnot which is pretty

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.490 
your base or whatnot which is pretty
tight<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:53.360> here's<00:02:53.630> my<00:02:53.690> dark<00:02:54.110> shrine<00:02:54.470> that

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
tight so here's my dark shrine that

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.220 
tight so here's my dark shrine that
allows<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.190> do<00:02:55.340> dark<00:02:55.850> templars<00:02:56.270> it's<00:02:56.870> kind

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
allows you to do dark templars it's kind

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.090 
allows you to do dark templars it's kind
of<00:02:57.290> tier<00:02:57.590> three<00:02:58.010> ish<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:59.150> they<00:03:00.140> moved<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.890> back

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
of tier three ish so they moved it back

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.400 
of tier three ish so they moved it back
a<00:03:01.610> tear<00:03:02.000> for<00:03:02.239> starcraft<00:03:02.720> 2<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:05.170> don't<00:03:06.170> really

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
a tear for starcraft 2 I don't really

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.920 
a tear for starcraft 2 I don't really
understand<00:03:06.800> why<00:03:06.860> they<00:03:07.100> did<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:07.930> that's

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
understand why they did that but that's

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.260 
understand why they did that but that's
okay<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.650> I<00:03:09.770> don't<00:03:09.920> know<00:03:09.980> why<00:03:10.130> he<00:03:10.310> just<00:03:10.520> moved

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
okay and I don't know why he just moved

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.390 
okay and I don't know why he just moved
his<00:03:11.450> barracks<00:03:11.810> all<00:03:11.959> strange<00:03:12.350> like<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:13.190> I

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
his barracks all strange like that and I

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.090 
his barracks all strange like that and I
don't<00:03:13.580> really<00:03:13.700> understand<00:03:14.180> why<00:03:14.270> he<00:03:14.860> he<00:03:15.860> has<00:03:15.980> an

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
don't really understand why he he has an

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.560 
don't really understand why he he has an
add-on<00:03:16.280> here<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.760> he<00:03:16.820> has<00:03:16.850> an<00:03:17.000> add<00:03:17.120> on<00:03:17.150> here

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
add-on here and he has an add on here

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.210 
add-on here and he has an add on here
he's<00:03:17.930> kind<00:03:18.050> of<00:03:18.170> going<00:03:18.350> like<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.500> nothing<00:03:18.980> build

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
he's kind of going like a nothing build

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.729 
he's kind of going like a nothing build
like<00:03:20.110> like<00:03:21.110> he's<00:03:21.230> got<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.380> little<00:03:21.530> bit<00:03:21.709> of

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
like like he's got a little bit of

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.280 
like like he's got a little bit of
everything<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.660> that's<00:03:23.660> kind<00:03:23.959> of<00:03:24.020> new

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
everything and that's kind of new

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.430 
everything and that's kind of new
frankly<00:03:24.830> because<00:03:25.360> you<00:03:26.360> want<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.660> invest<00:03:27.290> your

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
frankly because you want to invest your

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.560 
frankly because you want to invest your
resources<00:03:27.890> on<00:03:28.130> one<00:03:28.340> particular<00:03:28.670> stress<00:03:29.180> like

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
resources on one particular stress like

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.150 
resources on one particular stress like
he's<00:03:29.750> got<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.930> scanner<00:03:30.380> he<00:03:30.890> should<00:03:31.070> have

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
he's got a scanner he should have

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.920 
he's got a scanner he should have
scanned<00:03:31.519> my<00:03:31.700> base<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:32.120> see<00:03:32.299> what<00:03:32.450> I'm<00:03:32.540> doing

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
scanned my base to see what I'm doing

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.500 
scanned my base to see what I'm doing
but<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.709> there's<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.430> scan<00:03:34.730> but<00:03:35.030> i<00:03:35.060> cleverly

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
but and there's the scan but i cleverly

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.070 
but and there's the scan but i cleverly
put<00:03:35.900> my<00:03:36.170> over<00:03:36.620> here<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:37.519> he<00:03:38.080> didn't

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
put my over here so he didn't

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.289 
put my over here so he didn't
actually<00:03:39.320> see<00:03:40.100> what<00:03:40.370> I'm<00:03:40.489> really<00:03:40.820> doing<00:03:40.970> he

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
actually see what I'm really doing he

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.330 
actually see what I'm really doing he
thinks<00:03:41.510> I'm<00:03:41.600> going<00:03:41.780> immortals<00:03:42.350> since<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.220> have

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
thinks I'm going immortals since I have

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.610 
thinks I'm going immortals since I have
a<00:03:43.370> robo<00:03:43.700> Bay<00:03:43.850> out<00:03:44.049> which<00:03:45.049> is<00:03:45.170> actually<00:03:45.290> kind<00:03:45.530> of

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
a robo Bay out which is actually kind of

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.990 
a robo Bay out which is actually kind of
funny<00:03:45.799> that's<00:03:46.010> what<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.190> would<00:03:46.370> usually<00:03:46.640> do

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
funny that's what I would usually do

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.960 
funny that's what I would usually do
against<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.360> Terran<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.459> guess<00:03:49.790> he's<00:03:49.820> a

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
against a Terran so I guess he's a

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.660 
against a Terran so I guess he's a
necrotic<00:03:50.269> powder<00:03:50.630> immortals<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:52.430> should<00:03:52.549> be

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
necrotic powder immortals this should be

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.600 
necrotic powder immortals this should be
a<00:03:52.700> banshee<00:03:52.940> not<00:03:53.269> a<00:03:53.299> Viking<00:03:53.540> because<00:03:54.610> then

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
a banshee not a Viking because then

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.400 
a banshee not a Viking because then
she's<00:03:55.880> would<00:03:56.060> be<00:03:56.180> counter<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.720> immortals<00:03:57.230> not

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
she's would be counter to immortals not

she's would be counter to immortals not
Vikings<00:03:57.590> here<00:03:58.430> I<00:03:58.459> come<00:03:58.670> with<00:03:58.850> a<00:03:58.880> warp<00:03:59.090> prism

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
Vikings here I come with a warp prism

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.080 
Vikings here I come with a warp prism
carrying<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.870> probe<00:04:00.579> for<00:04:01.579> no<00:04:01.730> reason

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
carrying a probe for no reason

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.250

whatsoever

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.380 

and<00:04:04.530> I'm<00:04:04.950> dropping<00:04:05.159> more<00:04:05.519> gateways<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:06.090> got<00:04:06.239> the

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
and I'm dropping more gateways I got the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.960 
and I'm dropping more gateways I got the
seat<00:04:06.599> notice<00:04:07.170> how<00:04:07.290> these<00:04:07.500> look<00:04:08.430> different<00:04:08.849> now

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
seat notice how these look different now

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.580 
seat notice how these look different now
the<00:04:09.209> Gateway<00:04:09.510> opened<00:04:09.870> up<00:04:09.989> into<00:04:10.200> warp<00:04:10.379> gates

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
the Gateway opened up into warp gates

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.920 
the Gateway opened up into warp gates
I'm<00:04:11.280> gonna<00:04:11.459> drop<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:11.730> into<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.390> prism<00:04:12.720> over

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
I'm gonna drop that into the prism over

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.440 
I'm gonna drop that into the prism over
here<00:04:13.140> which<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.040> gonna<00:04:14.159> be<00:04:14.280> sick<00:04:14.640> but<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.180> was

here which is gonna be sick but I was

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:23.770 
here which is gonna be sick but I was
discovered<00:04:16.049> unfortunately<00:04:19.310> don't<00:04:20.310> kill<00:04:20.639> me

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
so I try to lure him away by dropping a

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.930 
so I try to lure him away by dropping a
probe<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:28.250> I'm<00:04:29.250> gonna<00:04:29.370> bring<00:04:29.580> this<00:04:29.729> guy<00:04:29.910> back

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
probe and I'm gonna bring this guy back

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.020 
probe and I'm gonna bring this guy back
around<00:04:30.539> to<00:04:31.470> create<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.800> little<00:04:32.100> energy<00:04:32.820> matrix

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
around to create a little energy matrix

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.580 
around to create a little energy matrix
he<00:04:36.030> expanded<00:04:36.510> so<00:04:36.870> he's<00:04:37.080> not<00:04:37.199> going<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.380> have

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
he expanded so he's not going to have

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.770 
he expanded so he's not going to have
too<00:04:37.830> much<00:04:37.979> army<00:04:38.280> I've<00:04:38.610> got<00:04:38.850> a<00:04:39.060> limited<00:04:39.630> amount

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
too much army I've got a limited amount

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.689 
too much army I've got a limited amount
of<00:04:39.990> time<00:04:40.139> to<00:04:40.199> attack<00:04:40.710> now<00:04:40.889> I<00:04:40.919> don't<00:04:41.039> know<00:04:41.430> this

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
of time to attack now I don't know this

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.260 
of time to attack now I don't know this
so<00:04:42.479> this<00:04:42.750> is<00:04:42.960> kind<00:04:43.229> of<00:04:43.789> i'm<00:04:44.789> not<00:04:44.940> going<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.090> say

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
so this is kind of i'm not going to say

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.129 
so this is kind of i'm not going to say
luck<00:04:45.630> i'm<00:04:46.500> just<00:04:46.770> going<00:04:46.889> to<00:04:46.919> say<00:04:47.160> skill<00:04:48.110> now<00:04:49.110> I

luck i'm just going to say skill now I

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.689 
luck i'm just going to say skill now I
dropped<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.590> probe<00:04:49.740> out<00:04:49.889> here<00:04:50.070> built<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.400> pylon

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
dropped the probe out here built a pylon

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.240 
dropped the probe out here built a pylon
and<00:04:51.199> with<00:04:52.199> these<00:04:52.320> two<00:04:52.470> dt's<00:04:52.800> I'm<00:04:52.979> going<00:04:53.100> to<00:04:53.160> go

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
and with these two dt's I'm going to go

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.659 
and with these two dt's I'm going to go
to<00:04:53.310> his<00:04:53.460> front<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:53.940> harass<00:04:54.780> his<00:04:54.990> ship<00:04:55.550> at<00:04:56.550> the

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
same time I'm going to open up a prism

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.960 
same time I'm going to open up a prism
back<00:04:59.160> here<00:04:59.520> and<00:04:59.639> drop<00:05:00.270> 3d<00:05:00.720> t's<00:05:00.930> back<00:05:01.169> here<00:05:01.970> I'm

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
back here and drop 3d t's back here I'm

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.909 
back here and drop 3d t's back here I'm
going<00:05:03.180> to<00:05:03.270> use<00:05:03.389> these<00:05:03.570> two<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:04.470> attack<00:05:04.770> his

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
going to use these two to attack his

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.879 
going to use these two to attack his
front<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.280> pull<00:05:05.789> all<00:05:05.910> his<00:05:06.060> forces<00:05:06.360> over<00:05:06.630> here

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
front and pull all his forces over here

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.219 
front and pull all his forces over here
his<00:05:07.910> his<00:05:08.910> scan<00:05:09.240> is<00:05:09.510> going<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:09.780> only<00:05:09.960> have

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
his his scan is going to only have

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.500 
his his scan is going to only have
enough<00:05:10.440> energy<00:05:10.949> for<00:05:11.220> once<00:05:11.550> can<00:05:11.820> so<00:05:12.330> I'm<00:05:12.419> gonna

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
enough energy for once can so I'm gonna

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.170 
enough energy for once can so I'm gonna
waste<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:12.900> on<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.139> front<00:05:13.849> I'm<00:05:14.849> gonna<00:05:15.000> have<00:05:15.150> him

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
waste it on the front I'm gonna have him

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.050 
waste it on the front I'm gonna have him
wasted<00:05:15.539> on<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.690> front

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.970 

I<00:05:20.610> was<00:05:21.610> gonna<00:05:21.700> scan<00:05:22.120> me<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:23.260> his<00:05:23.590> forces<00:05:23.800> are

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
I was gonna scan me and his forces are

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.530 
I was gonna scan me and his forces are
going<00:05:24.100> to<00:05:24.160> attack<00:05:24.220> me<00:05:24.520> now<00:05:25.090> I'm<00:05:25.150> gonna<00:05:25.270> drop

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
going to attack me now I'm gonna drop

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.990
