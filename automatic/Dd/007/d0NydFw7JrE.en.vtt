00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
anyway so what do I think of this figure

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.690 
anyway so what do I think of this figure
well<00:03:44.120> positives<00:03:44.960> I<00:03:45.310> really<00:03:46.310> did<00:03:46.460> the<00:03:46.550> robot

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
well positives I really did the robot

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.370 
well positives I really did the robot
mode<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.120> robot<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.660> red<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.200> white<00:03:48.350> and

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
mode the robot the red and the white and

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.980 
mode the robot the red and the white and
the<00:03:48.770> dark<00:03:49.400> blue<00:03:49.550> and<00:03:49.790> black<00:03:50.000> are<00:03:50.330> really

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
the dark blue and black are really

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.410 
the dark blue and black are really
really<00:03:51.290> nice<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.800> do<00:03:52.280> like<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.880> gimmicks<00:03:53.240> of

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
really nice I do like the gimmicks of

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.660 
really nice I do like the gimmicks of
the<00:03:53.690> little<00:03:54.110> deploying<00:03:54.770> legs<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.520> a<00:03:55.550> little

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
the little deploying legs and a little

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.790 
the little deploying legs and a little
bat<00:03:56.150> those<00:03:57.050> are<00:03:57.200> actually<00:03:57.500> pretty<00:03:57.740> cool

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
bat those are actually pretty cool

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.230 
bat those are actually pretty cool
unfortunately<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:01.370> beast<00:04:01.580> mode<00:04:01.790> is<00:04:01.970> pretty

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
unfortunately the beast mode is pretty

I like polar bears but it's not a very
good<00:04:06.140> bear<00:04:08.080> transformation<00:04:09.080> is<00:04:09.230> very<00:04:09.290> simple

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
good bear transformation is very simple

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.640 
good bear transformation is very simple
very<00:04:11.990> simple<00:04:12.850> gimmick<00:04:13.850> in<00:04:14.170> beast<00:04:15.170> mode<00:04:15.320> is

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
very simple gimmick in beast mode is

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.780 
very simple gimmick in beast mode is
dumb

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
dumb

it<00:04:16.940> looks<00:04:17.090> like<00:04:17.209> he's<00:04:17.390> humping<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:17.930> ground

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
it looks like he's humping the ground

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.290 
it looks like he's humping the ground
and<00:04:19.180> then<00:04:20.180> uh<00:04:20.709> mutant<00:04:21.709> face<00:04:21.950> is<00:04:22.220> just<00:04:22.460> black

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
and then uh mutant face is just black

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.370 
and then uh mutant face is just black
and<00:04:24.730> robot<00:04:25.730> mode<00:04:25.940> he's<00:04:26.630> kind<00:04:26.900> of<00:04:26.930> use<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.080> brick

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
and robot mode he's kind of use a brick

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.930 
and robot mode he's kind of use a brick
I<00:04:27.560> mean<00:04:27.740> he's<00:04:27.920> practically<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.580> brick<00:04:28.790> with

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
I mean he's practically a brick with

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.670 
I mean he's practically a brick with
moving<00:04:29.300> arms<00:04:29.480> that's<00:04:29.840> about<00:04:30.260> it

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
moving arms that's about it

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.940 
moving arms that's about it
what<00:04:31.670> I<00:04:31.700> recommend<00:04:31.910> him<00:04:32.330> not<00:04:33.020> really<00:04:33.290> I<00:04:33.650> really

Botcon repaint I think it was survive

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.930 
Botcon repaint I think it was survive
was<00:04:48.050> his<00:04:48.200> Botcon<00:04:48.620> repaint<00:04:49.040> anyway

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
was his Botcon repaint anyway
