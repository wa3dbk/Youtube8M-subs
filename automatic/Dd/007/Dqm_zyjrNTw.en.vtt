ago<00:00:45.030> people<00:00:45.329> would<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.600> make<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:45.870> stories

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
ago people would just make up stories

often<00:00:46.500> fanciful<00:00:47.129> stories<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.030> wolf

wolf and blocking the Sun and after a
while<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:54.090> developed<00:00:54.629> philosophy<00:00:55.530> which<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
while we developed philosophy which is a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.439 
while we developed philosophy which is a
way<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> approaching<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.789> same<00:00:56.969> questions

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
way of approaching the same questions

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.290 
way of approaching the same questions
through<00:00:57.690> logic<00:00:58.399> but<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.489> last<00:00:59.670> 200<00:01:00.120> years

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
through logic but the last 200 years

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.549 
through logic but the last 200 years
we've<00:01:00.510> developed<00:01:00.629> science<00:01:01.170> which<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.320> another

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
we've developed science which is another

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.090 
we've developed science which is another
method<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:02.039> understanding<00:01:02.969> these<00:01:03.059> issues<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
method of understanding these issues and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.350 
method of understanding these issues and
the<00:01:05.100> thing<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.309> science<00:01:05.760> adds<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.180> its

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the thing that science adds is its

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
the thing that science adds is its
testability<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.290> when<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> have<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> theory<00:01:08.369> in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
testability so when you have a theory in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.730 
testability so when you have a theory in
science<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.939> don't<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.240> say<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.500> don't<00:01:10.590> just

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
science you don't so say you don't just

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.530 
science you don't so say you don't just
give<00:01:10.890> an<00:01:11.010> opinion<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.360> really

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
give an opinion but you you really

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.090 
give an opinion but you you really
require<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.320> theories<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.710> they<00:01:13.950> make

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
require the theories that they make

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
require the theories that they make
predictions<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:14.939> they<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.509> testable

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
predictions and they they be testable

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.920 
predictions and they they be testable
and<00:01:16.170> falsifiable<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.390> progress<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and falsifiable and the the progress and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.350 
and falsifiable and the the progress and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
enormous it's it's much more progress

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
enormous it's it's much more progress
than<00:01:27.720> we've<00:01:27.840> made<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.110> although<00:01:28.409> thousands<00:01:29.009> of
