00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.650
 and that the end of the challenge, however, is the new one 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.170
 novak djokovic's weapon after so many 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.200
 mysteries we discovered what the famous is 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.230
 point g of and this new material yes 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.930
 calls a material to graphene 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.430
 very light but very very solid that is 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.310
 been opposite to the heart of the racket 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.560
 what allows you to remove weight without 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.480
 lose instability at that point from 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.360
 wand then redistribute it better 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.010
 in the rest of the frame essentially one 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.589
 racket that while maintaining the same 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.499
 weight manages to push this more than that 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:38.409
 it has proven itself both in multiple frames 

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:40.179
 competitive as well as in the amateur ones 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.190
 here we are talking about the frame more 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.559
 competition in this line that 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.659
 precisely dedicated to novak djokovic 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.690
 we are talking about a frame of length 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.909
 traditional 100 inches of oval 315 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.190
 grams not roped so if they arrive 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.899
 to exceed 330 grams once in 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.579
 consortium with the heart balance 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.489
 wave of inertia then of attitude 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.260
 to the pretty good push 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.690
 main features accuracy 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.790
 with this type of racket and with 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.800
 this scheme the stringing from 18 20 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.950
 when almost everyone is pushing on 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.410
 16 for 19 is clearly an exit of 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.880
 speaks a little less quickly but offset by 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.070
 this new system that anyway 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.830
 allows you to have a 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.440
 powerful chassis but above all great 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.820
 great precision control for pulling 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.330
 outside the power obviously does not need to 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.690
 being an exasperated knife sharpener here is done 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.490
 direct blows the dec 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.040
 he string very fast then 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.720
 rapid movements that allow to do 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.940
 head off the racket well 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.990
 to beat but with big 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.940
 great check the type of rope from 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.920
 use well here is essential because 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.540
 we are talking about a very competitive frame 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.490
 that therefore three tends a lot but that in 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.050
 also able to give back so much 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.910
 in terms of control and precision 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.490
 however, to get the ball out we recommend 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.260
 to try a multi-strand anyway 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.220
 because it could give a just 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.310
 compromise 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.590
 if you are really driven agonists 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.410
 second level third category a lot 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.010
 strong then could also try like 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.020
 professionals make a rope on 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.550
 new filament or the classic one 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.980
 hybrid solution than the one you give 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.590
 greater attention balances with the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.140
 useless tension go up too much better 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.530
 stand on medium-low tension also 22 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.890
 23 kg can do at home or moscow is a 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.630
 competitive frame then evaluated well 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.610
 your game level remember 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.280
 of the rule use the wand more 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.520
 heavy that you succeed comfortably I repeat 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.760
 comfortably by hand with this 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.450
 you see that the ball is struggling to get out there 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.280
 also the 300- gram 300 model 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.489
 which surely could be the case 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.489
 your
