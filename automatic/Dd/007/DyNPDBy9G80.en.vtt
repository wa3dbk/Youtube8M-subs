I'm using to get enough cobblestone so

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.070 
I'm using to get enough cobblestone so

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
that I can start building the castle I'm

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.889 
that I can start building the castle I'm
still<00:00:31.619> not<00:00:31.769> quite<00:00:32.070> at<00:00:32.369> critical<00:00:32.850> mass<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.450> far

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
still not quite at critical mass as far

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.160 
still not quite at critical mass as far
as<00:00:34.020> cobblestone<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.800> concerned<00:00:35.750> yes<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:37.020> is

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
as cobblestone is concerned yes that is

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.750 
as cobblestone is concerned yes that is
an<00:00:37.320> almost<00:00:37.649> full<00:00:37.860> double<00:00:38.219> chest<00:00:38.489> full<00:00:38.730> of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
an almost full double chest full of

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.080 
an almost full double chest full of
cobblestone<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:40.469> again<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.129> feel<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.610> it's

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
cobblestone but again I feel like it's

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.209 
cobblestone but again I feel like it's
not<00:00:42.360> quite<00:00:42.840> enough<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.559> want<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.920> have<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.190> least

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
not quite enough I want to have at least

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.529 
not quite enough I want to have at least
a<00:00:44.489> couple<00:00:44.700> chests<00:00:45.090> foals

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
a couple chests foals

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.979 
a couple chests foals
I'm<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.710> completely<00:00:47.489> level<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.570> Hill

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
I'm going to completely level this Hill

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.430 
I'm going to completely level this Hill
um<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:51.120> also<00:00:51.420> there's<00:00:51.750> an<00:00:51.930> added<00:00:52.230> bonus

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
um and also there's an added bonus

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160 
um and also there's an added bonus
because<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.280> turn<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.640> quarry<00:00:54.090> from<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
because I can turn this quarry from a

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.119 
because I can turn this quarry from a
quarry<00:00:55.590> into<00:00:56.090> a<00:00:57.090> mine<00:00:57.480> because<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.680> have

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
quarry into a mine because I have

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.920 
quarry into a mine because I have
stumbled<00:00:59.430> across<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.059> ravine<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
stumbled across this ravine that I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.349 
stumbled across this ravine that I
didn't<00:01:01.230> realize<00:01:01.379> was<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:02.309> until<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.030> started

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
didn't realize was here until I started

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.230 
didn't realize was here until I started
digging<00:01:03.480> into<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.930> ground<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.240> because

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
digging into the ground here and because

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
digging into the ground here and because
it's<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> ravine<00:01:06.869> there's<00:01:07.229> lots<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.979> easily

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it's a ravine there's lots of easily

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.750 
it's a ravine there's lots of easily
accessible<00:01:09.060> or<00:01:10.010> that<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.310> need<00:01:11.520> for

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
accessible or that I'm going to need for

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.719 
accessible or that I'm going to need for
building<00:01:12.090> stuff<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.840> forth<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.290> on

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
building stuff and so forth and so on

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.609 
building stuff and so forth and so on
but<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.150> Hill<00:01:15.330> also<00:01:15.689> has<00:01:15.869> some<00:01:16.080> ore<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:16.439> well

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
but this Hill also has some ore as well

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.679 
but this Hill also has some ore as well
but<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.759> sort<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.000> besides<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.420> point

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
but that is sort of besides the point

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.920 
but that is sort of besides the point
now<00:01:19.409> let<00:01:20.340> me<00:01:20.670> try<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.270> remember<00:01:21.600> where<00:01:22.290> did<00:01:22.890> I

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
now let me try and remember where did I

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.010 
now let me try and remember where did I
where<00:01:24.930> exactly<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:27.360> area<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.990> I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
where exactly is that area that I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410 
where exactly is that area that I
decided<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> finally<00:01:29.880> excuse<00:01:30.270> me

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
decided to that I finally excuse me

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.219 
decided to that I finally excuse me
decided<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.020> use<00:01:31.610> for<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> castle<00:01:33.360> build<00:01:33.869> it's

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
decided to use for the castle build it's

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.130 
decided to use for the castle build it's
somewhere<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.369> direction<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:36.689> I'm<00:01:36.900> not

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
somewhere in this direction if I'm not

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.850 
somewhere in this direction if I'm not
much<00:01:37.409> mistaken<00:01:40.640> is<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.420> way<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.500> think

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
much mistaken is it in this way I think

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.190 
much mistaken is it in this way I think
it<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:46.670> well<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.180> doubt<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.020> top<00:01:49.170> of

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it is well if in doubt go to the top of

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.160 
it is well if in doubt go to the top of
the<00:01:49.350> hill<00:01:49.500> add<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.220> ok<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.509> want<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the hill add there it is ok so I want to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.990 
the hill add there it is ok so I want to
build<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.680> huge<00:01:53.479> minecart<00:01:54.479> system<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:55.049> well<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
build a huge minecart system as well and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.700 
build a huge minecart system as well and
I've<00:01:57.000> built<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.450> sort<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.750> rudimentary<00:01:58.020> path

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
I've built this sort of rudimentary path

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.270 
I've built this sort of rudimentary path
it's<00:01:59.040> only<00:01:59.250> a<00:02:00.259> one<00:02:01.259> by<00:02:01.920> one<00:02:02.340> block<00:02:02.939> basically<00:02:04.280> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it's only a one by one block basically I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.789 
it's only a one by one block basically I
was<00:02:06.240> thinking<00:02:06.600> about<00:02:06.810> building<00:02:07.020> trusses<00:02:07.680> or

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
was thinking about building trusses or

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.680 
was thinking about building trusses or
something<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.610> or<00:02:09.000> pillars<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
something like that or pillars to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.360 
something like that or pillars to
support<00:02:09.720> it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
support it

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.870 
support it
but<00:02:11.970> I

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
but I

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.140 
but I
and<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.210> just<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:14.950> took<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.000> much

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
and it just it just took so much

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.240 
and it just it just took so much
cobblestone<00:02:16.780> just<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.140> build<00:02:17.380> this<00:02:17.680> thing<00:02:17.740> you

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
cobblestone just to build this thing you

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.730 
cobblestone just to build this thing you
know<00:02:18.370> what<00:02:18.460> I'm<00:02:18.550> saying<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:20.200> anyway<00:02:20.560> that's

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
know what I'm saying but anyway that's

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.320 
know what I'm saying but anyway that's

guys the location that I settled on for
the<00:02:26.290> castle<00:02:26.710> build<00:02:28.830> I'm<00:02:29.830> pretty<00:02:30.610> proud<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.030> it

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the castle build I'm pretty proud of it

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.300 
the castle build I'm pretty proud of it
and<00:02:34.980> yeah

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
and yeah

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.730 
and yeah
it's<00:02:36.940> going<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.210> be<00:02:37.300> pretty<00:02:37.510> awesome<00:02:37.600> wait<00:02:38.560> I'm

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
it's going to be pretty awesome wait I'm

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.590 
it's going to be pretty awesome wait I'm
going<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.100> wrong<00:02:39.190> direction<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.970> just

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
going in the wrong direction I just

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.470 
going in the wrong direction I just
realized<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:41.050> because<00:02:41.680> if<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.940> look<00:02:43.240> there

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
realized that because if you look there

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.440 
realized that because if you look there
is<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> double-wide<00:02:44.340> because<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.850> try<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.240> make

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
is a double-wide because I try to make

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.360 
is a double-wide because I try to make
the<00:02:46.570> path<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.780> little<00:02:46.990> bit<00:02:47.140> wider<00:02:47.410> but<00:02:47.800> I<00:02:48.010> ended

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
the path a little bit wider but I ended

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.100 
the path a little bit wider but I ended
up<00:02:48.490> stopping<00:02:48.820> because<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.510> just<00:02:49.840> seemed<00:02:50.050> like

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
up stopping because it just seemed like

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.410 
up stopping because it just seemed like
kind<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.410> always<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.770> cobblestone<00:02:51.390> because<00:02:52.390> I

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
kind of always to cobblestone because I

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.230 
kind of always to cobblestone because I
was<00:02:52.930> like<00:02:53.110> look<00:02:53.500> start<00:02:54.400> building<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.760> castle

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
was like look start building the castle

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.870 
was like look start building the castle
then<00:02:55.900> finish<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.470> infrastructure<00:02:56.950> though

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
then finish the infrastructure though

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.370 
then finish the infrastructure though
technically<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.630> should<00:02:58.900> build<00:02:59.200> the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
technically I should build the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.650 
technically I should build the
infrastructure<00:02:59.980> first<00:03:00.460> before<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.360> build<00:03:01.570> the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
infrastructure first before I build the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.530 
infrastructure first before I build the
castle<00:03:01.840> but<00:03:02.410> people<00:03:03.310> wanted<00:03:03.880> yet<00:03:04.180> see<00:03:04.420> if

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
castle but people wanted yet see if

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.030 
castle but people wanted yet see if
there<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:04.900> I<00:03:05.080> built<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.380> junction<00:03:05.740> I<00:03:07.020> should

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
there it is I built a junction I should

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.510 
there it is I built a junction I should
the<00:03:09.040> hell<00:03:09.460> was<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.730> noise<00:03:10.150> um<00:03:10.630> anyway<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:12.070> at

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
the hell was that noise um anyway so at

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.210 
the hell was that noise um anyway so at
these<00:03:13.060> junctions<00:03:13.600> I'm<00:03:14.020> going<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.710> be<00:03:14.800> putting

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
these junctions I'm going to be putting

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.770 
these junctions I'm going to be putting
great<00:03:15.610> big<00:03:15.790> pillars<00:03:16.240> and<00:03:16.590> these<00:03:17.590> pillars<00:03:17.950> are

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
hill is because it's going to take

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.400 
hill is because it's going to take
forever<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:13.690> traverse<00:04:14.110> this<00:04:14.380> thing<00:04:14.740> I<00:04:16.410> mean

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
forever to traverse this thing I mean

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.409 
forever to traverse this thing I mean
look<00:04:17.680> at<00:04:17.799> this<00:04:18.010> thing<00:04:18.070> it's<00:04:18.810> enormous

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
look at this thing it's enormous

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.780 
look at this thing it's enormous
it's<00:04:22.419> like<00:04:22.720> on<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.080> cusp<00:04:23.470> between<00:04:23.830> a<00:04:24.280> couple

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
it's like on the cusp between a couple

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.610 
it's like on the cusp between a couple
of<00:04:24.940> different

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
of different

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.450 
of different
ion's<00:04:27.220> it's<00:04:27.479> extremely<00:04:28.479> tall<00:04:29.460> especially

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
ion's it's extremely tall especially

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.060 
ion's it's extremely tall especially
from<00:04:30.729> like<00:04:30.940> roughly<00:04:31.870> sea<00:04:32.199> level<00:04:32.560> down<00:04:32.740> there

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
from like roughly sea level down there

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.520 
from like roughly sea level down there
and<00:04:33.340> it's<00:04:34.000> also<00:04:34.180> got<00:04:34.510> some<00:04:34.570> hills<00:04:35.169> and

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
and it's also got some hills and

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.100 
and it's also got some hills and
interesting<00:04:36.040> of<00:04:36.310> land<00:04:37.150> formations<00:04:37.750> sort<00:04:38.020> of

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
interesting of land formations sort of

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.550 
interesting of land formations sort of
in<00:04:38.199> this<00:04:38.320> direction<00:04:38.530> as<00:04:39.040> well<00:04:40.110> for<00:04:41.110> example

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
in this direction as well for example

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.740 
in this direction as well for example
I'm<00:04:42.100> thinking<00:04:42.160> about<00:04:42.910> building<00:04:43.120> like<00:04:43.419> a<00:04:43.449> big

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
I'm thinking about building like a big

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.540 
I'm thinking about building like a big
Tower<00:04:44.020> here<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.770> some<00:04:44.949> support<00:04:45.370> beams

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
Tower here and some support beams

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.860 
Tower here and some support beams
underneath<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:47.160> build<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.340> wall<00:04:48.760> that<00:04:48.870> stretches

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
underneath I build a wall that stretches

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.730 
underneath I build a wall that stretches
between<00:04:51.060> these<00:04:52.060> various<00:04:52.479> outcrops<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.380> stuff

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
between these various outcrops and stuff

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.700 
between these various outcrops and stuff
and<00:04:54.070> obviously<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.360> main<00:04:55.720> body<00:04:56.380> of<00:04:56.560> the

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
and obviously the main body of the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.210 
and obviously the main body of the
castle<00:04:57.370> will<00:04:58.000> reside<00:04:58.479> more<00:04:59.289> or<00:04:59.440> less<00:04:59.650> where

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
castle will reside more or less where

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.790 
castle will reside more or less where

reasons and and this place is relatively

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.689 
reasons and and this place is relatively
close<00:06:22.240> to<00:06:22.419> my<00:06:22.539> base<00:06:22.780> uh

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 
close to my base uh

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.960 
close to my base uh
the<00:06:24.699> quarry<00:06:25.210> that<00:06:25.510> I<00:06:25.539> built<00:06:25.840> is<00:06:26.080> a<00:06:26.970> little

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
the quarry that I built is a little

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.870 
the quarry that I built is a little
further<00:06:28.240> kind<00:06:28.720> of<00:06:28.870> that<00:06:29.169> direction<00:06:29.699> yeah<00:06:30.699> it's

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
further kind of that direction yeah it's

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.909 
further kind of that direction yeah it's
and<00:06:31.060> it's<00:06:31.240> in<00:06:31.389> that<00:06:31.479> direction<00:06:31.690> so<00:06:32.169> basically

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
and it's in that direction so basically

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.649 
and it's in that direction so basically
right<00:06:33.220> across<00:06:33.460> from<00:06:33.699> over<00:06:33.970> there<00:06:34.090> to<00:06:34.330> here

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:34.659 
right across from over there to here
