00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.870
 whiskey store the meeting place of all spirits 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.769
 and today I have something very rare 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.750
 brought and a lawrow 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:20.670
 Fully comprehensive shirts and what you see here 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.109
 that is something very special 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.380
 and a dark success relative 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.019
 dark form and that is because of that 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.300
 in a video oil filled what mature 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.000
 was not allowed to filter and of course 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.579
 not colored that is rare because 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 pleased and this exciting field 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.059
 between the intense smoke all the way 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.340
 wild distillery character in the mild 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.219
 soft drinks and now something 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.690
 more intense barrel yes this this 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:58.489
 tense this now wants to 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.489
 enjoy block a broken compound 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:08.150
 yes a real success 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.150
 no question that was too much 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.930
 the wish the father of the thought 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.030
 very clearly very much phenols succeed 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.760
 very aromatic smoke not this one 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.510
 campfire smoke but this one 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.790
 hospital out 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:02:16.040
 so now he comes under the smoke comes 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:02:17.810
 now beach yes better first wants 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.260
 pulls the tears from his eyes 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.890
 so that's merciless he only has 40 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.890
 volume percentage but all intensity 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:41.200
 mercilessly a piece- wide hospital like that 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.200
 disinfectant 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:51.070
 good that lithium in there so has the shows 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.070
 in it 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:03.790
 every human is good that is always 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.960
 the case if you are not limited to one 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.490
 characteristic of a whiskey 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.410
 limited as he for example strong 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.000
 also and the rest neglected says 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.420
 Phil fass and says out 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.520
 no if you look at the individual 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.530
 components of the whiskey really 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.459
 can concentrate and one after the 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.350
 other place and then also the 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.350
 really great here I have two times ran 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.650
 yes, as if one had in the mouth 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.010
 this tremendous aromatic take on the 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.659
 whole back mouth of the whole throat 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:57.030
 source gaudy one of the tastes 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.450
