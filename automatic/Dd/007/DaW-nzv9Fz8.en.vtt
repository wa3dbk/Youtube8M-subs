00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.279
 Holy House 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.179
 rm 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.980
 squid 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.990
 we were prepared 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.730
 I was not knowing 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.220
 the statistics 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.300
 no one was around, he said. 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
 this moment 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 according to himself 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.010
 their number 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.010
 in note to anatel the playing field 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.030
 however the site forecast 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.450
 he believed 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.490
 / p dir if it pops up 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.490
 He arrived on the spot. 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.890
 lacognata 2 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.260
 independent 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.890
 each one of them 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.580
 on the question 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.460
 I find it impossible 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.590
 all of them 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.010
 he has a lot of face 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.010
 The path that you chose 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.829
 not 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.720
 without any news 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.140
 cities that have 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.140
 Did you go there? 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.060
 António Braga 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.810
 we can have 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.080
 15 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.080
 antónio capucho 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.890
 more than ten years for everything to seem like a question 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.109
 Yes of course 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:11.109
 Yes, they did not like the name in any bank. 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.239
 in the large area they have learned a little 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.239
 to survive 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:19.909
 with the other 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.989
 there would be free until today
