it's<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.469> English<00:00:10.710> wheel<00:00:11.719> fairly<00:00:12.719> flat<00:00:13.910> flat

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
it's the English wheel fairly flat flat

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.470 
it's the English wheel fairly flat flat
anvil<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.389> at<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.540> moment<00:00:17.930> so<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.320> machine

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
anvil in at the moment so this machine

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.480 
anvil in at the moment so this machine
physically<00:00:21.480> squeezes<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> material<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.250> as

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
physically squeezes the material and as

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.759 
physically squeezes the material and as
you're<00:00:23.699> as<00:00:24.240> you're<00:00:24.300> squeezing<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.470> running

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
you're as you're squeezing and running

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.540 
you're as you're squeezing and running
the<00:00:25.920> material<00:00:26.640> through<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> wheels<00:00:27.060> it's

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
the material through the wheels it's

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.220 
the material through the wheels it's
stretching<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.420> as<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.019> work<00:00:31.199> through

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
stretching it and as you work through

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.500 
stretching it and as you work through
the<00:00:31.710> wheel<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.000> across<00:00:33.000> your<00:00:33.210> sheet<00:00:33.710> pressure

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
the wheel and across your sheet pressure

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.530 
the wheel and across your sheet pressure
will<00:00:36.510> gradually<00:00:36.690> start<00:00:37.079> build<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.010> curve<00:00:38.540> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
will gradually start build a curve and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.660 
will gradually start build a curve and
this<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.930> how<00:00:40.050> although<00:00:40.350> all<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> curves<00:00:41.399> are

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
this is how although all the curves are

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.180 
this is how although all the curves are
made<00:00:42.170> we're<00:00:43.170> dealing<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> beetle

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
made we're dealing with in the beetle

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:58.459 
made we're dealing with in the beetle
back<00:00:56.690> in<00:00:57.690> hundreds<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.140> would<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.350> thought

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
back in hundreds I would have thought

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.920 
back in hundreds I would have thought
yeah<00:00:59.070> look<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> kiss<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.449> mean<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.719> could

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
yeah look at the kiss I mean that could

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.920 
yeah look at the kiss I mean that could
be<00:01:01.050> sort<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.320> 1870<00:01:02.160> really<00:01:02.489> good<00:01:02.640> yeah<00:01:03.420> look

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
be sort of 1870 really good yeah look

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.870 
be sort of 1870 really good yeah look
and<00:01:04.589> you'll<00:01:04.739> start<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:05.580> building

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and you'll start to see you're building

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.609 
and you'll start to see you're building
a<00:01:06.470> feeling<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> compound<00:01:07.920> curve<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.340> there<00:01:08.520> now

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
a feeling a compound curve in there now

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.840 
a feeling a compound curve in there now
another<00:01:10.619> method<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> use<00:01:11.310> if<00:01:11.460> you're<00:01:11.580> doing<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
another method you use if you're doing a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.300 
another method you use if you're doing a
very<00:01:12.119> aggressive<00:01:12.900> curve<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.799> would<00:01:13.890> use<00:01:14.070> your

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
very aggressive curve you would use your

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.670 
very aggressive curve you would use your
your<00:01:14.729> son<00:01:14.939> bag<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.509> might<00:01:15.689> physically<00:01:16.470> beat

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
your son bag and I might physically beat

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:25.249 
your son bag and I might physically beat
the<00:01:16.830> shape<00:01:17.040> into<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> material<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:24.259> you'll

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the shape into the material and you'll

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.310 
the shape into the material and you'll
see<00:01:25.439> from<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:26.840> called<00:01:27.840> wall<00:01:28.020> matting

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
see from that it's called wall matting

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.429 
see from that it's called wall matting
and<00:01:28.729> it's<00:01:29.729> quarter<00:01:30.299> quite<00:01:31.200> an<00:01:31.320> aggressive

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and it's quarter quite an aggressive

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.620 
and it's quarter quite an aggressive
shape<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:32.640> back<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> wheel<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.360> you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
shape in there back in the wheel and you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.210 
shape in there back in the wheel and you
get<00:01:33.869> rid<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.200> your<00:01:34.380> marks<00:01:34.650> very<00:01:34.829> quickly

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.530 

I<00:01:40.280> hope<00:01:41.280> you've<00:01:41.460> got<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> use<00:01:41.910> for<00:01:42.120> that<00:01:42.240> piece

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
I hope you've got a use for that piece

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.040 
I hope you've got a use for that piece
now<00:01:42.870> oh<00:01:43.140> no<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.830> is<00:01:44.010> just<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.810> see

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
now oh no this is just you can see

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.160 
now oh no this is just you can see
that's<00:01:47.030> quite<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> quite<00:01:48.570> an<00:01:48.660> aggressive<00:01:48.720> curve

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that's quite a quite an aggressive curve

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.350 
that's quite a quite an aggressive curve
now
