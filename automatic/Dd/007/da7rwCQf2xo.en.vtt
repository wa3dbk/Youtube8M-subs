00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
they are big compound exercises you can

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.589 
they are big compound exercises you can
do<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:14.009> with<00:00:14.190> dumbbells<00:00:14.670> as<00:00:14.849> well<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.570> I

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
do this with dumbbells as well but I

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.990 
do this with dumbbells as well but I
prefer<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.080> do<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.440> with<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.890> barbell<00:00:17.430> then<00:00:17.970> a

prefer to do it with a barbell then a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.910 
prefer to do it with a barbell then a

two<00:00:44.190> variations<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:45.059> are<00:00:45.180> often<00:00:45.629> used<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
two variations that are often used the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.490 
two variations that are often used the
first<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.969> your<00:00:48.840> arms<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
first one is one with your arms in a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.529 
first one is one with your arms in a
ninety<00:00:49.829> degree<00:00:49.950> angle<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.820> personally<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
ninety degree angle and personally I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.170 
ninety degree angle and personally I
prefer<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:52.320> variation<00:00:52.949> because<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:54.000> put

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
prefer this variation because I can put

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.270 
prefer this variation because I can put
a<00:00:54.210> lot<00:00:54.420> more<00:00:54.629> focus<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.230> my<00:00:55.410> shoulders<00:00:55.920> rather

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
a lot more focus on my shoulders rather

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.119 
a lot more focus on my shoulders rather
than<00:00:56.730> using<00:00:57.480> momentum<00:00:57.660> which<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.530> often<00:00:58.710> do

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
than using momentum which I often do

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.970 
than using momentum which I often do
when<00:00:59.309> I'm<00:00:59.460> performing<00:00:59.940> side<00:01:00.870> raises<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.710> my

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
when I'm performing side raises with my

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.549 
when I'm performing side raises with my
arms<00:01:02.370> fully<00:01:02.699> extended<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.660> really<00:01:04.049> depends<00:01:04.500> on

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
arms fully extended it really depends on

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.590 
arms fully extended it really depends on
what<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.920> prefer<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.729> try<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.360> both

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
what you prefer so try out both

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.140 
what you prefer so try out both
variations<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.710> see<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:08.640> works<00:01:08.880> best

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
variations and see which one works best

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.270 
variations and see which one works best
for<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.540> then<00:01:10.080> there<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.439> another<00:01:10.650> shoulder

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
for you then there is another shoulder

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.039 
for you then there is another shoulder
exercise<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.210> perform<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
exercise that you can perform with a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.530 
exercise that you can perform with a
barbell<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.159> front<00:01:14.490> raise<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
barbell this is the front raise with a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.590 
barbell this is the front raise with a
barbell<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.380> using<00:01:16.680> an<00:01:17.009> EZ<00:01:17.220> curl<00:01:17.610> bar<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
barbell I'm using an EZ curl bar that

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.719 
barbell I'm using an EZ curl bar that
doesn't<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.170> matter<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.280> didn't<00:01:20.549> feel

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
doesn't really matter I just didn't feel

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.789 
doesn't really matter I just didn't feel
like<00:01:20.939> using<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.420> straight<00:01:21.720> bar<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.229> time<00:01:22.530> I

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
like using a straight bar this time I

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.649 
like using a straight bar this time I
think<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.250> easier<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> straight<00:01:24.450> bar

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
think it's easier with a straight bar

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.929 
think it's easier with a straight bar
you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.259> also<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.520> set<00:01:26.820> of

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you can also do this with a set of

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.179 
you can also do this with a set of
dumbbells<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.290> much<00:01:28.530> more<00:01:28.740> common

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
dumbbells and this is much more common

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.890 
dumbbells and this is much more common
it's<00:01:29.520> also<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.880> lot<00:01:30.119> better<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.600> my<00:01:30.630> opinion

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
it's also a lot better in my opinion

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.560 
it's also a lot better in my opinion
because<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.159> focus<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:33.090> arm<00:01:33.360> at

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
because you can focus on just one arm at

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.100 
because you can focus on just one arm at
a<00:01:33.720> time<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:35.130> also<00:01:35.520> use<00:01:36.150> two<00:01:36.479> arms<00:01:36.900> but

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
a time or you can also use two arms but

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.800 
a time or you can also use two arms but
still<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.130> won't<00:01:38.340> use<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:38.909> stronger<00:01:39.630> side

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
still you won't use your stronger side

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.050 
still you won't use your stronger side
more<00:01:40.170> than<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.650> weaker<00:01:41.130> side<00:01:41.369> may<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.820> have

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
more than your weaker side may you have

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.300 
more than your weaker side may you have
the<00:01:42.119> Arnold<00:01:42.750> press<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.439> think<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> great

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the Arnold press I think this is a great

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.700 
the Arnold press I think this is a great
exercise<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.509> believe<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.020> developed<00:01:46.560> by

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
exercise and I believe it's developed by

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.850 
exercise and I believe it's developed by
Arnold<00:01:47.310> Schwarzenegger<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.320> what<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:49.619> is

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
Arnold Schwarzenegger and what you do is

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.039 
Arnold Schwarzenegger and what you do is
you<00:01:50.130> will<00:01:50.250> make<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> kind<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.000> twisting<00:01:51.540> motion

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
you will make a kind of twisting motion

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.469 
you will make a kind of twisting motion
when<00:01:52.380> you're<00:01:52.560> moving<00:01:53.399> your<00:01:53.610> arms<00:01:53.970> towards<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
when you're moving your arms towards the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.539 
when you're moving your arms towards the
top<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.020> when<00:01:55.290> you're<00:01:55.409> extending<00:01:55.890> your<00:01:56.159> arms

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
top so when you're extending your arms

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.810 
top so when you're extending your arms
with<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.969> weights<00:01:57.240> then<00:01:58.229> two<00:01:58.619> variations<00:01:59.100> for

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
with the weights then two variations for

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.310 
with the weights then two variations for
the<00:02:00.000> back<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.570> shoulder<00:02:00.960> which<00:02:01.290> is

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the back of your shoulder which is

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.149 
the back of your shoulder which is
called<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.070> posterior<00:02:02.689> deltoids<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.159> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
called the posterior deltoids and the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.889 
called the posterior deltoids and the
first<00:02:05.430> one<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.820> where<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.210> lay<00:02:06.420> down<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.689> a

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
first one is where you lay down on a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.100 
first one is where you lay down on a
bench<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.560> slightly<00:02:07.979> inclined<00:02:08.729> bench<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.360> what

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
bench a slightly inclined bench and what

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.370 
bench a slightly inclined bench and what
you<00:02:10.200> will<00:02:10.349> do<00:02:10.500> next<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.489> will<00:02:11.610> raise<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
you will do next is you will raise the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.370 
you will do next is you will raise the
the<00:02:12.620> weights<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:13.610> decides<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.540> basically

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
the weights to decides and basically

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.290 
the weights to decides and basically
backwards<00:02:16.040> it's<00:02:16.340> kind<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:17.060> reverse

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
backwards it's kind of a reverse

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.050 
backwards it's kind of a reverse
dumbbell<00:02:18.110> fly<00:02:18.440> which<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:19.040> would<00:02:19.220> do<00:02:19.430> for<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
dumbbell fly which you would do for the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.110 
dumbbell fly which you would do for the
chest<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:21.440> next<00:02:21.770> one<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.250> kind<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.790> same

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
chest the next one is kind of the same

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.910 
chest the next one is kind of the same
but<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.510> time<00:02:23.780> you're<00:02:23.990> standing<00:02:24.320> up<00:02:24.710> or

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
but this time you're standing up or

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.880 
but this time you're standing up or
actually<00:02:25.460> you're<00:02:26.060> kind<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.660> bending<00:02:27.140> over<00:02:27.290> and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
actually you're kind of bending over and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.430 
actually you're kind of bending over and
it<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.670> easier<00:02:29.060> for<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.510> if<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.870> rest<00:02:30.200> your

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
it is easier for you if you rest your

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.950 
it is easier for you if you rest your
head<00:02:30.680> or<00:02:31.040> your<00:02:31.190> forehead<00:02:31.520> on<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.390> bench<00:02:32.690> or

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
something like that this will help to

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.060 
something like that this will help to
keep<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.300> stress<00:02:36.140> away<00:02:36.350> from<00:02:36.500> your<00:02:36.920> lower

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070
