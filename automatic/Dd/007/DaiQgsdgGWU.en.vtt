00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.200
 I just follow this path do not trust 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.839
 appearances do not read is your language 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.789
 between new promises of more do not forget 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.889
 ask for a truce to the problems not 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.379
 look in the eyes if not pure what 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.870
 I see it as leads in the eyes 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.090
 wither when they analyze whether the chest 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.590
 adepal lives and the mine is a city one 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.630
 life in great life that from above 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.980
 It is sad to walk on the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.289
 land 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.480
 so much urine be great with age for in 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.820
 search for novelty will never learn 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 live empty spaces full of baa have their 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.780
 arteries and your heart has already 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.059
 abandoned between trenches chivas no 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.800
 there are systems wondering what it would be like if 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.230
 they had not put their passion and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.480
 the sad harmony day that essence 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 they forgot their sad childhood day 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.129
 in which they forgot their families why 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.410
 I live very fantasy with joy and although 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.660
 life smiles at us every time it calls me more 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.699
 live my most sense weigh those who 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.370
 dead walk to save their soul 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.809
 They'd live not taking pills and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.820
 it is so difficult 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.160
 many arrogant ones want costumes and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.170
 diamonds yes yes but the humblest ones 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.500
 conform to being free by asking 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.090
 these incredible experiences already 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.770
 ask how much we deserve 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.289
 we are the dreams of the whole universe 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.630
 whole good men with meaning 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.960
 common is the least common of the senses 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.940
 to a question about all the debts that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.399
 We owe it to those who claim to be the owners 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.500
 of all your dreams the good men 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.080
 they have forgotten fear and now they live 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.300
 full of joy and cigars like fire 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.400
 these grammars the tear that hides 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.100
 in my retina playing on your deck 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.380
 melted to twisted as in the sea 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.560
 the eels sincere and deep which 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.050
 gorilla look soul of nomadic time life 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.020
 musician or mike my way does not take 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.850
 until roma vista the pigeons where the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.770
 they take them and so man as a rule 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.840
 he carries convictions that his back in curves 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.550
 after so many centuries of war and crying 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.190
 it sounds like the fucking suffering in 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.080

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.760

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.330
 life fades and my adolescence already 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.830
 belongs to the past road with 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.590
 consciousness in my steps towards the 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.840
 cliff my job is to grow free and 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.750
 strong work with my hands the earth 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.550
 so that it feeds and spirit resists 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.680
 calmly while my mind of 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.230

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.510
 The sun is full of energy but in the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.280
 village now stars illuminate me it gives me 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.800
 Life is hard and there is no doubt shines 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.100

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.350

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.100
 common sense to a question by 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.260
 all the debts that we owe to those who 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.810
 They claim to be the owners of all your dreams 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.760
