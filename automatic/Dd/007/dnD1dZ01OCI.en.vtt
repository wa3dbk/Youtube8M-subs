00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
and what's the right way to use them how

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
do you put them on so to answer the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.370 
do you put them on so to answer the
first<00:00:17.430> part<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.029> question<00:00:18.270> wrist<00:00:19.170> wraps

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
first part of that question wrist wraps

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.689 
first part of that question wrist wraps
I<00:00:19.560> don't<00:00:19.770> believe<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.130> using<00:00:20.400> too<00:00:20.550> much

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
I don't believe in using too much

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.120 
I don't believe in using too much
equipment<00:00:21.000> or<00:00:21.359> gear<00:00:21.840> because<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.680> protects

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
equipment or gear because it protects

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.070 
equipment or gear because it protects
your<00:00:23.670> muscles<00:00:24.510> from<00:00:24.630> actually<00:00:24.960> getting

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
your muscles from actually getting

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.750 
your muscles from actually getting
stronger<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.710> if<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.070> wear<00:00:26.220> your<00:00:26.400> wrist<00:00:26.550> wraps

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
stronger so if you wear your wrist wraps

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.210 
stronger so if you wear your wrist wraps
all<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> time<00:00:27.300> every<00:00:27.689> set<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.140> you're<00:00:28.890> warming

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
all the time every set as you're warming

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.800 
all the time every set as you're warming
up<00:00:29.340> your<00:00:29.970> wrists<00:00:30.210> are<00:00:30.240> actually<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.750> get

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
up your wrists are actually going to get

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.810 
up your wrists are actually going to get
weaker<00:00:31.230> because<00:00:31.800> they're<00:00:32.040> getting<00:00:32.250> help<00:00:32.579> from

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
weaker because they're getting help from

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.729 
weaker because they're getting help from
the<00:00:33.030> wrists<00:00:33.270> wraps<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.200> time<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.590> use

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
the wrists wraps so the time to use

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.220 
the wrists wraps so the time to use
wrist<00:00:35.070> wraps<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.489> not<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:36.360> every<00:00:36.630> set<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
wrist wraps is not for every set all the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.690 
wrist wraps is not for every set all the
time<00:00:37.410> what<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.710> want<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.129> wait<00:00:38.309> until

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
time what you want to do is wait until

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.940 
time what you want to do is wait until
you're<00:00:38.969> using<00:00:39.390> heavier<00:00:39.809> weight<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.800> me

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
you're using heavier weight for me

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.770 
you're using heavier weight for me
personally<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.879> vary<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.660> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
personally and this can vary I like to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.360 
personally and this can vary I like to
use<00:00:42.870> them<00:00:43.020> once<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.530> weight<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.739> something<00:00:44.190> I

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
use them once the weight is something I

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.400 
use them once the weight is something I
can<00:00:44.520> only<00:00:44.640> handle<00:00:44.820> for<00:00:45.210> three<00:00:45.510> repetitions<00:00:46.200> or

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
can only handle for three repetitions or

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.139 
can only handle for three repetitions or
less<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> weight<00:00:47.969> for

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
less so if I can we do the weight for

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.450 
less so if I can we do the weight for
three<00:00:48.390> reps<00:00:48.600> two<00:00:49.140> reps<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.649> if<00:00:49.829> I'm<00:00:49.950> doing<00:00:49.980> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
three reps two reps or if I'm doing a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.180 
three reps two reps or if I'm doing a
maxout<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.510> will<00:00:51.899> use<00:00:52.050> wrist<00:00:52.320> straps<00:00:52.530> other

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
maxout I will use wrist straps other

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.650 
maxout I will use wrist straps other
than<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> don't<00:00:53.850> use<00:00:54.239> them<00:00:54.390> because<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
than that I don't use them because I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.450 
than that I don't use them because I
want<00:00:54.960> my<00:00:55.079> wrist<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.469> get<00:00:55.590> stronger<00:00:55.980> you've

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.370 
up my forearm all the way halfway up my
hand<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.759> if<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.570> relax<00:01:48.840> my<00:01:49.020> hand<00:01:49.229> now<00:01:49.350> I

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
hand and if I just relax my hand now I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.380 
hand and if I just relax my hand now I
can't<00:01:49.920> even<00:01:50.130> open<00:01:50.250> my<00:01:50.399> fingers<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.119> it's

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.660 
can't even open my fingers it's it's
squeezing<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.079> hard<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:53.040> definitely<00:01:53.520> not

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
squeezing so hard so it's definitely not

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.670 
squeezing so hard so it's definitely not
comfortable<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.570> keeps<00:01:55.229> your<00:01:55.470> wrist

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
comfortable but this keeps your wrist

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.230 
comfortable but this keeps your wrist
straight<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.759> when<00:01:56.880> you're<00:01:56.969> doing<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
benchpress for example which is what I'm

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.440 
benchpress for example which is what I'm
talking<00:01:59.399> about<00:01:59.520> using<00:01:59.700> these<00:01:59.939> wrist<00:02:00.210> wraps

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.420 
talking about using these wrist wraps
you<00:02:00.990> don't<00:02:01.170> want<00:02:01.380> your<00:02:01.530> wrists<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.219> bend

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
backwards so what this does is it keeps

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620 
backwards so what this does is it keeps
it<00:02:04.500> straight<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.820> lets<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.090> push<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.479> bar
