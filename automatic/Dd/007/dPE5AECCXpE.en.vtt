reflections the puzzles in this video
are<00:00:14.759> slightly<00:00:15.030> harder<00:00:15.480> than<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> ones<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.020> put

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
in the first chapter so I suggest that

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.510 
in the first chapter so I suggest that
you<00:00:18.779> pause<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.170> video<00:00:19.260> at<00:00:19.500> every<00:00:19.800> position<00:00:20.130> so

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
you pause the video at every position so

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.120 
you pause the video at every position so
that<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.730> can<00:00:20.880> test<00:00:21.150> yourself<00:00:21.800> there<00:00:22.800> are<00:00:22.890> six

combination that completely turns around

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.620 
combination that completely turns around
the<00:01:48.659> game<00:01:49.159> why<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.220> starts<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:51.530> c7<00:01:52.530> check

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
the game why it starts with c7 check

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.899 
the game why it starts with c7 check
after<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.810> black<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.770> forced<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.399> capture<00:01:56.759> on

the sting all over the screen both are
winning<00:02:07.040> for<00:02:07.220> weight<00:02:07.569> let's<00:02:08.569> first<00:02:08.840> see<00:02:08.989> what

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
winning for weight let's first see what

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.670 
winning for weight let's first see what
happens<00:02:09.470> if<00:02:09.619> Queen<00:02:09.890> captures<00:02:10.220> season<00:02:10.819> after

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680

Queen are aligned on the same diagonal
another<00:02:18.680> thing<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.160> notice<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:20.180> if<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
another thing to notice is that if the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.670 
another thing to notice is that if the
Queen<00:02:20.930> was<00:02:21.230> moved<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:22.480> five-night<00:02:23.480> c6<00:02:24.230> would
