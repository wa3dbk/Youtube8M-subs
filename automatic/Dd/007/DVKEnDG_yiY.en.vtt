00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.610
 I will introduce you to the machine at this 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.139
 which is a very good machine 1 and if 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.929
 we have a problem with the film of course 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:14.379
 we 'll stop right here at 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.750
 the back we have a switch 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.349
 off and a connection cable 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.240
 from his hand the descriptive plaque that 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.919
 corresponds to the standard what is 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.000
 mandatory 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.380
 besides this machine meets all 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.279
 European safety standards 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.810
 here the handle that will lower the 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.400
 trolley of size 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.340
 here the feeler here the strawberry 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.550
 here we have a first brake so get 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.500
 would have prevented me we're going to prevent the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.940
 cart to go back and forth but 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.890
 on the other hand does not prevent a future of 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.000
 left to right then the utility the 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.990
 fresh if we already knew his 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.930
 machines in my opinion that we try 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.760
 the utility otherwise you will see using 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.740
 the machine is very useful here illustrated 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.120
 another obstacle that prevents the hand 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.930
 cart to go from left to right but 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.170
 but we do not want to go 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.420
 to have back here again another 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.060
 brake it's a damper brother who's going 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.220
 always bring back strawberries and 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.260
 feelers at their point of departure 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.430
 so that too is very useful when we 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.340
 size and dictated laser keys 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.080
 vehicles we can either do go on 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.420
 the left on the right is in the center 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.270
 and that's not using it 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.630
 here we have the storage box of 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.640
 strawberries 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.500
 so these are sentences likewise 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.000
 diameter that AIDS costs or jm has 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.250
 so do not throw your old ones to 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.720
 strawberries you can keep it and you 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.550
 can use them on this machine 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.670
 here are the first one a tightening 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.670
 quick 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.330
 for the keys then we serve if ever the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.620
 handle came to embarrass the Rennes make 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.360
 it's very tight if you end up with 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.980
 a handle like that we can always 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.800
 moved 500 locks 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.600
 So here it is a machine with 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.360
 an eto'o reclining yours will be and at 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.830
 fixed why but because you win 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.450
 in precision the nestois reclining are 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.220
 less precise and only serve to 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.220
 a key ie the key cowhide 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.500
 radial then next 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.050
 Here we have the machine controls 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.510
 so first button that corresponds to the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.020
 second button light that matches 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.090
 at twenty motor turns is here the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.700
 electronic leveling adjustment 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.080
 feelers and strawberries 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.540
 so to do that we press the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.220
 button the mayor marc hottin we remove 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.290
 the damper the damper we go there 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.370
 come on most machines 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.140
 modern we find a damper so 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.610
 here the damper is removed the strawberry 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.250
 the horn scared and the strawberry came even 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.050
 time on the keys to make the adjustment 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.820
 just follow the directions that 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.870
 are written there so they tell me he 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.030
 I have to turn right 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.250
 the adjustment wheel so I turn to 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.860
 right until I get a fire 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:54.220
 green this is this verse so the setting is 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.110
 well we look at two places in the key 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.560
 to make sure that the settings have 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.840
 been done then following the damper 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.739
 so what's the point of a damper 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.450
 the damper and it's very simple it's 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.100
 it gives me comfort that is to say that 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.769
 you have the touch probe that touches the key 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.080
 first and then see France 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.370
 has not touched yet 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.900
 so that's why it allows 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.360
 when you have small holes on 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.640
 little lapointe to be much more 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.810
 accurate sister I place do not have the heart 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.570
 in the will be the most fish of the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.250
 key I put my brakes here and there I 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.440
 know that my strawberry will stay in all the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.550
 time in the alignment of the holes of 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.030
 the clamshell machine one thing been forgotten 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.910
 here we then drive sofres and a 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.560
 frenda then drop when we do 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.020
 Passenger Vehicle Laser Keys serves 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.820
 often it allows to leave the strawberry 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.350
 in the down position and continue to 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.750
 to carve sacred on all the length without 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.780
 to have several levels we always 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.640
 a well-cut key well slipping what 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.350
 allows to succeed his keys perfectly 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.910
 so now we're going to carve this 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.140
 little key so just put in 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.290
 sale is in market our settings has been 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.290
 made 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.250
 he cut to be found simplified 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.950
 since we have a brother who has prevented the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:14.500
 cart to go left and right and 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.500
 so we have no trouble cutting the key 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.250
 even though there I was not really 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.890
 a perfect condition I'm not in 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.990
 a breeding workshop I'm in 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:37.070
 my garden I do not necessarily want 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:39.590
 this is a first phase second sense 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:49.850
 so here we check its setting it's 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:51.290
 preferable sever sever settings so I 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.490
 can size is my key then same thing 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:59.870
 I put back my shock absorbers I put back my 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.460
 centering brother earned the machine 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.039
 I just have to cut now the 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.990
 peace 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.449
 know one at the easiest part in 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.270
 applying constant pressure with 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:15.499
 my arm that the same impression that I have 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:19.029
 setting closing settings 1 I'm using 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:19.029
 the same notched impression 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.690
 is not anymore 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:39.560
 So here is a sequel it's very simple 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:40.910
 listener or so the complexity with a 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.480
 clip brushed is that often they 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.680
 have trouble getting in so we'll see 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.680
 and that's it works the first time 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.620
 as often by the way then there is a 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.960
 small failure rate is sure we succeed 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.220
 not every time but usually 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.840
 when we do not succeed it's not the fault 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.580
 of the machine it is the fault of being 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.420
 human who is not perfect that's the 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:08.870
 machine has the pantera what will you 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.050
 succeed your keys in 99% of cases thank you 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.050
 a lot
