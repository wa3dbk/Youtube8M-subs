00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.539 
like that to carry your baby in any case
and<00:01:31.049> certainly<00:01:31.710> not<00:01:31.829> for<00:01:31.950> an<00:01:32.040> Oso<00:01:32.310> sling

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
and certainly not for an Oso sling

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.730 
and certainly not for an Oso sling
either<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.689> I've<00:01:34.020> got<00:01:34.259> rings<00:01:34.470> or<00:01:34.650> two

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
either so I've got rings or two

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.010 
either so I've got rings or two
different<00:01:35.040> colors<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.430> clarity<00:01:35.790> I'm<00:01:36.780> going

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
different colors for clarity I'm going

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.210 
different colors for clarity I'm going
to<00:01:37.079> make<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.680> pink<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to make it so that the pink one is the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.530 
to make it so that the pink one is the
one<00:01:38.340> that's<00:01:38.400> showing<00:01:38.759> at<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> end<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.240> for

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
one that's showing at the end just for

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.899 
one that's showing at the end just for
clarity<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> first<00:01:41.579> thing<00:01:41.729> we're<00:01:41.850> gonna

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
clarity so the first thing we're gonna

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.260 
clarity so the first thing we're gonna
do<00:01:42.180> let's<00:01:43.049> take<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.409> end<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.799> fabric<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
do let's take one end of the fabric and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.810 
do let's take one end of the fabric and
I've<00:01:45.450> got<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.720> sort<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.990> bunched<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:47.610> gonna

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
I've got it sort of bunched up I'm gonna

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.480 
I've got it sort of bunched up I'm gonna
put<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.119> through<00:01:48.299> both<00:01:48.540> rings<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:53.280> I've

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
put it through both rings and I've

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.730 
put it through both rings and I've
already<00:01:53.670> done<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.000> wrong<00:01:54.409> I'm<00:01:55.409> gonna<00:01:55.560> put

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
already done this wrong I'm gonna put

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.459 
already done this wrong I'm gonna put
through<00:01:55.920> both<00:01:56.070> rings<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.780> then<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:58.259> I'm

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
through both rings and then like I'm

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.950 
through both rings and then like I'm
doing<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.009> ribbon<00:01:59.369> belt<00:01:59.610> I'm<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.840> gonna

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
doing a ribbon belt I'm just gonna

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.179 
doing a ribbon belt I'm just gonna
thread<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.380> over<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:03.270> silver<00:02:03.659> one<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.189> under

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
thread it over this silver one and under

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.760 
thread it over this silver one and under
the<00:02:05.640> pink<00:02:05.850> one

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.570 

so<00:02:10.770> now<00:02:10.920> I've<00:02:11.040> got<00:02:11.160> something<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.550> looks

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
so now I've got something that looks

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.650 
so now I've got something that looks
like<00:02:11.820> this<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:14.100> think<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.700> really<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:15.630> a

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
like this and I think it's really like a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.320 
like this and I think it's really like a
lot<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.930> videos<00:02:16.200> won't<00:02:16.440> show<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.770> but<00:02:17.040> a

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
lot of videos won't show this but a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.460 
lot of videos won't show this but a
really<00:02:18.330> good<00:02:18.510> step<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.140> make<00:02:19.230> sure<00:02:19.290> that

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
really good step is to make sure that

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.200 
really good step is to make sure that
your<00:02:19.680> fabric<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:20.160> spread<00:02:20.520> out<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:20.940> Rings

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
your fabric is spread out in the Rings

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.000 
your fabric is spread out in the Rings
before<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.630> go<00:02:21.720> any<00:02:21.900> further<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.710> it's<00:02:22.890> all

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
before you go any further if it's all

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.130 
before you go any further if it's all
bunched<00:02:23.220> up<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:24.810> actually

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
bunched up like this it's actually

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.990 
bunched up like this it's actually
forcing<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.740> Rings<00:02:25.920> apart<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.520> that's<00:02:26.850> gonna

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
forcing the Rings apart and that's gonna

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.850 
forcing the Rings apart and that's gonna
make<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.300> more<00:02:27.420> likely<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.960> slip<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.470> you

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
make it more likely to slip and you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.020 
make it more likely to slip and you
don't<00:02:29.040> want<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.310> slip<00:02:29.460> especially<00:02:29.880> when

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
don't want it to slip especially when

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.330 
don't want it to slip especially when
you're<00:02:30.120> wearing<00:02:30.210> it<00:02:30.390> with<00:02:30.420> me<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.830> I'm<00:02:32.190> just

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
you're wearing it with me so I'm just

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.720 
you're wearing it with me so I'm just
going<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.580> find<00:02:32.970> one<00:02:33.180> edge<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.580> I'm<00:02:35.580> gonna

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
going to find one edge and I'm gonna

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.400 
going to find one edge and I'm gonna
kind<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:37.070> pull<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.100> out<00:02:38.310> slowly<00:02:38.850> so<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.270> doesn't

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
kind of pull it out slowly so it doesn't

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.610 
kind of pull it out slowly so it doesn't
blur<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:42.660> then<00:02:42.870> when<00:02:43.080> I'm<00:02:43.230> done<00:02:45.470> see<00:02:46.470> how

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
blur and then when I'm done see how

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.050 
blur and then when I'm done see how
nicely<00:02:46.830> that's<00:02:47.100> kind<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.460> gathered<00:02:47.760> through

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
nicely that's kind of gathered through

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.990 
nicely that's kind of gathered through
like<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.920> I'm<00:02:49.920> gonna<00:02:50.100> take<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.460> piece<00:02:50.790> that

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
like that I'm gonna take this piece that

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.280 
like that I'm gonna take this piece that
I've<00:02:51.120> got<00:02:51.240> under<00:02:51.480> here<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:51.990> want<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.230> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
I've got under here and you want that to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.690 
I've got under here and you want that to
be<00:02:52.440> between<00:02:52.770> ten<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.160> twelve<00:02:53.430> inches<00:02:53.640> long

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
be between ten and twelve inches long

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.230 
be between ten and twelve inches long
I'm<00:02:54.630> just<00:02:54.750> gonna<00:02:54.840> pull<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.170> pretty<00:02:55.380> snug<00:02:56.240> a

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
I'm just gonna pull that pretty snug a

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.300 
I'm just gonna pull that pretty snug a
nice<00:02:57.630> little<00:02:57.840> trick<00:02:58.230> actually<00:02:58.470> if<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.130> have<00:02:59.280> a

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
nice little trick actually if you have a

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.820 
nice little trick actually if you have a
thin<00:02:59.550> enough<00:02:59.790> fabric<00:03:00.210> is<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.570> pull<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.470> longer

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
thin enough fabric is to pull the longer

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.570 
thin enough fabric is to pull the longer
one<00:03:02.010> through<00:03:02.400> again<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:04.530> makes<00:03:04.710> it<00:03:04.860> very

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
one through again that makes it very

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.630 
one through again that makes it very
tight<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:07.230> need<00:03:07.410> larger<00:03:07.860> rings<00:03:08.040> for<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.370> but

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
tight you need larger rings for that but

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.850 
tight you need larger rings for that but
that<00:03:09.210> is<00:03:09.330> absolutely<00:03:09.480> not<00:03:09.930> going<00:03:10.230> anywhere<00:03:10.500> I

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
that is absolutely not going anywhere I

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.270 
that is absolutely not going anywhere I
find<00:03:11.490> that<00:03:11.610> too<00:03:12.540> hard<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.170> deal<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.130> I'm

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
find that too hard to deal with so I'm

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.920 
find that too hard to deal with so I'm
gonna<00:03:14.430> undo<00:03:14.880> thread<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.300> part<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.690> would<00:03:15.810> do

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
gonna undo thread that part you would do

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.040 
gonna undo thread that part you would do
that<00:03:16.050> if<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.350> had<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> very<00:03:16.830> thin<00:03:17.160> fabric<00:03:17.670> like

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
that if you had a very thin fabric like

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.120 
that if you had a very thin fabric like
more<00:03:19.050> like<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.850> thin<00:03:20.850> tablecloth<00:03:21.950> which<00:03:22.950> is

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
more like a thin tablecloth which is

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.080 
more like a thin tablecloth which is
certainly<00:03:23.430> fine<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.730> use<00:03:24.510> for<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:28.970> thread<00:03:29.970> my

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
certainly fine to use for this thread my

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.220

I<00:04:56.550> thread<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:56.910> through<00:04:57.030> this<00:04:57.210> bottom<00:04:57.570> ring<00:04:58.220> so

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
I thread it through this bottom ring so

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.550 
I thread it through this bottom ring so
again<00:04:59.400> I'm<00:04:59.550> going<00:04:59.699> over<00:05:00.570> this<00:05:00.870> top<00:05:01.080> one<00:05:01.289> and

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
again I'm going over this top one and

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.230 
again I'm going over this top one and
under<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.669> bottom<00:05:02.789> one<00:05:04.490> this<00:05:05.490> whole<00:05:05.669> tail

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
under the bottom one this whole tail

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.689 
under the bottom one this whole tail
through<00:05:06.570> now<00:05:07.380> you<00:05:07.470> can<00:05:07.590> see<00:05:07.740> where<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.130> length

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
through now you can see where the length

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.150 
through now you can see where the length
of<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.330> fabric<00:05:09.479> can<00:05:10.260> be<00:05:10.289> an<00:05:10.470> issue<00:05:10.620> if<00:05:10.979> you're

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
of the fabric can be an issue if you're

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.540 
of the fabric can be an issue if you're
not<00:05:11.370> small<00:05:11.880> or<00:05:12.090> petite<00:05:13.039> I'm<00:05:14.039> ending<00:05:14.280> up<00:05:14.370> with<00:05:14.490> a

not small or petite I'm ending up with a

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.350 
not small or petite I'm ending up with a
very<00:05:14.820> very<00:05:15.030> short<00:05:15.270> tail<00:05:15.539> it<00:05:16.500> would<00:05:16.680> be<00:05:17.120> safe<00:05:18.120> as

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
very very short tail it would be safe as

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.120 
very very short tail it would be safe as
long<00:05:18.389> as<00:05:18.570> I'm<00:05:18.780> keeping<00:05:19.080> an<00:05:19.169> eye<00:05:19.260> on<00:05:19.440> it<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.800> just

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
want to make sure that it doesn't slip
