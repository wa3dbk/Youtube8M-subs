was that I had no way of running a power
cord<00:00:19.200> to<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.950> internally<00:00:20.730> without<00:00:21.590> leaving<00:00:22.590> it

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
exposed where water could get in like

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.240

for example I could run it through the
back<00:00:26.400> pocket<00:00:26.880> here<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.779> then<00:00:27.930> water<00:00:28.199> would

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
back pocket here but then water would

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.500 
back pocket here but then water would
get<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.760> not<00:00:29.970> good

let's get started take the back plate
that<00:02:22.390> goes<00:02:22.569> on<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.810> inside<00:02:22.840> we're<00:02:23.650> gonna<00:02:23.769> use

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
that goes on the inside we're gonna use

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.539 
that goes on the inside we're gonna use
that<00:02:24.190> as<00:02:24.519> a<00:02:24.610> template<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.299> the<00:02:25.330> front<00:02:26.430> place<00:02:27.430> it

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
that as a template on the front place it

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.070 
that as a template on the front place it
on<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.760> bag<00:02:27.910> wherever<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.420> want<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.750> front

have it exactly where you want it take

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.560 
have it exactly where you want it take
your<00:02:33.940> PIN<00:02:34.269> and<00:02:35.190> we're<00:02:36.190> going<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.489> trace<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
your PIN and we're going to trace the

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.080 
your PIN and we're going to trace the
inside<00:02:37.750> circle<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.590> then<00:02:39.340> where<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.880> four

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
inside circle and then where the four

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.200 
inside circle and then where the four
bolts<00:02:40.450> would<00:02:40.630> go

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.880 

okay<00:02:46.210> I<00:02:46.240> got<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.510> marked<00:02:46.720> out<00:02:46.960> so<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.650> can<00:02:47.770> see

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
okay I got it marked out so you can see

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.910 
okay I got it marked out so you can see
where<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.069> traced<00:02:48.450> got<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.569> four<00:02:49.810> holes<00:02:50.650> for

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
where I traced got the four holes for

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.280 
where I traced got the four holes for
the<00:02:51.130> bolts<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.640> in<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.030> center<00:02:52.330> hole<00:02:52.540> which

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
the bolts and in the center hole which

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.030 
the bolts and in the center hole which
the<00:02:53.890> plug<00:02:54.100> will<00:02:54.280> run<00:02:54.459> through<00:02:55.020> so<00:02:56.020> then<00:02:56.890> you'll

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
the plug will run through so then you'll

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.830 
the plug will run through so then you'll
be<00:02:57.190> taking<00:02:57.490> a<00:02:57.610> soldering<00:02:57.970> iron<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.420> isn't<00:02:58.750> my

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
be taking a soldering iron this isn't my

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.540 
be taking a soldering iron this isn't my
soldering<00:02:59.260> iron<00:02:59.290> but<00:02:59.680> I'll<00:02:59.800> use<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.190> point

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
soldering iron but I'll use it to point

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.540 
soldering iron but I'll use it to point
with<00:03:00.990> but<00:03:01.990> similar<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.220> take<00:03:03.490> a

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
end goes into the bag and that leaves

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.700 
end goes into the bag and that leaves
the<00:04:23.650> outside<00:04:24.450> with<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.479> faceplate<00:04:26.110> with<00:04:26.530> the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
the outside with the faceplate with the

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.600 
the outside with the faceplate with the
cap<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.280> sealing<00:04:27.610> cap<00:04:27.760> watertight<00:04:28.300> cap

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.340 

okay<00:04:32.610> you<00:04:32.670> can<00:04:32.820> see<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:32.970> have<00:04:33.210> mine<00:04:33.390> turned<00:04:33.930> with

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
okay you can see I have mine turned with

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.520 
okay you can see I have mine turned with
the<00:04:34.610> cap<00:04:35.610> going<00:04:36.060> over<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:36.690> left<00:04:36.840> side<00:04:37.140> that

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
the cap going over to the left side that

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.090 
the cap going over to the left side that
way<00:04:37.650> it's<00:04:37.800> not<00:04:37.950> interfering<00:04:38.580> with<00:04:38.760> my<00:04:38.910> cord

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
way it's not interfering with my cord

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.440 
way it's not interfering with my cord
because<00:04:41.100> my<00:04:41.250> cord<00:04:41.520> sits<00:04:41.760> on<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.000> right<00:04:42.030> side

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
because my cord sits on the right side

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.550 
because my cord sits on the right side
so<00:04:44.000> then<00:04:45.000> what<00:04:45.150> you'll<00:04:45.330> do<00:04:45.480> get<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.290> hardware

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
so then what you'll do get the hardware

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.830 
so then what you'll do get the hardware
out<00:04:46.710> there's<00:04:47.340> various<00:04:47.880> screws<00:04:48.240> they<00:04:48.570> give<00:04:48.720> you

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
like some short ones and some long ones

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.950 
like some short ones and some long ones
I'm<00:04:53.430> gonna<00:04:53.580> use<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:53.880> long<00:04:54.090> ones<00:04:54.300> in<00:04:54.510> this<00:04:54.690> case

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
I'm gonna use the long ones in this case

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.910 
I'm gonna use the long ones in this case
so<00:04:55.830> just<00:04:56.790> go<00:04:56.940> ahead<00:04:57.350> pick<00:04:58.350> which<00:04:58.560> ones<00:04:58.770> you

need and then go ahead and get started

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.660 
need and then go ahead and get started
screwing<00:05:02.760> them<00:05:03.390> into<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.590> case<00:05:04.860> I'm<00:05:05.490> not

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
screwing them into the case I'm not

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.250 
screwing them into the case I'm not
worried<00:05:05.940> about<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.300> face<00:05:06.480> plate<00:05:06.780> in<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.110> back

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
worried about the face plate in the back

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.690 
worried about the face plate in the back
yet<00:05:07.530> I<00:05:07.680> just<00:05:07.860> want<00:05:08.010> to<00:05:08.070> get<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.340> screws

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
yet I just want to get the screws

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.130 
yet I just want to get the screws
through<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.650> get<00:05:10.650> them<00:05:10.740> through<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.070> liner

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
through and get them through the liner

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.600 
through and get them through the liner
so<00:05:13.140> you<00:05:13.710> might<00:05:13.920> have<00:05:14.040> to<00:05:14.100> use<00:05:14.400> your

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
so you might have to use your

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.850 
so you might have to use your
screwdriver<00:05:16.550> to<00:05:17.550> push<00:05:17.760> it<00:05:17.910> through<00:05:18.120> so<00:05:18.770> I<00:05:19.770> just

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
screwdriver to push it through so I just

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.640 
screwdriver to push it through so I just
kind<00:05:20.220> of<00:05:22.400> twist<00:05:23.400> it<00:05:23.610> through<00:05:24.230> so<00:05:25.230> it's<00:05:25.380> seated

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
kind of twist it through so it's seated

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.740 
kind of twist it through so it's seated
in<00:05:25.920> there<00:05:26.130> pretty<00:05:26.340> good<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:26.970> then<00:05:27.240> just<00:05:27.510> go

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
in there pretty good and then just go

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.430 
in there pretty good and then just go
ahead<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:28.230> do<00:05:28.350> all<00:05:28.380> of<00:05:28.710> them<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:30.900> then<00:05:31.230> you

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
ahead and do all of them and then you

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.150 
ahead and do all of them and then you
can<00:05:32.540> put<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:33.660> face<00:05:33.840> plate<00:05:34.140> on<00:05:34.290> the<00:05:34.470> back<00:05:34.650> so

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
can put the face plate on the back so

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.810 
can put the face plate on the back so
I'll<00:05:35.280> do<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.580> rest<00:05:35.730> of<00:05:36.030> them<00:05:37.490> okay<00:05:38.490> this<00:05:38.670> is

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
I'll do the rest of them okay this is

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.250 
I'll do the rest of them okay this is
what<00:05:38.970> it<00:05:39.000> looks<00:05:39.240> like<00:05:39.300> on<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.720> inside<00:05:40.050> so

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
what it looks like on the inside so

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.930 
what it looks like on the inside so
hopefully<00:05:40.560> you<00:05:40.620> can<00:05:40.680> see<00:05:40.950> it's<00:05:41.100> kind<00:05:41.340> of<00:05:41.400> dark

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
hopefully you can see it's kind of dark

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.970 
hopefully you can see it's kind of dark
but<00:05:42.480> I<00:05:42.510> got<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:42.810> four<00:05:42.990> screws<00:05:43.320> coming<00:05:43.710> through

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
but I got the four screws coming through

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.520 
but I got the four screws coming through
I<00:05:44.190> got<00:05:44.460> my<00:05:44.610> main<00:05:44.790> cable<00:05:45.180> coming<00:05:45.390> through<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.080> I

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
I got my main cable coming through and I

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.410 
I got my main cable coming through and I
just<00:05:46.770> cut<00:05:47.040> the<00:05:47.250> lining<00:05:47.490> just<00:05:47.700> enough<00:05:48.150> to<00:05:48.270> get

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
just cut the lining just enough to get

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.940 
just cut the lining just enough to get
the<00:05:48.540> screws<00:05:48.870> through<00:05:49.170> I<00:05:49.440> didn't<00:05:49.650> want<00:05:49.800> to<00:05:49.860> make

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
the screws through I didn't want to make

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.510 
the screws through I didn't want to make
a<00:05:49.980> big<00:05:50.250> cut<00:05:50.520> in<00:05:50.670> the<00:05:50.760> lining<00:05:51.050> and<00:05:52.190> then<00:05:53.190> I'll

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
a big cut in the lining and then I'll

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.480 
a big cut in the lining and then I'll
take<00:05:53.850> the<00:05:53.970> face<00:05:54.150> plate<00:05:54.450> with<00:05:55.290> the<00:05:55.740> bolts<00:05:56.340> on

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
take the face plate with the bolts on

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.440 
take the face plate with the bolts on
the<00:05:56.610> back<00:05:56.730> and<00:05:57.240> slide<00:05:57.600> that<00:05:57.840> on<00:05:59.180> you<00:06:00.180> want<00:06:00.360> it

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.910 
the back and slide that on you want it
right<00:06:00.660> over<00:06:00.900> the<00:06:01.020> screws<00:06:01.320> and<00:06:01.590> then<00:06:01.680> you<00:06:01.770> can

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
right over the screws and then you can

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.960 
right over the screws and then you can
bolt<00:06:02.160> it<00:06:02.280> down<00:06:04.190> okay<00:06:05.190> so<00:06:05.250> there<00:06:05.520> it<00:06:05.640> is<00:06:05.670> it's

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
bolt it down okay so there it is it's

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.470 
bolt it down okay so there it is it's
mounted<00:06:06.360> in<00:06:06.540> now<00:06:06.750> I<00:06:07.680> got<00:06:08.160> my<00:06:08.280> cap<00:06:08.490> you<00:06:09.150> can<00:06:09.180> plug

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
mounted in now I got my cap you can plug

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.930 
mounted in now I got my cap you can plug
it<00:06:09.600> in<00:06:09.720> if<00:06:09.870> you're<00:06:09.990> not<00:06:10.020> using<00:06:10.380> the<00:06:10.650> power<00:06:10.940> the

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
it in if you're not using the power the

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.440 
it in if you're not using the power the
power<00:06:12.120> cord<00:06:12.450> plugs<00:06:12.780> directly<00:06:13.080> into<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:14.450> face

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
power cord plugs directly into the face

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.120 
power cord plugs directly into the face
plate<00:06:15.750> here<00:06:16.050> and<00:06:17.960> then<00:06:18.960> this<00:06:19.140> goes<00:06:19.470> into<00:06:19.680> your

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
plate here and then this goes into your

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.640 
plate here and then this goes into your
cigarette<00:06:20.520> lighter<00:06:20.700> outlet<00:06:21.540> and<00:06:21.750> then<00:06:22.290> on<00:06:22.500> the

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
cigarette lighter outlet and then on the

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.120 
cigarette lighter outlet and then on the
inside<00:06:23.960> so<00:06:24.960> you're<00:06:25.260> open<00:06:25.620> it<00:06:25.710> where<00:06:25.860> you<00:06:25.980> can

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
inside so you're open it where you can

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.410
