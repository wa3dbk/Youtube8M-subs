nice<00:00:31.619> light<00:00:32.070> color<00:00:32.309> here<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:33.030> says<00:00:33.239> how

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
nice light color here this says how

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.000 
nice light color here this says how
light<00:00:33.600> reflective<00:00:34.110> property<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.829> going

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
light reflective property so it's going

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.680 
light reflective property so it's going
to<00:00:35.100> draw<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> light<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> that's<00:00:36.390> what<00:00:36.600> you

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
to draw in the light and that's what you

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.360 
to draw in the light and that's what you
want<00:00:36.930> when<00:00:37.200> you're<00:00:37.290> highlighting<00:00:37.770> something

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
want when you're highlighting something

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.369 
want when you're highlighting something
using<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.059> slightly<00:00:39.270> smaller<00:00:39.660> brush<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.050> this

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
using a slightly smaller brush for this

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.650 
using a slightly smaller brush for this
and<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> upper<00:00:42.390> part

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and this is just going on the upper part

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.510 
and this is just going on the upper part
of<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> cheekbone<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.399> how

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
of the cheekbone so and I can see how

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.970 
of the cheekbone so and I can see how
the<00:00:44.579> light<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.030> naturally<00:00:45.690> hitting<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.649> part

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
the light is naturally hitting this part

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.590 
the light is naturally hitting this part
which<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> top<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.760> my<00:00:47.879> cheek<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.149> this

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
which is the top of my cheek like this

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.900 
which is the top of my cheek like this
this<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.620> where<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.100> are<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.489> place<00:00:50.700> our

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
this is where we are going to place our

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.139 
this is where we are going to place our
highlight<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.309> I'm<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.489> swirling<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
highlight and I'm just swirling it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.540 
highlight and I'm just swirling it
around<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.570> kind<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> C<00:00:55.170> shape<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.860> don't<00:00:56.489> know

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
around in kind of a C shape I don't know

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.040 
around in kind of a C shape I don't know
if<00:00:56.610> you've<00:00:56.730> watched<00:00:56.969> my<00:00:57.149> videos<00:00:57.449> before<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.870> I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
if you've watched my videos before but I

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.959 
if you've watched my videos before but I
actually<00:00:58.230> had<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.829> little<00:00:59.160> easy<00:00:59.430> way<00:00:59.789> of

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
actually had a little easy way of

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.849 
actually had a little easy way of
remembering<00:01:00.210> where<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:00.989> want<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> place<00:01:01.500> each

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
remembering where you want to place each

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.070 
remembering where you want to place each
thing<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> three<00:01:03.270> C's<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
thing so you have the three C's the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.320 
thing so you have the three C's the
first<00:01:04.320> C<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.710> across<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.060> where<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
first C is across here this is where you

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.020 
first C is across here this is where you
apply<00:01:06.420> your<00:01:07.140> highlighter<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.820> like

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
apply your highlighter so it's just like

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.300 
apply your highlighter so it's just like
this<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.750> second<00:01:10.229> C<00:01:10.530> which<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.040> slightly

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
this your second C which is slightly

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.690 
this your second C which is slightly
bigger<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.820> more<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.479> your<00:01:12.810> actual<00:01:13.159> blush<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
bigger is more for your actual blush and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.399 
bigger is more for your actual blush and
then<00:01:15.150> your<00:01:15.299> third<00:01:15.509> C<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.869> more<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.320> your

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
then your third C is more for your

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
then your third C is more for your
contour<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.100> contour<00:01:17.490> comes<00:01:17.729> along<00:01:17.970> here

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
contour so your contour comes along here

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.060 
contour so your contour comes along here
and<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:18.720> underneath<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:19.920> an

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and just underneath here so it's just an

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.770 
and just underneath here so it's just an
easy<00:01:20.310> way<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.640> remembering<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.600> add<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
easy way of remembering it just add a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.179 
easy way of remembering it just add a
little<00:01:21.930> bit<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.229> glow<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.799> face<00:01:23.009> but

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
little bit of glow to the face but

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.249 
little bit of glow to the face but
mostly<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:24.060> concentrated<00:01:24.659> along<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.229> I

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
mostly it's concentrated along there I

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.630 
mostly it's concentrated along there I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
nodes in highlighter so just a nice thin

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.389 
nodes in highlighter so just a nice thin
layer<00:01:41.970> right<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.140> between<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:44.280> also

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
do a cross here which is the top of the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.300 
do a cross here which is the top of the
brows<00:01:48.049> which<00:01:49.049> once<00:01:49.409> again<00:01:49.680> adds<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.070> little<00:01:50.189> bit

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310

brows which once again adds a little bit
of<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.520> three-dimensional<00:01:51.270> shape<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.140> also

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
of a three-dimensional shape and it also

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.889 
of a three-dimensional shape and it also
do<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.159> chin<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.659> step

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
do the chin so that is this step
