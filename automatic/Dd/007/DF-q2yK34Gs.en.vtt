00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
things that video does is it actually

things that video does is it actually
will<00:00:58.500> adjust<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.550> different<00:00:59.940> conditions

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
will adjust for the different conditions

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.360 
will adjust for the different conditions
if<00:01:00.750> you're<00:01:00.960> losing<00:01:01.559> bandwidth<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.250> will

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
if you're losing bandwidth it will

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
if you're losing bandwidth it will
adjust<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.850> them<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.570> no<00:01:04.110> bandwidth

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
adjust to them if you have no bandwidth

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.399 
adjust to them if you have no bandwidth
or<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:05.430> limited<00:01:05.640> bandwidth<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:07.140> going

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
or a very limited bandwidth it's going

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.289 
or a very limited bandwidth it's going
to<00:01:07.500> make<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.740> adjustment<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.180> going

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
to make an adjustment but it's not going

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.550 
to make an adjustment but it's not going
to<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.510> away<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.380> nice<00:01:10.530> things

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
to go away that's one of the nice things

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100 
to go away that's one of the nice things
is<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.880> someone<00:01:12.240> coming<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.689> me<00:01:12.810> from<00:01:12.960> a

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
linkous with pehle presence devices but

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.800 
linkous with pehle presence devices but
the<00:02:06.620> link<00:02:06.830> telepresence<00:02:07.400> into<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.420> jungle

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
the link telepresence into the jungle

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.280 
the link telepresence into the jungle
into<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:10.070> environment<00:02:10.760> and<00:02:11.270> there<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.140> need

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
into the environment and there you need

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.990 
into the environment and there you need
to<00:02:12.350> have<00:02:12.620> something<00:02:12.860> that's<00:02:12.980> very<00:02:13.160> flexible

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
to have something that's very flexible

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.670 
to have something that's very flexible
something<00:02:14.450> that's<00:02:14.630> very<00:02:14.750> portable<00:02:15.380> and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
something that's very portable and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.740 
something that's very portable and
something<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.430> actually<00:02:16.730> works<00:02:17.210> I'm

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
something that actually works I'm

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.560 
something that actually works I'm
sitting<00:02:18.110> in<00:02:18.260> front<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.560> my<00:02:18.710> office<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:19.550> I'm<00:02:20.390> in

sitting in front of my office and I'm in

sitting in front of my office and I'm in
a<00:02:20.600> small<00:02:21.020> village<00:02:21.290> called<00:02:21.710> gamboa<00:02:22.600> which<00:02:23.600> is

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
a small village called gamboa which is

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.560 
a small village called gamboa which is

I<00:02:27.020> have<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:28.220> jungle<00:02:29.210> so<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.720> got<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.050> lot<00:02:30.230> of

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
I have a jungle so I got a lot of

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.190 
I have a jungle so I got a lot of
experience<00:02:30.980> with<00:02:31.130> web<00:02:31.790> conferencing<00:02:32.540> and

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
experience with web conferencing and

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.170 
experience with web conferencing and
this<00:02:33.830> is<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.160> completely<00:02:34.580> different<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.090> it

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
this is so completely different and it

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.210 
this is so completely different and it
really<00:02:35.360> gives<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.810> independence<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.680> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
really gives the independence of the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.979 
really gives the independence of the
individual<00:02:37.760> researcher<00:02:38.330> who<00:02:38.510> wants<00:02:38.810> to

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
individual researcher who wants to

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.540 
individual researcher who wants to
connect<00:02:39.470> with<00:02:39.650> somebody<00:02:39.860> just<00:02:40.340> do<00:02:40.520> it

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
connect with somebody just do it

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.600 
connect with somebody just do it
themselves

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.910 

another<00:02:49.610> major<00:02:50.300> advantage<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:51.110> video<00:02:51.350> was

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
another major advantage of video was

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.950 
another major advantage of video was
again<00:02:52.490> that<00:02:53.000> every<00:02:53.570> computer<00:02:54.530> can<00:02:55.460> be<00:02:55.960> itself

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
again that every computer can be itself

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.190 
again that every computer can be itself

that I've invested in here is Dean of
the<00:03:02.270> School<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.540> Life<00:03:02.720> Sciences<00:03:03.170> have<00:03:03.440> been

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
the School of Life Sciences have been

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.660 
the School of Life Sciences have been
expensive<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:05.000> they've<00:03:05.270> been<00:03:05.450> static<00:03:06.320> and

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
expensive and they've been static and

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.770 
expensive and they've been static and
every<00:03:07.670> place<00:03:07.940> you're<00:03:08.150> having<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.420> conference

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
every place you're having a conference

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.740 
every place you're having a conference
has<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.410> have<00:03:09.590> an<00:03:09.830> equal<00:03:10.190> investment<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:11.660> it

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
has to have an equal investment so it

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.020 
has to have an equal investment so it
was<00:03:11.900> very<00:03:12.230> expensive<00:03:12.740> to<00:03:13.220> be<00:03:13.340> trying<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.790> link

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
was very expensive to be trying to link

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.310 
was very expensive to be trying to link
in<00:03:14.240> multiple<00:03:14.810> video<00:03:15.290> points<00:03:16.100> into<00:03:16.700> a

in multiple video points into a
conferencing<00:03:18.320> classroom<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.730> we've<00:03:19.940> been

conferencing classroom so we've been
playing<00:03:20.300> with<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.480> lot<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:20.870> different<00:03:21.350> devices

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
playing with a lot of different devices

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.910 
playing with a lot of different devices
and<00:03:22.210> we're<00:03:23.210> finding<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:24.440> know<00:03:24.530> for<00:03:24.890> the

and we're finding that you know for the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.030 
and we're finding that you know for the
most<00:03:25.010> part<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:25.640> can<00:03:25.790> use<00:03:26.030> consumer<00:03:26.510> grade

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
most part you can use consumer grade

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.070 
most part you can use consumer grade
equipment<00:03:28.040> which<00:03:28.580> is<00:03:28.760> really<00:03:29.030> exciting<00:03:29.210> to

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
equipment which is really exciting to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.500 
equipment which is really exciting to
get<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.920> same<00:03:31.190> results<00:03:31.910> that<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.180> would<00:03:32.390> have

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
get the same results that you would have

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.720 
get the same results that you would have
had<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.870> excuse<00:03:33.470> very<00:03:33.770> expensive<00:03:34.340> equipment

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
had to excuse very expensive equipment
