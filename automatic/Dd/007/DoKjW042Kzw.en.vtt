00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:02.610
 and such a goal 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.670
 slopes are normalized 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.710
 only after installation is completed 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.419
 window frames 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:12.799
 very important in this operation 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.290
 preparatory process 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.619
 in order to avoid damage to the temple frame 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.869
 wrapped in protective material 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.330
 the main tools are level and 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.429
 Master OK 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.349
 the top from where it is spooned 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.210
 mounted mesh radiator for 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.760
 targeting the upper layer of the slope 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.160
 and the best strength 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.010
 the side slopes are not reinforced as 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.870
 vertical wall so provides 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.970
 desired strength and durability 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.990
 perfect straight polanski nailed 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.630
 vertically on two sides or 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.760
 necessarily checked with 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.250
 level 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.910
 the gaps between the slope and the bar should not 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.910
 be less than 6 millimeters 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.250
 for strength concrete or 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.040
 brick wall looks like a weak 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.290
 concrete solution for better 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.290
 slope interaction and true 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.560
 finishing the top of its escarpment occurs 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.000
 method as a gift or handed down the spot grid and 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.330
 simultaneously sticking mesh 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.330
 singer does not border window opening 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.450
 assembly time slopes things are 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.689
 much easier 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.170
 nato cheeses and side window openings 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.959
 sling and cement mix 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.270
 shown extraordinary 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.649
 the way this method allows the mixture and 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.280
 fit snugly to the wall surface 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.149
 stamped and fills holes 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.340
 and cracks 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.800
 after applying the concrete mix on 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.010
 the slopes we are cube paradise extra concrete corner 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.220
 tool with obligatory 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.849
 maintaining an angle of 90 degrees 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.719
 slopes should be strictly 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.269
 perpendicular to the plant or earlier 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.370
 when the slope is a little paso no we start 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.509
 rub it 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:47.659
 all hand rubbed irregularities and 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.659
 roughness 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:08.749
 when the grout slope is finished and last 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.489
 once check the corner between the slope and in my 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.199
 we are neatly removable 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.199
 auxiliary wooden planks 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:54.169
 slopes ready for the test finish
