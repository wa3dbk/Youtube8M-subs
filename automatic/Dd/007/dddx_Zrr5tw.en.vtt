00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.980
 social network becomes a haven 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.600
 terrorists at least so 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.580
 approves the committee chairman 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.950
 British Parliament for intelligence and 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.289
 security his statement followed 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.580
 after the committee published 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.340
 death investigation report 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.590
 british military whether rigby 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.740
 killed last year not far from 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.720
 barracks by two religious extremists 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.910
 the report says that one of the killers 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.980
 corresponding in social network said 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.670
 his companion that intends to kill 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.129
 rigby 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.559
 The document also states that if 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.960
 would die 5 have access to this correspondence 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.210
 the attack could have been prevented 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.980
 however, the companyâ€™s law is not required 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.659
 notify law enforcement and 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.030
 appearance of such messages 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.809
 site name is not indicated in the report 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.600
 but the British media have already calculated it 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.499
 such a lava spartaque on an expert 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.710
 nozzles 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:07.210
 but the continent I do not think that 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.670
 facebook does not disclose data 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.260
 users but this is another case after 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.630
 charges from london facebook 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.640
 published a special statement in it 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.190
 it says that the company is shocked by this 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.440
 murder but an individual case she 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.470
 does not comment on company policy not 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.280
 allows the placement of content on the site 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.080
 terrorist content and 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.870
 takes steps to prevent 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.940
 similar cases in one of the killer 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.500
 Rigby had eleven accounts in 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.270
 facebook three of which at the moment 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.230
 committing their crimes were 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.780
 acting 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.790
 whether rigby was killed last may 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.430
 near the royal barracks 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.650
 artillery will g in south london two 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.480
 armed men drench who 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.150
 as it turned out later 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.430
 religious fanatics our guest 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.580
 charles noise bridge analyst for 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.780
 security issues and a former officer 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.350
 counterterrorism unit 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.310
 British intelligence 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.990
 is facebook responsible for what happened 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.610
 collar griffiths even if not 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.130
 take into account such aspects 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.110
 problems as moral integrity 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.030
 privacy legality is possible 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.519
 suggest that facebook and others 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.220
 social networks are viewing the message 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.100
 user publications every day but 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.240
 there are practical difficulties 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.820
 facebook users and public 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.800
 over 5 million posts daily and 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.960
 you can not be sure that the company 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.080
 there is a mechanism to view 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.910
 all these posts are technically facebook 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.250
 could provide this information 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.340
 security services so that later 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.080
 a company in no way accusing it could 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.040
 there would be many countries and many 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.410
 special services 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.390
 especially if laws oblige them 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.910
 provide this kind of reports 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.370
 but in this case the security services 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.650
 would simply be overwhelmed with information 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.200
 such congestion is even greater 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.200
 would be difficult for the security services to select data 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.200
