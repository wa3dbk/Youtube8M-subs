come on man you can do it I can't get
into<00:03:25.310> progress<00:03:25.519> here<00:03:25.849> uh<00:03:26.709> oh<00:03:27.709> shit<00:03:28.310> all<00:03:28.489> right

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
into progress here uh oh shit all right

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:38.110 
into progress here uh oh shit all right
in<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.480> same<00:03:29.690> shot<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.940> have<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:37.970> little

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
in the same shot so I have a little

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.550 
in the same shot so I have a little
Theory<00:03:38.450> here<00:03:38.540> if<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:38.930> go<00:03:39.079> start<00:03:39.860> off<00:03:39.980> with<00:03:40.390> OMW

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
Theory here if you go start off with OMW

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.550 
Theory here if you go start off with OMW
then<00:03:42.560> once<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.860> hits<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.190> do<00:03:43.970> P<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:44.360> Q<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:44.690> then

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
then once it hits it do P and Q and then

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.920 
then once it hits it do P and Q and then
just<00:03:45.709> repeat<00:03:46.069> that<00:03:46.250> process<00:03:46.599> it<00:03:47.599> gives<00:03:47.780> me

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
just repeat that process it gives me

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.069 
just repeat that process it gives me
kind<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.459> running<00:03:49.459> stance<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.420> know<00:03:50.480> it's

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
kind of a running stance and I know it's

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.630 
kind of a running stance and I know it's
not<00:03:51.260> around<00:03:51.530> here<00:03:51.769> is<00:03:51.860> like<00:03:51.980> hurdles<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.519> have

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
not around here is like hurdles you have

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.539 
not around here is like hurdles you have
to<00:03:52.760> get<00:03:52.879> past<00:03:53.170> so<00:03:54.170> that'll<00:03:54.890> be<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.010> bitch<00:03:55.250> if<00:03:55.280> I

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
to get past so that'll be a bitch if I

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.300 
to get past so that'll be a bitch if I
can<00:03:55.760> even<00:03:55.879> get<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.209> those<00:03:59.230> and<00:04:00.230> oh<00:04:00.590> when<00:04:01.190> you

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
can even get to those and oh when you

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.879 
can even get to those and oh when you
