Debbie from Colorado Springs she writes
in<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.270> world<00:00:18.539> where<00:00:18.840> everything<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:20.220> true<00:00:20.730> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
in a world where everything is true and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.509 
in a world where everything is true and
acceptable<00:00:21.510> how<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.710> prove<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
acceptable how do you prove that the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.790 
acceptable how do you prove that the
Bible<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:24.060> really<00:00:24.359> true<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.140> other

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
Bible is really true and that other

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.910 
Bible is really true and that other
forms<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.340> Bibles<00:00:26.760> are<00:00:26.880> not<00:00:27.320> well<00:00:28.320> that's<00:00:28.560> of

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
forms of Bibles are not well that's of

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.710 
forms of Bibles are not well that's of
course<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.340> most<00:00:29.519> foundational<00:00:30.150> question<00:00:30.599> of

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
course the most foundational question of

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.840 
course the most foundational question of
all<00:00:30.900> because<00:00:31.590> everything<00:00:32.160> rises<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.700> falls

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
all because everything rises and falls

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.299 
all because everything rises and falls
on<00:00:33.059> whether<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.540> scripture<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.860> Word<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
on whether the scripture is the Word of

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.880 
on whether the scripture is the Word of
God<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.570> there<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:36.840> lots<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.170> lines<00:00:37.530> of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
God so there are lots of lines of

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.920 
God so there are lots of lines of
evidence<00:00:37.980> which<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.610> would<00:00:39.000> use<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.600> prove

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
evidence which you would use to prove

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.160 
evidence which you would use to prove
the<00:00:40.410> veracity<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:41.250> Scripture<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:42.000> would<00:00:42.989> say

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the veracity of Scripture I would say

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.770 
the veracity of Scripture I would say
one<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> them<00:00:43.710> would<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.700> person<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.329> Jesus

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
one of them would be the person of Jesus

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.750 
one of them would be the person of Jesus
