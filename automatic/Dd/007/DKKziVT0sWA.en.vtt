megapixel and you'll notice there are no
physical<00:01:53.189> buttons<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.180> screen<00:01:54.810> like

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
physical buttons it's all on screen like

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.859 
physical buttons it's all on screen like
a<00:01:55.350> lot<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.860> these<00:01:56.070> smaller<00:01:56.490> phones<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:57.719> we

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
a lot of these smaller phones but if we

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.719 
a lot of these smaller phones but if we
power<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.439> we'll<00:01:58.649> take<00:01:58.860> our<00:01:59.070> first<00:01:59.310> look<00:01:59.579> at

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
power it on we'll take our first look at

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.899 
power it on we'll take our first look at
this<00:01:59.969> 5-inch<00:02:00.570> 720<00:02:01.439> by<00:02:01.590> 1280<00:02:02.130> pixel<00:02:02.729> display

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
this 5-inch 720 by 1280 pixel display

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.830 
this 5-inch 720 by 1280 pixel display
that's<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.869> density<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:05.149> 294<00:02:06.149> pixels<00:02:06.630> per<00:02:06.810> inch

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
that's a density of 294 pixels per inch

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.900 
that's a density of 294 pixels per inch
so<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.200> not<00:02:07.350> terrible<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.009> although<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.789> is

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
so it's not terrible and although it is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.229 
so it's not terrible and although it is
IPS<00:02:09.479> LCD<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.349> does<00:02:10.560> use<00:02:10.860> knock<00:02:11.790> years<00:02:12.060> old

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
IPS LCD it does use knock years old

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.760 
IPS LCD it does use knock years old

technology<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.460> it's<00:02:14.610> got<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.820> fairly<00:02:15.210> high

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
technology so it's got a fairly high

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.780 
technology so it's got a fairly high
contrast<00:02:16.140> other<00:02:16.380> things<00:02:16.680> worth<00:02:17.010> noting<00:02:17.340> are

the<00:02:18.210> sizes<00:02:18.810> now<00:02:18.960> this<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.290> only<00:02:19.440> 8.8

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
the sizes now this is only 8.8

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.550 
the sizes now this is only 8.8
millimeters<00:02:20.370> thin<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.450> not<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.870> chunky

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.340

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.100 
device and it only weighs just over five

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
ounces so it's quite light too and our

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.170 
ounces so it's quite light too and our
first<00:02:28.320> impressions<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.100> seems<00:02:29.310> fairly<00:02:29.670> smooth

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
first impressions it seems fairly smooth

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.030 
first impressions it seems fairly smooth
