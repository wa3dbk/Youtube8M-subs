 sweater from the label andy lamb 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.560
 Imagine learning a little what I am 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.510
 specializing in wearing clothes 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.240
 and very nice thing makes you think 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.250
 See this is a fleece pullover in this one 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.250
 case it is a vest so without a sleeve 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.890
 and just has the opening for this 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.110
 the child where that in the belly when it is in 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.500
 the ground is carried out of here 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.899
 can 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.510
 this is a great pullover just for that 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.090
 the transitional time or for the home if 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.809
 you just wear a pullover 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.789
 would like to 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.370
 for wills it gets a bit colder 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.800
 that's just too thin it's more normal 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.500
 fleecepulli very nice flows of 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.120
 advantage the big advantage which also ours 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.739
 reason why we preside him 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.539
 have recorded that is this 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.269
 politically cut 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.489
 that means you can do it without problems 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.800
 just worn elsewhere and you can 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.900
 then wear them with you when you are back 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.000
 this plural 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.080
 that simply results from that was that 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.390
 is completely symmetrical 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.320
 and in front as well as question 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.210
 the flora can be the pullover 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.829
 is here again to see at any time 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.450
 also in many different colors like 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.229
 you can find something on our website 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.420
 because it is currently available and what is not 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.430
 This is the sweater always has relative 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.649
 long sleeve you will not be so 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.659
 have problem with it and it relatively far 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.860
 cut so synonymous a normal size 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.600
 information would suffice 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.220
 which can socialize here again 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.990
 if just not worn 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.600
 so it does not get quite so in and has 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.770
 still a nice bag and just 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.140
 also a nice one 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.229
 pity here of all the sick to 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.600
 Pull the vest will be delivered with 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:59.770
 last hours then goes over here 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:01.689
 can be pulled as a small 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.549
 alternative does not fall as an alternative 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.399
 but more than a supplement to the 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.600
 jackets extension and so a sweater can 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.349
 even more likely from the partner 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.370
 be worn 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:15.760
 Unisex is nothing to work up to 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.160
 the color choice why not 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.079
 the men should ask just again 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.079
