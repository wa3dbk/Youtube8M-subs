00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.500 
science and it made sense that it would
work<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.370> repair<00:03:53.640> these<00:03:53.760> types<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.000> processes

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
work to repair these types of processes

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.300 
work to repair these types of processes
but<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.290> wasn't<00:03:55.500> really<00:03:55.620> until<00:03:55.770> you<00:03:56.070> see<00:03:56.190> those

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
but it wasn't really until you see those

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.650 
but it wasn't really until you see those
patients<00:03:56.670> come<00:03:56.820> back<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.270> know<00:03:57.360> six<00:03:57.570> months

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
patients come back you know six months

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.630 
patients come back you know six months
later<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:58.380> they're<00:03:58.800> dancing<00:03:59.190> again<00:03:59.460> and

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
later and they're dancing again and

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.950 
later and they're dancing again and
they're<00:03:59.790> playing<00:03:59.970> with<00:04:00.150> their<00:04:00.300> grandkids<00:04:00.750> and

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
they're playing with their grandkids and

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.080 
they're playing with their grandkids and
they<00:04:01.050> ran<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.290> 5k<00:04:01.580> that<00:04:02.580> you<00:04:02.670> realize<00:04:02.910> hey<00:04:03.060> this

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
they ran a 5k that you realize hey this

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.790 
they ran a 5k that you realize hey this
stuff<00:04:03.420> really<00:04:03.600> does<00:04:03.720> work<00:04:04.110> it's<00:04:04.320> not<00:04:04.470> the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
stuff really does work it's not the
