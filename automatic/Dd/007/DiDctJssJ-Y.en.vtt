00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.750
 hi to all these two years ago 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.190
 today a new video where I 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.520
 you are presenting the ceni 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.680
 smartwatch so from sony like you 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.850
 the 10 and so we will talk a little bit 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.939
 of this shows the mud that is no 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.740
 touch based under android 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.660
 so this is a watch at the base but who 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.310
 is enough features like 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.710
 adding apps like facebook 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.410
 twitter etc and widgets 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:43.460
 here and so we will talk about this 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:46.770
 shows already there so already if we remove 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.920
 very little case like that so if we 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.090
 see compared to a finger go this is 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.770
 really small so and a bracelet 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.240
 so me I black them with the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.360
 brass and black we there is blue gray 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.780
 etc. 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:08.190
 there is only one button on this watch there 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.500
 that's the one it's used to display 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.090
 the time when if we are in 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.520
 applications to hand over theirs so 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.130
 it was this watch walking 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.440
 mainly finally even is obliged to 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.440
 walk with an android smartphone 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 disgusting so for example there we 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.020
 sees that my watch and connected through the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.300
 shot 1 in the notification center in 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.750
 voice that smart smart thing or another 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.300
 part connect us so it must be well 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.710
 sure the apps that's called her 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.340
 heard what it did rather 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.700
 sport it takes the smart app 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.270
 control so that's the shame that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.439
 I will go several 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.179
 several objects boutou sony 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.140
 so there the watch we really manage everything 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:08.470
 so had we manage the clock style 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.869
 but if we play like that like 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.869
 that like that 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.040
 here are all the styles I prefer 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.170
 like this for now 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.200
 then we can manage the applications 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.549
 we want to add to the port so there is 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.900
 all the gesture operations that I have 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.069
 downloaded so installs 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.629
 automatically so if we want 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.359
 of August have made search application 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.069
 all searched for and that lead us to 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.329
 the ps store 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.219
 then we download and install 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.829
 to the thv automatically by no on the 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.030
 then shows one can very application 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.230
 you want to put in the order that you tell me 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.659
 the posters and so there as you 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.889
 can see there then it's facebook 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:50.239
 twitter message email here is facebook 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:53.260
 twitter gmail but then it was 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:59.659
 our new music player 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:03.950
 events and endomondo then we can 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:06.400
 manage the widgets so in order 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.040
 when we see them to see so 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.370
 so me weekends as well 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.409
 facebook and twitter and / or after 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.989
 a little bankrupt gives me some advice 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:24.169
 of use how to use it with 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:25.579
 the fingers and then about the 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.519
 shows where they tell us ah what 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.689
 version was going the address everything if we want 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.470
 update accessories therefore open 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.710
 normally 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.870
 1 to update so here is so 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.920
 this watch there I country 99 euros 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.450
 but without internet we find it less 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.210
 expensive and otherwise you can take the 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.680
 smart switch two so that's the one where 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.380
 normally there is internet bullshit 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.420
 where there are the waterproof ones 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.030
 so that's against the they say she 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.960
 can hold 320 hours 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.060
 so it's really not bad for a 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:02.630
 other than say more so oils 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.150
 saints is at the cheapest boss there I 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.130
 find it really beautiful and useful finally 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.390
 she uses it walks in the air so 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.910
 so if marion messing around that the wolf is 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.340
 vain the watch will put a logo all 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.660
 best says when we receive 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.500
 notification us that I wanted you 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.290
 say when we receive a notification 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.240
 she vibrates it's a little bottle 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.540
 seems to manage or if you 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.030
 activate or not so if we disable games 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:32.510
 wii she had much to vibrate and there 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.860
 a little logo right here and there they tell us 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.200
 say we need to be sponsored with our 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.520
 phone only if I reactivate the back 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.120
 normally she should on sponsor 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.120
 automatically 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.580
 that's smart all we were 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.660
 so that's why you recommend 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.310
 cowardly oath he finally shows uti 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.870
 useful in life a bit original we're going 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.970
 to say because I played few people and 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.190
 demonstrate like that and frankly she 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.759
 is not bad so we can manage his 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.050
 calls and everything 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.610
 call gresset listen to music 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.220
 finally launch a 60 music is good and 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.110
 everything to see the missed calls the 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.280
 what google directories google and where 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.229
 we must use all of them 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.120
 your phone 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.800
 here is one to come back so it's in 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.889
 an application 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:33.820
 we talk mostly where we finally double 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:35.440
 click like that so thank you for having 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.669
 kept my video I hope you have more 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.669
