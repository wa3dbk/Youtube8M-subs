00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:14.769 
our and for CES 2012 we're demoing our

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.980 
our and for CES 2012 we're demoing our
feature<00:00:15.010> system<00:00:15.580> this<00:00:15.879> is<00:00:16.059> the<00:00:16.090> black<00:00:16.420> mamba

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
feature system this is the black mamba

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.010 
feature system this is the black mamba
from<00:00:17.529> the<00:00:17.710> Fang<00:00:17.949> 3<00:00:18.279> series<00:00:18.669> so<00:00:19.360> one<00:00:19.779> of<00:00:19.900> the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
from the Fang 3 series so one of the

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.230 
from the Fang 3 series so one of the
most<00:00:20.259> unique<00:00:20.650> thing<00:00:21.070> about<00:00:21.310> this<00:00:21.550> whole

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
most unique thing about this whole

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.029 
most unique thing about this whole
system<00:00:22.509> is<00:00:22.810> that<00:00:22.960> it's<00:00:23.140> actually<00:00:23.289> two<00:00:23.710> and<00:00:23.860> one

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
system is that it's actually two and one

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.790 
system is that it's actually two and one
on<00:00:24.669> the<00:00:24.820> top<00:00:25.000> you<00:00:25.180> have<00:00:25.300> a<00:00:25.329> home<00:00:25.689> server<00:00:26.110> that's

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
on the top you have a home server that's

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.759 
on the top you have a home server that's
running<00:00:26.920> a<00:00:27.220> mini<00:00:27.699> ITX<00:00:27.990> z68<00:00:28.990> chipset

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
running a mini ITX z68 chipset

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.910 
running a mini ITX z68 chipset
motherboard<00:00:30.550> for<00:00:31.119> the<00:00:31.269> 2500<00:00:31.990> K<00:00:32.199> so<00:00:32.890> basically

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
motherboard for the 2500 K so basically

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.400 
motherboard for the 2500 K so basically
with<00:00:33.730> that<00:00:33.760> you<00:00:34.089> can<00:00:34.300> connect<00:00:34.930> up<00:00:35.050> to<00:00:35.199> five

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
with that you can connect up to five

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.390 
with that you can connect up to five
systems<00:00:35.860> remotely<00:00:37.320> all<00:00:38.320> your<00:00:38.559> home<00:00:38.710> systems

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
systems remotely all your home systems

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.350 
systems remotely all your home systems
can<00:00:39.580> connect<00:00:39.879> to<00:00:40.000> it<00:00:40.030> share<00:00:40.480> files<00:00:42.149> backed<00:00:43.149> up

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
can connect to it share files backed up

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.529 
can connect to it share files backed up
and<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.739> can<00:00:44.890> actually<00:00:45.039> even<00:00:45.219> use<00:00:45.430> this<00:00:45.760> top

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
and you can actually even use this top

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.840 
and you can actually even use this top
system<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.230> do<00:00:47.530> overclocking<00:00:48.280> for<00:00:48.489> our<00:00:48.640> bottom

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
system to do overclocking for our bottom

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.060 
system to do overclocking for our bottom
system<00:00:49.360> here<00:00:49.570> and<00:00:49.750> I<00:00:50.199> mean<00:00:50.350> lift<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.649> top<00:00:50.860> to

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
system here and I mean lift the top to

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.670 
system here and I mean lift the top to
show<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.309> what<00:00:52.270> we<00:00:52.360> have<00:00:52.510> going<00:00:52.750> down<00:00:53.050> here<00:00:53.289> so

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
show you what we have going down here so

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.770 
show you what we have going down here so
this<00:00:54.070> is<00:00:54.250> running<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.730> latest<00:00:54.760> Intel<00:00:55.539> Sandy

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
this is running the latest Intel Sandy

motherboard<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:06.009> we<00:01:06.100> got<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.280> dual<00:01:06.610> five<00:01:06.850> 90s<00:01:07.330> in

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
motherboard so we got a dual five 90s in

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.210 
motherboard so we got a dual five 90s in
Quad<00:01:08.289> SLI<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:09.460> also<00:01:09.610> have<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:09.910> optional

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
Quad SLI we also have a optional

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.010 
Quad SLI we also have a optional
250-milliliter<00:01:12.220> radiator<00:01:13.179> or<00:01:13.450> reservoir

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
250-milliliter radiator or reservoir

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.649 
250-milliliter radiator or reservoir
sorry<00:01:14.410> yeah

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
sorry yeah

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.780 
sorry yeah
liquid<00:01:16.659> cooled<00:01:17.220> completely<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:19.390> have<00:01:19.770> 480

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
liquid cooled completely we have 480

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.870 
liquid cooled completely we have 480
radiator<00:01:21.790> jump<00:01:22.270> back<00:01:22.540> up<00:01:22.869> here<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.700> main

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
radiator jump back up here for the main

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.870 
radiator jump back up here for the main
system<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.570> then<00:01:26.170> we<00:01:26.320> also<00:01:26.520> ran<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.700> to

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
system and then we also ran it to

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.899 
system and then we also ran it to
another<00:01:28.750> 120<00:01:29.590> down<00:01:29.770> at<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:29.979> bottom<00:01:30.159> to<00:01:30.759> go

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
another 120 down at the bottom to go

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.580 
another 120 down at the bottom to go
through<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.270> video<00:01:31.390> cards<00:01:31.990> it's<00:01:32.290> nice<00:01:32.409> and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
through the video cards it's nice and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.170 
through the video cards it's nice and
silent<00:01:32.979> -<00:01:33.130> yes<00:01:33.700> absolutely<00:01:34.210> so<00:01:35.939> both<00:01:36.939> of<00:01:36.970> these

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
silent - yes absolutely so both of these

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.330 
silent - yes absolutely so both of these
systems<00:01:37.420> are<00:01:37.750> independent<00:01:38.380> so<00:01:38.530> if<00:01:38.950> you<00:01:39.130> don't

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
systems are independent so if you don't

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.609 
systems are independent so if you don't
need<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.970> have<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.630> bottom<00:01:40.930> system<00:01:41.320> running

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
need to have the bottom system running

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.499 
need to have the bottom system running
if<00:01:41.799> you're<00:01:41.979> not<00:01:42.100> gaming<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.579> can<00:01:42.759> just<00:01:43.060> shut

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
if you're not gaming you can just shut

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.230 
if you're not gaming you can just shut
that<00:01:43.630> down<00:01:43.890> there's<00:01:44.890> two<00:01:45.100> separate<00:01:45.520> power<00:01:45.820> and

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
that down there's two separate power and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.630 
that down there's two separate power and
reset<00:01:46.600> switches<00:01:47.049> for<00:01:47.619> both<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.159> top<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.399> the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
reset switches for both the top and the

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.649 
reset switches for both the top and the
bottom<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.649> flap<00:01:50.890> angry<00:01:51.759> black<00:01:52.119> mamba<00:01:52.509> is

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
bottom so the flap angry black mamba is
