 h under games is starting but one 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.140
 checkpoint daily news video here 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.970
 no bjc cito has not yet registered with 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.590
 click on the top or bottom 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.990
 to know everything about the world of 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.660
 games but not how a cofounder wins 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.460
 sledgehammer games and he spoke in a 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.140
 that the company is not the type 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.779
 that shows within a game not 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.570
 perceive super hair and then deliver 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.220
 it ready well below expectations 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.930
 in fact what he means was that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.390
 when the company shows the trailer of 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.920
 some game is exactly as it is 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.140
 It'll be when it's released. 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.260
 or players will not have surprises 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.000
 bad as it sometimes happens 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.890
 the developer also said that the new 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.320
 car sank and will have very 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.200
 more detailed than the last game of the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.030
 series released for xbox one and will have a 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.500
 larger screen resolution 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.239
 thanks to the time of 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.440
 development that the team had to 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.899
 prepare the game 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.550
 creative director of par 4 alex 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.980
 hutchinson participated in a podcast 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.890
 ended up revealing several things about the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.510
 new series game comes on that appears 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.519
 with the greatest game will have practically the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.369
 same size as the previous game but this 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.869
 containing one more left-hander over the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.549
 He commented that it will be necessary to 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.680
 bring oxygen to the mountains more 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.939
 regions and that these regions will 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.770
 avalanches 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.030
 but they can not always be created 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.830
 by the players 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.900
 now it will also be possible to shoot 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.180
 grenades into the cars through 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.330
 windows and a fire system that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.850
 spreads continues in the title to 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.770
 4 will also have multiple endings but 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.799
 choose between them should be much more 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.930
 complex of what will make cry 3 crossing and 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.970
 ubisoft believes that more and more 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.530
 people are accepting content from 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.450
 digital form 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.340
 it will look like I think I can say 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.159
 that most games prefer anyway is 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.530
 the physical version of your games is not in the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.329
 However, it does not clarify that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.549
 at least that's what he thinks he used 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.920
 as an example the extra features packages 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.080
 including four cases that do not 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.670
 had been there 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.460
 the public seems to have accepted 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.400
 super well beyond that must be decision 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.710
 well-accepted models and 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.840
 shows a certain evolution of service 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.740
 but then what you prefer physical media 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.540
 digital 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.610
 yesterday we know you own it 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.950
 fmi morpheus because it is without glasses 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.500
 virtual reality of the sony that walks half 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.250
 shy and not showing up much at fairs 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.750
 such 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.820
 just stay connected because the company has 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.640
 invested more and more the product 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.170
 the interview is the only band in july raul 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.020
 said the company is placing 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.330
 significant investments in the product 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.030
 and that they intend to reach the point of 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.800
 to bring a magical census something that deceives 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.410
 our brains to think that 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.209
 really is in that place of the game 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.620
 people I remember I did not have to bridge 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.450
 we said that there in japan the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.910
 happy mclanche toys on the dolls 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.560
 and it is as if it was not enough to 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.209
 people die of envy that these 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.020
 correct toy the question was not 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.209
 happy

 anything barbie or if it goes the best 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.269
 Since we're talking about dolls 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.010
 good news is that it comes 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.860
 it seems that Sony wants to invest in 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.959
