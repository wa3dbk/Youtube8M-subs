00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.710
 pasta micelli di gragnano that are more 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.829

 for people we prepare 200 heads of 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:45.410
 walls then we will need dry red wine 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:49.310
 two glasses for the decision then 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.420
 unique certifies the triplets of oil 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:57.310
 extra virgin olive oil then a head 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.899

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.590
 don't worry kilari will go 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.449
 applied and once opened, do it again 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.619
 of lakes greater than this destiny 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:14.229

 chopped parsley and garlic 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:48.310
 I helped myself from the curtains 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:52.280
 the author promised an oil spin separately 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:57.320
 to help amalgamate and then 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.509
 reported a rarer Sicilian thousand 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.039
