00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.260
 my mind 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.420
 hello how 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.790

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:18.369
 early hour 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.189
 also in the thermometers will continue well megapresa sides of the afternoon of 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.619
 30 and 34 degrees in addition to the partly cloudy sky even though 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.199
 still holds is that if the man mind cleared in some sectors the 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.020
 new españa appears suddenly it is not and of course it is accompanied merad 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.260
 of 7 10% the winds for the moment in calm of 9 to 10 kilometers per hour and 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.269
 the pressure - you have to remind them 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.120
 that the winds are expected to increase here in the next few hours 

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:50.280
 in the north-east section so you do not want to rule out 30 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.899
 35 kilometers to be here you manifest in the next few hours and 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.829
 not to say that I did not warn you the maximum thermometers will be from 35 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.039
 37 the minimum with asilar from 22 to 23 'and you know the sky partially 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:08.939
 cloudy has cleared what we will have as main news for the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.080
 next hours and in the heat wave in most of the national territory 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.399
 generating blinds mostly cleared apart from that it is expected that 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.200
 enter or face cold in the region i generating and increasing winds of 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.970
 Cloudy in some sectors, especially precipitation 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.010
 d noguera nothing strong intensity is expected to really be at the strong 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.130
 For the Yucatan Peninsula Campeche, Oaxaca pairs sectors 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.920
 that can put us to increase the wind have surf swell and also 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.350
 the humidity of the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico to continue interacting 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.420
 and generating 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.729
 for those changes were still so unstable in the atmosphere for the 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.490
 next days because not all of them stop nearby towns and that 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.579
 our region the maxims will be 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.859
 from 32 to 34 were so minimal from 14 to 15 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.880
 moving quickly to the sectors of saltillo monterrey and durango 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.700
 here the maximum factors pay close attention 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.030
 will be present of the 34 and 36 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.860
 the negligible minima of the 13 to the 25 'of how they can see the clouds 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.569
 and clear will prevail over the course of the day tie what remains of 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.830
 the week remember that he called santa of it and does not mean that I've 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.890

 ranging from 28 to 35 years the minimum and five minimum 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.779
 they are oscillating from 14 to 23 and to give an idea 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.989
 of how the weather is going to have clouds and clear increase of winds 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.519
 much humidity that will be generating pairs next days the next 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.729
 hours and especially because they have not completed the cold fronts they 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:51.519
 remember that a few days ago starting the week begins the season of 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.829
 hurricanes that the modems that some call in tigers will be us 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.239
 affecting the country so there is that jalapa house living ar many 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.599
 people walking wells since yesterday that theoretical the moon then take advantage 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.209
 because I always feel full moon phase denomination so I can appreciate the 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.719
 nose cut it and especially take advantage of this Monday in other arms farms 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.840
 more in more detail I like that I want to say that I have an excellent day 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.199
 the catwalk better and especially on your part to quito 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.399
 dead 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.569
 chants 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.059
 in a world for a goal 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.279
 Andean 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.279
 a world 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.959
 so that eta has not changed anything else we have closed until tomorrow 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.870
 condemnation for traffic information while we have 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.199
 another habitual way 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.539
 from 23 to 24 degrees and we have also shared to the maximum for the next 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:54.669

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:55.880
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.170
 and the pressure is increasing that the third with expedia we have the apache 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.130
 cloudy weather and for the next few days expect the similar forecast although 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.970
 the afternoon hours clear this weather because we are going to have all very much 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.250
 heat due to the heat wave that is most of the territory 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.310
 national leaving maximum thermometers from 35 to 37 the minimum 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.930
 to follow from the 22 to the 23 that franco are not clear and they go 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.600
 taking advantage of that we have a very nice area and that is going to stay still is 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.180
 make a dent in the backwater 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.330

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.580
 over the next days a lot of heat and also taking advantage of it 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.259
