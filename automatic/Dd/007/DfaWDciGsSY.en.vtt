00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.600
 cool excuse here is very noisy it 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.400
 guys often say to me, and I can not 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.470
 meet girls in the subway I say 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.020
 why because well there it is very noisy 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.029
 I have to, I am glad in your ear and that is 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.750
 when you talk with friends with 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.939
 you in the subway 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.130
 you are not like a guy that you marish on 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.980
 ear and they do not seem to beat you in the head 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.720
 hearing belt in my ear we are not in the subway boom 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
 we are talking only in the street 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.809
 or only in a room where there is no noise 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.440
 but this is in my opinion stupid and ridiculous therefore 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.210
 simply 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.980
 This excuse that arises if you 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.200
 afraid to approach a girl is just in the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.879
 the head is what you 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.360
 just afraid to come up and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.460
 make the first step it will disappear only 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.170
 then when you start pumping your 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.469
 personality and just start finally 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.500
 meet girls she is in headphones 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.210
 what does she do with headphones 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.729
 the simplest is just fit and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.550
 say and hello there starting with her 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.890
 meet she sees that you are someone 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.979
 you say she takes out the headphone game 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.569
 what did you say i think you don't me 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.470
 break off just repeat the same thing 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:21.800
 how could it be a little problem yet 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.810
 tell while you look cool 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.700
 believe me that she is not stupid to understand 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.500
 from and create don't want to pull your 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.840
 headphones but in general can be so 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.429
 her headphones in order to not know on 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.119
 the street is cold and back and nods to 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.979
 wind nedu don't just try it 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.789
 the most important thing here which 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.509
 looks like excuses 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.679
 don't try for a girl to predict her 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.709
 actions don't try 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:52.679
 think for her her life is just home 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:55.259
 the thing is just action just action 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.599
 you come and meet and spit 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.620
 you on all these things and we are all the most 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.130
 from disguise 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.130
 price too 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.550
