00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.900
 or the first thing we see here is like a 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.419
 club thing lying 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.340

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.300

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.430
 product for mom nintendo point is 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.770
 for returns against the first place 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.110
 with the server first 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.110
 of this bag contains the pigment 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.180
 yellow 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.740
 the presentation is pretty good maybe 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.740
 more to which the film appears 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.200
 here we have the yellow 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.460
 I knew that going to be complicated and has 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.460
 brought some scissors 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.180
 because we achieve this yellow pigment 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.659
 it's pretty cool details is 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.210
 fairly good 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.299
 and curious curiosity 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.110
 but here I do not know if you can see it if 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.110
 focus the camera 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.790
 nintendo 2009 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.659
 curious this is possible that they are 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.899
 planning a planned picnic for the wii 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.800
 or simply they did in 2009 but 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:57.220
 it's funny that the label puts 2009 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.980
 things we'll see what's in the other 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.180
 bag I guess there will be those left 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.180
 red and blue 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.780
 now break this 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.010
 here we come 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.200
 exactly the same from the nintendo club 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.920
 so we have here first blue is left 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.090
 pretty much balls and you can see the face 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.090
 pretty pretty 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.410
 and the red crime already having done all the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.140
 collection of the 3 basic kevin with 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.170
 this club nintendo with this the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.599
 stars were expensive two thousand each 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.590
 you can imagine the stars that 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.920
 I could get to have 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.080
 and on top of that I also bought good 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.510
 acquired with the stars and nintendo 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.220
 the 3ds game separator from 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.349
 supermario that if that note that I 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.349
 come this 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.870
 to see an opening down here for 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.260
 open it easily I just went up 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:18.110
 since we have the red pigment 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.909
 of profile guayana narigudos ya saberÃ©is 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.640
 this one that does not affect the fire and that 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.150
 fight you do not see psychology so green 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.150
 I like a lot 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.769
 and we go with the blue 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:42.200
 I mean, they 're big, I do not know if they're both 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.890
 the same size are more or less 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.160
 Same size 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.860
 but after him we also thought he was going to 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.530
 be smaller but as you can see the 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:57.090
 size is pretty good so nothing 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.880
 here we have this entourage of picnics the 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.010
 yellow the red and the blue so if 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.660
 you want to make an idea of what it 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.670
 here you have this a boxing so now 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.590
 you know life favorites comments and we 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.040
