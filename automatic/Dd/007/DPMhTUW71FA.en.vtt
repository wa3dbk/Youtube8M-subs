 hi there, tungsten is the first 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:18.840
 Yaroslavl videobloger today decided 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:24.039
 fish fry here it is beautiful roach 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.610
 from the Rybinsk reservoir at first 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.190
 thought 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.330
 pan to lie but pan 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.990
 ceramic 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:36.489
 here he burns everything on her already 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.649
 this usa on i cut and then i too 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.550
 in mine too here on the baking sheet and 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:47.229
 on it also it turned out to throw such 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:51.059
 tasty and crispy in general very good 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:55.499
 the fish but the truth is a little bit burnt but 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:59.579
 Now I think nothing exactly will burn 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:01.510
 on a baking sheet in special such paper 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:08.100
 for baking 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.100
 and below there is a foil such a sandwich now 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.210
 nothing napkins 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.210
 take 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:43.840
 need to salt the most important thing not 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:48.310
 go too far a little bit and tap here 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.159
 there is caviar too on fry call 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.289
 it's better it was any 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:02:00.239
 the red screen is extremely be salmon it 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.239
 well, what really is 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:15.930
 chicken to the heart and still on top olive 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.510
 I do not eat everything completely with oil 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.530
 ready to go to 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.250
 oven temperature here p then 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.340
 degrees set I'm still convection 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:38.670
 included the amount on so under the juice so 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:43.760
 dry for about 20 minutes I will probably have a few 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.760
 look out the window so as not to burn 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:54.959
 the pan also came in handy and 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:03:00.799
 such is the fish we got and caviar 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.799
 heard try crust 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:15.570
 test roe 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:15.570
 cult body with her drink smartly 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.400
 crust 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.400
 That fish itself 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:33.030
 nothing burnt hot show like this 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.030
 as if on 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:47.010
 steamed fish put on the taste very 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.010
 even tasty and 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.660
 at this time 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:00.420
 dress of bones a bit too much to be 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.520
