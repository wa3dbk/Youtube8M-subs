hi<00:00:00.269> this<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:00.930> Paul<00:00:01.230> Hamilton<00:00:01.879> lately<00:00:02.879> I've

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
hi this is Paul Hamilton lately I've

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.269 
hi this is Paul Hamilton lately I've
been<00:00:03.149> flying<00:00:03.449> all<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.780> fast<00:00:04.319> high-powered

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
been flying all the fast high-powered

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.169 
been flying all the fast high-powered
revos<00:00:05.879> Delta<00:00:06.600> jets<00:00:07.040> trikes<00:00:08.040> now<00:00:08.790> what<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.150> have

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
revos Delta jets trikes now what we have

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.089 
revos Delta jets trikes now what we have
here<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.050> super<00:00:11.040> slow<00:00:11.849> true<00:00:13.099> ultralight

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
here is a super slow true ultralight

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.180 
here is a super slow true ultralight
well<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.030> like<00:00:15.240> my<00:00:15.900> gallons<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.379> gas<00:00:16.560> single

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
well it's like my gallons of gas single

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.939 
well it's like my gallons of gas single
person<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.930> I<00:00:18.930> just<00:00:18.990> got<00:00:19.260> done<00:00:19.439> test<00:00:19.710> flying

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
person and I just got done test flying

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.310 
person and I just got done test flying
this<00:00:20.160> thing<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> what<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> joy<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.900> was<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
this thing what a what a joy it was to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.529 
this thing what a what a joy it was to
fly<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.010> super<00:00:23.519> slow<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.240> what<00:00:24.359> we're<00:00:24.449> going

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
fly it is super slow so what we're going

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.269 
fly it is super slow so what we're going
to<00:00:24.600> do<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.619> kind<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.980> really

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
to do is this is kind of a really

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.380 
to do is this is kind of a really
top-of-the-line

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
top-of-the-line

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.849 
top-of-the-line
ultra<00:00:27.810> light<00:00:27.960> we're<00:00:28.109> going<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.289> take<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> look

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
ultra light we're going to take a look

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.620 
ultra light we're going to take a look
at<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.340> some<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.910> details<00:00:30.330> and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
at this in some of the details and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.360 
at this in some of the details and
explain<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:31.980> makes<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.369> thing<00:00:32.579> special

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
explain what makes this thing special

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.260 
explain what makes this thing special
okay<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.460> we're<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> start<00:00:35.969> off<00:00:36.090> looking

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
okay so we're going to start off looking

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
okay so we're going to start off looking
at<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> wing<00:00:36.809> when<00:00:37.469> we've<00:00:37.620> got<00:00:37.829> here<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.399> a

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
at the wing when we've got here is a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.770 
at the wing when we've got here is a
well<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:40.440> call<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> 17<00:00:41.280> meter<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.660> it's

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
well they call it a 17 meter but it's

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.590 
well they call it a 17 meter but it's
really<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.020> 16<00:00:43.530> point<00:00:43.770> five<00:00:44.070> meter<00:00:44.460> wing<00:00:45.360> it's

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
really a 16 point five meter wing it's

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.760 
really a 16 point five meter wing it's
really<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> derivative<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.500> hang-glider

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
really a derivative of a hang-glider

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.549 
really a derivative of a hang-glider
wing<00:00:47.750> it's<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:48.960> made<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.320> quite

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
wing it's really made to be quite

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.200 
wing it's really made to be quite
efficient<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.280> has<00:00:50.399> actually<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
efficient now this has actually got a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.420 
efficient now this has actually got a
streamlined<00:00:52.610> struts<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.160> guess<00:00:56.309> if

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
streamlined struts here and I guess if

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.740 
streamlined struts here and I guess if
you<00:00:56.520> really<00:00:56.760> want<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.120> slow<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.420> could

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
you really want to go slow you could

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
you really want to go slow you could
give<00:00:58.199> us<00:00:58.320> some<00:00:58.350> more<00:00:58.559> drag<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:59.100> tend<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
give us some more drag these tend to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.430 
give us some more drag these tend to
when<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.640> was<00:00:59.760> test<00:01:00.420> flying<00:01:00.660> at<00:01:00.870> these<00:01:01.109> tend<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
when I was test flying at these tend to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.950 
when I was test flying at these tend to
kind<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.680> find<00:01:01.949> themselves<00:01:02.449> we've<00:01:03.449> also<00:01:03.629> got

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
kind of find themselves we've also got

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
kind of find themselves we've also got
on<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.379> which<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> typical<00:01:05.489> hang<00:01:05.700> glider

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
on this which is typical hang glider

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.940 
on this which is typical hang glider
wings<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.360> variable<00:01:06.689> geometry<00:01:06.890> we<00:01:07.890> pull<00:01:08.159> this

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
wings of variable geometry we pull this

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.090 
wings of variable geometry we pull this
and<00:01:10.950> what<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.549> does<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.830> stiffens<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and what it does is it stiffens up the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.440 
and what it does is it stiffens up the
wing<00:01:14.310> because<00:01:14.460> makes<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.030> bit<00:01:15.119> harder

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
wing because makes a little bit harder

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.440 
wing because makes a little bit harder
to<00:01:15.479> fly<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.590> that's<00:01:16.979> another<00:01:17.450> interesting

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
to fly but that's another interesting

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.539 
to fly but that's another interesting
derivative<00:01:19.170> that's<00:01:19.350> used<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.070> which<00:01:20.520> is

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
derivative that's used on this which is

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.830 
derivative that's used on this which is
typical<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:22.130> hang<00:01:23.130> gliding<00:01:23.369> wings<00:01:23.840> now

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
typical of the hang gliding wings now

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.289 
typical of the hang gliding wings now
for<00:01:25.590> some<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.890> real<00:01:26.070> interesting<00:01:26.729> meat<00:01:27.150> on

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
for some of the real interesting meat on

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.200 
for some of the real interesting meat on
this<00:01:27.420> thing<00:01:27.479> let's<00:01:27.840> look<00:01:28.020> at<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.259> engine

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
this thing let's look at this engine

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.850 
this thing let's look at this engine
okay<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.930> engine<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:33.170> fuel-injected

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.230 

four-stroke<00:01:39.380> engine<00:01:40.380> okay<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:41.939> see<00:01:42.060> we've

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
four-stroke engine okay we can see we've

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.800 
four-stroke engine okay we can see we've
got<00:01:42.360> our<00:01:42.420> water<00:01:42.689> cooler<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:44.630> we've<00:01:45.630> got

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
got our water cooler up here we've got

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.760 
got our water cooler up here we've got
our<00:01:45.990> oil<00:01:46.020> cooler<00:01:46.619> down<00:01:46.860> below<00:01:49.670> down<00:01:50.670> here<00:01:51.770> and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
our oil cooler down below down here and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.340 
our oil cooler down below down here and
it's<00:01:53.040> really<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.450> nice<00:01:54.450> little<00:01:54.720> engine<00:01:54.960> run

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
it's really a nice little engine run

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.520 
it's really a nice little engine run
smooth<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.659> we<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.079> got<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> belt

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
smooth and we can see it's got a belt

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.980 
smooth and we can see it's got a belt
drive<00:01:58.939> here<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.240> part<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.479> your<00:02:00.570> starter

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
drive here this is part of your starter

sounds<00:02:12.459> pretty<00:02:12.670> nice<00:02:12.819> too<00:02:13.090> when<00:02:13.239> it's<00:02:13.359> flying

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
sounds pretty nice too when it's flying

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.089 
sounds pretty nice too when it's flying
it<00:02:13.689> doesn't<00:02:13.930> have<00:02:14.019> that<00:02:14.049> two-stroke<00:02:14.829> pingy

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
it doesn't have that two-stroke pingy

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:26.759 
it doesn't have that two-stroke pingy
sound<00:02:19.889> nice<00:02:20.889> engine<00:02:21.459> here<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:26.019> here<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:26.620> have

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
sound nice engine here and here we have

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.069 
sound nice engine here and here we have
a<00:02:26.799> second<00:02:27.790> chance<00:02:27.900> ballistic<00:02:28.900> parachute

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
a second chance ballistic parachute

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.259 
a second chance ballistic parachute
system<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.430> an<00:02:30.579> air<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.000> actually

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
system this is an air so actually

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.640 
system this is an air so actually
nitrogen<00:02:31.689> system<00:02:32.049> high-pressure<00:02:32.409> nitrogen

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650

fires<00:02:33.340> out<00:02:33.609> instead<00:02:33.849> of<00:02:33.909> the<00:02:34.000> rocket<00:02:34.359> makes<00:02:35.109> it

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
fires out instead of the rocket makes it

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.589 
fires out instead of the rocket makes it
a<00:02:35.260> lot<00:02:35.379> easier<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.680> ship<00:02:36.359> it's<00:02:37.359> interesting

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
a lot easier to ship it's interesting

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.179 
a lot easier to ship it's interesting
this<00:02:37.900> takes<00:02:38.139> 12<00:02:38.439> volts<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.799> run<00:02:38.950> everything

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
this takes 12 volts to run everything

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.069 
this takes 12 volts to run everything
but<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:39.609> takes<00:02:39.760> 24<00:02:40.180> volts<00:02:40.510> for<00:02:40.629> a<00:02:40.689> starter<00:02:40.989> so

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
but it takes 24 volts for a starter so

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.289 
but it takes 24 volts for a starter so
we've<00:02:41.169> got<00:02:41.290> two<00:02:41.409> batteries<00:02:41.799> here<00:02:42.040> our<00:02:42.299> low
