so as you see here we have everything
we're<00:00:47.850> going<00:00:47.970> to<00:00:48.030> need<00:00:48.150> for<00:00:48.330> this<00:00:48.420> project<00:00:48.480> we

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
we're going to need for this project we

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.810 
we're going to need for this project we
have<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> bowl<00:00:49.440> stainless<00:00:50.040> steel<00:00:50.400> that<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
have a bowl stainless steel that the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.970 
have a bowl stainless steel that the
lagoon<00:00:51.150> nitrogen<00:00:51.540> will<00:00:51.720> not<00:00:51.870> freeze<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.950> death

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
lagoon nitrogen will not freeze to death

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.220 
lagoon nitrogen will not freeze to death
we<00:00:53.640> wouldn't<00:00:54.300> recommend<00:00:54.630> using<00:00:54.780> wood<00:00:55.080> or

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
we wouldn't recommend using wood or

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.560 
we wouldn't recommend using wood or
anything<00:00:55.470> like<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.650> we've<00:00:56.430> got<00:00:56.670> some<00:00:57.240> ice

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
anything like that we've got some ice

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.840 
anything like that we've got some ice
cream<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.080> got<00:00:58.200> vanilla<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.920> chocolate<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
cream and got vanilla and chocolate and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.570 
cream and got vanilla and chocolate and
then<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> marble<00:01:00.420> did<00:01:01.080> for<00:01:01.260> fun<00:01:01.380> and<00:01:01.650> they're

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
then a marble did for fun and they're

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.800 
then a marble did for fun and they're
melted<00:01:02.970> because<00:01:03.150> we<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> use<00:01:03.690> these

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
melted because we have to use these

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.080 
melted because we have to use these
strippers<00:01:04.050> so<00:01:04.530> drip<00:01:04.740> them<00:01:04.920> into<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.820> future

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
strippers so drip them into the future

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.800 
strippers so drip them into the future
the<00:01:06.330> quick<00:01:06.450> nitrogen<00:01:07.190> so<00:01:08.510> let's<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:09.660> started

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the quick nitrogen so let's get started

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.790 
the quick nitrogen so let's get started
shall<00:01:10.050> we<00:01:10.520> this<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.670> liquid<00:01:11.790> nitrogen<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.990> is

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
shall we this is liquid nitrogen it is

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.840 
shall we this is liquid nitrogen it is
really<00:01:14.580> cold<00:01:14.940> it<00:01:15.690> is<00:01:16.440> some<00:01:17.280> subliming

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
really cold it is some subliming

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.520 
really cold it is some subliming
immediately<00:01:18.450> after<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.930> open<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.229> because

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
immediately after you open it because

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.320 
immediately after you open it because
its<00:01:19.890> boiling<00:01:20.220> point<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:20.970> negative

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
its boiling point is actually negative

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.140 
its boiling point is actually negative
196<00:01:22.080> degrees<00:01:22.560> Celsius<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.610> beyond

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
196 degrees Celsius so it is beyond

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.050 
196 degrees Celsius so it is beyond
boiling<00:01:24.720> right<00:01:24.869> now<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.160> cool<00:01:26.400> part

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.480 

it<00:01:30.060> when<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.690> touches<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.050> air<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.650> turns<00:01:32.369> into

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
it when it touches the air it turns into

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.910 
it when it touches the air it turns into
gas<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.000> quickly<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.570> most<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.619> will<00:01:34.770> just

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
gas so quickly that most of it will just

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.260 
gas so quickly that most of it will just
evaporate<00:01:35.070> before<00:01:35.520> gets<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.940> bowl<00:01:36.090> so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
evaporate before gets in the bowl so

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.400 
evaporate before gets in the bowl so
have<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.450> pour<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> lot<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
have to pour a lot out to get in the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.370 
have to pour a lot out to get in the
bull<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.340> ready<00:01:38.490> yes<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.660> I'm<00:01:40.050> gonna<00:01:40.110> call

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
bull so ready yes one and I'm gonna call

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.630 
bull so ready yes one and I'm gonna call

can<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.490> looks<00:01:53.580> ridiculous<00:01:54.560> don't<00:01:55.560> touch

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
can see it looks ridiculous don't touch

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.110 
can see it looks ridiculous don't touch
it<00:01:56.750> if<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.840> look<00:01:58.020> closely<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.649> boiling

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.710 

that<00:02:04.120> is<00:02:04.270> liquid<00:02:04.540> nitrogen<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:06.390> now<00:02:07.390> with<00:02:07.600> our

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
that is liquid nitrogen and now with our

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.240 
that is liquid nitrogen and now with our
little<00:02:07.870> drippers<00:02:08.619> would<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.950> like<00:02:09.100> some

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
little drippers would you like some

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.270 
little drippers would you like some
goobers<00:02:09.520> Ava<00:02:09.700> would<00:02:10.540> you<00:02:10.600> like<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:11.040> we<00:02:12.040> can

goobers Ava would you like to we can

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.390 
goobers Ava would you like to we can
start<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:13.300> dripping<00:02:13.630> process<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:15.220> really

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
start the dripping process it's really

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.890 
start the dripping process it's really
cool<00:02:15.670> because<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:17.740> turns<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.340> immediately

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
cool because it turns it immediately

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.630 
cool because it turns it immediately
turns<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.260> just<00:02:20.740> freezes<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.250> second<00:02:21.580> it

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
turns it just freezes the second it

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:30.450 
turns it just freezes the second it
touches<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.390> surface<00:02:23.850> have<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.880> like<00:02:29.460> dippin
