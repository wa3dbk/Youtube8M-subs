when adjusting the rear ruckus break you

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.540 
when adjusting the rear ruckus break you
have<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.670> be<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.819> little<00:00:06.029> bit<00:00:06.120> careful<00:00:07.550> careful

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
have to be a little bit careful careful

have to be a little bit careful careful
ER<00:00:08.760> than<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.179> front<00:00:09.450> wheel<00:00:09.990> because<00:00:10.889> we're

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
ER than the front wheel because we're

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.650 
ER than the front wheel because we're
going<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.309> do<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.580> same<00:00:11.790> way<00:00:11.820> but<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.360> rear

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
going to do it the same way but the rear

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.519 
going to do it the same way but the rear
wheel<00:00:13.790> it<00:00:14.790> has<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.120> gears<00:00:15.719> going<00:00:15.990> through<00:00:16.410> it

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
wheel it has the gears going through it

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.470 
wheel it has the gears going through it
so<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.460> can<00:00:17.609> give<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.910> kind<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.210> false

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
so that can give you a kind of false

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.710 
so that can give you a kind of false
sense<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.580> what<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.730> tightened<00:00:21.180> what<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.480> not

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
sense of what is tightened what is not

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.660 
sense of what is tightened what is not
now<00:00:22.320> I've<00:00:22.590> tightened<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> wheel<00:00:23.279> all<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
now I've tightened the wheel all the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.480 
now I've tightened the wheel all the
weight<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:24.480> doesn't<00:00:24.810> move<00:00:24.960> now<00:00:25.949> come<00:00:26.160> up<00:00:26.250> here

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
weight or doesn't move now come up here

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.669 
weight or doesn't move now come up here
and<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.699> check<00:00:27.500> my<00:00:29.510> my<00:00:30.510> give<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.140> rear<00:00:31.380> brake

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
and I check my my give on my rear brake

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.180 
and I check my my give on my rear brake
and<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:33.149> where<00:00:36.770> you<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.100> it

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and you can see where you can see it

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.650 
and you can see where you can see it
doesn't<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.520> any<00:00:38.640> give<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.239> need<00:00:39.420> about

doesn't have any give you need about

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020 
doesn't have any give you need about
probably<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.110> about<00:00:40.200> an<00:00:40.379> inch<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.969> said

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
probably in about an inch so like I said

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.940 
probably in about an inch so like I said
the<00:00:42.300> best<00:00:42.450> way<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.710> do

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the best way to do this and you can do

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.920 
the best way to do this and you can do
it<00:00:44.070> by<00:00:46.340> practice<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.690> thing<00:00:48.809> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it by practice but the one thing you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.250 
it by practice but the one thing you
want<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.200> make<00:00:49.289> sure<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.870> err<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
want to make sure is that err on the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.990 
want to make sure is that err on the
side<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.559> caution<00:00:52.829> as<00:00:53.250> far<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> rear<00:00:53.820> wheel

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
side of caution as far as the rear wheel

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.139 
side of caution as far as the rear wheel
goes<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.780> locked<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.199> right<00:00:55.410> now<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.670> go

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
goes it's locked up right now so we go

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.799 
goes it's locked up right now so we go
down<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.920> adjuster<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.640> want<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.059> back

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
down to the adjuster and we want to back

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.039 
down to the adjuster and we want to back
it<00:01:01.020> off<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:02.280> where<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.390> break<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.840> not

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
it off to where the the break is not

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.570 
it off to where the the break is not
grabbing<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.100> rear<00:01:05.369> wheel<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:06.740> now<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.400> can

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
grabbing the rear wheel see now you can

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.030 
grabbing the rear wheel see now you can
hear<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.939> noise<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.350> rear<00:01:10.530> wheel<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
hear that noise of the rear wheel and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.020 
hear that noise of the rear wheel and
that's<00:01:11.970> sometimes<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.869> can't<00:01:14.030> disseminate

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
that's sometimes you can't disseminate

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.749 
that's sometimes you can't disseminate
between<00:01:15.479> uh<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.009> wheel<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.430> really

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
between uh if the wheel is really

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.210 
between uh if the wheel is really
spinning<00:01:18.150> freely<00:01:18.479> or<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.830> gears<00:01:23.100> are

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
spinning freely or if the the gears are

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.330 
spinning freely or if the the gears are
dragging<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.790> if<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.950> brake

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
dragging and if if you do have the brake

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.270 
dragging and if if you do have the brake
on<00:01:27.080> slightly<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.409> it'll<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.829> it'll<00:01:28.979> get

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
on slightly what it'll do is it'll get

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.859 
on slightly what it'll do is it'll get
this<00:01:29.460> really<00:01:29.850> hot<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> will<00:01:30.450> turn<00:01:30.600> them<00:01:30.720> blue

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
this really hot and will turn them blue

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.609 
this really hot and will turn them blue
hot<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:32.070> what<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> would<00:01:33.299> suggest<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.380> back

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
hot so what I would suggest is to back

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.010 
hot so what I would suggest is to back
it<00:01:34.829> off<00:01:34.950> two<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:35.790> three<00:01:37.310> um<00:01:38.720> two<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:39.840> three

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it off two or three um two or three

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.170 
it off two or three um two or three
clicks<00:01:40.290> two<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.369> three<00:01:41.520> turns<00:01:41.790> where<00:01:41.970> you

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
clicks two or three turns where you

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.389 
clicks two or three turns where you
think<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.140> then<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.070> come<00:01:44.220> up

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
think you have it and then to come up

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.700 
think you have it and then to come up
here<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:45.840> by<00:01:45.960> practice<00:01:46.500> you

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
here this is this is all by practice you

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.710 
here this is this is all by practice you
know<00:01:46.829> trial<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.430> error<00:01:47.490> come<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.630> your

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
know trial and error come up to your

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.429 
know trial and error come up to your
break<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.320> start<00:01:49.890> pulling<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.259> if<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
break and start pulling on it and if you

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.980 
break and start pulling on it and if you
think<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:53.070> your<00:01:53.909> break<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.329> too<00:01:54.509> tight<00:01:54.810> up

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
think that your break is too tight up

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.850 
think that your break is too tight up
here<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:55.969> that<00:01:56.969> um<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:58.170> break<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.590> grabbing

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
here or that um the break is grabbing

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.709 
here or that um the break is grabbing
too<00:01:59.219> easily<00:01:59.840> then<00:02:00.840> come<00:02:01.229> back<00:02:01.259> down<00:02:02.719> because

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
too easily then come back down because

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.510 
too easily then come back down because
the<00:02:03.840> break<00:02:04.020> still<00:02:04.320> may<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.310> back

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the break still may be on on the back

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.249 
the break still may be on on the back
this<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.060> only<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.659> back<00:02:06.810> wheel<00:02:07.020> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
this is the only on the back wheel and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.300 
this is the only on the back wheel and
back<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.009> off<00:02:08.129> another<00:02:08.429> couple<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.879> turns

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.420 

okay<00:02:12.180> because<00:02:12.810> your<00:02:13.410> wheel<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.920> going<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.160> it's

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
okay because your wheel is going to it's

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.100 
okay because your wheel is going to it's
going<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.640> drag<00:02:14.940> because<00:02:15.150> it's<00:02:15.450> dragging<00:02:15.900> on

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
going to drag because it's dragging on

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.260 
going to drag because it's dragging on
the<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.760> rear<00:02:19.670> transmission<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.030> belt

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
the the rear transmission and the belt

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.809 
the the rear transmission and the belt
and<00:02:21.599> everything<00:02:21.930> else<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:23.130> then<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.430> come<00:02:23.610> up

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
and everything else so then we come up

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.000 
and everything else so then we come up
and<00:02:24.800> we<00:02:25.800> check<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:27.019> we<00:02:28.019> check<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.410> again<00:02:28.769> and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
and we check the we check this again and

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.949 
and we check the we check this again and
this<00:02:29.069> isn't<00:02:29.370> bad<00:02:29.580> see<00:02:30.420> I've<00:02:30.540> got<00:02:30.569> about<00:02:30.810> an

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
this isn't bad see I've got about an

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.170 
this isn't bad see I've got about an
inch<00:02:31.080> inch-and-a-half<00:02:31.620> pull<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.910> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
inch inch-and-a-half pull on that and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.580 
inch inch-and-a-half pull on that and
then<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.690> may<00:02:33.810> want<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.080> go<00:02:34.230> over<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.500> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
then you may want to go over to the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.050 
then you may want to go over to the
other<00:02:34.769> side<00:02:35.069> we<00:02:35.340> know<00:02:35.519> we<00:02:35.670> have<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.880> front

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
other side we know we have the front

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.900 
other side we know we have the front
wheel<00:02:36.269> adjusted<00:02:36.780> pretty<00:02:37.440> good<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:38.610> want

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
wheel adjusted pretty good so you want

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.180 
wheel adjusted pretty good so you want
to<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.300> want<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.540> pull<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:40.080> your<00:02:40.680> front<00:02:40.980> brake

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
to you want to pull on your front brake

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.820 
to you want to pull on your front brake
and<00:02:41.550> see<00:02:42.300> if<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.630> if<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.230> have<00:02:43.590> enough

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
and see if it's if you have enough

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.380 
and see if it's if you have enough
clearance<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:45.319> leeway<00:02:46.319> or<00:02:46.530> margin<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.459> dead

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
clearance and leeway or margin of dead

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.490 
clearance and leeway or margin of dead
space<00:02:48.769> margin<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:49.890> dead<00:02:50.100> space<00:02:51.470> would<00:02:52.470> be

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
space margin of dead space would be

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.990 
space margin of dead space would be
about<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:52.950> don't<00:02:53.100> know<00:02:53.160> well<00:02:53.549> inch<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.940> half

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
about I don't know well inch and a half

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.479 
about I don't know well inch and a half
maybe<00:02:54.420> more<00:02:55.140> depending<00:02:56.010> on<00:02:56.130> your<00:02:56.250> riding

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
maybe more depending on your riding

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.030 
maybe more depending on your riding
style<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:57.750> trick<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.440> do<00:02:58.560> not<00:02:58.739> want

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
style the trick is that you do not want

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.100 
style the trick is that you do not want
to<00:02:59.099> have<00:02:59.220> your<00:02:59.370> brakes<00:02:59.640> on<00:02:59.849> because<00:03:00.810> your<00:03:00.959> bike

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
to have your brakes on because your bike

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.009 
to have your brakes on because your bike
will<00:03:01.410> run<00:03:01.709> with<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.010> brakes<00:03:02.250> on<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.840> only

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
will run with the brakes on the only

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.220 
will run with the brakes on the only
problem<00:03:04.349> is<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.470> those<00:03:05.750> brake<00:03:06.750> pads<00:03:06.989> will

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
problem is that those brake pads will

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.330 
problem is that those brake pads will
heat<00:03:07.560> up<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.310> they<00:03:09.299> will<00:03:09.720> up<00:03:09.900> your<00:03:10.049> wheel

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
heat up and they will up your wheel

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.400 
heat up and they will up your wheel
basically<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.330> what<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.540> do<00:03:12.599> is<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.900> try<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.260> get

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
basically so what I do is I try and get

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.710 
basically so what I do is I try and get
I<00:03:13.650> know<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.670> front<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.120> adjusted<00:03:15.690> to

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
I know that the front is adjusted to

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.569 
I know that the front is adjusted to
where<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:15.959> want<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.620> know<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.280> could

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
where I want it so I know that I could

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.240 
where I want it so I know that I could
pull<00:03:17.820> on<00:03:17.970> this<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.540> get<00:03:18.780> maybe<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.350> don't

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
pull on this and I get maybe I don't

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.160 
pull on this and I get maybe I don't
know<00:03:20.400> it's<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.850> half<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.540> don't<00:03:21.780> know<00:03:21.870> how<00:03:21.989> many

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
know it's a half I don't know how many

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.420 
know it's a half I don't know how many
meters<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:25.109> metrics<00:03:26.010> all<00:03:26.190> Greek<00:03:26.400> to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
meters that is the metrics all Greek to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.160 
meters that is the metrics all Greek to
me<00:03:28.100> so<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.250> kind<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.519> feels<00:03:29.940> right<00:03:30.209> right

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
me so that kind of feels right right

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.530 
me so that kind of feels right right
about<00:03:31.319> there<00:03:31.560> on<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.700> front<00:03:32.850> so<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.180> know<00:03:33.299> it's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
about there on the front so I know it's

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.449 
about there on the front so I know it's
adjusted<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.440> I'm<00:03:34.560> just<00:03:34.769> going<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.160> kind<00:03:35.370> of

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
adjusted so I'm just going to kind of

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.170 
adjusted so I'm just going to kind of
get<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.329> rear<00:03:36.600> rear<00:03:37.170> wheel<00:03:37.530> close<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.340> then

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
get the rear rear wheel close and then

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.120 
get the rear rear wheel close and then
start<00:03:39.630> pulling<00:03:40.049> on<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:41.510> on<00:03:42.510> this<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.799> now

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
start pulling on the on this and now

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.039 
start pulling on the on this and now
that<00:03:44.400> looks<00:03:44.609> close<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.209> even<00:03:45.810> if<00:03:45.900> you're<00:03:46.019> not

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
that looks close and even if you're not

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.949 
that looks close and even if you're not

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
sure and go back and back it off another

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.590 
sure and go back and back it off another
turn<00:03:49.609> you<00:03:50.609> can<00:03:50.790> always<00:03:50.910> tighten<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.420> back<00:03:51.450> up

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
turn you can always tighten it back up

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.849 
turn you can always tighten it back up
so<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.500> back<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:52.889> off<00:03:53.150> one<00:03:54.150> turn<00:03:54.530> what<00:03:55.530> that'll

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
so you back it off one turn what that'll

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.379 
so you back it off one turn what that'll
do<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:58.519> make<00:03:59.519> sure<00:03:59.549> your<00:03:59.910> break<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.209> not
