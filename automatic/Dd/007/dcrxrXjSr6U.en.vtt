00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 how often do you need 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.879
 beautifully put my hair specifically for me 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.250
 this happens every time i 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.290
 I am trying to shoot a new video but I am constantly 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.360
 confused what to use wax 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.389
 or varnish is not in principle similar means 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.890
 but they are somehow different 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.470
 Today we will know the main difference of wax 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.240
 From varnish than from these means better 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.350
 hair styling and also at the end 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.949
 release I will tell you how you can 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.300

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.810
 let's start a little story 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.310
 stylish hairstyles appeared on the very 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.420
 when they appeared 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.430
 primitive people 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.080
 there is such a stereotype that they are all before 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.970
 walked such shaggy with long 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.680
 unwashed hair like a bass player from 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.040
 Metals in fact it is not 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.690
 primitive people even they were already courting 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.230
 they made stylish hair 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.510
 hairstyles for long centuries 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.019
 abyss of hair and waged a merciless war 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.550
 with his neighbors who have long been 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:14.080
 known shampoo secret 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:16.000
 [music] 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.800
 further go the Egyptians who in contrast 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.930
 from primitive people who did 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.700
 hairstyles for convenience began to make them 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.820
 to show your social status 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.950
 well and also for convenience because in 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.540
 Egypt hot and men used 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.390
 the most popular hairstyle is not easy 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.610
 shaved off everything bald and then if needed 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.500
 it was worn in the same way and 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.110
 most of the population of egypt were all 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.500
 bald and only on holidays whether hidden 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.420
 triumph they wore hair wigs and 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.030
 namely stylish hairstyles could wear 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.400
 only pharaohs king emperor and others 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.180
 status people and they wore mostly 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.000
 hairstyles such straight forms say 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.560
 so not quite familiar to ours 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.110
 time hairstyles but then it was 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.850
 status on cool fashionable youth on 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.310
 primitive times passed with them 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.010
 gone status hair now hair on 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.020
 head wear only for beauty on to 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.910
 it looked beautiful they needed right 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.500
 lay and what is better to do 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.840
 waxed or lacquered 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.970
 the wax looks like this usually he cans 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.340
 here so we unscrew and that's where mickey and 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.890
 bee and with other various additives 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.410
 also there are with different flavors but 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.880
 we don't need it right but for what 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.950
 only our last hair is not needed 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.750
 it smelled like there were sparkles 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.300
 The main task of wax is 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.489
 just to put the hair and curl 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.230
 them in the right direction 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.750
 make much more difficult and restored 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.640
 used to fix already finished 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.800
 hairstyles so if normal hair growth 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.280
 you do not suit you need to use 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.720
 wax for example like mine like this 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.640
 my hair looks like if with her 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.560
 absolutely nothing to do nothing 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.790
 lay and me it is absolutely not 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.340
 arranges to fix it 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.070
 need to use wax because 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.200
 it is he who sets the direction which 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.690
 your hair will curl 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.239
 the most important thing is when you ask wax 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.310
 you need to take about as much 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.390
 more because otherwise the hair will 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.519
 seem fat 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.040
 well or wet but now begins 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.040
 magic you need to take our brains and grind 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.890
 attacks on the palm and then just take and 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.000
 here such movements to put our 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.860
 hairstyle but now but its perfect 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.110
 another thing is simpler to say if you 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.300
 I like your hair 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.250
 standard hairstyles first use 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.620
 wax to deliver them to you since 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.860
 like alac uses to 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.060
 fix the result 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.190
 easier to say to your hair 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.170
 in the wind not disheveled but now 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.480
 let's see what happens if we take 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.150
 wax a lot more in the first place by 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.460
 it feels a little bit different 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.950
 so slimy nasty and when we 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.900
 begin to rub your hair for sure 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.850
 see what remains so white here 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.150
 traces of wax itself and hair 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.080
 stick together and starts to look 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.170
 social 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.430
 they become naughty and generally 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.739
 it turns out actually 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.090
 some kind of garbage how can you say so in 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.520
 regards to resurrection you don't want to 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.400
 your hair was so wet 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.060
 Use just a little bit is not necessary 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.620
 overdid 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.419
 well now let's try to put 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.930
 hairstyle using only one 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.340
 varnish 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:27.100
 now i will click i have my hair in 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.580
 wax he fat nasty i can't 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.380
 click shorter but now we will try 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.770
 style your hair using one 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.450
 only 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.919
 lacquer but I think we have nothing 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.630
 It turns out because the varnish is usually 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.080
 used to fix 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.750
 ready hairstyle or support 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.460
 so to say in a classic manner 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.990
 hairstyle if everything suits you 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.760
 I don't want anything 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.030
 put roll on 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.180
 prettier for this varnish is needed first 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.780
 spray or some such 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.830
 movements you can try to lay everything 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.650
 Of course use a comb but there is 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.650
 One problem when working with varnish because 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.570
 this lacquering fixing effect through 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.070
 for a while it freezes and if 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.010
 try to stick a comb such 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.450
 hair firstly she will not che 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.940
 combing secondly she's just 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.050
 you will have hair 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.050
 [music] 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.110
 simply speaking if you tried 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.550
 put the hair lacquer and did not have time 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.930
 do it in five minutes and you have 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.600
 it turns out like this 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.580
 and you canâ€™t calculate it 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.919
 because the comb stupidly does not pass 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.680
 hands on actually too stuck and the 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.370
 there is fix it already only if again 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.370
 go and wash your hair 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.110
 so if you are not comfortable with your 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.330
 standard hairstyle you want to lay 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.970
 its somehow different then i recommend 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.400
 use you alac wax only 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.590
 to fix the effect but or if you 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.900
 want to wear a hair comb or 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.880
 some other thing then of course 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.800
 use varnish, use it a lot 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.380
 then you will surely be secure 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.620
 and I'm not sure what it will look like 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.090
 very normal but as you like well 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.490
