00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
composting a pot so that's not a problem

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.729

the problem what we've got here though

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.610 
the problem what we've got here though
is<00:00:38.100> even<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.730> south-facing<00:00:38.940> garden<00:00:39.620> fruits

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
is even as a south-facing garden fruits

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.440 
is even as a south-facing garden fruits
not<00:00:40.920> getting<00:00:41.309> enough<00:00:41.579> light<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.239> what<00:00:42.360> I've

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
not getting enough light so what I've

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.040 
not getting enough light so what I've
done<00:00:42.600> already<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.610> taking<00:00:44.610> off<00:00:44.730> some<00:00:45.690> leaves

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
done already is taking off some leaves

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.410 
done already is taking off some leaves
and<00:00:46.460> just<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:48.149> expose<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:50.610> fruit<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and just to expose the fruit and the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.069 
and just to expose the fruit and the
forming<00:00:51.870> through<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.440> more<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.300> always

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
forming through to more like so I always

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.810 
forming through to more like so I always
leave<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> ones<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> back<00:00:58.039> fence<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.699> this

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
leave the ones at the back fence to this

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
leave the ones at the back fence to this
side<00:01:00.090> generally<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> side<00:01:01.230> on

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
side generally because this is a side on

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.650 
side generally because this is a side on
the<00:01:01.920> back<00:01:02.070> don't<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.210> much<00:01:03.390> sunlight

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the back don't get that much sunlight

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.010 
the back don't get that much sunlight
anyway<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:05.250> then<00:01:05.519> saying<00:01:05.850> Corey's<00:01:06.150> more<00:01:06.360> like

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
anyway and then saying Corey's more like

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.020 
anyway and then saying Corey's more like
to<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.260> some<00:01:07.409> more<00:01:07.439> sunlight<00:01:10.640> might<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:11.850> off

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
to get some more sunlight might take off

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.420 
to get some more sunlight might take off
stem<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.409> make<00:01:13.770> sure<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:13.950> take<00:01:14.280> out

stem like that make sure I do take out

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.730 
stem like that make sure I do take out
stem<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> fruit<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.500> don't<00:01:16.680> know

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
stem with the fruit so you don't know

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.719 
stem with the fruit so you don't know
like<00:01:16.920> snip<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.369> off<00:01:19.220> that's<00:01:20.220> somewhere<00:01:20.490> that

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
like snip that off that's somewhere that

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.710 
like snip that off that's somewhere that
you<00:01:20.790> could<00:01:20.880> take<00:01:21.060> off

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.290 

but<00:01:24.260> that's<00:01:24.440> it<00:01:24.650> really<00:01:24.890> it's<00:01:25.190> um<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:25.970> know

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
but that's it really it's um you know

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.070 

but<00:01:32.900> make<00:01:33.140> sure<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:34.130> got<00:01:34.250> light

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
but make sure that you got light

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.710 
but make sure that you got light
penetrating<00:01:36.610> as<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.790> Sun<00:01:38.030> goes<00:01:38.270> around<00:01:38.510> or

penetrating as the Sun goes around or

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.940 
penetrating as the Sun goes around or
some<00:01:38.930> girls<00:01:39.200> around<00:01:39.260> like<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:40.940> and<00:01:41.800> as<00:01:42.800> it

some girls around like that and as it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.280 
some girls around like that and as it
does<00:01:43.130> this<00:01:44.090> prove<00:01:44.360> will<00:01:44.540> get<00:01:44.720> plenty<00:01:44.900> of<00:01:45.050> light

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
does this prove will get plenty of light

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.690 
does this prove will get plenty of light
you<00:01:45.470> can<00:01:45.620> also<00:01:45.770> try<00:01:46.510> taking<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.570> pot<00:01:48.700> like

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
you can also try taking the pot like

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.500 
you can also try taking the pot like
that<00:01:50.080> and<00:01:51.760> exposing<00:01:54.850> fruit<00:01:55.850> on<00:01:56.060> different

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
that and exposing fruit on different

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.700 
that and exposing fruit on different
through<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:57.680> light<00:01:58.040> that<00:01:58.310> way<00:01:59.230> so<00:02:00.230> to<00:02:00.410> get<00:02:00.560> rid

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
through to light that way so to get rid

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.080 
through to light that way so to get rid
of<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:00.920> but<00:02:01.070> definitely<00:02:01.190> don't<00:02:01.760> take<00:02:01.940> off

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
of that but definitely don't take off

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.300 
of that but definitely don't take off
all<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.450> folders<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:02.870> want<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.110> leave<00:02:03.310> at

all the folders you want to leave at

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.540 
all the folders you want to leave at
least<00:02:04.580> as<00:02:04.790> much<00:02:05.000> on<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.360> thing<00:02:06.070> just<00:02:07.070> to<00:02:07.340> make

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
least as much on the thing just to make

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.770 
least as much on the thing just to make
sure<00:02:07.730> that<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:09.020> plant<00:02:09.320> does<00:02:10.510> recover<00:02:11.510> well

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
sure that the plant does recover well

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.540 
sure that the plant does recover well
from<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.710> know<00:02:12.770> taking<00:02:13.130> out<00:02:13.190> these<00:02:13.400> extra

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
from you know taking out these extra

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.780 
from you know taking out these extra
excess<00:02:14.300> leaves<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:16.370> want<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.580> encourage

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
excess leaves and you want to encourage

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.180 
excess leaves and you want to encourage
more<00:02:17.240> growth<00:02:17.570> as<00:02:17.780> well<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.260> it's<00:02:18.740> more<00:02:18.890> fruit

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
more growth as well so it's more fruit

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.630 
more growth as well so it's more fruit
here<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.700> it's<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.210> lot<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.390> fruit<00:02:20.630> on<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:20.870> a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
here so it's a lot of fruit on this a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.370 
here so it's a lot of fruit on this a
lot<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.670> fruit<00:02:22.880> but<00:02:22.970> we've<00:02:23.090> formally<00:02:24.080> on<00:02:24.260> this

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
lot of fruit but we've formally on this

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.160
