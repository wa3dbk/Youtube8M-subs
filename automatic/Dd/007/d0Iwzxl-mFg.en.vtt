tablespoon of water and we're going to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.110 
tablespoon of water and we're going to
mix<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> two<00:00:34.230> together<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.820> not<00:00:35.969> as

simple as that we're only making a very
small<00:00:39.180> amount<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.140> order<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.410> make

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
small amount because in order to make

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.069 
small amount because in order to make
sourdough<00:00:41.100> starter<00:00:41.489> work<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:42.420> need<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.690> speed

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
sourdough starter work we need to speed

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.529 
sourdough starter work we need to speed
it<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.500> need<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.649> add<00:00:43.890> water<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.940> flour<00:00:45.239> and

day and after the third or fourth

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.189 
day and after the third or fourth
feeding<00:00:52.860> you'll<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.879> bubbling<00:00:54.660> sourdough

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
feeding you'll have bubbling sourdough

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.760 
feeding you'll have bubbling sourdough
starter<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.550> bacteria<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.420> yeast<00:00:57.989> that

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
starter and the bacteria and yeast that

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.040 
starter and the bacteria and yeast that
is<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> environment<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.300> also<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
is in the environment and also on the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.340 
is in the environment and also on the
flower<00:01:01.289> itself<00:01:01.710> will<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.760> eating<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> sugars

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
flower itself will be eating the sugars

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.320 
flower itself will be eating the sugars
in<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.830> flour<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.900> creating<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.020> bubbly

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
in the flour and creating a bubbly

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.210 
in the flour and creating a bubbly
creating<00:01:09.330> bubbles<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.930> making<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.830> starter

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
creating bubbles and making the starter

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.320 
creating bubbles and making the starter
and<00:01:11.430> that's<00:01:11.549> what<00:01:11.729> gives<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> sour

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and that's what gives you the sour

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.380 
and that's what gives you the sour
flavor<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.590> we're<00:01:14.070> gonna<00:01:14.189> go<00:01:14.369> ahead<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.729> store

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
flavor so we're gonna go ahead and store

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.660 
flavor so we're gonna go ahead and store
this<00:01:15.570> away<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.680> we're<00:01:16.860> gonna<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.310> leave<00:01:17.520> it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.160 
this away and we're gonna just leave it
out<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.060> right<00:01:18.479> now<00:01:18.509> we're<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> leave

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
out for right now we're going to leave

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.840 
out for right now we're going to leave
it<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> counter<00:01:20.130> I'm<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
it out on the counter I'm just going to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.940 
it out on the counter I'm just going to
cover<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.180> loosely<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:22.200> don't<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> get

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
cover it loosely you don't want to get

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.050 
cover it loosely you don't want to get
air<00:01:23.070> tight<00:01:23.369> because<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.729> you're<00:01:23.850> not<00:01:23.909> gonna

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
air tight because then you're not gonna

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.359 
air tight because then you're not gonna
have<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.600> bacteria<00:01:25.500> from<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> environment

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
have the bacteria from the environment

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.700 
have the bacteria from the environment
getting<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:28.110> next<00:01:28.500> we're<00:01:28.650> gonna

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
getting in there and next we're gonna

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.010 
getting in there and next we're gonna
come<00:01:29.549> back<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.880> feed<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.210> again<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.659> about<00:01:30.750> 8

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
come back and feed this again in about 8

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.219 
come back and feed this again in about 8
hours<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:33.090> we'd<00:01:33.210> say<00:01:33.360> 8<00:01:33.479> hours<00:01:33.570> later<00:01:33.990> now

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
hours so we'd say 8 hours later now

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.740 
hours so we'd say 8 hours later now
we've<00:01:34.829> been<00:01:34.920> letting<00:01:35.130> our<00:01:35.369> starter<00:01:36.180> set<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
we've been letting our starter set and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.560 
we've been letting our starter set and
we're<00:01:37.200> loosely<00:01:37.890> covered<00:01:38.280> take<00:01:38.970> our<00:01:39.119> cover<00:01:39.360> off

we're loosely covered take our cover off
we've<00:01:40.049> got<00:01:40.079> our<00:01:40.229> starter<00:01:40.710> here<00:01:40.890> kind<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.220> looks

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
we've got our starter here kind of looks

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.340 
we've got our starter here kind of looks
like<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.790> very<00:01:42.329> small<00:01:42.659> amount<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.930> pancake

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
like a very small amount of pancake

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.429 
like a very small amount of pancake
batter<00:01:44.210> we're<00:01:45.210> gonna<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.810> now<00:01:46.140> we're<00:01:46.350> gonna

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
batter we're gonna do is now we're gonna

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.590 
batter we're gonna do is now we're gonna
double<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.759> we're<00:01:47.880> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> take<00:01:48.180> another

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
double it so we're going to take another
