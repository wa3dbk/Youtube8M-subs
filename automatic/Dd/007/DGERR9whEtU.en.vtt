in<00:01:03.629> my<00:01:03.690> tank<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.880> don't<00:01:05.880> know<00:01:05.939> how<00:01:06.060> he's<00:01:06.180> not

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330

but I think that's what's a nuisance
last<00:01:11.369> time<00:01:11.700> there<00:01:12.030> should<00:01:12.179> be<00:01:12.210> drift<00:01:12.479> leaders

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810

to a 75 that'll probably fit on the
stand<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.489> have<00:02:51.700> here<00:02:52.859> but<00:02:53.859> here's<00:02:54.519> the

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
stand that I have here but here's the

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.390 
stand that I have here but here's the
video<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.659> just<00:02:56.590> remember<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:57.010> comment<00:02:57.250> rate
