00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
it very sparingly and the memory is not

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.619 
it very sparingly and the memory is not
a<00:02:45.150> good<00:02:45.329> one<00:02:46.819> what<00:02:47.819> I<00:02:47.849> remember<00:02:48.329> is<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.480> I

a hair better than that for me so go
there<00:06:51.490> I<00:06:51.520> guess<00:06:52.000> is<00:06:52.150> what<00:06:52.270> I<00:06:52.300> would<00:06:52.420> say<00:06:52.660> in

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810 
there I guess is what I would say in

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.990 
there I guess is what I would say in
that<00:06:52.870> ballpark<00:06:53.380> is<00:06:53.830> I<00:06:53.920> mean<00:06:54.070> I<00:06:54.430> didn't<00:06:54.820> have

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
that ballpark is I mean I didn't have

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.370 
that ballpark is I mean I didn't have
the<00:06:55.180> pumpkin<00:06:55.480> pie<00:06:55.630> but<00:06:55.660> I<00:06:55.990> would<00:06:56.110> have<00:06:56.230> to

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
the pumpkin pie but I would have to

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.160 
the pumpkin pie but I would have to
agree<00:06:56.470> it's<00:06:56.800> it's<00:06:57.040> it's<00:06:57.430> pretty<00:06:57.610> rough<00:06:57.970> I<00:06:58.720> can

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170 
agree it's it's it's pretty rough I can

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.250 
agree it's it's it's pretty rough I can
never<00:06:59.410> ever<00:06:59.560> imagine<00:07:00.370> drinking<00:07:00.730> this<00:07:00.850> again
