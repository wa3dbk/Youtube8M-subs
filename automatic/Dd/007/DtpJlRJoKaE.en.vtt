a little bit more time and just see how

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.660 
a little bit more time and just see how
good<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:19.020> remote<00:01:19.320> itself<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670

spring<00:01:51.420> rate<00:01:51.630> feels<00:01:52.200> good<00:01:52.380> also<00:01:53.070> has<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> little

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
spring rate feels good also has a little

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.420 
spring rate feels good also has a little
bit<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.820> drop<00:01:54.000> drop<00:01:54.420> down<00:01:54.600> feature<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.170> here

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
bit of a drop drop down feature on here

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.410 
bit of a drop drop down feature on here
stop<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> little<00:01:56.700> antenna<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.270> there's

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
stop it a little antenna so there's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.959 
stop it a little antenna so there's
really<00:01:57.540> nothing<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> break<00:01:58.469> off

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
really nothing for you to break off

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.870 
really nothing for you to break off
which<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.119> nice<00:02:00.360> here's<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.320> screen<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.430> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
which is nice here's your screen and a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.510 
which is nice here's your screen and a
few<00:02:03.060> buttons<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> back<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.310> although<00:02:05.310> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
few buttons on the back and although it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.889 
few buttons on the back and although it
may<00:02:05.640> look<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.360> swap<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.630> wheel

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
may look like you can swap the wheel

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.960 
may look like you can swap the wheel
around<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.320> actually<00:02:07.590> can't<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.459> sorry

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970

steering this way

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.259 
steering this way
and<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.860> course<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.099> runs<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.400> four<00:02:14.730> double<00:02:15.120> a's

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
and of course it runs on four double a's

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.540 
and of course it runs on four double a's
which<00:02:15.569> I've<00:02:15.720> already<00:02:15.989> put<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:16.980> the

which I've already put in here and the
the<00:02:17.580> tray<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:19.140> double-a<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.680> going<00:02:19.980> into

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
the tray that the double-a is going into

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.710 
the tray that the double-a is going into
is<00:02:20.310> actually<00:02:20.610> removable<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.360> can

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
is actually removable so you can

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.890 
is actually removable so you can
actually<00:02:21.989> put<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:23.670> rechargeable<00:02:24.480> battery<00:02:24.510> in

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
actually put a rechargeable battery in

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.540

tray up because you have to kind of push
in<00:02:28.560> here<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.920> need<00:02:29.040> like<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.340> little

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
in here you need like a little

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.550 
in here you need like a little
screwdriver<00:02:29.940> or<00:02:30.239> something<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:31.110> kind<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.349> push

which<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.510> don't<00:02:33.569> have<00:02:33.750> at<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:33.989> moment<00:02:34.019> so<00:02:34.410> it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
which I don't have at the moment so it

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.680 
which I don't have at the moment so it
is<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.129> bit<00:02:35.310> hard<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.580> open<00:02:35.760> which<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.299> not<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> bad

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
is a bit hard to open which is not a bad

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.030 
is a bit hard to open which is not a bad
thing<00:02:36.720> which<00:02:37.049> means<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.590> going<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.830> you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
thing which means it's not going to you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.110 
thing which means it's not going to you
know<00:02:38.160> your<00:02:38.310> batteries<00:02:38.580> aren't<00:02:38.790> going<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:38.970> fall

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
know your batteries aren't going to fall

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.630 
know your batteries aren't going to fall
out<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:40.049> we<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:41.099> grab<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.370> rest<00:02:41.519> of<00:02:41.580> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
out so we just grab the rest of the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.460 
out so we just grab the rest of the
stuff<00:02:41.819> that's<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.180> box<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.629> first<00:02:43.379> thing

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
it's actually got a pretty small

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.500 
it's actually got a pretty small
footprint<00:02:53.130> which<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.459> nice<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.299> course

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
footprint which is nice and of course

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.940 
footprint which is nice and of course
you've<00:02:54.599> got<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.780> little<00:02:55.049> 2.4<00:02:55.709> gigahertz

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
you've got a little 2.4 gigahertz

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.039 
you've got a little 2.4 gigahertz
antenna<00:02:56.519> there<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.030> there's<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:57.690> little<00:02:57.840> bag

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
antenna there and there's a little bag

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.900 
antenna there and there's a little bag
yet<00:02:58.290> with<00:02:58.470> all<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.769> senses<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.670> comes

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
yet with all the senses that it comes

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.240 
yet with all the senses that it comes
with<00:03:00.110> I'll<00:03:01.110> quickly<00:03:01.319> get<00:03:01.620> rid<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:01.980> box

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
with I'll quickly get rid of this box

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.150 
with I'll quickly get rid of this box
and<00:03:02.519> we'll<00:03:03.480> go<00:03:03.629> through<00:03:03.660> these<00:03:04.019> senses<00:03:04.560> very

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
and we'll go through these senses very

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.039 
and we'll go through these senses very
quickly<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.549> only<00:03:05.700> have<00:03:05.849> three<00:03:06.120> senses<00:03:06.540> you

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
quickly you only have three senses you

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.780 
quickly you only have three senses you
have<00:03:07.170> one<00:03:07.319> for<00:03:07.500> speed<00:03:07.769> one<00:03:08.190> for<00:03:08.370> temperature

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
have one for speed one for temperature

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.470 
have one for speed one for temperature
and<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.180> for<00:03:09.480> voltage<00:03:10.019> so<00:03:10.799> let's<00:03:11.430> see<00:03:11.640> first

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
and one for voltage so let's see first

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.080 
and one for voltage so let's see first
one<00:03:12.629> in<00:03:12.750> my<00:03:12.870> hand<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.769> believe<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.849> going

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
one in my hand is I believe it's going

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.229 
one in my hand is I believe it's going
to<00:03:15.180> be<00:03:15.239> my<00:03:15.599> temperature<00:03:16.110> sensor<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.670> I'm<00:03:18.150> not

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
to be my temperature sensor so I'm not

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.580 
to be my temperature sensor so I'm not
quite<00:03:18.420> sure<00:03:18.450> how<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.750> set<00:03:19.019> this<00:03:19.139> one<00:03:19.319> up<00:03:19.380> I

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
quite sure how you set this one up I

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.960 
quite sure how you set this one up I
think<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.859> wraps<00:03:20.069> around<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.459> motor<00:03:20.489> or<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
think it wraps around the motor or the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.819 
think it wraps around the motor or the
ESC<00:03:21.660> depending<00:03:22.049> on<00:03:22.139> which<00:03:22.260> one<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.590> want<00:03:22.739> to

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
ESC depending on which one you want to

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.059 
ESC depending on which one you want to
check<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.069> temperature<00:03:23.100> on<00:03:24.290> but<00:03:25.290> yeah<00:03:25.920> I'll

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
check the temperature on but yeah I'll

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.470 
check the temperature on but yeah I'll
have<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.340> do<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.489> check<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.910> instructions<00:03:27.389> and

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
have to do a check the instructions and

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.640 
have to do a check the instructions and
a<00:03:27.569> little<00:03:27.810> bit<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:27.959> homework<00:03:28.109> and<00:03:28.410> how<00:03:28.530> am<00:03:28.620> I

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
a little bit of homework and how am I

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.500 
a little bit of homework and how am I
going<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.859> set<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.130> guy<00:03:29.190> up<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.180> that's<00:03:30.269> that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
going to set this guy up so that's that

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.650 
going to set this guy up so that's that
one<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:31.380> next<00:03:31.560> one<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.549> speed<00:03:32.970> sensor<00:03:33.269> and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
one the next one is the speed sensor and

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.259 
one the next one is the speed sensor and
you<00:03:33.690> have<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.440> little<00:03:34.680> optical<00:03:35.639> lens<00:03:35.910> here

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
you have this little optical lens here

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.140 
you have this little optical lens here
that<00:03:37.109> I<00:03:37.319> believe<00:03:37.859> according<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.940> little

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
that I believe according to the little

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.479 
that I believe according to the little
glimpse<00:03:39.299> that<00:03:39.569> I<00:03:39.599> had<00:03:39.840> on<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.470> manual<00:03:40.950> it

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
glimpse that I had on the manual it

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.699 
glimpse that I had on the manual it
actually<00:03:41.849> mounts<00:03:42.630> kind<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:42.989> like<00:03:43.139> on<00:03:43.319> your<00:03:43.500> I

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
actually mounts kind of like on your I

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.400 
actually mounts kind of like on your I
am<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.430> counts<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.329> spokes<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:45.840> your<00:03:45.989> wheel<00:03:46.169> I

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
am and counts the spokes of your wheel I

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.250 
am and counts the spokes of your wheel I
think<00:03:46.919> that's<00:03:47.370> how<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.609> works

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
think that's how it works

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.629 
think that's how it works
again<00:03:49.260> I'll<00:03:49.440> need<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.769> try<00:03:49.950> already<00:03:50.250> setup<00:03:50.459> to

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
again I'll need to try already setup to

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.960 
again I'll need to try already setup to
give<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.150> some<00:03:51.299> accurate<00:03:51.750> information<00:03:52.970> I'm

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
give you some accurate information I'm

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.909 
give you some accurate information I'm
assuming<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:54.599> if<00:03:54.690> you<00:03:54.780> have<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.349> car<00:03:55.680> with<00:03:55.889> a

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
assuming that if you have a car with a

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.339 
assuming that if you have a car with a
with<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.250> flat<00:03:56.579> wheel<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:57.120> solid<00:03:57.900> wheel<00:03:58.079> you're

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
with a flat wheel a solid wheel you're

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.809 
with a flat wheel a solid wheel you're
not<00:03:58.530> going<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.709> be<00:03:58.799> able<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:59.099> get<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.519> speed

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
not going to be able to get a speed

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.509 
not going to be able to get a speed
reading<00:04:00.030> maybe<00:04:00.569> we'll<00:04:01.380> see<00:04:01.560> how<00:04:01.650> we<00:04:01.709> go<00:04:01.950> we

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
reading maybe we'll see how we go we

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.220 
reading maybe we'll see how we go we
have<00:04:02.639> to<00:04:02.760> run<00:04:02.880> some<00:04:03.030> tests<00:04:03.359> as<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.569> said<00:04:03.780> and

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
have to run some tests as I said and

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.180 
have to run some tests as I said and
then<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.530> course<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.799> have<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:05.069> little

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
then of course you have the little

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.659 
then of course you have the little
voltage<00:04:06.169> sensor<00:04:07.169> here<00:04:07.440> now<00:04:07.919> it<00:04:08.069> is<00:04:08.160> only<00:04:08.370> set

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
voltage sensor here now it is only set

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.659 
voltage sensor here now it is only set
up<00:04:08.760> for<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.090> 2's<00:04:09.750> out<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:10.889> box<00:04:11.099> but<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:11.340> can

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
up for a 2's out of the box but you can

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.490 
up for a 2's out of the box but you can
buy<00:04:11.880> these<00:04:12.329> additional<00:04:12.870> sensors<00:04:13.230> which<00:04:13.380> I

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
buy these additional sensors which I

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.259 
buy these additional sensors which I
believe<00:04:13.739> are<00:04:13.769> less<00:04:14.220> than<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.489> dollar<00:04:14.639> each<00:04:14.970> and

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
believe are less than a dollar each and

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.729 
believe are less than a dollar each and
that<00:04:16.139> way<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.709> can<00:04:16.950> have<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.609> 3s<00:04:18.209> 4s<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.530> on

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
that way you can have a 3s 4s and so on

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.080 
that way you can have a 3s 4s and so on
I<00:04:19.950> think<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.519> goes<00:04:20.609> all<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.789> way<00:04:20.849> up<00:04:20.969> to

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
I think it goes all the way up to

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.990 
I think it goes all the way up to
success<00:04:22.010> so<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.460> can<00:04:23.729> buy<00:04:23.880> additional

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
success so you can buy additional

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.570 
success so you can buy additional
sensors<00:04:24.659> for<00:04:24.900> different<00:04:25.320> R<00:04:25.469> series<00:04:25.740> or

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
sensors for different R series or

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.210 
sensors for different R series or
and<00:04:26.759> batteries<00:04:27.409> so<00:04:28.409> let's<00:04:28.710> have<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.889> bit<00:04:29.099> of<00:04:29.159> a

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
and batteries so let's have a bit of a

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.649 
and batteries so let's have a bit of a
quick<00:04:29.370> look<00:04:29.520> at<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:29.729> radio<00:04:30.030> itself<00:04:30.419> we'll

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
quick look at the radio itself we'll

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.659 
quick look at the radio itself we'll
have<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.840> closer<00:04:31.080> look<00:04:31.229> at<00:04:31.439> this<00:04:31.560> guy<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:32.370> let's

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
have a closer look at this guy so let's

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.050 
have a closer look at this guy so let's
turn<00:04:32.939> him<00:04:33.120> on<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:34.400> you<00:04:35.400> can<00:04:35.520> see<00:04:35.699> here<00:04:35.909> that

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
turn him on and you can see here that

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.179 
turn him on and you can see here that
the<00:04:36.150> screen<00:04:36.449> will<00:04:36.599> come<00:04:36.810> on<00:04:37.020> there's<00:04:37.889> a<00:04:38.009> little

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:38.189 
the screen will come on there's a little

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:40.459 
the screen will come on there's a little
bit<00:04:38.280> of<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.400> beep<00:04:38.610> now<00:04:39.539> here<00:04:40.169> we<00:04:40.289> have<00:04:40.319> our

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:40.469 
bit of a beep now here we have our

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.790 
bit of a beep now here we have our
throttle<00:04:41.310> trim<00:04:41.699> steering<00:04:42.389> trim<00:04:42.810> we<00:04:43.379> have<00:04:43.590> our

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
menu options here because there are 15

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.909 
menu options here because there are 15
of<00:04:58.680> them<00:04:58.889> so<00:04:59.400> first<00:04:59.729> one<00:04:59.909> is<00:05:00.090> EPA<00:05:00.870> which<00:05:01.740> is

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
of them so first one is EPA which is

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.350 
of them so first one is EPA which is
your<00:05:02.069> endpoints<00:05:02.729> then<00:05:03.000> you<00:05:03.120> have<00:05:03.240> your

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
your endpoints then you have your

up to six seas on this guy

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.339 
up to six seas on this guy
which<00:05:17.940> is<00:05:18.060> very<00:05:18.270> very<00:05:18.539> cool<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.020> of<00:05:19.289> course

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
you can actually go into these models

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.029 
you can actually go into these models
here<00:05:23.159> and<00:05:24.139> change<00:05:25.139> the<00:05:25.319> name<00:05:25.469> of<00:05:25.529> them<00:05:25.800> so<00:05:25.979> you

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
here and change the name of them so you

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.429 
here and change the name of them so you
know<00:05:26.250> if<00:05:26.370> you<00:05:26.490> have<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.639> slash<00:05:26.969> or<00:05:27.330> I<00:05:27.659> don't<00:05:28.259> know

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:28.439 
know if you have a slash or I don't know

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.619 
know if you have a slash or I don't know
a<00:05:28.500> low<00:05:29.009> C<00:05:29.279> or<00:05:29.550> something<00:05:29.939> you'll<00:05:30.150> be<00:05:30.180> able<00:05:30.419> to

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:30.629 
a low C or something you'll be able to

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:35.629 
a low C or something you'll be able to
name<00:05:30.960> it<00:05:31.139> accordingly<00:05:31.610> as<00:05:32.610> you<00:05:32.789> please<00:05:34.639> it

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
name it accordingly as you please it

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.480 
name it accordingly as you please it
does<00:05:35.909> have<00:05:36.150> also<00:05:36.389> a<00:05:36.650> fail-safe<00:05:37.650> which<00:05:38.340> I'm

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
does have also a fail-safe which I'm

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.369 
does have also a fail-safe which I'm
assuming<00:05:38.580> would<00:05:38.940> be<00:05:39.029> ideal<00:05:39.360> for<00:05:39.419> your<00:05:39.779> gas

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:40.379 
assuming would be ideal for your gas

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.309 
assuming would be ideal for your gas
powered<00:05:40.800> RCS<00:05:41.310> out<00:05:41.490> there<00:05:41.990> multi<00:05:42.990> option

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 
powered RCS out there multi option

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.829 
powered RCS out there multi option
screen<00:05:44.069> so<00:05:44.460> this<00:05:44.969> will<00:05:45.150> turn<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:45.330> beeps<00:05:45.629> on

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:45.839 
screen so this will turn the beeps on

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:48.379 
screen so this will turn the beeps on
and<00:05:46.080> off<00:05:46.169> you<00:05:46.469> have<00:05:46.589> a<00:05:46.620> throttle<00:05:46.919> hold<00:05:47.279> which<00:05:48.270> I

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
and off you have a throttle hold which I

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.329 
and off you have a throttle hold which I
believe<00:05:48.629> again<00:05:48.900> could<00:05:49.199> be<00:05:49.229> for<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.650> gas<00:05:50.009> cars

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:50.339 
believe again could be for the gas cars

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:52.269 
believe again could be for the gas cars
and<00:05:50.580> you<00:05:50.639> have<00:05:50.759> a<00:05:50.789> two<00:05:51.120> and<00:05:51.150> three<00:05:51.629> channel<00:05:51.960> mix

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:52.279 
and you have a two and three channel mix

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:56.269 
and you have a two and three channel mix
so<00:05:53.279> pretty<00:05:53.639> cool<00:05:54.589> so<00:05:55.589> we'll<00:05:55.680> just<00:05:55.860> exit<00:05:56.129> out<00:05:56.219> of

00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:56.279 
so pretty cool so we'll just exit out of

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:59.089 
so pretty cool so we'll just exit out of
this<00:05:56.430> guy<00:05:56.669> and<00:05:57.000> go<00:05:57.839> down<00:05:58.020> to<00:05:58.050> a<00:05:58.169> timer<00:05:58.680> we<00:05:58.919> have

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
this guy and go down to a timer we have

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.390 
this guy and go down to a timer we have
battery<00:05:59.550> we<00:05:59.789> have<00:05:59.819> reset<00:06:00.860> channel<00:06:01.860> adjustment

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
battery we have reset channel adjustment

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.350 
battery we have reset channel adjustment
monitor<00:06:03.029> and<00:06:03.300> speed<00:06:04.169> so<00:06:04.979> again<00:06:05.819> I'm<00:06:06.120> going<00:06:06.300> to

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:20.339 
see how I go with it I'm actually quite

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:22.279 
see how I go with it I'm actually quite
excited<00:06:20.849> to<00:06:20.879> try<00:06:21.150> this<00:06:21.210> remote<00:06:21.690> out<00:06:21.900> I<00:06:21.960> mean<00:06:22.169> it

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
excited to try this remote out I mean it

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.629 
excited to try this remote out I mean it
looks<00:06:22.500> fantastic<00:06:23.099> it<00:06:23.219> feels<00:06:23.490> really<00:06:23.819> good<00:06:24.110> and

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 
looks fantastic it feels really good and

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.689 
looks fantastic it feels really good and
given<00:06:26.639> the<00:06:26.729> price<00:06:26.969> point<00:06:27.360> I<00:06:28.259> think<00:06:28.710> it's<00:06:29.069> a<00:06:29.219> you

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
given the price point I think it's a you

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.850 
given the price point I think it's a you
know<00:06:29.789> it<00:06:29.909> could<00:06:30.060> be<00:06:30.210> the<00:06:30.389> next<00:06:30.629> big<00:06:30.930> thing<00:06:30.960> in

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
know it could be the next big thing in

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.730 
know it could be the next big thing in
its<00:06:32.190> range<00:06:32.490> in<00:06:32.759> its<00:06:32.909> price<00:06:33.150> point<00:06:33.740> obviously

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
its range in its price point obviously

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.499 
its range in its price point obviously
this<00:06:34.889> can't<00:06:35.219> compete<00:06:35.520> to<00:06:35.729> some<00:06:36.149> of<00:06:36.270> the<00:06:36.330> you

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:36.509 
this can't compete to some of the you

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:37.909 
this can't compete to some of the you
know<00:06:36.569> remote<00:06:37.229> out<00:06:37.409> there<00:06:37.589> they're<00:06:37.709> in<00:06:37.740> the

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
know remote out there they're in the

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.850 
know remote out there they're in the
hundreds<00:06:38.370> of<00:06:38.459> dollars<00:06:38.639> but<00:06:39.180> I

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
hundreds of dollars but I

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.499 
hundreds of dollars but I
think<00:06:40.039> for<00:06:40.310> somebody<00:06:40.699> that<00:06:40.879> wants<00:06:41.240> a<00:06:41.300> little

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509 
think for somebody that wants a little

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:44.499 
think for somebody that wants a little
bit<00:06:41.629> extra<00:06:41.840> out<00:06:42.080> of<00:06:42.229> their<00:06:42.319> RC<00:06:42.770> or<00:06:43.669> just<00:06:43.969> simply

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:44.509 
bit extra out of their RC or just simply

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:46.119 
bit extra out of their RC or just simply
