00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and everyone you know has a bit of a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.229 
and everyone you know has a bit of a
peek<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.640> oh<00:01:02.760> yeah<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.090> might

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
peek and they think oh yeah this might

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.479 
peek and they think oh yeah this might
actually<00:01:03.390> work<00:01:03.720> so<00:01:03.949> they<00:01:04.949> do<00:01:05.009> think<00:01:05.339> you're<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
actually work so they do think you're a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.639 
actually work so they do think you're a
little<00:01:05.580> bit<00:01:05.700> crazy<00:01:06.110> Tony<00:01:07.110> Hawk<00:01:07.259> was<00:01:07.440> probably

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
little bit crazy Tony Hawk was probably

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:08.810 
little bit crazy Tony Hawk was probably
one<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> those<00:01:07.950> guys<00:01:08.160> and<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.430> never<00:01:08.610> thought

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
one of those guys and I never thought

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.670 
one of those guys and I never thought
I'd<00:01:08.940> meet<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.270> wife<00:01:09.450> being<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.840> bit<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> fan<00:01:10.380> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
I'd meet my wife being a bit of a fan I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.900 
I'd meet my wife being a bit of a fan I
think<00:01:11.130> you'll<00:01:11.250> probably<00:01:11.280> think<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:11.759> a<00:01:11.790> bit

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
think you'll probably think it's a bit

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.249 
think you'll probably think it's a bit
extreme<00:01:12.119> but<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.570> should<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.750> right<00:01:12.990> off<00:01:13.110> his

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
extreme but it should be right off his

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.380 
extreme but it should be right off his
alley<00:01:13.440> so<00:01:13.770> we're<00:01:14.759> just<00:01:14.790> gonna<00:01:14.940> see<00:01:15.210> if<00:01:15.240> he'll

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
alley so we're just gonna see if he'll

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.160 
alley so we're just gonna see if he'll
jump<00:01:15.660> on<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.899> and<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> crack<00:01:17.990> we<00:01:18.990> haven't

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
jump on it and have a crack we haven't

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
jump on it and have a crack we haven't
built<00:01:19.259> too<00:01:19.410> many<00:01:19.440> safety<00:01:19.890> features<00:01:20.070> into<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
built too many safety features into it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.910 
built too many safety features into it
at<00:01:20.880> all<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.350> apart<00:01:22.350> from<00:01:22.410> the<00:01:22.619> big<00:01:22.740> red

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
at all really apart from the big red

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.230 
at all really apart from the big red
button<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> ability<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.820> run<00:01:23.970> away<00:01:24.180> from

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
button and the ability to run away from

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.770 
button and the ability to run away from
it<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:24.600> about<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.890> good<00:01:26.040> idea<00:01:26.130> for

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
it that's about it it's a good idea for

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.880 
it that's about it it's a good idea for
for<00:01:27.780> someone<00:01:27.960> else<00:01:28.170> other<00:01:28.290> than<00:01:28.500> me<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> be

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
for someone else other than me to be

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.960 
for someone else other than me to be
standing<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.340> yeah<00:01:31.280> I'm<00:01:32.280> fairly<00:01:32.549> confident

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
standing there yeah I'm fairly confident

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.370 
standing there yeah I'm fairly confident
that<00:01:33.090> we'll<00:01:33.210> nail<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.570> first<00:01:33.780> time<00:01:33.990> I'm<00:01:34.140> just

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that we'll nail that first time I'm just

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:47.870 
that we'll nail that first time I'm just
worried<00:01:34.860> about<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> driver<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:35.549> all

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.040 

apparently<00:01:48.880> our<00:01:48.910> insurance<00:01:49.420> covers<00:01:49.750> all<00:01:49.900> this

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
apparently our insurance covers all this

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.340 
apparently our insurance covers all this
