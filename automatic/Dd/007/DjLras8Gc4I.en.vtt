where<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:37.220> actually<00:01:37.520> shifts<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.210> braids<00:01:38.479> to

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
where it actually shifts the braids to

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.810 
where it actually shifts the braids to
the<00:01:38.870> side<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:39.800> way<00:01:39.860> it<00:01:40.100> won't<00:01:40.280> really<00:01:40.610> cover

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
the side this way it won't really cover

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.610 
the side this way it won't really cover
your<00:01:41.120> forehead<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:41.810> will<00:01:42.080> just<00:01:42.290> add<00:01:42.440> an

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
your forehead and will just add an

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:57.300

personally<00:01:58.310> I<00:01:58.400> love<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.670> pair<00:01:59.000> this<00:01:59.240> look<00:01:59.300> with

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510

personally I love to pair this look with
two<00:01:59.900> ponytails

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.639 

and<00:02:03.820> now<00:02:04.030> we<00:02:04.090> could<00:02:04.270> use<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:04.659> exact<00:02:04.960> same<00:02:05.200> idea

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
and now we could use the exact same idea

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.639 
and now we could use the exact same idea
to<00:02:05.979> create<00:02:06.159> a<00:02:06.460> braided<00:02:06.759> fringe<00:02:07.210> for<00:02:08.140> that<00:02:08.349> we

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
to create a braided fringe for that we

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.529 
to create a braided fringe for that we
just<00:02:08.830> need<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.099> start<00:02:09.399> looping<00:02:09.640> our<00:02:09.940> strands

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
just need to start looping our strands

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.990 
just need to start looping our strands
lower<00:02:10.810> down<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:12.040> course<00:02:12.310> such<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.700> fringe

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
lower down of course such a fringe

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.339 
lower down of course such a fringe
wouldn't<00:02:13.300> really<00:02:13.450> become<00:02:13.810> your<00:02:13.989> everyday

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
wouldn't really become your everyday

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.320 
wouldn't really become your everyday
go-to<00:02:14.860> loop<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.489> could<00:02:15.670> be<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.849> great<00:02:16.060> element

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
go-to loop but could be a great element

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.350
