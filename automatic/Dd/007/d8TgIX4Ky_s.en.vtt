00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
could so as you guys could see this is

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.170 
could so as you guys could see this is
the<00:03:30.590> Marc<00:03:30.830> Jacobs<00:03:30.860> sample<00:03:31.549> that<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.730> got<00:03:31.940> it's

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
the Marc Jacobs sample that I got it's

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.670 
the Marc Jacobs sample that I got it's
actually<00:03:32.480> sparkly<00:03:32.900> brown<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.440> blends

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
actually sparkly brown and it blends

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.949 
actually sparkly brown and it blends
really<00:03:33.860> well<00:03:34.010> so<00:03:34.790> I<00:03:35.120> use<00:03:35.299> that<00:03:35.480> on<00:03:35.600> my<00:03:35.720> lower

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
really well so I use that on my lower

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.350 
really well so I use that on my lower
lash<00:03:36.230> line<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.950> almost<00:03:37.340> never<00:03:37.610> use<00:03:37.760> stuff<00:03:38.150> on<00:03:38.269> my

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360

lash line I almost never use stuff on my
lower<00:03:38.540> lash<00:03:38.780> line<00:03:39.049> but<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.610> wanted<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.760> be

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
lower lash line but I wanted it to be

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.550 
lower lash line but I wanted it to be
super<00:03:41.120> dramatic<00:03:41.239> so<00:03:41.930> I'm<00:03:42.110> adding<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.410> little

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.070 
so that I'm able to give it a little
more<00:05:58.370> volume<00:05:58.580> and<00:05:58.940> also<00:05:59.060> hide<00:05:59.540> that<00:05:59.960> chain

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
more volume and also hide that chain

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.170 
more volume and also hide that chain
this<00:06:03.080> is<00:06:03.140> a<00:06:03.320> super<00:06:03.890> easy<00:06:04.070> updo<00:06:04.730> I'm<00:06:04.910> just

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
this is a super easy updo I'm just

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.510 
this is a super easy updo I'm just
basically<00:06:05.600> just<00:06:06.050> creating<00:06:06.860> as<00:06:06.980> much<00:06:07.250> volume

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
basically just creating as much volume

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.180 
basically just creating as much volume
as<00:06:07.850> possible<00:06:08.450> and<00:06:08.690> just<00:06:08.750> pinning<00:06:09.530> until<00:06:10.160> I

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
as possible and just pinning until I

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.330 
as possible and just pinning until I
think<00:06:10.340> it<00:06:10.580> looks<00:06:10.790> right<00:06:11.560> I'm<00:06:12.560> not<00:06:12.830> big<00:06:13.100> into

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
think it looks right I'm not big into

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.110 
think it looks right I'm not big into
the<00:06:13.940> really<00:06:14.180> smooth<00:06:14.780> updos<00:06:15.470> so<00:06:16.070> I<00:06:16.400> was<00:06:16.640> kind<00:06:17.060> of

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
the really smooth updos so I was kind of

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.030 
the really smooth updos so I was kind of
trying<00:06:17.300> to<00:06:17.450> create<00:06:17.720> organized<00:06:18.140> chaos<00:06:18.410> I<00:06:21.040> was

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
trying to create organized chaos I was

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.160 
trying to create organized chaos I was
having<00:06:22.250> so<00:06:22.490> much<00:06:22.760> fun<00:06:23.060> I<00:06:23.360> really<00:06:23.600> kind<00:06:24.080> of

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.170 
having so much fun I really kind of

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.630 
having so much fun I really kind of
didn't<00:06:24.410> want<00:06:24.530> the<00:06:24.830> whole<00:06:25.010> getting<00:06:25.490> ready

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
didn't want the whole getting ready

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.570 
didn't want the whole getting ready
process<00:06:26.120> and<00:06:29.530> so<00:06:30.530> as<00:06:30.830> you<00:06:30.920> can<00:06:31.010> see<00:06:31.250> I'm<00:06:31.550> just

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
process and so as you can see I'm just

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.000 
process and so as you can see I'm just
trying<00:06:32.090> to<00:06:32.180> mirror<00:06:32.690> that<00:06:32.930> same<00:06:33.200> volume<00:06:33.440> in<00:06:33.860> the

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
trying to mirror that same volume in the

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.080 
trying to mirror that same volume in the
back<00:06:34.160> pull<00:06:35.090> a<00:06:35.120> few<00:06:35.360> hairs

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
back pull a few hairs

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.150
