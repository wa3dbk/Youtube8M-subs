00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.740
 Good morning 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.679
 It continues in the test series in the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.690
 new blade of the bl x2 blades that here 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.199
 next to me is the successor of the old one 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.830
 blech team is now called wilson plate one 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.560
 hamburg before blx 2 the general conditions 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.650
 here are the same stayed for team 104a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:35.460
 head means that 289 grams on the side 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.739
 32 5 balance down 18 x 19 his tip blx 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.480
 2 is primarily only times that 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.420
 finally many added that is 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.710
 means he was created overall 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 extends to the handle you have one 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.430
 much better feedback plus one 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.770
 bit more to say to trainings 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.629
 just remember when playing a game 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.219
 a bit similar to the cortex systems 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.870
 just just here on feedback instead of on 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.629
 arm already laid out how to make the ball 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.090
 I think finds a great innovation 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.039
 Other features of the 104 a place are one 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.090
 something enlarges the spot like that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.119
 here you are still in the big shot 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.500
 the grommets are held a little bit further 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.479
 means the eyelids can already 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.280
 resonate you see this is just here 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.619
 so kept in the sweet spot area 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.530
 where it matters, however, falls 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.299
 the resort is pretty big out 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.680
 Just this sweet spot that 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.720
 light weight the good 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.580
 maneuverability that also loads 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.350
 I would say for everyone 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.689
 this new blade series is the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.549
 definitely from everyone and from 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.979
 Everyone playable and for every player type 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.259
 made if you are the ladies now 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.430
 It is somewhat easier to mr 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.500
 swing want to maneuver better 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.479
 may it be for teens 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.369
 want to change to blades are for 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.810
 for adolescent i believe this 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.110
 Bat is about for every game 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.390
 the racket was the wilson 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.600
 Sisters was in the same place for me 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.670
 a little bit 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.560
 the most comfortable versions just believe 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.320
 I was just too easy on it 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.220
 meets most in the sweet spot 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.750
 Nevertheless, there is a lot 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.729
 swing out even if you are due to the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.880
 slightly lower weight significantly more 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.960
 must do as for example at the 93 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.549
 but I believe during these bats 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.340
 hand knows where the 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.209
 is a quantitative difference lies spins 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.880
 it was possible 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.260
 the pages are a little wider-meshed 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.670
 I think that's fine 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.300
 as with all sides then the spin 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.180
 support 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.590
 the further that the pattern is the more 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.459
 the side can grab the ball more 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.230
 here is definitely the case 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.030
 surprised how stable the racket 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.040
 despite this very small 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.450
 weight at the volleys was right 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.030
 fun to play with 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.280
 surcharges here a bomb another 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.319
 a little more power just because of 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.160
 bigger plot though 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.170
 you yourself a little swing 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.730
 Of course, if not 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.769
 you have to move fast 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.780
 it is like all the beats when 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.150
 serve as well as there is right 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.730
 from it if you simply the thing on the 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.530
 point could accelerate exactly 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.570
 finally to say the player type 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.950
 I would say the blade one 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.049
 have there about that 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.370
 entry level model in the blade series 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.350
 but that does not mean much 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.989
 beginner to do because the racket is 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.579
 an all around weapon a very very good one 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.320
 all-rounder for people a bit 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.549
 want to play comfortably too 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.350
 maybe a bit suitable 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.570
 First, problems have little weight 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.370
 secondly almost always a clean meeting place 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.750
 if you swing the normal one for 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.579
 give me a clear recommendation for that 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.590
 broad community of play for the the 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:25.410
 other world maybe not 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.410
 new wilson plate one 100 model x2 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.820
