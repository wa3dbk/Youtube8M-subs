 We are here by phone but before 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.910
 It is very important to know that our 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.129
 contacts are saved in three 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.020

 save our contact 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.220
 in the phone's memory or also 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.780
 we can save contacts in the city 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.870
 card which normally we can 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.610
 install or withdraw or exchange and in 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.770
 this case we want to delete the contacts 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.330
 that are in the sim card then what 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.470
 first that we should do having 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.900
 started here by the option of 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.690
 telephone again the telefonito that 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.970
 is here we click here below where 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.060
 are the three lines then we give 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.190
 contacts has to be done this way by the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.600
 three dashes and then contacts because if 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.909
 we enter by action here up to the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.789
 right we will work then three 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.670
 contact pins then we give you here 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.410
 again of hatches and we say 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.090
 contacts to show we tell you that 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.670
 It is usually here in all 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.729
 contacts the list is longer they will see 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.009
 here says 17 contacts in the list of 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.220
 all contacts then what is going to 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.410
 do is click on three lines 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.600
 contacts to show me show me the 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.450
 sim card right now there is less 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.429
 contacts there is thirteen contacts of 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.530
 your thirteen contacts I can only 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.270
 delete I think 3 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.680
 this depends on how many contacts you have 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.260
 you and in this case I only have 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.330
 Three test contacts test one 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.890

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.350
 contacts that they have like a candadito 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.959

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.200

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.720
 contacts of the sim at this time 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.880
 we are visualizing we give them another click 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.980
 once in the three dashes and here where 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.050
