00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.189
 the ING 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.749
 for that reason again that already the kitchen of supreme pleasure 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.900
 let's work with fish 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.099
 I am a great big fan of the fish, always commented that 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.519
 It was a debate in the post in a nutshell that all the chefs in 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.679
 we are saying that we want to have vote old 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.160
 fish process and that because they are like fifth favorite 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.990
 me to start fully 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.750
 We are going to look for a cargo Tenoya stick here 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.770
 prepared so that those who have you 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.230
 what we are going to do today is quite simple the little 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.570
 work that he is carrying is simply a job 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.760
 He argued that it exceeds what we are going to do at this time and because he needs 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.380
 freezing because also according to Carlos cacho but according to carpaccio 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.440
 Salmon 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.570
 and this rock 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.250
 one things 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.829
 very curious the very curious fact the case of venezuela 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.540
 is that we have 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.500
 three thousand kilometers of coastline 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.880
 and that was forwarded four other sections the fish but everywhere 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.430
 and so 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.900
 % israel opposed a relatively non-consuming fish country that's why I 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.950
 I am always 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.159
 very aware of that that is very rare in general in Latin America caride 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.119
 Latin American 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.750
 but I must say amen of the island as Cuba 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.800
 that very little descabello culture I saw in the island of grenada for examples 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.710
 we want to island the program that when one enters the fishing water port the ap very 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.620
 little fish culture very curious 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.740
 we have a parasite 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.140
 precious and as many times you have heard that you have to have your eyes 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.130
 A) Yes 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.920
 transparent and bright 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.110
 and the only thing that I have removed the scales 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.640
 and lacks to raise it I wanted to show you it's pretty easy one is a short in 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.520
 diagonal 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.710
 how she fell to get a single fiat in today's case which is what I need 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.730
 1 comes with the fish as well and he all the trick of the filleting is to cut in 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.980
 direction asia 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.039
 lectinas uk 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.839
 if with the knife facing downwards 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:13.030
 thing that the central spine is the one that defines 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.670
 for a future that knife 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.250
 if you have a pass with just tell you that it is quite easier than what the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.099
 people imagine what is 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.999
 simply by tasting it in a very safe cut and holds 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.229
 a single and good steak 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.539
 this other 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:31.969
 half fish we will keep paying any other preparation once 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.369
 we have it so the complete genetic remove we escape from here to wave the 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.209
 area where I would be before 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.669
 from the belly of the delta river east rite 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:42.779
 we cut here 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:46.139
 for this reason the little ones and who resigned forever I love it most 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.599
 we are arequito companies 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.549
 well tasty that and here we have no spine but this central area 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.680
 only and finally 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.349
 and what you do is to your little cut that goes down flush with the skin 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.779
 and one comes 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.769
 cutting towards the skin as well as in 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.450
 with little more chili sa not to cut the skin completely by how to remove 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.709
 a sweater 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.779
 this fish 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.099
 so rakatá regatta regatta 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.279
 and it comes out full 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.549
 Latvian that the other side has absolutely no skin 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.569
 it's as easy as they saw it 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.590
 in this case I'm not going to use it 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.269
 but I could have perfectly grabbed all this rider the other half 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.389
 of the fish fillet here 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.230
 leave it with the skin is called for the carpaccio 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.099
 they were in small cuts and that increased for example santa ana with 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.029
 I've put there an entrance and seeds of coriander and it is made on silk foresees that 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:39.990
 the client 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.170
 a marvel 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.039
 and as I was saying, make sure 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.069
 to see where the art galleries are here 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.589
 I think those spots will be very demanding to retire as well as on the court 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:53.009
 removing him being in all the way a pity 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.769
 that little piece of chili that has thorny 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.670
 and the rest of the fillet to make properly carpacho that I want to make 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.489
 along with another steak that I already have ready 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.539
 d salmon 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:06.889
 let's leave this fish here in the meantime 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.439
 As I have said several times to you 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.469
 ap the best I refused 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:13.669
 of knowing 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.759
 if a client excavated is fresh it seems lie ironic perez that no 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.159
 flies to fish 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.610
 seven sins tarno wonderful power pedro h 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.370
 smell the fishing 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.779
 we cover is that to take it 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:29.129
 alan herrera 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:32.300
 and a strange way to look for other municipalities of sesame 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.150
 how to guarantee 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.259
 I have two 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.120
 the really done 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.650
 because we have checked 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.120
 comfort to show the whole recipe 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.479
 like in a place of salmon 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.479
 come delgaditos also have the idea here 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.580
 and what we are going to do 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.849
 pretty pretty simple to the right 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.559
 we take soldiers that I'm really making a single recipe or 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:02.550
 the kilo in chile tecmo icm very delgadito disarmed saying one day that they buy 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.860
 a piece of salmon the real life what a Venezuelan calls a cachet ico 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.180
 cachi peaks and 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.020
 of salmon and here we have it and try 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.990
 in this case to have 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.950
 two pieces as similar as possible patients or not to be identical and 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.529
 placed one over the other 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:20.860
 little the way to square the 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.860
 he cut the accesses in this case of unemployment 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:25.409
 And there we have it 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.620
 somehow that island the piece 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.960
 let's try then to cut more we anguish yes percent 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.189
 they see that all your bits are being left 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:38.719
 pajamas in my life I would vote for food these are just the pieces of their 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.699
 would do in the case of a restaurant or the case of this one 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:42.980
 to be many 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.339
 percent in fact several mus we've done ibáñez I'll teach him to do 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:49.569
 to you 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.919
 thing that does not always know that being like that kind of epidemics bits of 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:54.629
 fish 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:58.109
 indeed the Muses a great great great resource 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:03.330
 once we have the pair of pieces of fish and you majestic equestrian parade 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.599
 of sin we take 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.509
 again a film film this I already had prepared here 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.759
 for that purpose it is typical of us in the kitchen do not respond to such a thing 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.879
 the best time your investments in a perfect square 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.759
 we put first 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.009
 unemployment 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.040
 after 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.490
 the csa almón the reason why I'm placing the pair first then the 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.279
 Salmon 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:31.179
 is because the salmon steak is not the prettiest of the two then I'm going to 

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:32.439
 leave out 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:34.240
 no god for presentation 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.240
 the snapper went to the rollán domingo I sell yamaha fifth 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:39.339
 as you are seeing here 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:41.289
 it would be moving 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:42.450
 a caramel 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.029
 we wish a good roll 

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:47.520
 how would i say i'm doing raca raca raca raca raca 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.199
 and we closed dogs so it looks good and has pressed the idea is that 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.439
 we wanted this to be on the street 

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:55.270
 that a good candy 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.770
 as simple as that I am not saying the idea of ​​placing it simply fish 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.279
 a problem was nuance smoke from dd 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:02.960
 every hour of the presentation 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.800
 be even more beautiful but it could be perfectly just with salmon 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.279
 or just compared 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:12.669
 and now we simply continue with the recipe as it was removed and 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.770
 teaching to be today 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.689
 this piece of
