00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
will keep my tent dry and good reason to

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.160 
will keep my tent dry and good reason to
have<00:05:56.370> I<00:05:57.560> think<00:05:58.560> that's<00:05:58.860> 50<00:05:59.280> foot<00:05:59.610> of<00:06:00.170> parachute

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
have I think that's 50 foot of parachute

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.690 
have I think that's 50 foot of parachute
cord<00:06:01.770> or<00:06:02.010> 550<00:06:02.550> cord<00:06:02.960> get<00:06:03.960> a<00:06:03.990> good<00:06:04.200> view<00:06:04.380> there

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
cord or 550 cord get a good view there

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.390 
cord or 550 cord get a good view there
so<00:06:05.700> i'll<00:06:05.910> actually<00:06:06.690> i<00:06:06.960> guess<00:06:07.110> i<00:06:07.260> could<00:06:07.400> throw

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.490 
so i'll actually i guess i could throw
my<00:06:08.610> bike<00:06:08.850> in<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.090> back<00:06:09.330> and<00:06:10.050> i'll<00:06:10.230> put<00:06:10.410> my

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
my bike in the back and i'll put my
