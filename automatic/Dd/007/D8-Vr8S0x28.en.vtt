00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
gelatinous yes it well okay so you want

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.240 
gelatinous yes it well okay so you want
to<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.689> started<00:01:25.049> first<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.830> add<00:01:25.920> some<00:01:26.100> olive

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
to get started first you add some olive

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.560 
to get started first you add some olive
oil<00:01:27.890> then<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.920> onions

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.389 

and<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:32.659> chop<00:01:32.869> garlic<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.009> saute<00:01:37.369> that

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
and you chop garlic and you saute that

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.419 
and you chop garlic and you saute that
off

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
off

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.520 
off
anyhow<00:01:40.429> you<00:01:40.490> might<00:01:41.149> deep<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:42.109> they're<00:01:42.259> cooked

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
anyhow you might deep and they're cooked

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.779 
anyhow you might deep and they're cooked
all<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.829> way<00:01:42.859> through<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.429> then<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.640> guess

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
all the way through and then I guess

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.700 
all the way through and then I guess
another<00:01:44.060> important<00:01:44.479> part<00:01:44.689> is<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:45.020> have<00:01:45.590> to

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
another important part is you have to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.230 
another important part is you have to
have<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.280> liquid<00:01:46.579> in<00:01:46.670> there<00:01:46.789> that<00:01:46.969> are<00:01:47.060> cooked

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
have the liquid in there that are cooked

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.999 
have the liquid in there that are cooked
in<00:01:47.390> yes<00:01:47.750> cuz<00:01:48.079> again<00:01:48.259> that's<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:48.560> starchiness

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
in yes cuz again that's the starchiness

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.160 
in yes cuz again that's the starchiness
so<00:01:49.939> we<00:01:50.030> have<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.240> beans<00:01:50.420> in<00:01:50.630> there<00:01:50.750> now<00:01:50.929> and

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
so we have the beans in there now and

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.449 
so we have the beans in there now and
throw<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:51.649> up<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.920> simmer
