00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
on this ramp how far do you think he'll

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.869 
on this ramp how far do you think he'll
go<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.530> squiffed<00:00:46.860> back<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.370> their<00:00:47.460> radar<00:00:47.820> do

go but squiffed back to their radar do

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.160 
go but squiffed back to their radar do
you<00:00:47.969> want<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.210> put<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> post-it<00:00:48.780> right<00:00:48.930> there

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
you want to put a post-it right there

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.990 
you want to put a post-it right there
and<00:00:49.530> that's<00:00:49.920> where<00:00:50.219> we'll<00:00:50.399> mark<00:00:50.760> our

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and that's where we'll mark our

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.520 
and that's where we'll mark our

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
to but you're posted right there you

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.290 
to but you're posted right there you
have<00:01:00.090> 1<00:01:01.100> 2<00:01:02.100> squared<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.969> think<00:01:03.149> will

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
have 1 2 squared what do you think will

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.940 
have 1 2 squared what do you think will
happen<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:04.100> we<00:01:05.100> move<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.119> vamp<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.590> little

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
happen if we move the vamp up a little

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.609 
happen if we move the vamp up a little
bit<00:01:08.159> high<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.420> rod<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.020> little<00:01:10.409> bit

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
bit high the rod can be a little bit

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.730 
bit high the rod can be a little bit
higher<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:12.140> do<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.500> he's

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
higher on here do you think that he's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.070 
higher on here do you think that he's
going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.130> farther<00:01:14.610> or<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.689> think<00:01:15.720> he's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
going to go farther or do you think he's

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.880 
going to go farther or do you think he's
going<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.409> go<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.770> stand<00:01:17.100> distance<00:01:17.729> sign<00:01:18.890> flush

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
going to go to stand distance sign flush

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.719 
going to go to stand distance sign flush
go<00:01:20.280> run<00:01:20.640> oh<00:01:23.090> eight<00:01:24.090> squares<00:01:24.810> oh<00:01:25.259> yeah<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.220> am<00:01:26.549> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
go run oh eight squares oh yeah I am you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.700 
go run oh eight squares oh yeah I am you
know<00:01:26.880> yeah<00:01:27.150> what<00:01:27.990> do<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.290> think<00:01:28.530> will<00:01:28.680> happen

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
know yeah what do you think will happen

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.069 
know yeah what do you think will happen
if<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.490> move<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.970> ramp<00:01:30.210> up<00:01:30.360> even<00:01:30.900> higher<00:01:33.079> you

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
if we move the ramp up even higher you

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.160 
if we move the ramp up even higher you
think<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.810> time

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
think so so do we think that this time

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.510 
think so so do we think that this time
if<00:01:37.409> he<00:01:37.560> goes<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> little<00:01:37.920> bit<00:01:38.070> further<00:01:38.400> than

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
if he goes a little bit further than

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.760 
if he goes a little bit further than
eight<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.350> you're<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.710> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
eight do you think that you're going to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
eight do you think that you're going to
stay<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.610> mat<00:01:41.869> or<00:01:42.869> optimum<00:01:43.909> really

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
stay on the mat or optimum really

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.560 
stay on the mat or optimum really
ah<00:01:50.570> first<00:01:51.570> time<00:01:51.930> he<00:01:52.260> went<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:53.159> squares<00:01:54.119> right

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
ah first time he went to squares right

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.020 
ah first time he went to squares right
the<00:01:55.409> second<00:01:55.950> time<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.310> went<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.700> way<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the second time you went all the way to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.960 
the second time you went all the way to
eight<00:01:57.450> squares<00:01:57.990> right<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:59.280> third<00:01:59.549> time

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
eight squares right and the third time

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.630 
eight squares right and the third time
is<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.140> way<00:02:01.229> off<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.740> mat<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.369> learn

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
is all the way off the mat you learn

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.609 
is all the way off the mat you learn
with<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.090> what<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.200> learned<00:02:04.440> when<00:02:04.590> we

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
with this what have you learned when we

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.469 
with this what have you learned when we
need<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.100> bring<00:02:05.280> up<00:02:05.310> different<00:02:05.550> different

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
need to bring up different different

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.960 
need to bring up different different
types<00:02:06.750> what<00:02:07.020> are<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.170> learning<00:02:07.550> who<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.759> tell

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
types what are you learning who can tell
