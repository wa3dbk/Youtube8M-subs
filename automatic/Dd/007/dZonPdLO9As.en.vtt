00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 very good we are all in minecraft 

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.810
 1.7 point 2 let's see a mod a riot 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.990
 It is very cool although it is very short 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.940
 but I think this is the typical mod 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.460
 that you see it going is because it is not stones 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.490
 mick to this is very cool the question 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.560
 is that now when we raise levels 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.369
 we will be able to upload skills when 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.590
 we start to replicate zero mold let's go 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.349
 now you do not see the question there we are going to 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.910
 get experience 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.910
 expert in 5000 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.920
 and that's where some letters come out that 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.620
 puts choose a class that best suits you 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.350
 says a class if you give us l 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.610
 goes out to many different classes we can 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.699
 choose the one that we want I will put the 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.699
 miner increases mining in 10 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.190
 this would be like digging the five and 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.040
 five as it is said in melt in 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.989
 smelters and that gives us experience 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.510
 list by ticas etcetera etcetera here 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.960
 well more damage I defend the table 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.490
 let's see miner accept and now 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.110
 we have points there because we have 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.690
 put a lot I do not know why the traffic 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.180
 Spanair mobile no longer know there are points 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.440
 of skill if we give the l here 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.450
 we have everything we can upload 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.590
 As you can see we already have some points in 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.930
 some things because we have chosen 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.030
 mining but for example in mining 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.880
 they give us for each point the one 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.810
 more probability of getting double drop 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.920
 of the osores as if we had lu ting 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.630
 crystallize what you do if water every 5 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.750
 increases every five points increases the 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.410
 chop speed and so we have with 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.610
 all for example on the sword every point 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.050
 increases the probability of making a 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.750
 critical 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.409
 every 5 damage with objects no no 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.109
 I understand that but good 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.319
 each point increases the blocking of the 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:04.920
 sword and every 5 - damage from enemies 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:08.670
 it's pretty cool it increases a bit 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.170
 the table for example this is valid if it is 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.200
 for each point will increase by the idea of 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.300
 that give us objects like that a little rank to 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.370
 remove earth now then I'm going to 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.770
 teaching is pretty cool and every 5 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.770
 increases by the idea that we get flint of 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.230
 the gravel and so with everything there is all of the 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.880
 sne kim I think it was what to say with the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.819
 shift I think they go faster now yes 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.230
 yes every point increases the speed if 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.410
 every five points makes the bugs 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.599
 see us as they lose the rank 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.000
 - range of seeing us or something like that is a bit 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.989
 weird but hey he's pretty cool he's 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.120
 pretty good this increases the speed 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.970
 for example and every five takes away the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.010
 fall year then I'm going to upload everything 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.799
 what I can in fact go up all 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.780
 to the maximum the maximum level is 50 for that 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.459
 first everything and now we're good again 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.019
 we have everything to the fullest and now he wants 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.490
 teach them some little things for example 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.150
 when running 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.150
 no way 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.280
 if we click on the yes to throw ourselves 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.010
 also happens to this weird effect and we 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.810
 we move quite fast then when fishing 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.600
 what we see is that everything went up 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.360
 until the fishing will give us some objects a 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.710
 little rando before evil or a bone and 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:26.140
 He also sent another rod to kill 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.900
 and it's weird because they do not even bite and 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.239
 you pick up things 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.819
 as it normally itches even if they are things 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.569
 rando 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.409
 OK 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.409
 an arrow 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.579
 you see 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.299
 it's worth keeping it pressed 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.299
 directly 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.700
 today 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.260
 something is something a boat and a bucket but 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.770
 Well let's see what the shovel 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.440
 example part that itches super fast this 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.630
 it's normal I've seen mostly with the 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.750
 earth that is what I am going to teach 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.560
 now 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.480
 we go around here as the towers go 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.290
 this could be for example the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.290
 normal minecraft 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:24.490
 and good 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.620
 That's already the mike's thing 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.840
 question is that now by removing earth 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.600
 and this especially the land of normal me 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.210
 I have seen that it does not come out 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.009
 they can give us things apart 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.990
 take a little quick look here 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.309
 they have given us coal before also gives 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.309
 for it seems that you will also know 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.800
 but super exaggerated 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.640
 apart they give us everything it's like 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.380
 we look for stone things have given us 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.460
 how are we going as we go searching and 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.460
 we had gotten by appointments 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.860
 of everything 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.050
 and what I have not seen, come on, I do not 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.780
 I see that I go 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.539
 faster at least with the stone I'm not going 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.030
 to try colors to see how it is worth 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:17.969
 let's try it 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:25.649
 called of a truth again two 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:29.009
 Of course not so much because before, not because 

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:32.200
 I would not fly is removing tornado earth 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.330
 but if you give us a lot 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.660
 mother calls me of the grief liquor of this 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.660
 function 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:43.949
 it does not look like that look 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.419
 4 and we have removed 3 is quite 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.940
 guayasamÃ­n and I like it I like it a lot 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.710
 this of the levels I found very cool 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.710
 another thing that I want to check I'm going to 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.450
 check now is if I die every the 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.980
 experience takes it from me but the levels 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.330
 that I've put on for all this I 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.520
 remove 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.190
 I will check it is worth not the points 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.470
 continue here that's going to kill me 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.650
 coast now because now I launch from 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.810
 from above everything and I have this 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.760
 from here of the tics no yes I have less 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.920
 fall damage and I had to go to 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.900
 all by sack but it 's pretty good 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.540
 let's also see the objects that 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.870
 add now let's see this talisman of 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.870
 wonder that it's done like this with gold reston and 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.550
 gold and this is supposed to allow us 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.070
 transform an entire stack for example 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.700
 of coal 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:36.380
 in energy in pure experience or something 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.380
 well this I see it 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.880
 I do not see it, I'm very good 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48.470
 I'm not sure how this will work but 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:51.790
 let's go to me I will not spend it yes but no 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.790
 it seems to work 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.460
 I want I want experience like 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.680
 I make 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.870
 ok it will not get these 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.620
 objects I do not know why but good this is 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.410
 the other gp the book of 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.220
 aller ning I do not know how to tell you for not 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.220
 to learn 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:13.330
 to forget it would be that we are supposed to 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.330
 reset the points 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:21.940
 in fact we have 614 together now but 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:24.400
 As you can see, it's pretty good, I do not know how 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.000
 that object works the truth but good 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.980
 this is the mod 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.690
 I hope you liked it I do not know why 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.780
 that other object did not work for me 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:34.000
 well you do not have the link in the 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:39.270
 description is already out there are favorites 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.270
 to ride these and everything now 

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.150
 ah
