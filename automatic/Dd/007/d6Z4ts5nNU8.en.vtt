00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
like that in itself it's like okay your

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.880 
like that in itself it's like okay your
point<00:02:02.450> what<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.710> big<00:02:04.159> thing<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:04.960> they<00:02:05.960> you

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
point what the big thing is they you

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.430 
point what the big thing is they you
need<00:02:07.040> lots<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.820> lots<00:02:08.270> of<00:02:08.509> levels<00:02:08.750> like<00:02:09.170> Ken

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
need lots and lots of levels like Ken

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.530 
need lots and lots of levels like Ken
basically<00:02:10.220> works<00:02:10.580> like<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.030> enchantment

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
basically works like the enchantment

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.260 
basically works like the enchantment
system<00:02:11.840> where<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.050> need<00:02:12.230> lots<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.880> XP<00:02:13.880> levels

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
system where you need lots of XP levels

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.630 
system where you need lots of XP levels
to<00:02:14.420> get<00:02:14.600> high<00:02:14.780> high<00:02:15.470> youth<00:02:15.709> level<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.370> chance

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
to get high high youth level and chance

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.890 
to get high high youth level and chance
so<00:02:17.920> basically<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.190> need<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.459> level<00:02:20.269> you<00:02:20.690> need

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
so basically you need a level you need

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.970 
so basically you need a level you need
level<00:02:21.290> 66<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.250> get<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.519> tier<00:02:22.760> 4<00:02:23.410> tier<00:02:24.410> 4<00:02:24.680> down

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
level 66 to get the tier 4 tier 4 down

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.280 
level 66 to get the tier 4 tier 4 down
here<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:26.090> boom<00:02:26.570> ins<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:28.010> can<00:02:28.190> be<00:02:28.400> a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
here and boom ins and that can be a

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.949 
here and boom ins and that can be a
really<00:02:30.290> daunting<00:02:30.470> task<00:02:31.070> so<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.820> have<00:02:32.480> made<00:02:32.720> that

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
really daunting task so I have made that

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.800 
really daunting task so I have made that
task<00:02:33.290> very<00:02:33.950> very<00:02:34.400> simple<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:35.150> is<00:02:35.209> on<00:02:35.630> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
task very very simple this is on the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.320 
task very very simple this is on the
resonant<00:02:36.290> rise<00:02:36.500> pack<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.790> can<00:02:37.970> see<00:02:38.209> as

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
resonant rise pack and you can see as

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.810 
resonant rise pack and you can see as
you<00:02:38.510> look<00:02:38.690> around<00:02:38.930> here<00:02:39.470> I've<00:02:39.980> been<00:02:40.430> here<00:02:40.640> for

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
you look around here I've been here for

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.060 
you look around here I've been here for
a<00:02:40.880> while<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.330> can<00:02:41.540> see<00:02:41.780> all<00:02:41.959> my<00:02:42.070> stuff

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
a while you can see all my stuff

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.470 
a while you can see all my stuff
everywhere<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.950> basically<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.670> piece<00:02:47.269> of

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
everywhere and basically this piece of

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.610 
everywhere and basically this piece of
machinery<00:02:47.840> right<00:02:48.319> here<00:02:48.620> is<00:02:50.530> possibly<00:02:51.530> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
machinery right here is possibly the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.310 
machinery right here is possibly the
most<00:02:51.830> one<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.820> most<00:02:53.120> useful<00:02:53.420> things<00:02:54.049> in

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
most one of the most useful things in

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.979 
most one of the most useful things in
here<00:02:54.590> honestly<00:02:54.920> okay<00:02:55.730> not<00:02:56.150> quite<00:02:56.450> but<00:02:56.780> it's

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
here honestly okay not quite but it's

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.470 
here honestly okay not quite but it's
pretty<00:02:57.230> useful<00:02:57.790> basically<00:02:58.790> what<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.090> is

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
pretty useful basically what it is is

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.370 
pretty useful basically what it is is
it's<00:02:59.840> this<00:03:00.610> lose<00:03:01.610> these<00:03:01.850> liquid<00:03:02.269> XP<00:03:02.930> tanks

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
it's this lose these liquid XP tanks

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.970 
it's this lose these liquid XP tanks
it's<00:03:03.590> mostly<00:03:04.190> open<00:03:04.430> blocks<00:03:04.880> there's<00:03:05.360> some

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
it's mostly open blocks there's some

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.550 
it's mostly open blocks there's some
thermal<00:03:06.980> expansion<00:03:07.459> in<00:03:07.579> here<00:03:07.730> but<00:03:08.560> basically

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
thermal expansion in here but basically

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.539 
thermal expansion in here but basically
the<00:03:09.799> way<00:03:09.829> it<00:03:10.130> works<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:11.170> use<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.560> XP<00:03:13.280> drain

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
the way it works is the use the XP drain

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.449 
the way it works is the use the XP drain
which<00:03:14.360> drains<00:03:14.750> your<00:03:14.930> XP<00:03:15.320> into<00:03:15.680> these<00:03:15.829> tanks

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
which drains your XP into these tanks

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.180 
which drains your XP into these tanks
which<00:03:17.329> is<00:03:17.540> then<00:03:17.750> pumped<00:03:17.989> up<00:03:18.380> into<00:03:18.590> this<00:03:18.860> tank

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
which is then pumped up into this tank

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.060 
which is then pumped up into this tank
which<00:03:19.489> will<00:03:20.420> if<00:03:20.840> I<00:03:21.049> flick<00:03:21.410> this<00:03:21.620> lever<00:03:21.920> right

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
which will if I flick this lever right

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.810 
which will if I flick this lever right
here<00:03:22.130> shower<00:03:23.090> down<00:03:23.540> XP<00:03:24.110> on<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.820> basically

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
here shower down XP on you and basically

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.640 
here shower down XP on you and basically
it<00:03:25.880> just<00:03:25.940> keeps<00:03:26.450> on<00:03:26.630> doing<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.590> just

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
it just keeps on doing that so it just

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.110 
it just keeps on doing that so it just
keeps<00:03:27.950> going<00:03:28.220> as<00:03:28.489> long<00:03:28.670> as<00:03:28.820> you<00:03:28.940> have

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
keeps going as long as you have

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.780 
keeps going as long as you have
basically<00:03:29.720> any<00:03:29.870> amount<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.350> XP<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:31.459> helps<00:03:31.730> to

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
basically any amount of XP it helps to

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.630 
basically any amount of XP it helps to
have<00:03:31.910> more<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:32.390> it's<00:03:32.510> faster<00:03:32.989> on<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:34.190> reload

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
have more so it's faster on the reload

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.460 
have more so it's faster on the reload
but<00:03:36.820> basically<00:03:37.840> when<00:03:38.840> you're<00:03:39.049> I'm<00:03:39.290> not

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
but basically when you're I'm not

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.560 
but basically when you're I'm not
wearing<00:03:39.739> any<00:03:39.890> armor<00:03:39.980> but<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:40.730> put<00:03:41.329> on<00:03:41.450> my

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
wearing any armor but you put on my

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.190 
wearing any armor but you put on my
armor<00:03:41.600> here<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.829> can<00:03:42.950> see<00:03:43.239> the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
armor here you can see the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.500 
armor here you can see the
the<00:03:46.200> experience<00:03:46.980> level<00:03:47.280> going<00:03:47.849> up<00:03:48.120> and

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
the experience level going up and

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.500 
the experience level going up and
basically<00:03:49.349> it<00:03:49.800> splits<00:03:50.160> all<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.580> XP<00:03:51.000> along

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
basically it splits all the XP along

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.470 
basically it splits all the XP along
your<00:03:51.750> armor<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:52.650> that's<00:03:52.860> why<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.099> as

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
your armor and so that's why the as

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.059 
your armor and so that's why the as
that's<00:03:54.480> why<00:03:54.660> if<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.050> take<00:03:55.319> off<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.709> rest<00:03:55.860> of<00:03:55.980> my

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
that's why if I take off the rest of my

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.240 
that's why if I take off the rest of my
armor<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:57.150> level<00:03:57.810> goes<00:03:58.020> up<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.349> whole<00:03:58.620> lot

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
armor the level goes up a whole lot

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.370 
armor the level goes up a whole lot
faster<00:03:59.520> than<00:04:00.209> it<00:04:00.330> did<00:04:00.480> before<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:02.510> so<00:04:03.510> if<00:04:03.989> you

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
faster than it did before and so if you

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.320 
faster than it did before and so if you
just<00:04:04.560> sit<00:04:04.800> here<00:04:05.099> for<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.670> while<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:06.120> can<00:04:06.300> just

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
just sit here for a while you can just

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.600 
just sit here for a while you can just
sit<00:04:06.569> here<00:04:06.599> afk<00:04:07.260> it's<00:04:07.500> like<00:04:07.650> an<00:04:07.800> afk<00:04:08.130> machine

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
sit here afk it's like an afk machine

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.080 
sit here afk it's like an afk machine
it's<00:04:08.849> awesome<00:04:09.599> like<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.920> will<00:04:11.160> just<00:04:11.940> keep

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
it's awesome like that it will just keep

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.110 
it's awesome like that it will just keep
on<00:04:12.300> racking<00:04:12.870> up<00:04:13.400> experience<00:04:14.400> on<00:04:14.610> your<00:04:14.760> armor

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
on racking up experience on your armor

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.900 
on racking up experience on your armor
which<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.569> can<00:04:15.720> then<00:04:15.959> use<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.290> put<00:04:17.220> on<00:04:17.250> those

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
which you can then use to put on those

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.830 
which you can then use to put on those
really<00:04:18.359> useful<00:04:18.810> imbue<00:04:19.169> mints<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.620> become<00:04:19.979> a
