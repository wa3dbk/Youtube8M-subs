00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.669

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.589
 good craft is not very difficult 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.079
 just download it and others 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.990
 install it and others rather install it 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:22.179
 what has been the minimum root or its 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.460
 useful life that I forged myself and other things 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.859
 good for me it is very easy for me 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.599
 spend yourselves and save yourselves 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.060
 all the procedure and install 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.039

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.640

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:39.620
 they are going to see it the download link forgive 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.379
 to see more but good 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.480
 and show that the file is downloaded 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.260
 good radio point I will use the video 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.260
 for the moment that 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.840
 good and once downloaded you can go 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.290
 where I downloaded it where they wanted it 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.010
 send it and well I sent it to the 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.129
 downloads and already opened it good and a 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.440
 Once we open it, we will give it in the 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.310
 specified folder I'm going to send it 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.350
 to the desk 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.710
 Excuse me because sometimes I swallow better 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.200
 well let's close this and we're going to 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.810
 open it once we have it in the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.689
 desk let's go let's have two 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.350
 files that is the point minecraft and the 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.450
 launcher what good are we going to click on 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.700
 point minecraft and we will give 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.670
 extract here 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.740
 well, it's going to take a little bit 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.780
 it depends on your computer 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.780
 well, I'm missing a little 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.310
 this is what we are going to do is send it to 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.259
 app data ok let's delete the file 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.539
 weird if you want to leave it but 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.229
 the same is going to eliminate good at once 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:56.530
 let's send the launcher to the desktop 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.119
 or where you want to put it but 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.170
 This is going to be like the executor of the 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.090
 minecraft key and let's search or 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.280
 run and know what they are going to put 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.380
 for those who do not know I 'm going to put the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.990
 loupe are going to put this look 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:17.450
 without the percentage of data 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.450
 without that percentage ok ok 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.970
 and once you are going to leave this if 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.060
 they have the minecraft folder they do not know 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.450
 worry what they are going to do is give 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.700
 backspace and delete it because what 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.780
 let's do is the folder that we have 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.970
 here for example 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.010
 or good so that they understand me better is 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.000
 this one that is here then the one that we had 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.000
 that we download we are going to send it to 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.730
 here on the property and it's ready 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.350
 everything we had here as already 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.819
 we send property that we no longer have 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.690
 nothing and if you want you can erase this 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:59.050
 folder and well we put the launcher here 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.250
 and we can double click on it and either 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.470
 open the executer and if it does not open 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.160
 this if they do not have it so what are they going to 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.720
 do is open with java always they will 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.140
 open with java if it is not going to 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.570
 work in another way than good now 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.450
 let's now here to play online clear if 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:23.140
 well better online do not worry if 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:27.710
 we can play ok well I have a little bit of 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:31.280
 flu sorry the nose floor 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.950
 already opened and will open this 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.860
 but I do not like it at all 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.960
 so I'm going to do it that well once 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.180

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.500

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.970
