00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.590
 good morning and welcome to world 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.480
 unknown point is 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.970
 for a long time the numbers have 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.269
 been an enigma and of course they continue 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.160
 being it currently 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:19.150
 there are certain numbers that have something 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.850
 I miss our bonding two of them 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.490
 they are 9 and 11 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.720
 yes I know that many of you will be 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.509
 thinking about September 11, 2001 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.370
 that's just one part a small 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.739
 seed in a barn 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.460
 the link between 9 and 11 is 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:47.329
 tremendous in mathematics if we divide 100 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:50.050
 for 9 gives us 11,11 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.190
 and so on 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:59.559
 also if we divide 100 by 11 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.490
 90 90 90 9 obtain and thus so 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.100
 continued 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:09.460
 9 11 and 11 9 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.210
 another curious fact is that in the book of 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.950
 the revelations the apocalypse 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.190
 specifically in chapter 13 of the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:22.149
 circle 18 there is a curious paragraph that 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.610
 says here there is wisdom the one that has 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.119
 understanding count the number of the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.480
 beast for you are number of man and his 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:42.130
 number is 666 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:44.730
 chapter 13 verse 18 13 by 18 234 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:51.230
 234 equal to 9 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:57.180
 if inverse is 432 if we add it to 234 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:02:00.090
 we get 666 the number that indicates the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:07.680
 verse but what do we get if 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:09.300
 we divide 432 between 2 then 216 which is 6 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.560
 to the cube 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.900
 16 210 is an odd number as 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.140
 platÃ³n called it was the cube 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.220
 perfect the last of them formed by 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.090
 six cubes per side 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:30.240
 the cabal considers that in the 16 216 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.800
 first numbers is the name of god 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.680
 curiously the first time that the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:42.550
 name of Indians appears in the bible is 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:50.340
 in the exodus chapter 3 verse 14 3 14 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:50.340
 and which 314 1592 neither more nor less than pi 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.130
 again the numbers are enigmatic 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.490
 if we go back to the apocalypse and see the 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.520
 apocalypse chapter 7 verse 4 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:07.390
 we find the following appointment 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.730
 and today the number of the sealed 144,000 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.530
 sealed from all the tribes of the 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:17.370
 fives of israel 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:20.010
 144,000 equals 144 equal to 9 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.890
 again 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.439
 Each person is composed of 72,000 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.110
 nobodies second the ancient scriptures 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:34.140
 the nobodies are energy centers 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:42.710
 humans a man and a woman among 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:49.540
 two form 144,000 nobodies 72 7 plus 29 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:51.340
 and 144 144 equal to 9 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.099
 another curious fact is that any 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.840
 number divided by 9 in has its rest 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:01.080
 will be equal to the sum of this number 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.890
 for example let's look at this data if 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:09.390
 we take a random number 485 and what 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.959
 we divide by 9 it leaves us equal to 53 8 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:17.280
 so the rest is 8 and the sum of 4 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:22.199
 plus 8 plus 5 equals 17 the sum of 1 and 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.069
 7 equals 8 exactly equal to 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.629
 decimal 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:28.729
 the difference between a number does not 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:31.310
 specified and the number formed by the 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:36.110
 investment of your digits is always the 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:41.610
 multiple of 9 for example between 26 and 62 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:45.270
 the difference is 36 which is multiple of 9 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:49.620
 always comes out multiple of 9 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:53.100
 9 and 11 is always close to each other 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:57.150
 as well as nine and six that one is the 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:00.000
 investment of another and forms a vortex of 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:04.070
 geometric congruence 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.050
 a vortex that divides and is divisible 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:10.280
 have been divided by 9 as we said 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:14.470
 it's 11 11 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.170
 and they have divided between 11 you get 9 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:22.010
 09 09 09 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:27.590
 therefore one thousand 111 per thousand 111 us 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:29.340
 da 12 343 21 graph that generates a 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.760
 pyramid 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.610
 the 9 its strange number linked to 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.810
 solar system to the union between the earth 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.040
 and the moon the earth and the sun 9 are the 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.650
 months of pregnancy 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.670
 there are many strange things around 9 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:53.900
 9 is the creation number 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:58.200
 the 666 is the number of the beast its 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:00.540
 antithesis is 999 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.530
 think about it 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:08.310
 and well after this long succession of 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:11.990
 numbers without more we see the world 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.990
 unknown point a is
