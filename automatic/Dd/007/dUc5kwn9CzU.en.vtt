advantages on this reel over a lot of
reels<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> market<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.059> have

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
reels on the market because we have

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
reels on the market because we have
these<00:00:57.510> two<00:00:57.809> raised<00:00:58.140> areas<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.399> spool

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
these two raised areas on the spool

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.610 
these two raised areas on the spool
which<00:00:59.969> although<00:01:00.180> were<00:01:00.390> very<00:01:00.600> very<00:01:00.809> easy<00:01:01.079> push

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
which although were very very easy push

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.830 
which although were very very easy push
off<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.940> cassette<00:01:03.270> rather<00:01:03.600> than<00:01:03.750> you

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
off of the cassette rather than you

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.359 
off of the cassette rather than you
having<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> strain<00:01:04.500> against<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.129> pull<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.370 
having to strain against it and pull it
off<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.119> very<00:01:06.360> easy<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.659> get<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> spool<00:01:07.200> off<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
off so very easy to get the spool off a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.870 
off so very easy to get the spool off a
nice<00:01:07.680> simple<00:01:08.010> method<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.490> doing<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:10.580> again<00:01:11.580> on

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
nice simple method of doing it again on

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.050 
nice simple method of doing it again on
this<00:01:12.119> particular<00:01:12.420> real<00:01:12.810> GX<00:01:13.560> 500<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
this particular real GX 500 we have the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.480 
this particular real GX 500 we have the
pin<00:01:15.330> identification<00:01:16.259> system<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:17.100> allows<00:01:17.310> us

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
pin identification system this allows us

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.780 
pin identification system this allows us
to<00:01:17.850> identify<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.450> fly<00:01:18.810> line<00:01:19.110> type<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:20.490> size

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
to identify the fly line type the size

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.550 
to identify the fly line type the size
the<00:01:21.210> density<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> sink<00:01:22.049> profile<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the density and the sink profile a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
the density and the sink profile a
really<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.159> key<00:01:23.430> thing<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> lot<00:01:24.210> of

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
really really key thing on a lot of

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.670 
really really key thing on a lot of
aerials<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.930> forward<00:01:25.380> they're<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
aerials going forward they're going to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.800 
aerials going forward they're going to
have<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.920> pin<00:01:26.159> system<00:01:26.430> very<00:01:27.210> very<00:01:27.299> good<00:01:27.659> way

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
have this pin system very very good way

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.300 
have this pin system very very good way
of<00:01:27.840> telling<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:28.380> sort<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.680> fly<00:01:28.860> lines<00:01:29.130> you've

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
of telling what sort of fly lines you've

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.620 
of telling what sort of fly lines you've
got<00:01:30.229> on<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.470> inside<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.070> reel<00:01:32.479> we've<00:01:33.479> got

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
got on the inside of the reel we've got

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.359 
got on the inside of the reel we've got
a<00:01:33.659> good<00:01:33.990> quality<00:01:34.170> drag<00:01:34.619> system<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.220> gives

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
a good quality drag system that gives

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.160 
a good quality drag system that gives
you<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> nice<00:01:35.729> range<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.329> tension<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> dis

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you a nice range of tension it's a dis

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.289 
you a nice range of tension it's a dis
track<00:01:37.350> system<00:01:37.829> left<00:01:38.579> right<00:01:38.820> conversion

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
track system left right conversion

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.969 
track system left right conversion
probably<00:01:39.930> one<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.320> easiest<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
probably one of the easiest on the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.649 
probably one of the easiest on the
markets<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.000> very<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.450> simple<00:01:44.450> cog<00:01:45.450> that

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
markets it's a very very simple cog that

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.420 
markets it's a very very simple cog that
we<00:01:45.780> take<00:01:46.020> out<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.380> flip<00:01:46.590> over<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:47.070> reverse

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
we take out and flip over that's reverse

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.490 
we take out and flip over that's reverse
the<00:01:47.729> direction<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.509> wine<00:01:48.720> from<00:01:48.990> left<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> right

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the direction of wine from left to right

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.770 
the direction of wine from left to right
so<00:01:49.530> very<00:01:49.979> very<00:01:50.220> simple<00:01:50.640> simple<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.420> comes<00:01:51.600> out

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
so very very simple simple it comes out

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.350 
so very very simple simple it comes out
turn<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.829> over<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.670> drag<00:01:53.850> mechanism

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
turn it over and that's a drag mechanism

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.209 
turn it over and that's a drag mechanism

construction for the cage and for the

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.030 
construction for the cage and for the
spool<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.469> we've<00:02:30.590> got<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.709> full<00:02:30.889> bar<00:02:31.129> stock<00:02:31.370> real

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040

similar scoffs we'll release we have the

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.619 
similar scoffs we'll release we have the
pin<00:02:39.230> identification<00:02:40.159> system<00:02:40.519> also<00:02:40.700> on<00:02:41.209> the

pin identification system also on the
Smurfs<00:02:41.870> pool<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:42.500> we<00:02:42.530> can<00:02:42.739> identify<00:02:42.829> the<00:02:43.280> line

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:43.609 
Smurfs pool so we can identify the line

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.069 
Smurfs pool so we can identify the line
by<00:02:43.909> belly<00:02:44.269> type<00:02:44.599> and<00:02:45.019> by<00:02:45.169> sinking<00:02:45.739> speed<00:02:46.040> etc

one<00:02:48.079> of<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.319> big<00:02:48.500> key<00:02:48.769> things<00:02:49.129> with<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:50.739> is

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
one of the big key things with this is

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.319 
one of the big key things with this is
that<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:52.909> spools<00:02:53.209> are<00:02:53.419> interchangeable

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
that the spools are interchangeable

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.559 
that the spools are interchangeable
between<00:02:56.329> 700<00:02:57.169> and<00:02:57.260> 500<00:02:57.939> so<00:02:58.939> if<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.090> happen<00:02:59.540> to

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
between 700 and 500 so if you happen to

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.860 
between 700 and 500 so if you happen to
buy<00:03:00.379> yourself<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.980> 500<00:03:01.549> reel<00:03:01.730> then<00:03:02.659> a<00:03:02.750> little
