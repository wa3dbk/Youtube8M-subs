clueless<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.520> mean<00:04:29.699> you<00:04:29.849> guys<00:04:29.970> remember<00:04:30.240> the

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
clueless I mean you guys remember the

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.540 
clueless I mean you guys remember the
first<00:04:30.720> episode<00:04:31.169> I<00:04:31.380> made<00:04:31.830> about<00:04:31.949> the<00:04:32.250> clueless

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
first episode I made about the clueless

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.659 
first episode I made about the clueless
I<00:04:32.970> mean<00:04:33.539> it<00:04:33.900> was<00:04:34.110> lots<00:04:34.410> of<00:04:34.620> fun<00:04:34.680> perhaps<00:04:35.430> I

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
I mean it was lots of fun perhaps I

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:36.860 
I mean it was lots of fun perhaps I
should<00:04:35.849> have<00:04:35.940> done<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.300> same<00:04:36.330> thing<00:04:36.539> with

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
should have done the same thing with

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.620 
should have done the same thing with
this<00:04:37.050> one<00:04:37.259> clueless<00:04:37.759> part<00:04:38.759> two<00:04:39.030> I<00:04:39.240> don't<00:04:39.509> know

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
this one clueless part two I don't know

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.290 
this one clueless part two I don't know
but<00:04:40.199> I<00:04:40.259> think<00:04:40.470> it's<00:04:40.860> it's<00:04:41.250> obviously<00:04:42.060> we're

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
but I think it's it's obviously we're

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.480 
but I think it's it's obviously we're
playing<00:04:42.539> against<00:04:42.960> lots<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.680> clueless<00:04:44.160> players

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
playing against lots of clueless players

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.150 
playing against lots of clueless players
here<00:04:44.849> the<00:04:45.449> ways<00:04:45.690> we<00:04:45.930> can<00:04:46.110> easily<00:04:46.380> flank<00:04:46.889> them<00:04:47.009> I

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
here the ways we can easily flank them I

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.700 
here the ways we can easily flank them I
mean<00:04:47.340> this<00:04:48.270> map<00:04:48.569> is<00:04:48.599> actually<00:04:49.229> easier<00:04:49.650> to

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
mean this map is actually easier to

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.700 
mean this map is actually easier to
flank<00:04:50.099> because<00:04:51.110> there's<00:04:52.110> lots<00:04:52.289> of<00:04:52.530> vertical

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
flank because there's lots of vertical

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.180 
flank because there's lots of vertical
gameplay<00:04:53.370> so<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:53.639> can<00:04:53.880> drop<00:04:54.090> on<00:04:54.300> top<00:04:54.509> of<00:04:54.660> them

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
gameplay so you can drop on top of them

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.309 
gameplay so you can drop on top of them
when<00:04:56.190> they're<00:04:56.370> not<00:04:56.580> expecting<00:04:56.789> you<00:04:57.720> can<00:04:57.990> turn

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
when they're not expecting you can turn

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.850 
when they're not expecting you can turn
around<00:04:58.380> and<00:04:59.569> completely<00:05:00.569> take<00:05:01.470> them<00:05:01.680> by

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
around and completely take them by

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.520 
around and completely take them by
surprise<00:05:01.889> like<00:05:02.340> a<00:05:02.669> full<00:05:03.300> squad<00:05:03.659> if<00:05:03.900> sometimes

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
surprise like a full squad if sometimes

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.240 
surprise like a full squad if sometimes
it's<00:05:04.740> possible<00:05:05.250> then<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:06.620> get<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.650> full<00:05:07.949> squad

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
it's possible then you get a full squad

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.249 
it's possible then you get a full squad
from<00:05:08.430> behind<00:05:08.759> and<00:05:09.000> they<00:05:09.240> are<00:05:09.509> completely

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
from behind and they are completely

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.279 
from behind and they are completely
oblivious<00:05:11.220> of<00:05:11.639> what's<00:05:11.940> going<00:05:12.300> on<00:05:12.509> that's<00:05:13.080> the

oblivious of what's going on that's the

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.409 
oblivious of what's going on that's the
funny<00:05:13.530> thing<00:05:13.620> about<00:05:13.919> this<00:05:14.250> map<00:05:14.490> specially<00:05:15.180> on
