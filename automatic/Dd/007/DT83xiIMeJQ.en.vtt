get one it grabs attention with its
retro<00:00:33.540> styling<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.739> when<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.890> actually<00:00:35.250> flip

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
retro styling and when I actually flip

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.130 
retro styling and when I actually flip
it<00:00:35.610> over<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> calculation<00:00:36.780> people<00:00:37.079> are

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
it over to do the calculation people are

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.130 
it over to do the calculation people are
amazed<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.160> actually<00:00:38.340> works<00:00:38.930> you<00:00:39.930> may<00:00:40.079> be

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
amazed that it actually works you may be

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.420 
amazed that it actually works you may be
thinking<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.890> always<00:00:41.129> use<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
thinking that you can always use a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.190 
thinking that you can always use a
smartphone<00:00:41.850> app<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.180> do<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> calculations

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
smartphone app to do the calculations

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.650 
smartphone app to do the calculations
and<00:00:43.410> you'd<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:45.030> look<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.360> uses

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
and you'd be right but look it uses

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.959 
and you'd be right but look it uses
battery<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.289> takes<00:00:46.530> time<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.829> find<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.640> open

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
battery it takes time to find and open

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.330 
battery it takes time to find and open
the<00:00:48.059> app<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.260> no<00:00:49.440> physical<00:00:49.920> feeling

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the app and you have no physical feeling

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.880 
the app and you have no physical feeling
of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> buttons<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.110> it's<00:00:52.110> hard<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.469> use<00:00:52.649> when

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
of the buttons so it's hard to use when

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.799 
of the buttons so it's hard to use when
you're<00:00:53.039> looking<00:00:53.370> away<00:00:53.640> say<00:00:53.969> at<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.449> list<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
you're looking away say at a list of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.819 
you're looking away say at a list of
numbers<00:00:54.989> ready

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.160

I<00:00:55.860> used<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.670> calculator<00:00:57.180> app<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.690> many<00:00:57.840> years

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
I used a calculator app for many years

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.680 
I used a calculator app for many years
before<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.559> had<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.829> calculator<00:00:59.100> case<00:00:59.660> but<00:01:00.660> I

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
before I had a calculator case but I

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.330 
before I had a calculator case but I
found<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.350> much<00:01:01.559> quicker<00:01:01.800> than<00:01:01.949> flip

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
found that it's much quicker than flip

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.429 
found that it's much quicker than flip
my<00:01:02.489> case<00:01:02.730> over<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> calculation

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
my case over and do the calculation

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.830
