00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.969 
something like that and it later starts
floating<00:04:02.449> around<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.199> map<00:04:03.379> ever<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:03.739> see

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:03.979 
floating around the map ever you see

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:07.110 
floating around the map ever you see
maybe<00:04:04.159> before<00:04:04.790> dude<00:04:05.060> Oh

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
maybe before dude Oh

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.240 
maybe before dude Oh
yeah<00:04:08.569> like<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.050> gun<00:04:09.260> simple<00:04:09.680> lag<00:04:09.920> out<00:04:10.069> like

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
yeah like the gun simple lag out like

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.800 
yeah like the gun simple lag out like
you'll<00:04:10.370> get<00:04:10.519> like<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.760> quick<00:04:11.060> lag<00:04:11.269> spike<00:04:11.599> when

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
you'll get like a quick lag spike when

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.000 
you'll get like a quick lag spike when
you're<00:04:11.930> in<00:04:11.989> a<00:04:12.049> gunship<00:04:12.379> I<00:04:12.530> grab<00:04:12.709> when<00:04:12.799> you<00:04:12.860> call

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
you're in a gunship I grab when you call

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.440 
you're in a gunship I grab when you call
it<00:04:13.099> in<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.459> gunship<00:04:13.760> will<00:04:13.909> just<00:04:14.060> fly<00:04:14.239> like

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
it in and the gunship will just fly like

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.940 
it in and the gunship will just fly like
either<00:04:14.540> underneath<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.080> map<00:04:15.260> or<00:04:15.530> like<00:04:15.680> around

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
either underneath the map or like around

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.229 
either underneath the map or like around
the<00:04:16.130> map<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:16.489> came<00:04:16.729> in<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:16.970> shoot<00:04:17.090> you

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
the map and you came in to shoot you

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.449 
the map and you came in to shoot you
can't<00:04:17.449> shoot<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.810> enemy<00:04:18.079> so<00:04:18.380> basically<00:04:19.280> you

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
can't shoot the enemy so basically you

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.890 
can't shoot the enemy so basically you
get<00:04:19.549> screwed<00:04:19.850> for<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.120> good<00:04:20.299> minute<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.720> half

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
get screwed for a good minute and a half

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.870 
get screwed for a good minute and a half
and<00:04:21.620> when<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:21.739> have<00:04:21.919> a<00:04:21.949> nasty<00:04:22.250> gameplay<00:04:22.729> like

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
and when you have a nasty gameplay like

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.330 
and when you have a nasty gameplay like
this<00:04:23.000> of<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.210> mac-11<00:04:23.479> which<00:04:24.050> really<00:04:24.830> is<00:04:25.010> rare

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
this of the mac-11 which really is rare

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:46.000 
this of the mac-11 which really is rare
like<00:04:25.790> it<00:04:25.940> sucks<00:04:26.350> but<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:44.530> also<00:04:45.530> take<00:04:45.889> this

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
like it sucks but you also take this

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.520 
like it sucks but you also take this
ratio<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.820> cuts<00:04:47.120> it<00:04:47.300> out<00:04:47.449> when<00:04:47.660> I'm<00:04:47.750> going<00:04:48.020> 98

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
ratio it cuts it out when I'm going 98

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.200 
ratio it cuts it out when I'm going 98
mile<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:48.889> so<00:04:49.039> still<00:04:49.430> amazing<00:04:50.000> gameplay

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
mile and so still amazing gameplay

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.790 
mile and so still amazing gameplay
overall<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:50.870> it's<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:51.050> little<00:04:51.260> shorter<00:04:51.620> that's

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
overall and it's a little shorter that's

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.560 
overall and it's a little shorter that's
why<00:04:51.919> we<00:04:52.070> use<00:04:52.250> it<00:04:52.280> that's<00:04:52.580> why<00:04:52.699> we<00:04:52.820> keep<00:04:52.940> saved

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
why we use it that's why we keep saved

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.200 
why we use it that's why we keep saved
