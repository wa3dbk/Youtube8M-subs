00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.179
 if not 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.519
 has seen grenades in the market and not 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:11.709
 I had no idea how to prepare it 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.660
 let me show you a simple and 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.029
 easy to reveal how beautiful this is 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.130
 fruit inside I am your savior 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.289
 registered nutritionist and today they 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.600
 I will show a very easy way to split 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.640
 a grenade this fruit intimidates a little 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.740
 the first time we see it because it does not 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.930
 we know how to treat it what they do 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.940
 many people is cutting it into pieces 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.020
 but I would like to teach you another way to 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.900
 do it look at the two sides of your grenade 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.140
 this side the bigger side is the side 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.810
 where was the flower and this side is from 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 Stem the first step is to take 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.550
 the knife and cut delicately 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.580
 around the side where the flower is born 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.370
 will cut a little bit from the center only 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.410
 the top part is cut as well and as 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.020
 can see I started cutting a bit of the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.910
 fruit inside now something else 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.080
 important is that when you see a grenade 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.510
 you can see some small lobes 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.970
 if you look closely you will see that they are not 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.190
 perfectly round 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.030
 what I will do is cut a piece of the 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.030
 bottom part 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.070
 and then cut between the lobes 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.580
 through the shell do not go through all 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.580
 the fruit 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.140
 I try is to cut between 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.600
 lobes to separate them 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.420
 this external part is what is called the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.970
 skin alone I will cut the skin a little and 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.460
 now this is the secret I will put this in 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.530
 a bowl of water and the reason why 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.540
 I will do it because this is how I can start the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.790
 fruit without the seeds returning 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.890
 everywhere and I get my pretty blouse 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.110
 yellow with spots of all ranges of 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.270
 purple 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.370
 one of the reasons to use this 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.980
 Bowl method with water is because 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.020
 It is easier to remove seeds by 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.570
 the opposite if you do this on a 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.400
 chopping board will cut the seeds and 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.950
 is going to let out a lot of this juice that 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.290
 stain everything in this way we will avoid 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.550
 the disaster is observed see here and a 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.710
 white part floating inside the bowl 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.410
 and when you have finished breaking it 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.540
 You can take out that white part of the water 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.930
 this white part is known as the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.930
 mesocarp 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.590
 another thing about the seeds of 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.299
 grenade that I advise to make 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.400
 People have always interested me 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.970
 observe how people eat this 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.310
 fruit 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.040
 and many put a handful of seeds in 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.550
 his mouth and chew it then spit out 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.550
 seeds 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.300
 I advise that you also try 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.890
 trade that part the reason is that as 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.510
 other seeds of other fruits that 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.010
 We eat like the little seeds of the 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.010
 strawberries or the kiwis 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.770
 They contain natural oils that are very 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.740
 healthy for our organism 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.120
 let's try to eat the whole seed me 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.780
 I have placed these seeds in my 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.430
 smoothies and they taste very good 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.200
 I advise you to do this 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.719
 They also look very pretty on 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.969
 salads in addition perfectly well with 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:16.189
 the chicken if you are preparing a saucepan 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:20.799
 of chicken places some seeds on top 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.799
 almost finished as you can see here 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.240
 and we will take these pieces 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.870
 and these little pieces that call 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.870
 membranes 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.730
 if I had a small colander could 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.180
 do this and separate the white pieces 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.400
 that are floating 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.170
 once this is done they are ready 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.510
 to take the fruit to the lava tackle 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.240
 place it in a colander and strain all 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.070
 those wonderful seeds 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.370
 pretty easy and I think it does not stain my 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.370
 blouse 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.310
 I took another colander like this and they placed 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.430
 lava dish and the result are seeds 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.799
 of granada beautiful beautiful 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.390
 the technical name of these seeds is 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:12.579
 ar and those of Granada ary ls are 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.950
 ready to eat them as they are 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.530
 chew them add them to your smoothies 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.070
 address salads or how do 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.070
 snack
