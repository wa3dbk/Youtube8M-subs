00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
the pink watch yeah I think there is I

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:58.429 
the pink watch yeah I think there is I
think<00:04:43.570> it<00:04:43.720> does<00:04:43.900> go

00:04:58.429 --> 00:04:58.439 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:00.350 

well<00:04:59.039> under<00:04:59.309> the<00:04:59.429> start<00:04:59.669> of<00:04:59.789> the<00:04:59.849> frame<00:05:00.059> like

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
well under the start of the frame like

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.239 
well under the start of the frame like
when<00:05:00.539> I<00:05:00.629> was<00:05:00.719> telling<00:05:01.019> you<00:05:01.169> that<00:05:01.199> he<00:05:02.009> makes

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:02.249 
when I was telling you that he makes

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:03.559 
when I was telling you that he makes
centuries<00:05:02.639> for<00:05:02.789> third<00:05:03.059> I<00:05:03.149> never<00:05:03.300> really

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
centuries for third I never really

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.149 
centuries for third I never really
thought<00:05:03.749> he'd<00:05:03.959> make<00:05:04.169> one<00:05:04.349> here<00:05:04.559> and<00:05:04.769> perhaps

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
thought he'd make one here and perhaps

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:06.679 
thought he'd make one here and perhaps
he<00:05:05.459> won't<00:05:05.669> now<00:05:05.879> but<00:05:06.119> he<00:05:06.179> gave<00:05:06.360> her<00:05:06.449> the<00:05:06.539> good

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:06.689 
he won't now but he gave her the good

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:08.419 
he won't now but he gave her the good
shots<00:05:06.959> there<00:05:07.319> he's<00:05:07.499> just<00:05:07.529> missed<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.039> cabin

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:08.429 
shots there he's just missed the cabin

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:09.949

there<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.849> left<00:05:09.059> and<00:05:09.269> red<00:05:09.449> is<00:05:09.629> the<00:05:09.749> one<00:05:09.869> he

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:09.959 
there the left and red is the one he

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.469 
there the left and red is the one he
played<00:05:10.199> on<00:05:10.439> you<00:05:11.189> miss<00:05:11.459> the<00:05:11.639> intended<00:05:12.089> cannon
