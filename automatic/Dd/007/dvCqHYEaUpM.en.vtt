easier<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.000> roots<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> go<00:01:09.570> through<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
easier for the roots to go through the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
easier for the roots to go through the
soil<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.590> sort<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.950> there<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.820> Minh<00:01:12.119> you

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
soil it just sort of there is Minh you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.450 
soil it just sort of there is Minh you
are<00:01:12.330> already<00:01:12.630> yeah<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> but<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.250> helps

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
are already yeah so I but it just helps

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.330 
are already yeah so I but it just helps
it<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.720> when<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.500> loosen<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it get going and when you loosen up the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.149 
it get going and when you loosen up the
roots<00:01:17.369> Susan<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.869> from<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.350> part<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.890> that

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
roots Susan in the from the part is that

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.280 
roots Susan in the from the part is that
because<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.759> roots<00:01:21.150> are<00:01:21.360> very<00:01:21.659> delicate<00:01:21.960> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
because the roots are very delicate and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.499 
because the roots are very delicate and
you<00:01:22.500> need<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.430> sometimes<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.330> can

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
you need to know that sometimes you can

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.390 
you need to know that sometimes you can
find<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.799> been<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> pot

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
find out that if it's been in the pot

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.649 
find out that if it's been in the pot
for<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.640> long<00:01:26.759> time<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> roots<00:01:27.360> are<00:01:27.540> growing

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
for a long time the roots are growing

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.330 
for a long time the roots are growing
round<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.439> round<00:01:28.619> around<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.220> they

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
round and round around because they

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.399 
round and round around because they
can't<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.720> don't<00:01:30.930> separate

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
can't get out so if you don't separate

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.039 
can't get out so if you don't separate
them<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:32.640> tend<00:01:32.880> inside<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> hole<00:01:33.750> that

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
them out they tend inside the hole that

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.660 
them out they tend inside the hole that
you<00:01:34.170> plant<00:01:34.439> them<00:01:34.619> into<00:01:34.890> keep<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.310> round<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
you plant them into keep going round and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.550 
you plant them into keep going round and
round<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:41.659> goes<00:01:42.659> round<00:01:42.899> does<00:01:43.439> that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
round and it just goes round does that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.889 
round and it just goes round does that
mean<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> don't<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.399> get<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> sort<00:01:45.750> of

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
mean you don't really get the sort of

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.929 
mean you don't really get the sort of
the<00:01:46.229> food<00:01:46.500> doesn't<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.280> get<00:01:47.549> into<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
the food doesn't really get into the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.969 
the food doesn't really get into the
plants<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.450> give<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.960> good<00:01:49.259> plant<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
plants to give you a good plant the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.590 
plants to give you a good plant the
roots<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.460> roots<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:50.850> developing<00:01:51.420> and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
roots the roots are developing and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.660
