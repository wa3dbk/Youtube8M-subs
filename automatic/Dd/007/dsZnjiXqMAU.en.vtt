00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.980
 good but let's talk about something that 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.779
 you know very well the simulators of 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.759
 formula 1 and especially the simulator of the 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.379
 ferrari team I think not what 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.509
 we had never seen but for the first 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.400
 Once we have some images in the 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.650
 that we see fernando climbing in this 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.130
 species of turtle that is the simulator 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.769
 of ferrari ah yes it's a giant cage of 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.230
 almost 3 tons that is powered by 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:29.289
 six legs six hydraulic legs that 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.939
 move the cage simulating the reactions 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.510
 of a car then inside this 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.160
 cage you have a 3d screen you 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.650
 you feel in the car with good in the 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.140
 same monocoque monocoque same seat 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.560
 everything just like you in my same steering wheel 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.300
 and the reaction of the car then with these 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.040
 hydraulic legs is moving the 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.540
 cage and of it in the same way 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.730
 that the car would move the simulator is 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.290
 very useful to prepare especially the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.560
 great prizes now having all the 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.870
 circuits in 3-d always the best is the 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.220
 clue that's the reality all over the world 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.540
 all pilots want to try on the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.430
 track we do not want to shoot in the simulator 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.290
 and the first one but if you can not shoot in 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.810
 the track the simulator is the most 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.640
 fast more efficient and cheaper 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.649
 a car the problem of a simulator 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.049
 principal is that the forces that have 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.630
 they are very few and they are only the reactions 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.360
 of the cage is metal that you see in 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.610
 the images you also have to 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.289
 you have to imagine it then the 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.820
 distance will always see a 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.830
 difference between reality the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.380
 simulator but really the simulators 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.820
 more good are the Estadi because this 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.770
 distance this difference between the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.229
 reality and the simulator is reduced to 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.509
 minimum what percentage of the performance of 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.220
 a team a car on track 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.520
 percentage corresponds to the work that 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.049
 makes in simulation 5 10% of today 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.819
 it's the simulation work 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.229
 but no longer the simulator is work of 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.179
 simulation because then there are many 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.759
 tools that are also used in 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.009
 track that is not only if it is simulator 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.270
 pure and hard is simulation because there 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.220
 many changes that occur during 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.899
 the weekend that has not been 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.000
 the simulator of the simulator is basic 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.179
 because because when the department 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.580
 aerodynamics produces a a map 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.009
 aerodynamic new that gives more points of 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.200
 aerodynamic load but if we put it in 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.269
 the simulator and see the kilo we quantify 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.740
 quantify how much is the improvement and 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.900
 if it's really worth it 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.270
 production or not if you do not pass the test 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.650
 of the simulator often does not happen 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.140
 production with what you save a lot 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.580
 money as it gets virtually a 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.550
 new aerodynamic piece in the simulator 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.010
 good is all software is that they charge you 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.690
 a new program a new aroma because 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.610
 they call them and the car because it simulates 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.590
 if you have more adherence where in what 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.870
 type of curve at what heights of the car 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.790
 when we arrived at a circuit like that 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.210
 malaysia for example with this heat with 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.130
 this one with a layout so different to 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.010
 australia where we have never tried 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.600
 the v6 turbo of the new generation then 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.040
 I declare the first question that I 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.780
 I do after a few laps is how 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.090
 we go for consumption because what we have 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.800
 simulated in the simulator has to 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.110
 correspond to reality and the more 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.360
 next is better because it means that 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.190
 all the duties we have done this 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.980
 week in maranello know to be 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.660
 applicable to malaysia not anyway 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.560
 when you came to Ferrari is the truth 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.060
 that so that you never bet 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.900
 excessively by the simulator and I think 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.120
 that when you arrived was quite 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.310
 delayed the simulator project and not 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.440
 It was at the height of 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.230
 Of course, I knew that the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.239
 Ferrari simulator since I believe 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.030
 which is a formula trend change 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.599
 one is that the simulator was a bit 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.700
 where nobody wanted to go then in the end 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.400
 ends up working if someone was not 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.280
 enough then 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.959
 good to go to the racing team what 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.430
 awarded to the simulator this was how 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.189
 the formula one teams worked 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.450
 ten years ago now nowadays the 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.299
 better have to go to the simulator 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.310
 because that's really where you are 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.069
 is cooking everything that is going to happen 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.140
 in career and it's terribly important 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.269
 the help of fernando and kimi in the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.459
 simulator they are the only ones that are 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.900
 rolling now in malaysia with the car 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.819
 again then if I do not have the help 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.209
 of them we are nobody is to say 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.609
 we need your help and your dedication that 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.319
 we always give us at the end there 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.030
 that invest in simulation because it's the 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.440
 future and it's the fastest way anymore 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.569
 cheap to develop a car of 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.070
 formula one to finish what the 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.199
 simulator of what can happen with 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.660
 ferrari here in malaysia in the simulator 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.639
 the sensations were pretty good and 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.110
 I believe that the sensations are 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.710
 materializing here that they are better than 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.660
 in australia 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.789
 mercedes and being the strongest team 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.319
 as it has been showing but here we are 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.740
 better than in australia it's a circuit 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.120
 that we do better is a circuit where 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.639
 our car does not have to go better 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.039
 because there is more fast corner and there are 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.490
 more curve that is the reality currently 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:48.270
 is where it goes best is in fast curve and 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.270
 ambient
