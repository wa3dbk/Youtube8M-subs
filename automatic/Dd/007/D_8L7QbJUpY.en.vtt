00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.600 

so<00:00:00.989> here<00:00:01.260> we<00:00:01.319> are<00:00:01.350> again<00:00:01.560> out<00:00:02.100> in<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.370> sunshine

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
so here we are again out in the sunshine

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.980 
so here we are again out in the sunshine
and<00:00:03.230> the<00:00:04.230> solar<00:00:04.859> test<00:00:05.220> rig<00:00:05.490> has<00:00:05.850> made<00:00:06.690> another

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
and the solar test rig has made another

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.160 
and the solar test rig has made another
outing<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.940> it's<00:00:08.940> had<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> few<00:00:09.179> things<00:00:09.599> added

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
outing and it's had a few things added

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.709 
outing and it's had a few things added
to<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.800> they're<00:00:11.280> up<00:00:11.429> here<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.450> top

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
to it and they're up here in this top

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.709 
to it and they're up here in this top
right<00:00:12.900> hand<00:00:13.080> corner<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:14.210> from<00:00:15.210> left<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.480> right

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
right hand corner and from left to right

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.880 
right hand corner and from left to right
you've<00:00:15.929> got<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.740> MOSFET<00:00:17.310> there<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.590> then<00:00:19.590> down

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
you've got a MOSFET there and then down

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.730 
you've got a MOSFET there and then down
there<00:00:20.189> there's<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.730> Schottky<00:00:21.210> diode<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.810> that

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
there there's a Schottky diode and that

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.509 
there there's a Schottky diode and that
piece<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.820> wire<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:26.039> inductor<00:00:28.369> now<00:00:29.369> this

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
piece of wire is a and inductor now this

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.330 
piece of wire is a and inductor now this
configuration<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:31.140> buck<00:00:31.380> converter<00:00:31.679> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
configuration is a buck converter and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.940 
configuration is a buck converter and
it's<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.540> simplified<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> three

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
it's a simplified it's just the three

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.500 
it's a simplified it's just the three
components<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.880> took<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.149> straight<00:00:36.390> off

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
components and I took this straight off

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.350 
components and I took this straight off
Wikipedia<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.219> there's<00:00:38.460> nothing<00:00:38.610> fancy<00:00:38.910> here

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
Wikipedia so there's nothing fancy here

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.170 
Wikipedia so there's nothing fancy here
and<00:00:39.629> I've<00:00:40.050> no<00:00:40.350> way<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.430> knowing<00:00:41.790> yet<00:00:42.000> whether

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and I've no way of knowing yet whether

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.639 
and I've no way of knowing yet whether
these<00:00:42.390> components<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.440> right

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
these components are the right

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.700 
these components are the right
components<00:00:44.629> but<00:00:45.629> what's<00:00:46.320> interesting<00:00:46.469> about

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
components but what's interesting about

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.700 
components but what's interesting about
a<00:00:46.860> buck<00:00:47.070> converter<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> DC<00:00:49.170> state

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
a buck converter is that in the DC state

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.459 
a buck converter is that in the DC state
as<00:00:50.550> long<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> MOSFET<00:00:51.360> switched<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
as long as the MOSFET switched on and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.930 
as long as the MOSFET switched on and
I've<00:00:52.710> done<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.309> by<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.579> putting<00:00:53.640> this

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
I've done that by just putting this

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.380 
I've done that by just putting this
9-volt<00:00:54.510> battery<00:00:55.039> straight<00:00:56.039> across<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.730> gate

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
9-volt battery straight across the gate

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.560 
9-volt battery straight across the gate
and<00:00:57.600> source<00:00:57.840> terminals<00:00:58.969> that<00:00:59.969> cluster<00:01:00.449> of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and source terminals that cluster of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.229 
and source terminals that cluster of
components<00:01:01.199> effectively<00:01:02.039> does<00:01:02.219> nothing<00:01:02.609> or

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
components effectively does nothing or

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.270 
components effectively does nothing or
just<00:01:03.600> acts<00:01:03.809> as<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> piece<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.470> wire<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.159> can

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
just acts as a piece of wire and you can

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.390 
just acts as a piece of wire and you can
see<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.670> from<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.970> display<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:07.130> I've<00:01:08.130> got

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
see here from the display that I've got

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.840 
see here from the display that I've got

travelling<00:01:25.470> through<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.890> system<00:01:26.180> with<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
travelling through this system with the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.600 
travelling through this system with the
buck<00:01:27.479> converter<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.049> place<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.950> as<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.250> say<00:01:29.460> in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
buck converter in place but as I say in

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.910 
buck converter in place but as I say in
the<00:01:29.640> DC<00:01:29.939> state<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:31.170> does<00:01:31.470> nothing

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the DC state it does nothing

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.190 
the DC state it does nothing
and<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.000> passes<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> current<00:01:33.930> straight

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and so just passes the current straight

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.980 
and so just passes the current straight
through<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.680> that's<00:01:34.829> interesting<00:01:35.070> because

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
through and that's interesting because

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.810 
through and that's interesting because
when<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.110> thing<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.439> being<00:01:37.680> switched<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.579> can

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
when this thing is being switched it can

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.569 
when this thing is being switched it can
act<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.150> DC<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> DC<00:01:39.869> converter<00:01:40.470> when<00:01:41.460> it's

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
act as a DC to DC converter when it's

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.850 
act as a DC to DC converter when it's
not<00:01:41.790> being<00:01:41.820> switched<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.140> act<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.439> nothing

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
not being switched it can act as nothing

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.410 
not being switched it can act as nothing
and<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.700> could<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.939> quite<00:01:44.970> interesting

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and that could be quite interesting

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.590 
and that could be quite interesting
because<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.689> could<00:01:45.840> switch<00:01:46.079> between<00:01:46.290> MPPT<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
because we could switch between MPPT and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.380 
because we could switch between MPPT and
PWM<00:01:48.600> modes<00:01:49.070> depending<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.490> what<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
PWM modes depending on what what the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.090 
PWM modes depending on what what the
circumstances<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:54.259> so<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.439> next<00:01:55.619> step<00:01:55.890> for

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
circumstances are so the next step for

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.450 
circumstances are so the next step for
this<00:01:56.189> some<00:01:56.570> circuit<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.689> going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.619> put

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
this some circuit is going to be to put

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.959 
this some circuit is going to be to put
in<00:01:59.579> an<00:01:59.729> oscillator<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:01.340> preferably<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.820> will

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
in an oscillator and preferably it will

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.109 
in an oscillator and preferably it will
have<00:02:03.180> variable<00:02:03.960> frequency<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.159> variable

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
have variable frequency and variable

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.080 
have variable frequency and variable
mark<00:02:06.570> space<00:02:06.810> ratio<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.340> also<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:08.940> we're

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
mark space ratio and I also think we're

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.479 
mark space ratio and I also think we're
going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.270> need<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> capacitor<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.649> I've<00:02:10.709> got

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
going to need a capacitor so I've got

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.940 
going to need a capacitor so I've got
one<00:02:11.700> here<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.260> four<00:02:13.560> seven

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
one here it's a four seven

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
therefore 7mm microfarad 35 volt have no

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
just noticed that the the sun's gone in

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.710 
just noticed that the the sun's gone in
ironically<00:02:55.440> but<00:02:55.620> no<00:02:55.980> me<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.130> look<00:02:56.340> 19<00:02:57.060> just

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
ironically but no me I look 19 just

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.430 
ironically but no me I look 19 just
flicking<00:02:58.290> up<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.620> 20<00:02:59.010> watts<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.780> peak

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
flicking up to 20 watts and the peak

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.090 
flicking up to 20 watts and the peak
value<00:03:01.980> has<00:03:02.430> hit<00:03:03.290> twenty<00:03:04.290> point<00:03:04.560> eight<00:03:04.799> watts

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
value has hit twenty point eight watts

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.449 
value has hit twenty point eight watts
so<00:03:05.540> that's<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.780> 20<00:03:07.290> watt<00:03:07.410> solar<00:03:07.590> panel<00:03:07.709> into<00:03:08.310> an

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
so that's a 20 watt solar panel into an

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.309 
so that's a 20 watt solar panel into an
optimized<00:03:08.940> load<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:11.510> 20<00:03:12.510> Watts<00:03:12.660> peak<00:03:12.930> sun's

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
optimized load and 20 Watts peak sun's

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.210 
optimized load and 20 Watts peak sun's
gone<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.650> there<00:03:13.860> what<00:03:14.760> happens<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:17.040> one

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
gone in there what happens and just one

this in the graphical mode got this

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.380 
this in the graphical mode got this
interesting<00:03:21.989> pattern<00:03:22.829> you've<00:03:23.790> got<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.030> outer

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
interesting pattern you've got the outer

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.990 
interesting pattern you've got the outer

down<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:28.170> right-hand<00:03:28.470> side<00:03:29.070> but<00:03:29.880> also<00:03:30.060> got

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
down the right-hand side but also got

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.690

angles and they are

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.039 
angles and they are
when<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.280> was<00:03:35.489> at<00:03:35.609> different<00:03:36.000> power<00:03:36.299> points<00:03:36.840> by

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
when I was at different power points by

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.270 
when I was at different power points by
using<00:03:37.079> different<00:03:38.040> numbers<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.459> bulbs<00:03:38.910> on<00:03:39.120> my

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
load unit there

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.990 
load unit there
it's<00:03:42.959> where<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.410> Sun<00:03:43.680> went<00:03:44.220> behind<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.670> cloud

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
it's where the Sun went behind the cloud

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.390 
it's where the Sun went behind the cloud
and<00:03:45.420> then<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.410> course<00:03:46.440> both<00:03:46.859> voltage<00:03:47.370> and

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
and then of course both voltage and

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.030 
and then of course both voltage and
current<00:03:47.880> collapsed<00:03:48.600> together<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.859> just

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
current collapsed together so it just

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.340 
current collapsed together so it just
heads<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.640> zero<00:03:50.910> point<00:03:51.299> zero<00:03:51.480> zero<00:03:51.780> mark

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
heads to the zero point zero zero mark

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.000 
heads to the zero point zero zero mark
and<00:03:53.060> depending<00:03:54.060> on<00:03:54.150> where<00:03:55.079> I'd<00:03:55.350> set<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.829> load

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
and depending on where I'd set the load

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.120 
and depending on where I'd set the load
at<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.280> time<00:03:56.519> when<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.120> cloud<00:03:57.329> came<00:03:57.660> across

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
at the time when the cloud came across

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.069 
at the time when the cloud came across
depends<00:03:59.130> on<00:03:59.280> where<00:03:59.549> it<00:03:59.819> drew<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.329> spoke<00:04:00.750> line

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
depends on where it drew that spoke line

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.300 
depends on where it drew that spoke line
so<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.590> just<00:04:01.829> thought<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:01.980> was<00:04:02.160> an

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
so I just thought that was an

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.789 
so I just thought that was an
interesting<00:04:02.579> little<00:04:03.500> pattern<00:04:04.500> that<00:04:04.650> it

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
interesting little pattern that it

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.730 
interesting little pattern that it
emerged<00:04:05.130> on<00:04:05.459> there
