00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
one has a little bit of a wave in there

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
one has a little bit of a wave in there
so<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> does<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.509> I<00:01:09.840> mean<00:01:10.050> not<00:01:10.259> a<00:01:10.290> wave<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
so it does have I mean not a wave a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.080 
so it does have I mean not a wave a
little<00:01:10.860> bit<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> bump<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.520> there<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.940> does

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
little bit of a bump in there so it does

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.609 
little bit of a bump in there so it does
tend<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.420> give<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.690> a<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:12.990> bit<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.440> bomb

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
tend to give it a little bit of a bomb

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.280
