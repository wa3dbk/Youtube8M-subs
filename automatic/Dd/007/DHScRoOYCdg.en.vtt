00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
throughout the entire mission I thought

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.050 
throughout the entire mission I thought
it<00:01:09.119> meant<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.810> drop<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.590> period<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.850> got

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
