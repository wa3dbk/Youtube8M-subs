absolutely<00:00:51.179> devastated<00:00:51.510> when<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.710> heard<00:00:52.949> that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
absolutely devastated when I heard that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.950 
absolutely devastated when I heard that
they<00:00:53.280> had<00:00:53.370> canceled<00:00:53.850> first<00:00:54.120> assault<00:00:54.479> but

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
they had canceled first assault but

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.110 
they had canceled first assault but
which<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.069> something<00:00:56.339> that<00:00:56.370> lucasarts<00:00:56.969> was

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
which was something that lucasarts was

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.309 
which was something that lucasarts was
making<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.629> apparently<00:00:58.019> it<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.170> in

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
making and apparently it was in

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.660 
making and apparently it was in
preparation<00:00:59.069> to<00:00:59.359> make<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.690> new<00:01:01.379> battlefront<00:01:02.010> so

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
preparation to make a new battlefront so

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.189 
preparation to make a new battlefront so
it<00:01:02.819> looks<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.359> EA<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.899> went<00:01:04.019> ahead<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
it looks like the EA just went ahead and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.870 
it looks like the EA just went ahead and
scrap<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.920> decided<00:01:05.220> well<00:01:05.489> let's<00:01:05.519> just

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
scrap that and decided well let's just

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.899 
scrap that and decided well let's just
go<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> big<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:08.190> EA<00:01:08.520> tube

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
go with the big one here so with EA tube

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.820 
go with the big one here so with EA tube
I<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:10.140> they've<00:01:10.260> been<00:01:10.290> trying<00:01:10.620> to<00:01:10.710> go

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
I know that they've been trying to go

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.830 
I know that they've been trying to go
ahead<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.130> come<00:01:11.370> up<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.700> some<00:01:12.000> type<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.390> game

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
ahead and come up with some type of game

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.290 
ahead and come up with some type of game
to<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.200> ahead<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.620> replace<00:01:14.400> medal<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.120> honor

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
to go ahead and replace medal of honor

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.910 
to go ahead and replace medal of honor
because<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.020> didn't<00:01:16.410> work<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:16.680> too

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
because that just didn't work out too

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.700 
because that just didn't work out too
well<00:01:17.150> they<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.390> what<00:01:18.960> call<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.260> duty's<00:01:19.530> been

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.320 
well they like what call of duty's been
doing<00:01:20.010> switching<00:01:20.400> off<00:01:20.550> you<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.210> between

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
doing switching off you know between

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.360 
doing switching off you know between
treyarch<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.290> Activision<00:01:22.920> stuff<00:01:23.190> like<00:01:23.340> that

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
treyarch and Activision stuff like that

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.810 
treyarch and Activision stuff like that
here<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:24.600> infinity<00:01:25.110> ward<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.640> that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
here or infinity ward you know just that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.220 
here or infinity ward you know just that
every<00:01:27.150> other<00:01:27.270> year<00:01:27.480> they<00:01:27.660> make<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.870> different

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
every other year they make a different

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.140 
every other year they make a different
one<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.100> mean<00:01:29.460> EA<00:01:29.640> wants<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> do

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
one and so I mean EA wants to do

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.140 
one and so I mean EA wants to do
something<00:01:30.360> similar<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.230> but<00:01:31.620> I<00:01:32.150> that'd

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
something similar with that but I that'd

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.850 
something similar with that but I that'd
be<00:01:33.330> sweet<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:33.750> they<00:01:33.870> do<00:01:33.930> battle<00:01:34.230> field<00:01:34.620> one

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
be sweet if they do battle field one

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.080 
be sweet if they do battle field one
year<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:35.280> then<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.460> switch<00:01:35.670> off<00:01:35.880> with

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
year and then they switch off with

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.490 
year and then they switch off with
battle<00:01:36.480> front<00:01:37.010> that<00:01:38.010> would<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.220> epic<00:01:38.810> my<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.200> lot

apparently a lot of other people did so

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.920 
apparently a lot of other people did so
there's<00:03:26.010> always<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.730> fear<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.300> battlefront

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
there's always the fear that battlefront

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.520 
there's always the fear that battlefront
is<00:03:28.110> going<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.350> get<00:03:28.440> ruined<00:03:28.800> by<00:03:28.950> EA<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:30.780> you

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
is going to get ruined by EA but you

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.509

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
know it's one of those things I guess we

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.890 
know it's one of those things I guess we
got<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.730> wait<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.030> see<00:03:33.239> what<00:03:33.420> happens<00:03:33.450> with

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
got to wait and see what happens with
