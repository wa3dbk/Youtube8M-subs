00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 Hello to you the army would now be 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.040
 I wanted to introduce you to a mod that 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.259
 allow you to lose unnecessary heavy 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.630
 work from your shoulders using minions and 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.830
 so let's begin perhaps to begin with 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.410
 will have to do some insidious 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.089
 business and get the eighth level after 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.670
 what are you clamping the m key and 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.650
 listen to the dark voice he 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.439
 must approve your request for 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.180
 to have slaves and so we start here 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.550
 several options if you make a mistake 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.460
 first time you have to accumulate 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.610
 your eighth level is probably starting again 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:40.469
 from the first each variant has different 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:41.489
 voices yes what the fuck are you goji vrub 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.489
 duo flame 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.030
 Shoot my blood from my ears 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.890
 affairs 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.840
 Now we can notice that our 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.000
 the dark lord approved our request for 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.039
 then to have minions and how you can 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.059
 notice my arm is present 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.800
 and even three 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.460
 that principle is very cool at all 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.379
 it happens very rarely in this is 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.149
 tin actually it was lightning 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.680
 which promotes data management 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.430
 the minions that you actually are now 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.430
 call 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.869
 they look so cute questions 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.689
 them they are even without panties in general they 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.030
 will be your miners and also 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.670
 can say food getters 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.439
 perhaps let's start from the beginning I 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.509
 pointing to a sheep right-click 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:30.060
 the mouse and one of them runs and raises it 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.790
 straight ahead of you 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.560
 tin I do not know why I would throw now 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.869
 they took it over raw ruled 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.479
 me up to generally yes they can also 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.990
 transfer these things from side to 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.880
 side as you do not order this one of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.119
 basic abilities if we allow this 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.729
 Carries one sheep and you need to say 2 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.009
 or as many as four you point to the second 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.409
 and here he actually raised it and judging by 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.290
 all telekinesis raised I understand 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.460
 we can also raise a cow chicken and 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.680
 other sentient beings in general we are now 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.290
 let's leave these sheep and hitting left in peace 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.319
 click on it and as you see it 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.069
 it turns out was shocked by this and let go 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.180
 given sheep 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.420
 that principle is very much in my opinion on 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.790
 We listen and in general we will start to dig 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.489
 land down so how are they 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.549
 miners in their basic configuration 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.890
 for this you hold down the m key and you 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.599
 may notice several options 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.000
 which you can actually use 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.359
 the bottom one cancels all commands 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.459
 I mean just nothing we hold again 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.469
 we choose the first option which on the very 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.739
 really removes all minions to nowhere 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:44.829
 just nowhere again your staff probably 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.349
 call them back caused them back and 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:51.040
 choose the second option and the second option 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.549
 allow us to dig down down down to 7 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.819
 level 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.540
 I think it's just great and how are you 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.419
 may notice 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.189
 they start to drip all together and fun 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:02.169
 that's what i think is just super as 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.599
 sometimes you just donâ€™t have enough time 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:07.329
 to dig a huge cave 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.430
 they are capable of it they will drip 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.769
 until you tell them to do 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.959
 something else and the thing is 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.379
 they will build for themselves 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.329
 here is the ladder that will be 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:22.030
 your way down they will dig up 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.709
 level seven i repeat them i think 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.959
 you understand what it really is 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.389
 just a huge distance so for 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.299
 That they are building us a ladder is just 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:33.639
 chic in my opinion and so on until i'm not 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.680
 build i would like to tell you about 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.780
 which is actually all these blocks which 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.569
 they take them now they take them 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.239
 get here and here these backpacks and 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.609
 afterwards in the end they can 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.829
 you just give them away 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.290
 all the resources that they will be in this 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.329
 Journey to this fun journey 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.120
 agree guys even so fun to dig 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.030
 in general okay at the moment you we 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.530
 may have noticed that one of them 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.359
 teleported here's another teleportation 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.000
 happened yes they possess such 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.669
 abilities and such ability is very 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.810
 often appear with them then when they 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.209
 stumble on lava 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.329
 they just teleport through her 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.650
 or let's say the other way 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.549
 opposite from her to actually 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.959
 do no harm to yourself even if you beat them 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.010
 nothing will happen i mean by 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.380
 least they won't die 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.720
 You saw me hit him 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.700
 even if he continues to work here 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.640
 this is real hard work on my 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.500
 look and you can see what they are 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.140
 pretty and quickly break through such 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.740
 huge number of blocks and can be 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.740
 We will wait 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.370
 guys I think what you are missing 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.740
 made sure that they would dig up 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.450
 seventh level all the resources that they 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.790
 raised afterwards they can also 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.190
 put in a chest how to do it very 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.530
 just for starters i still cover it 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:09.320
 place that you could see 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:11.390
 then I'll tell you not shut up think for 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:17.270
 even with such a discharge they are not 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:19.790
 shut up they actually don't care all yes 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.010
 all calm down calm you without 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.690
 control these guys in general I clamped 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.580
 right click pointed at them and they 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.470
 Throw away all the resources that they have extracted 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.160
 consequences you may notice 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:35.090
 later my enough is enough you just 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.860
 click on the general command to remove them all 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.530
 and because they really are already 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.800
 fed up now we will highlight this place and 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.710
 continue to demonstrate their abilities 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.420
 if they recently dug down then now they 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:53.780
 will dig in the side you're called back and 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:56.060
 point to this wall they start 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.640
 dig in wog i think it is very good 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.530
 idea to mine diamonds 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.900
 imagine you live to be 8 or 12 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.940
 level and then tell him to dig in 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.100
 side and by the way for themselves they 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.160
 leave here such here that the torch 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:13.370
 will serve as lighting for you guys 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.380
 well done you are just fine as well 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.160
 you want to do it all a little 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.510
 quicker you can point one more 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.790
 so that he dug in another 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.130
 direction and he will start to cover in another 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.800
 direction is just great 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:31.100
 agree each of these four 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.900
 can dig in its direction also 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.790
 you can make these minions dig 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.470
 on this system that you specify it 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.450
 just go through this tab and 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.230
 choose your own characteristics 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.280
 I will leave as they are 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.890
 clamp and as you see at this 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.430
 moment us cube is also in a one-time right 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:53.690
 mouse button and they start digging forward 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:55.580
 forward, I said everything amicably, well, how are you 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.280
 you can see it all just great and 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.870
 effective in my opinion but that's all 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.060
 Here they say extracted resource from 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:05.070
 consequences of accounting did not understand 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.020
 really so assholes in general they 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.420
 extracted resources later this here 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.970
 dig in point at right chest 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.680
 mouse button and they run leave everything 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.440
 resources in this very chest I think 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.540
 it's just great you got chong yes they 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.490
 extracted here is the approximate amount of resources 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.800
 which they got here by digging up this 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.790
 water square i think what is the principle 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.920
 very cool 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.690
 also wanted to tell you what you can 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.760
 fry all any creatures that 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:32.190
 is nearby using this 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.830
 wonderful late to which radiates 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.930
 This is a lightning. I think it's just. 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.210
 cool but minions it does not affect 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.410
 they won't die you gouge them 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.500
 batter and they do not care 

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.790
 no panties and bullies in general here and in 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.010
 principle and everything that I wanted you 

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.600
 tell about this mod I 

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.280
 I think it's just great what you have 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.080
 now there will be such Arabs 

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.570
 since we play more or less for 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.880
 insidious character at the moment so 

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:59.610
 how did you listen to the dark voice and 

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.180
 he gave us this wonderful one 

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:05.490
 staff I think you guys understand well, that's 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:10.610
 all if you like and very much 

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:10.610
 you were 8 see you in new series bye
