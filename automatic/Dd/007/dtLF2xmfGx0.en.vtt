00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.850
 associated with entering a password code 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:41.059

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.690
 the standard screen rotation test is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:57.059

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.739
 as smoothly as on its 6 was let's 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.739
 run the appstore 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.120

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.980

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.230
 the same opening animation is not smooth 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:59.760

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:20.540
 let's look at the construction sites that we have 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:26.709

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.709

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.410
 Sorry now the opportunity to return 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.330
 at 6 there is no one can 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.660
 overcome again by preserving 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:18.260
 with hiv cache if we have something you can 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:20.740
 try again in something just now 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.740

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.640

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.940

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.770

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.910

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:02.450
 got better keyboard 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:05.510
 besides, she is also free like this 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:11.140
 she looks like there are opportunities in 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.140
 first there is a cover 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.579
 various themes in bright colors in dark 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.579
 tones 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.610
 secondly naturally supports svayp 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.150
 at the same time what I liked 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.370
 maintained unlike standard 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.740
 standard google keyboard 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.020
 which for some reason only hold your own 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.310
 Russian in English is not here 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.710
 support us and our 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.150
 English words regarding 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.440

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.470
 the answer is weak too 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.580
 can be configured will pop up letter 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.030
 or not when pressed 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:17.010
 so to speak and with great effect 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:21.880
 it's all about us tune in as well 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:29.669
 there is a voice year on the space press and 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:31.840
 keep a text message you see 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.140
 accordingly what is our language now 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.550
 enabled by default such 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.550
 voice input will be perceived by us 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:48.780
 from here we can if we wound up not 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.780
 twitter send message to twitter 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.240
 if we want 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.260
 enter sprawled and various then 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.110
 enough in the case of tsifer they are 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.390
 on top of the letters we just swipe 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:09.160
 up case 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:15.850
 lower case down very quickly and 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:17.260
 conveniently naturally there are clues 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.390
 there is a very comfortable keyboard all 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:24.010
 it works you can drive just letters 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:29.620
 You can swipe all the way and by the way already 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:41.510
 there are words and even 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:42.670
 in the torus a Russian mat is crammed 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.900
 thing here 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.860
 I recommend eating accordingly
