00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
instructions and it was pretty simple

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.720 
instructions and it was pretty simple
really<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:56.039> create<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.460> very

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
really and you create this very

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.110 
really and you create this very
elaborate<00:00:58.370> structure<00:00:59.370> so<00:00:59.609> I'll<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.910> try<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
elaborate structure so I'll just try to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.580 
elaborate structure so I'll just try to
move<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.020> closer<00:01:01.260> look<00:01:06.590> so

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
move it in here so you a closer look so

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.280 
move it in here so you a closer look so
you<00:01:07.619> see<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> whole<00:01:09.479> book<00:01:09.780> none<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
you see this is a whole book none of the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.770 
you see this is a whole book none of the
pages<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.799> been<00:01:10.920> cut<00:01:11.100> out<00:01:11.330> see<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> edge

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
pages have been cut out see on the edge

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440 
pages have been cut out see on the edge
you<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.760> simply<00:01:15.240> start

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
you have here and you just simply start

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.580 
you have here and you just simply start
in<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> center<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.990> start<00:01:16.259> doing<00:01:16.409> these

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
in the center and you start doing these

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.370 
in the center and you start doing these
elaborate<00:01:17.130> folds<00:01:17.850> well<00:01:17.970> they're<00:01:18.090> not<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
elaborate folds well they're not that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
you can see how this is done but then

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.990 
you can see how this is done but then
after<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> got<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.740> all<00:01:31.829> folded<00:01:32.340> together

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
after I got it all folded together

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.649 
after I got it all folded together
um<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.750> added<00:01:34.590> these<00:01:35.340> large<00:01:35.880> Brad's<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.780 
um I added these large Brad's to the
corners<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.380> glued<00:01:37.799> down<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.250> sheets<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
corners and glued down this sheets the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.120 
corners and glued down this sheets the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
pages that I had left to make a little

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.990 
pages that I had left to make a little
bit<00:01:41.280> more<00:01:41.430> stable

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
bit more stable

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.340 
cardboard and glued it to the back of
this<00:02:05.340> now<00:02:05.850> when<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.630> my<00:02:06.719> first<00:02:06.990> attempt

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
this now when I this is my first attempt

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.540 
this now when I this is my first attempt
so<00:02:07.500> when<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> make<00:02:07.920> another<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.369> these<00:02:08.489> I

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
so when I make another one of these I

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.130 
so when I make another one of these I
think<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.819> would<00:02:08.970> paint<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.420> first<00:02:09.750> before<00:02:09.959> I

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
think I would paint this first before I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.080 
think I would paint this first before I
glue<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.379> down<00:02:10.679> maybe<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.550> basic<00:02:11.879> black

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
glue it down maybe just a basic black

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.940 
glue it down maybe just a basic black
and<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.989> I'm<00:02:13.080> going<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.319> get<00:02:13.410> a

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and then I'm going to get a

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.070 
and then I'm going to get a
you're<00:02:14.069> hanger<00:02:14.340> kit<00:02:15.000> put<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.599> on<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.780> back<00:02:15.900> I'm

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
you're hanger kit put it on the back I'm

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.199 
you're hanger kit put it on the back I'm
gonna<00:02:16.200> hang<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.560> wall<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.879> really

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
gonna hang it on the wall but it really

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.880 
gonna hang it on the wall but it really
didn't<00:02:18.390> take<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> lot<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.840> time<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.200> do<00:02:19.349> it<00:02:19.379> once

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
didn't take a lot of time to do it once

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.559 
didn't take a lot of time to do it once
you<00:02:19.980> got<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.250> hang<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.849> think<00:02:21.450> it's

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
you got the hang of it I think it's

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.820 
you got the hang of it I think it's
really<00:02:21.720> kind<00:02:22.019> of<00:02:22.110> neat<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.470> there's<00:02:22.680> all

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
really kind of neat and there's all

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.470 
really kind of neat and there's all
kinds<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.400> variations<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.150> if<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.330> do<00:02:24.450> a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
kinds of variations and if you do a

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.680 
kinds of variations and if you do a
youtube<00:02:24.989> search<00:02:25.610> you'll<00:02:26.610> probably<00:02:26.790> find<00:02:27.330> all

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
youtube search you'll probably find all

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.780 
youtube search you'll probably find all
kinds<00:02:28.019> of<00:02:28.080> different<00:02:28.260> variations<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.160> this

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
kinds of different variations of this

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.970 
kinds of different variations of this
kind<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.209> structure<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.959> really<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:31.709> open

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
kind of structure and really it's open

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.280 
kind of structure and really it's open
to<00:02:32.099> your<00:02:32.220> interpretation<00:02:32.810> as<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.870> what<00:02:34.170> you

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
want to do with it so just another idea

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.740 
want to do with it so just another idea
book<00:02:37.739> sculpture<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.489> call<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> book<00:02:39.269> sculpture<00:02:39.720> I
