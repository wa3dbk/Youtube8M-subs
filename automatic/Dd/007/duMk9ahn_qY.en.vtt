00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.390 
hi this is Jon and in this clip we will
be<00:00:03.000> laying<00:00:03.480> out<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.140> drilling<00:00:04.589> our<00:00:04.920> stud

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
be laying out and drilling our stud

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.059 
be laying out and drilling our stud
holes<00:00:05.779> now<00:00:06.779> since<00:00:07.109> we<00:00:07.290> are<00:00:07.319> building<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.859> coat

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
holes now since we are building a coat

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.330 
holes now since we are building a coat
rack<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.639> coats<00:00:09.330> can<00:00:09.750> get<00:00:10.050> pretty<00:00:10.290> heavy<00:00:10.559> we

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
rack and coats can get pretty heavy we

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.120 
rack and coats can get pretty heavy we
have<00:00:11.490> six<00:00:11.849> hooks<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.200> could<00:00:13.380> feasibly<00:00:13.679> have

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
have six hooks so we could feasibly have

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.120 
have six hooks so we could feasibly have
six<00:00:14.610> different<00:00:15.269> coats<00:00:15.870> hanging<00:00:16.560> out<00:00:16.800> our<00:00:16.920> coat

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
six different coats hanging out our coat

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.429 
six different coats hanging out our coat
rack<00:00:17.340> what<00:00:18.090> we<00:00:18.210> need<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.600> do<00:00:18.750> when<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.020> install

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
rack what we need to do when we install

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.390 
rack what we need to do when we install
it<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.430> install<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:21.390> into<00:00:21.660> studs<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
it is to install it into studs in the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.550 
it is to install it into studs in the
wall<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.840> prevent<00:00:25.350> it

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
wall and this is going to prevent it

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.130 
wall and this is going to prevent it
from<00:00:25.769> pulling<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.119> wall<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
from pulling out of the wall with the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.800 
from pulling out of the wall with the
weight<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> coats<00:00:29.060> now<00:00:30.060> essentially<00:00:30.660> what

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
weight of the coats now essentially what

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.569 
weight of the coats now essentially what
we're<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.289> be<00:00:31.410> doing<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.920> install<00:00:32.369> this

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
we're going to be doing to install this

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.670 
we're going to be doing to install this
is<00:00:32.850> we're<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.180> take<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.510> long<00:00:33.840> screw<00:00:34.440> and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
is we're going to take a long screw and

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.290 
is we're going to take a long screw and
we're<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> screw<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.850> right<00:00:35.880> through

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
we're going to screw it right through

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.700 
we're going to screw it right through
our<00:00:36.390> project<00:00:37.079> into<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> stud<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> wall

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
our project into a stud in the wall

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.100 
our project into a stud in the wall
however<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.920> also<00:00:40.950> want<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:42.059> make<00:00:42.329> our<00:00:42.510> project

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
however we also want to make our project

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.900 
however we also want to make our project
look<00:00:43.379> good<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.980> what<00:00:44.129> we're<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.670> is

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
look good so what we're going to do is

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.479 
look good so what we're going to do is
countersink<00:00:45.750> our<00:00:46.020> screws<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.860> we're<00:00:47.370> going

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
countersink our screws and we're going

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.180 
countersink our screws and we're going
to<00:00:47.550> install<00:00:47.670> these<00:00:48.120> buttons<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.960> top<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:50.010> those

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
to install these buttons on top of those

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.819 
to install these buttons on top of those
countersunk<00:00:50.940> screws<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.110> that's<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.770> to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
countersunk screws and that's going to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
countersunk screws and that's going to
cover<00:00:53.129> those<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.820> give<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:54.960> nice

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
cover those up and give it a really nice

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.770 
cover those up and give it a really nice
finished<00:00:55.860> look<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.879> first<00:00:57.180> we're<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.539> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
finished look now first we're going to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.099 
finished look now first we're going to
measure<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.440> distance<00:00:58.949> between<00:00:59.359> each<00:01:00.359> peg

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
measure the distance between each peg

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.429 
measure the distance between each peg
which<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.829> about<00:01:02.039> six<00:01:02.760> inches<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.449> we're

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
which is about six inches and we're

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.600 
which is about six inches and we're
going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> come<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.100> make<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> mark<00:01:07.610> halfway

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
going to come in and make a mark halfway

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.630 
going to come in and make a mark halfway
between<00:01:09.090> those<00:01:09.540> pegs<00:01:10.010> we're<00:01:11.010> also<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
between those pegs we're also going to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.830 
between those pegs we're also going to
make<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> mark<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.770> other<00:01:14.010> way<00:01:14.250> at<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:15.600> halfway

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
make a mark the other way at the halfway

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.450 
make a mark the other way at the halfway
mark<00:01:19.369> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.909> give<00:01:21.090> us<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.420> little

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
mark this is going to give us a little

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.420 
mark this is going to give us a little
crosshair<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.909> where<00:01:24.259> we<00:01:25.259> should<00:01:25.500> drill<00:01:25.860> for

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
crosshair for where we should drill for

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.880 
crosshair for where we should drill for
our<00:01:26.700> screws<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.299> go<00:01:27.450> next<00:01:28.409> we're<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
our screws to go next we're going to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.469 
our screws to go next we're going to
drill<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.189> pilot<00:01:29.310> hole<00:01:29.700> through<00:01:30.329> our

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
drill a pilot hole through our

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.660 
drill a pilot hole through our
crosshairs<00:01:30.780> all<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.220> way<00:01:32.310> through<00:01:32.340> our

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
crosshairs all the way through our

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.149 
crosshairs all the way through our
project<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.560> just<00:01:34.560> make<00:01:34.740> sure<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.009> don't

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
project and just make sure you don't

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:52.920 
project and just make sure you don't
drill<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.700> hole<00:01:35.790> through<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.390> table<00:01:36.780> below<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.090 

next<00:01:53.930> we're<00:01:54.080> going<00:01:54.230> to<00:01:54.350> be<00:01:54.560> drilling<00:01:54.860> our

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
next we're going to be drilling our

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.090 
next we're going to be drilling our
counter<00:01:55.490> sink<00:01:55.790> hole<00:01:56.030> with<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.750> 38<00:01:57.380> inch<00:01:57.680> drill

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
counter sink hole with a 38 inch drill

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.520 
counter sink hole with a 38 inch drill
bit<00:01:58.160> and<00:01:58.520> we're<00:01:59.420> just<00:01:59.540> going<00:01:59.660> to<00:01:59.930> drill<00:02:00.320> that

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
bit and we're just going to drill that

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:13.309 
bit and we're just going to drill that
down<00:02:01.240> about<00:02:02.350> three-eighths<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.530> an<00:02:03.650> inch

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.569 

then<00:02:14.319> we<00:02:14.530> can<00:02:14.680> go<00:02:14.769> ahead<00:02:14.799> and<00:02:14.980> test<00:02:15.340> our

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
then we can go ahead and test our

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.580 
then we can go ahead and test our
buttons<00:02:15.969> in<00:02:16.269> those<00:02:16.689> holes<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.260> we<00:02:17.379> just

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
buttons in those holes that we just

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.989 
buttons in those holes that we just
drilled<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:19.359> looks<00:02:19.540> pretty<00:02:19.810> nice
