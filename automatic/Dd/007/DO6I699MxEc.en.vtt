00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.200
 It was originally a simple top-down perspective 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.220
 Police and robber games 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.540
 In the beginning its name was Race'n'Chase. 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.640
 And now it 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.780
 And now it grows like this 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.980
 This is Grand Theft Auto. 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.400
 The original GTAIV should be set to 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.880
 Free state 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.720
 Free state and not just 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.640
 Free State, not just Liberty City 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.280
 It will contain mountains and forests around the city. 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.115
 Just like GTAV 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.640
 But based on time constraints 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.760
 They can only focus on developing cities 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.620
 Almost all Grand Theft Auto titles use Price down fonts 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.040
 It actually uses the same font as the popular TV show Price is Right (price guess) 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.540
 There is evidence that Rockstar's game may follow 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.780
 Grand Theft Auto exists in the same world 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.420
 For example, in GTAV in an apartment in Franklin 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.240
 There is a book called Red Dead author J. Marston 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.219
 If you don't know 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.700
 This is the protagonist John or Jack Marston who smashed the game blood. 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.980
 The game Grand Theft Auto (Manhunt) takes place 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.360
 A fictional city of Carcer City 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.680
 And this city is actually mentioned many times in the GTA. 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.680
 Whether in conversation or on a radio station 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.920
 Trevor: "Mike, brother, which is the first bank you grab?" 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.760
 Mike: "In the suburb of Carcer in 1988" 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.820
 Bullworth College exists in both GTAIV and bully Rooney 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.540
 It appears in GTA's TV show I'm Rich 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.060
 Months before the release of GTA5 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.200
 Some loyal fans predicted the map of GTA5 on the GTA forum 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.480
 This map has quite unscientific fineness 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.680
 They are derived from analyzing each message. 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.360
 They come from various trailers, advertisements, pictures, interviews and 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.600
 Other Rockstar's pre-play video collection leads 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.780
 GTAIV protagonist Niko Bellic is derived from Russian actor 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.580
 The role played by Vladimir Mashkov in the blockade line (2001) 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.400
 If you put them together, you will find that the two are very similar. 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.540
 Even invited him to voice himself, but was eventually rejected. 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.840
 Later, Rockstar did the same thing in GTA5. 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.860
 But this time, let the protagonist match his voice. 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.280
 In the Three Leaf Clover mission of GTA4 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.680
 Can kill the protagonist Gais Tony's protagonist Luis 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.160
 He will hang on the floor with the hostage in a cutscenes animation. 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.040
 However, killing him does not have a real impact on the story. 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.920
 Rockstar actually hired a real criminal in GTAV 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.560
 To dub the various criminals in the game 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.160
 Just to make the game more realistic 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.740
 Let criminals improvise conversations for a long time 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.380
 Instead of following the script to make the game closer to reality 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.660
 One of the voice actors was invited to dub one day after being released from prison. 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.180
 Back in 1999, when GTA2 was released 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.200
 Rockstar or DMA Design of the year 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.160
 Also made a short video for the game 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.260
 It is a short film composed of several cutscenes to promote the game. 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.520
 The story is the protagonist Claude Speed 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.400
 Being chased by armed groups around a group of cities 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.900
 Because it is just an 8-minute short film for publicity. 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.120
 The official never gave him an official name. 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.280
 Everyone generally calls it GTA2: The Movie 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.740
 Although the film is no longer on the official website. 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.080
 But we can still watch it on Youtube. 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.980
 Back to 2001 released by GTA3 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.800
 Some things have changed and removed due to respect for 911 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.340
 For example, the color of the police car has been changed. 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.360
 Because of the old blue-and-white stripes, the long color is like the color of the New York Police Department. 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.080
 Boxed art drawings have also been redesigned, partly because of the 911 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.260
 This is the original cover, which is the cover map of the European version. 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.400
 Changed to the US version of the cover page at the last minute 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.600
 A character named Darkel is deleted 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.940
 But you can still find him in the end of the game and in the game file. 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.820
 Another task is to open a plane that has lost most of its wings. 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.760
 This mission has been deleted, but the plane can still be found in the game. 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.880
 And it really can fly, but it’s super hard to control 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.440
 When someone asks how much this changes with the original version 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.680
 Rockstar said it has probably changed 1% 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.960
 Only changed a task related to terrorists 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.640
 Changed some art details like the details of the car 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.540
 Some common pedestrians and some radio stations 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.780
 We all know that the Grand Theft Auto series is one of the biggest video games. 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.240
 But GTAV is another level. 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.780
 Even GTAV was released last year (2013) 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.140
 It is the sixth best selling video game in the world (I just saw it is the fourth, plus PC, PS4, X1 d (`・∀・)b) 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.600
 This is impressive, considering that he is only on two platforms. 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.833
 Xbox360 

00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:48.497
 And PlayStation3 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.980
 So far, it has sold 32.5 million copies on two platforms. 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.140
 Compared to GTA4, it was published in 2008 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.360
 It is now in the 14th position 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.400
 (The highest-selling action game in 24 hours) (The highest-selling game in 24 hours) (The fastest entertainment product that breaks through $1 billion in revenue) (The fastest game that breaks through $1 billion in revenue) (The highest in 24 hours) Revenue games) (The most revenue-generating entertainment products in 24 hours) (The most popular action games for watching trailers) GTA5 has maintained 7 Gold World records so far 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.400
 (thanks for watching)
