 empty hours watching show today

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.170
 some loose curls that my normal 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.510

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.600

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.960
 late but also like I start with 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.260
 protecting her step by step 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.300

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.989
 brackets on the side so you will need one 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.150
 kind came and suggests you find one is 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.470
 appear super nice because I have my 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.330
 Going to make curls don't have to 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.400
 use 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.989
 I therefore pulled it out 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.400
 I start to divide my hair 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.839
 I do this because I had it easier 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.769
 find my heart to you this way 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.180
 shavings 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.250
 I do this through a street on top of my 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.840
 make head and a lot of pluck to 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.670
 bottom yet to unleash 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.909
 then my name is van hey start with bottom 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.909
 plugs 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.290
 I also grab the bottom seat 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.860
 sets up and make a half too little 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.290
 my hair straightener 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.790
 then I just press down 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.340
 but it again a half turn a bush 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.970
 and all comes down again and according 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.970
 there is such a sound 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.340
 also done one to the next point 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.010
 and that's how I got all my hair 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.840
 downwards depends so up there 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.369
 I would take my head out and leave a few 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.500
 picking that act downward 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.780
 that I read okay this now gives 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.640
 and because I still have a lot of curls 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.110
 picking are not then I have to make one 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.240
 slightly smaller strikes and 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.229
 I do the last picking a little later 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.670
 exactly the same way 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.290
 I pick another pick with ordered then 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.420
 make half a train 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.220
 iron down with whom half a 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.240
 turn and iron down and then 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.160
 you return to sound and the cloth 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.019
 activity then help tail and 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.160
 out at the top by the latter 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.160
 pick a few and then I'm done 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.830
 toll road lies to the front two 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.620
 picking on the side of your face 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.180
 straight is times with the flat iron 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.709
 then insert on the back 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.709
 her fit just wants something there 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.550
 please give me the used if it 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.230
 better best too and so that it lasts longer 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.230
 model remains and with that ready
