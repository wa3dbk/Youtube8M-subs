00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.490
 if it costs on all the corners of 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.290
 been if these minecraft are to you 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.190
 random because we have here at least 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.690
 once again shop the www 43a and one add 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.830
 the many things that he opens that 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.110
 I have to teach so we're going to 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.280
 start telling you that you still have not 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.530
 discovered that change of my little thing 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.750
 Home is always better have me 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.790
 done the lever is turned north to 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.960
 south to north west to the back not that 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.329
 it is not is not the lever of agreement 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.860
 when I hope they realize now and 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.780
 well let's start let's start 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.850
 well we have two new shoppings worth 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.030
 we have all here with their woods and with 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.230
 I will show you the bushes 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.230
 cassia sampling 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.100
 and this one here is the challenge 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.590
 link is valid with their respective woods 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.260
 that are identical to doing it there already 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.600
 the other to the oak and then also 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.550
 they are identical of the brave bushes 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.620
 does not change any of that other ways we're going 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.390
 to see them grow 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.710
 we find them here the dust of 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.710
 bone here is 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.350
 and let's put a few here 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.970
 I am such that 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.630
 and this is chosen upwards but 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.630
 they usually grow sideways 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.600
 well we were not usually grow as 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.280
 a little bit of side is worth 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.900
 the truth that he will not put four 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.050
 together but I'm saying it's not going to come out 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.320
 nothing 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.350
 it would come out to them that is exactly what 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.350
 that we were looking for is a kind of 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.119
 side the weird vale we have it is here 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.979
 which is usually grow with four 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.229
 together you see here you can not grow up worth 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.850
 however much we give it, it will not grow 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.330
 but we have to put four vouchers and with 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.740
 four you get this 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.840
 okay 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.220
 the way has not changed does not change anything 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.400
 it is only sapiens himself that has 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.330
 changed 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.330
 And there we have it 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.710
 is a game a little bit more and more 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.710
 but good 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.760
 the end and then as you see 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.890
 the bush ends up being the same as 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.690
 it's always ok but we 'll find it 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.630
 also here below here are the others 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.940
 bushes and then in this case down here 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.940
 we would find the two woods worth 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.860
 the acacia and the thin oak equal 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.190
 Jungle plot really asks 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.849
 question can you put davis cup in the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.849
 acacia 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.850
 you can put on let's check them 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.790
 the ladies of a moment 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.880
 you are not going to put the power to touch in the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.520
 oak of hunting does not let us be worth 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.500
 much that has the same texture does not 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.500
 you can put them ok 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:04.710
 you can burn this wood in the oven 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.710
 and all that roll then look quickly 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.690
 I do not say anything I will not say that we 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.060
 we know 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.490
 exactly works without any kind of 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.730
 inconvenient of agreement as you have 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.730
 viewed 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.940
 but 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.909
 but 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.550
 will teach us something I will teach you 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.550
 something 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.370
 forgive me 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.750
 moment the moment lapse is worth what 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.700
 you can put gavin can burn 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.220
 quietly ha ha ha super physique 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.920
 we have the same thing this is already valid 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.040
 Isolated agreed the food you 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.310
 you agree also added with these three 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.910
 cosillas 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.650
 the colo colorado the salmon 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.680
 and here is the color is the clown fish 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.600
 OK, well, here is not what 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.549
 You will also be able to get the 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.650
 legend is not yet put why we 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.330
 I'm teaching it but they said it's going 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.890
 to be to come out also of the squid 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.040
 It's worth when you eat a squid that goes to 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.630
 give a wolfhound like these according 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.060
 we believe that I do the same thing 4 or 5 and 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.590
 does not send anything so they have not put it 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.880
 now but they're going to put the 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.620
 except that is what they have said agreement 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.470
 Whether it's true or not is already a 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.360
 mystery for life 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.340
 more things in the music box that have 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.010
 changed good they have changed that the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.270
 discs now have a name 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:52.020
 all are 418 as you see ok as before 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.820
 great before but before the 418 13 418 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.760
 blogs with three rights 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.249
 ch creep have now put the record 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.500
 they agree 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:05.169
 is what they seek to change without novelty 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.389
 as you see so nothing super 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.240
 and then as a new command they have put a 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.639
 set world span is valid for you to put 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.020
 spam what you want then 060 to 0 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:19.190
 For example, this is valid when you give spam 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.930
 it's going to change 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.630
 to those coordinates of agreement you already know 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.410
 that 0 will be 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.889
 x 60 that will be the height and z will be what 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.840
 others are worth 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.759
 that more things have changed good in 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.169
 change also good here we go 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.490
 to teach because in star because 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.150
 you know who he is and where great 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.400
 ship but when before before in the 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.229
 little boat you rode if you could throw 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.389
 arrows calmly okay now you're going to 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.669
 be able to throw arrows and at the same time turn 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.620
 before you could not assert it instead 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.270
 it is also the added thing here is very 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.699
 difficult the ocean program and it is a 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.349
 true madness okay I hope what 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.660
 improve because he himself has 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.249
 liked and is fatal fact 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.589
 and well then we have this too 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:07.219
 this is very good, you can not 

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:09.710
 mount here your own own map voucher 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:11.480
 you come here and know 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.520
 we would be trees out there are 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.160
 appearing 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.720
 although the two trees are good 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.720
 we have there we just planted not 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.000
 I move 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.250
 really great how nice good map 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.290
 now we come here and we zoom and 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.330
 the map is planted that we 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.940
 what are we going to do is we have this map 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.220
 here agreement we caught another map we 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.289
 we go to this corner and explore the 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.389
 map of that corner of agreement 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.680
 when we will explore in that corner what 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.409
 we put here then you are doing your 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.849
 own giant map in your own home 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:51.270
 what you have around that comes the 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:52.589
 true that very well that something else with the 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.300
 rada mouse you know that you can catch the 

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:56.300
 objects true then the map 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:05.140
 the map is the one that is going to give you 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.450
 maybe he left me but he did leave 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:10.300
 it has been an error of mine totally a 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:13.000
 fail of those fools 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.650
 and I think that already here it is already so that you 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.020
 you liked to like it subscribe and 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.900
 fuck wants 1.7 because there 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.270
 too many new things from my point 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.909
 view has added too much what 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:27.310
 you think it 's too much the 1.7 with 

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:29.379
 other versions or it's fine you do not want 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.259
 more things because from my point of view 

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:35.169
 that if new land that if the sand that 

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:37.750
 yes all the crystals that if a 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:42.750
 block and here all these bio flowers more 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.750
 new more crystals more up links 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.129
 I do not know a lot of things too much 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.289
 that if the books around here the cane 

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:51.300
 fish that did not burn donkin what 

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:52.919
 you think what do you think I have it 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.300
 comments is worth and nothing like and
