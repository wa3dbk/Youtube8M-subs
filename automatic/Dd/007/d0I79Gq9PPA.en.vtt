00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
writing and that would be spelling and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.920 
writing and that would be spelling and
punctuation<00:02:51.730> consistency<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:53.060> then<00:02:53.690> once

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
punctuation consistency and then once

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.360 
punctuation consistency and then once
