00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
cool because yeah for example lately on

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.960 
cool because yeah for example lately on
the<00:01:43.439> minecraft<00:01:44.009> server<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.369> run<00:01:44.610> into<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the minecraft server I run into the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.170 
the minecraft server I run into the
problem<00:01:45.119> ahead<00:01:45.509> efficiency<00:01:46.259> 5<00:01:46.500> pig<00:01:47.009> eggs<00:01:47.280> got

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
problem ahead efficiency 5 pig eggs got

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.999 
problem ahead efficiency 5 pig eggs got
that<00:01:48.390> by<00:01:48.540> upgrading<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.380> wasn't<00:01:49.560> able<00:01:49.770> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
that by upgrading and I wasn't able to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.840 
that by upgrading and I wasn't able to
repair<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> costs<00:01:51.740> were<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:52.979> high

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.719 

another<00:01:56.850> really<00:01:57.329> cool<00:01:57.659> change<00:01:58.700> redstone<00:01:59.700> and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
another really cool change redstone and

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.719 
another really cool change redstone and
that<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.479> almost<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.680> groundbreaking<00:02:02.250> change

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that is almost a groundbreaking change

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.420 
that is almost a groundbreaking change
or<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> huge<00:02:03.299> change<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.140> now<00:02:04.320> lock<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
or a huge change you can now lock the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.760 
or a huge change you can now lock the
state<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:06.030> repeaters<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.140> that's<00:02:07.469> create

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
state of repeaters and that's create

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.770 
state of repeaters and that's create
very<00:02:07.979> very<00:02:08.429> small<00:02:08.729> memory<00:02:08.970> cells<00:02:09.479> basically

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
very very small memory cells basically

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.890 
very very small memory cells basically
so<00:02:10.619> check<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.099> out<00:02:11.310> I'm<00:02:11.520> powering<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.690> line

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
so check it out I'm powering the line

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.460 
side of this repeater now you can see
power<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.820> line<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.300> now<00:02:19.510> flick<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.080> lever

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
power this line so now flick that lever

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.650

like or ya bedrock like bar on there
that<00:02:28.780> means<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.440> repeater<00:02:29.800> is<00:02:29.890> locked<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.520> if

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
that means the repeater is locked and if

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.170 
that means the repeater is locked and if
I<00:02:30.910> change<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.810> state<00:02:32.110> now<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:33.700> can<00:02:33.880> see<00:02:34.060> it
