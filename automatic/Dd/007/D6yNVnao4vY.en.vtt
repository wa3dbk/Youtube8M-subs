00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.799
 the world is full of bizarre things and the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.670
 world of games could not be 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.440
 different 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.270
 addressing this subject I will bring here 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.520
 for you a short list of three 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.100
 games with these bizarre themes that I 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.050
 I threw up starting at the time of 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.189
 first generation of consoles recalls 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.490
 when you get your clone 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.430
 Little cloner is clone my case at least 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.559
 I got a great login then these 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.780
 consoles comes with those tapes of 13 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.879
 millions of games and with great luck you 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.160
 enjoy some four of everything is 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.620
 and among these games had 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.379
 kind of bizarre fun called 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.850
 pnq restaurant is obvious not to know 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.219
 your name at the time but I simply 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.440
 I played this game as you 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.570
 controls the chef called cook 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.090
 was attacked and threatened with his rival 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.859
 saying that he would take his restaurant 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.780
 so you have to go out with your 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.539
 frying pan in hand killing all 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.729
 vegetables and foods for 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.479
 ensure your income and your 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.060
 restaurant 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.400
 detail that goal amuse said the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.740
 player of very good simple advantage 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.330
 much in this even has a 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.330
 Incredible kind of bonus 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.700
 changing generation has a game that does not 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.680
 has been such a bizarre topic since it is 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.690
 interesting race is that you do not 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.470
 controls a bicycle or skateboard vehicle 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.619
 tour in universes you are one in the cycle 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.560
 That's right you are our rich and despite 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.080
 the game is too good too fast full 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.280
 maneuvers and repair the unicycle try 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.670
 demonstrate emotions 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.310
 hilarious and reaching the apex of bizarre 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.729
 I had to have a ling xing finger 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.000
 scoundrel of japan demolition gum 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.990
 although despite using it I'm talking 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.600
 everything in Portuguese that although bizarre 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.940
 praises furniture in curiosity for the fact 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.150
 bring all the Japanese follies into one 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.510
 I play alone but already pains have 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.489
 that since basically in this thing 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.800
 You control the helicopter that has to 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.220
 distract this giant and this is the game 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.500
 to be flying over her 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.959
 because she is very dumb and always falls 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.209
 being in compromising positions 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.790
 Those Japanese junk linens and you 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:42.940
