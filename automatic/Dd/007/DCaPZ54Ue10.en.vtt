the pump turn the pump off I still have
pressure<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:36.690> pressure<00:00:36.840> will<00:00:37.170> eventually

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
pressure the pressure will eventually

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.369 
pressure the pressure will eventually
back<00:00:38.640> off<00:00:38.910> if<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.300> wait<00:00:39.480> long<00:00:39.660> enough<00:00:39.719> half<00:00:40.170> hour

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
back off if I wait long enough half hour

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.529 
back off if I wait long enough half hour
an<00:00:40.590> hour<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.960> connect<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> solenoid<00:00:44.539> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
an hour I connect it to the solenoid to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.560 
an hour I connect it to the solenoid to
the<00:00:45.629> pump<00:00:46.610> pump<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> looks<00:00:48.329> in

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the pump pump you can see it looks in

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.410 
the pump pump you can see it looks in
pretty<00:00:49.170> good<00:00:49.379> shape<00:00:49.760> it's<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.879> California<00:00:51.239> car

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
pretty good shape it's a California car

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.910 
pretty good shape it's a California car
but<00:00:54.420> when<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.899> bleed<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> pump<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:55.770> was

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
but when I bleed the pump or was

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180 
but when I bleed the pump or was
bleeding<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> pump<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> car<00:00:58.190> gorgeous

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
bleeding the pump in the car gorgeous

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.109 
bleeding the pump in the car gorgeous
pieces<00:01:00.320> trans<00:01:03.080> the<00:01:04.080> pump<00:01:04.379> would<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.250> bleed<00:01:05.700> or

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
pieces trans the pump would not bleed or

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.600 
pieces trans the pump would not bleed or
push<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:06.900> any<00:01:07.049> fluid<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.189> way<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.580> used

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
push out any fluid the way that it used

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.320 
push out any fluid the way that it used
to<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.420> suspected<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.080> pump<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:10.710> bad<00:01:11.330> for

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
to so I suspected the pump was bad for

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.660 
to so I suspected the pump was bad for
just<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.630> rebuild<00:01:12.960> kit<00:01:13.700> I'm<00:01:14.700> Kiki<00:01:14.970> turbo<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:17.130> I

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
just a rebuild kit I'm Kiki turbo and I

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.310 
just a rebuild kit I'm Kiki turbo and I
also<00:01:17.820> purchased<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.390> tester<00:01:18.750> cuz<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.020> wanted<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
also purchased a tester cuz I wanted to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.870 
also purchased a tester cuz I wanted to
make<00:01:19.470> sure<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.979> pump<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.310> actually<00:01:20.700> bad

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
make sure that the pump was actually bad

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.020 
make sure that the pump was actually bad
and<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.420> didn't<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.869> some<00:01:22.020> other<00:01:22.140> problem

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
and I didn't have some other problem

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.640 
and I didn't have some other problem
initially<00:01:24.030> when<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> ran<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.570> pump<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.409> would

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
initially when I ran the pump it would

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.969 
initially when I ran the pump it would
do<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.070> free<00:01:26.340> cycle<00:01:26.820> where<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> would<00:01:27.360> run

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
do that free cycle where it would run

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.270 
do that free cycle where it would run
run

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
run

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.819 
run
and<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.549> wouldn't<00:01:29.990> orally<00:01:30.990> sound<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> was

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
and it wouldn't orally sound like it was

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.300 
and it wouldn't orally sound like it was
building<00:01:32.159> any<00:01:32.280> pressure<00:01:33.079> which<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.860> after

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
building any pressure which now after

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.649 
building any pressure which now after
fiddling<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.000> connecting<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.420> it

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
fiddling with it and connecting with it

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.240 
fiddling with it and connecting with it
now<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.079> making<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.470> sound<00:01:37.530> where<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.100> can

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
now it's making that sound where you can

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.850 
now it's making that sound where you can
hear<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.750> volume<00:01:40.049> decrease<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.650> slowed

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
hear the volume decrease and it slowed

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039 
hear the volume decrease and it slowed
down<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.490> its<00:01:41.759> building<00:01:42.060> pressure<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.630> wasn't

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
down as its building pressure I wasn't

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.230 
down as its building pressure I wasn't
doing<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.259> before<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.909> guess<00:01:45.090> my<00:01:45.210> first

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
doing that before so I guess my first

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.319 
doing that before so I guess my first
question<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:46.950> intermittent<00:01:47.729> can

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
question is can it be intermittent can

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.330 
question is can it be intermittent can
the<00:01:48.420> pump<00:01:48.630> work<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.259> did<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.590> work<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.220> then

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the pump work and did not work and then

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340 
the pump work and did not work and then
work<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.090> work<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.600> does<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.930> mean<00:01:52.170> I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
work and not work and does that mean I

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.249 
work and not work and does that mean I
need<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> rebuild<00:01:53.189> kit<00:01:53.899> is<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.110> why

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
need to do the rebuild kit is that why

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.899 
need to do the rebuild kit is that why
some<00:01:55.290> people<00:01:55.740> say<00:01:55.950> they<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.700> three

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
some people say they have the three

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.880 
some people say they have the three
lights<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.689> no<00:01:57.869> three<00:01:58.110> lights<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> three

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
lights on and no three lights on a three

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.170 
lights on and no three lights on a three
lights<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.460> no<00:01:59.520> through<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.850> saw<00:02:00.030> I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
lights on and no through that saw I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.330 
lights on and no through that saw I
never<00:02:00.450> never<00:02:01.049> had<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.439> only<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:01.829> time<00:02:02.070> ever

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
never never had that only one time ever

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.999 
never never had that only one time ever
did<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> three<00:02:02.790> lights<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.180> come<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.540> after<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
did the three lights on come on after a

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.740 
did the three lights on come on after a
year<00:02:05.009> or<00:02:05.130> two<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.549> behavior<00:02:06.000> where<00:02:06.630> it

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
year or two of the behavior where it

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.100 
year or two of the behavior where it
wouldn't<00:02:06.960> bleed<00:02:07.170> properly<00:02:08.869> all<00:02:09.869> right<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.020> just

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
wouldn't bleed properly all right I just

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.459 
wouldn't bleed properly all right I just
to<00:02:10.379> mypos<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.890> see<00:02:11.009> what<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.190> guys<00:02:11.250> think
