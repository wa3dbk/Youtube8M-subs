two<00:01:23.189> weapons<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.700> course<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.060> STG<00:01:24.570> 44<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.259> the

two weapons of course the STG 44 and the

two weapons of course the STG 44 and the
SVO<00:01:25.979> sniper<00:01:26.520> rifle<00:01:27.030> these<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> little<00:01:27.720> bit

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
SVO sniper rifle these are a little bit

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.569 
SVO sniper rifle these are a little bit
different<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.470> won't<00:01:28.799> get<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> freebase

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
different so you won't get the freebase

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.670 
different so you won't get the freebase

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
own one the variants and then it'll give

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.600 
own one the variants and then it'll give
you<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> base<00:01:46.799> version<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.250> course<00:01:47.460> that

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
ways to get one of these variants of

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.100 
ways to get one of these variants of
course<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.670> through<00:01:51.180> Supply<00:01:51.540> Drop<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.960> can

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
one of these events as well so that is

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.869 
one of these events as well so that is
how<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.319> those<00:02:10.709> two<00:02:10.950> epidermal<00:02:11.430> why<00:02:11.730> I've

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
how you get those two epidermal why I've

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.710 
how you get those two epidermal why I've
done<00:02:12.060> with<00:02:12.150> kind<00:02:12.450> of

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
done with kind of

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.240 
done with kind of
but<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.260> blunderbuss<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.800> course<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.130> a

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
but the blunderbuss of course is a

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.800 
but the blunderbuss of course is a
freebie<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:14.850> like<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.030> m1<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.570> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
freebie just like the m1 is and the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.390 
freebie just like the m1 is and the
other<00:02:15.960> two<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.230> little<00:02:16.650> more<00:02:16.860> complicated<00:02:17.130> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
other two a little more complicated to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.500 
other two a little more complicated to
get<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.760> earn<00:02:17.910> them<00:02:18.090> through<00:02:18.360> an

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
get you have to earn them through an

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.120 
get you have to earn them through an
advanced<00:02:18.810> horse<00:02:19.080> normal<00:02:19.440> supply<00:02:19.560> drop<00:02:19.860> and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
advanced horse normal supply drop and

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.530 
advanced horse normal supply drop and
you<00:02:20.250> could<00:02:20.430> even<00:02:20.520> pay<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:21.000> them<00:02:21.090> or<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.360> could

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
you could even pay for them or you could

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.180 
you could even pay for them or you could
in<00:02:21.720> game<00:02:21.960> like<00:02:22.200> earn<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.590> subtitles<00:02:23.070> and

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
in game like earn the subtitles and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.350 
in game like earn the subtitles and
possibly<00:02:23.490> get<00:02:23.670> one<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.910> those<00:02:24.000> four<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.270> so

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
possibly get one of those four and so

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.850 
possibly get one of those four and so
that<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.600> how<00:02:24.780> those<00:02:24.930> work<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.410> now<00:02:25.620> let's<00:02:25.770> get

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that is how those work and now let's get

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.620 
that is how those work and now let's get
into<00:02:26.010> these<00:02:26.310> variants<00:02:26.790> now<00:02:26.940> but<00:02:27.180> believe<00:02:27.300> some

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
into these variants now but believe some

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.180 
into these variants now but believe some
of<00:02:27.660> these<00:02:27.840> are<00:02:27.900> actually<00:02:28.350> legendary<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.040> I

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
of these are actually legendary like I

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.710 
of these are actually legendary like I
said<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.850> video<00:02:29.970> where<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.450> got<00:02:30.600> the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
said in the video where we got the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.330 
said in the video where we got the
leaked<00:02:30.870> information<00:02:31.200> about<00:02:31.620> them<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
leaked information about them to the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.130 
leaked information about them to the
variance<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.670> these<00:02:32.880> sniper<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.540> also<00:02:33.990> the

11<00:03:36.030> variants<00:03:36.360> I<00:03:36.450> counted<00:03:36.900> going<00:03:37.230> through

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
11 variants I counted going through

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.220 
11 variants I counted going through
those<00:03:37.920> rents<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.430> STG<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.180> SVO<00:03:39.570> those

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
those rents the STG in the SVO those

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.020 
those rents the STG in the SVO those
have<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.500> believe<00:03:40.800> five<00:03:41.250> events<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.820> base

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
have I believe five events is a base

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.390 
have I believe five events is a base
weapon<00:03:42.420> plus<00:03:42.780> five<00:03:43.080> extra<00:03:43.680> variants<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.070> if

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
weapon plus five extra variants and if

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.800 
weapon plus five extra variants and if
we<00:03:44.489> go<00:03:44.640> through<00:03:44.850> them<00:03:45.000> right<00:03:45.090> here<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.630> can

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
we go through them right here you can
