things<00:02:36.209> about<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.690> hair<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.870> noticed<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
things about the hair I noticed that the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.610 
things about the hair I noticed that the
hair<00:02:38.400> had<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.640> tighter<00:02:39.150> pattern<00:02:39.410> when<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.440> was

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
hair had a tighter pattern when it was

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.440 
hair had a tighter pattern when it was
wet<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.100> almost<00:02:41.340> looked<00:02:41.550> like<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.760> jheri<00:02:42.390> curl

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
wet it almost looked like a jheri curl

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.640 
wet it almost looked like a jheri curl
pattern<00:02:44.360> which<00:02:45.360> one<00:02:45.540> doesn't<00:02:45.750> bother<00:02:45.989> me<00:02:46.230> but

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
pattern which one doesn't bother me but

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.710 
pattern which one doesn't bother me but
I<00:02:46.709> do<00:02:46.830> like<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> fact<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.640> curl<00:02:47.850> kind<00:02:48.510> of

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
I do like the fact that the curl kind of

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.870 
I do like the fact that the curl kind of
loosened<00:02:49.470> up<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.650> little<00:02:49.680> bit<00:02:50.010> sort<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.370> said

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
loosened up a little bit sort of said

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.400 
loosened up a little bit sort of said
that<00:02:51.030> look<00:02:51.209> at<00:02:51.420> Mike<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.989> already<00:02:52.140> available

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410

with<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.739> jheri<00:02:52.950> curl<00:02:53.040> pattern<00:02:53.580> they<00:02:54.209> do<00:02:54.270> have

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
with the jheri curl pattern they do have

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.360 
with the jheri curl pattern they do have
it<00:02:54.660> any<00:02:54.780> dirt<00:02:54.989> or<00:02:55.140> path<00:02:55.350> but<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.830> again<00:02:56.250> is

what everybody like this is color one so

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.310 
what everybody like this is color one so
far<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:08.300> shit's<00:03:08.690> really<00:03:09.260> motivated<00:03:09.920> as<00:03:10.040> well

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
far it shit's really motivated as well

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.270 
far it shit's really motivated as well
is<00:03:12.320> it<00:03:12.530> something<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:12.890> could<00:03:13.100> probably

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
is it something I could probably

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.080 
is it something I could probably
tolerate<00:03:14.620> probably<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:16.430> doesn't<00:03:16.730> live

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
tolerate probably so it doesn't live

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.310 
tolerate probably so it doesn't live

this little piece here I kinda like the
way<00:05:00.550> it<00:05:00.850> curls<00:05:01.300> at<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.690> end<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.860> everybody

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
way it curls at the end so everybody

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.700 
way it curls at the end so everybody
didn't<00:05:03.340> want<00:05:03.460> to<00:05:03.520> cut<00:05:03.699> it<00:05:03.820> too<00:05:04.000> much<00:05:04.180> I<00:05:04.650> kind<00:05:05.650> of

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
didn't want to cut it too much I kind of

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.050 
didn't want to cut it too much I kind of
spaced<00:05:05.949> the<00:05:06.070> trucks<00:05:06.280> out<00:05:06.460> in<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.610> back<00:05:06.789> so

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
spaced the trucks out in the back so

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.310 
spaced the trucks out in the back so
that<00:05:07.090> it<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.570> could<00:05:07.870> have<00:05:08.020> more<00:05:08.199> of<00:05:08.229> the

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
that it I could have more of the

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:16.920 
that it I could have more of the
fullness<00:05:08.590> at<00:05:08.919> the<00:05:09.010> top<00:05:11.130> what<00:05:12.130> else

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.900
