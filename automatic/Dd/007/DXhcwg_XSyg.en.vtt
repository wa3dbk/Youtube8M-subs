00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
want to talk about some new picking

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.000 
want to talk about some new picking
concepts<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:18.199> let's<00:00:19.199> start<00:00:19.529> off<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:19.890> this

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
concepts and let's start off with this

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.150 
concepts and let's start off with this
pattern<00:00:20.550> here<00:00:27.380> Lisa<00:00:28.380> they<00:00:28.560> I'm<00:00:28.619> descending

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
pattern here Lisa they I'm descending

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.370 
pattern here Lisa they I'm descending
down<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> note<00:00:29.670> down<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.599> scale<00:00:30.840> five

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
down the note down the scale five

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.040 
down the note down the scale five
minutes<00:00:31.679> at<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> time<00:00:32.360> now<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.630> pattern

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
minutes at a time now this pattern

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.930 
minutes at a time now this pattern
actually<00:00:34.489> came<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.270> similar

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
actually came out of a similar

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.310 
actually came out of a similar
pentatonic<00:00:38.940> pattern<00:00:38.969> i<00:00:39.450> was<00:00:40.020> playing

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
pentatonic pattern i was playing

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.049 
pentatonic pattern i was playing
something<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.640> pentatonic

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
something like this so the pentatonic

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.110 
something like this so the pentatonic
version<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.860> actually<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.340> an<00:00:50.520> example<00:00:50.820> from

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
version this actually is an example from

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.689 
version this actually is an example from
my<00:00:51.510> new<00:00:52.079> course<00:00:52.410> supercharged<00:00:53.190> slowly<00:00:53.460> made

supercharged<00:01:12.439> anyway<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:15.979> like<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> idea<00:01:17.220> of

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
supercharged anyway I I like the idea of

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670 
supercharged anyway I I like the idea of
five<00:01:17.909> note<00:01:18.150> patterns<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:19.229> they're<00:01:19.439> kind

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
five note patterns because they're kind

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.120 
five note patterns because they're kind
of<00:01:20.060> asymmetrical<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.560> kind<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> challenger

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
of asymmetrical and kind of challenger

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.859 
of asymmetrical and kind of challenger
fingers<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.610> New<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.820> different<00:01:24.090> ways<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.840> I

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
fingers in New in different ways so I

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.740 
fingers in New in different ways so I
started<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.700> playing<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.299> five<00:01:27.540> note

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
started you know playing a five note

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.990 
started you know playing a five note
sequence<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:29.040> using<00:01:29.310> alternate<00:01:29.790> picking

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
sequence just using alternate picking

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.200 
sequence just using alternate picking
and<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:31.049> wasn't<00:01:31.320> very<00:01:31.590> efficient<00:01:32.400> so

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
and it really wasn't very efficient so

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.940 
and it really wasn't very efficient so
I'm<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.570> thought<00:01:33.780> why<00:01:34.049> not<00:01:34.079> use<00:01:34.470> this

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
I'm going to thought why not use this

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.120 
I'm going to thought why not use this
kind<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> same<00:01:36.000> picking<00:01:36.509> strategy<00:01:37.100> with<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
kind of same picking strategy with the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.149 
kind of same picking strategy with the
diatonic<00:01:38.640> scale<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.740> let's<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.920> start<00:01:41.040> off

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
diatonic scale so let's just start off

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.130 
diatonic scale so let's just start off
with<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.490> pentatonix<00:01:42.150> because<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.020> more

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
with the pentatonix because it's more

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.780 
with the pentatonix because it's more
basic<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.600> what<00:01:45.600> i'm<00:01:45.689> doing<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.170> i'm

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
basic so what i'm doing here is i'm

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.210 
basic so what i'm doing here is i'm
using<00:01:47.790> alternate<00:01:48.299> picking<00:01:48.920> for<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.979> first

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
using alternate picking for the first

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.410 
using alternate picking for the first
five<00:01:50.460> notes<00:01:50.960> down<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.290> down<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:53.040> down<00:01:53.390> then<00:01:54.390> i

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
five notes down up down up down then i

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.930 
five notes down up down up down then i
do<00:01:54.990> another<00:01:55.380> down<00:01:55.649> stroke<00:01:57.770> right<00:01:58.770> down

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
do another down stroke right down

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.210 
do another down stroke right down
down<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.990> then<00:02:01.110> down<00:02:01.470> again<00:02:02.330> do<00:02:04.040> so<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.160> like

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
down and then down again do so it's like

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.560 
down and then down again do so it's like
a<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:05.580> sweet<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.210> again<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.320> combining

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
a little sweet and again just combining

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.480 
a little sweet and again just combining
the<00:02:09.570> alternate<00:02:10.380> picking<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.830> economy<00:02:11.280> Peggy

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
the alternate picking with economy Peggy

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.750 
the alternate picking with economy Peggy
so<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.840> you're<00:02:13.050> not<00:02:13.170> familiar<00:02:13.320> with<00:02:13.760> these

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so if you're not familiar with these

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.350 
so if you're not familiar with these
terms<00:02:15.560> economy<00:02:16.560> picking<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:17.210> refers<00:02:18.210> to

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
terms economy picking is refers to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.330 
terms economy picking is refers to
economy<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.990> motion<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:19.770> i<00:02:19.860> was<00:02:19.980> playing

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
economy of motion so if i was playing

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.210 
economy of motion so if i was playing
something<00:02:20.550> like<00:02:22.910> arpeggio<00:02:24.890> if<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.980> look<00:02:26.100> at

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
something like arpeggio if you look at

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.920 
something like arpeggio if you look at
my<00:02:26.370> picking<00:02:26.730> hand<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.300> going<00:02:27.600> straight

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
my picking hand it's just going straight

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.800 
my picking hand it's just going straight
down<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:32.220> know<00:02:32.340> not<00:02:32.760> wasting<00:02:32.970> any<00:02:33.300> motion<00:02:33.660> not

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
down you know not wasting any motion not

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.370 
down you know not wasting any motion not
going<00:02:34.230> up<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.650> down<00:02:34.740> it's<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.640> straight<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
going up and down it's just straight to

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.310 
going up and down it's just straight to
the<00:02:37.470> next<00:02:37.710> string<00:02:37.910> now<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.720> opposite<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.200> that

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
the next string now the opposite of that

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.150 
the next string now the opposite of that
is<00:02:42.140> economy<00:02:43.140> picking<00:02:43.350> or<00:02:43.770> excuse<00:02:44.130> me

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
is economy picking or excuse me

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.130 
is economy picking or excuse me
alternate<00:02:44.850> picking<00:02:45.030> where<00:02:45.840> I'm<00:02:45.930> always

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
alternate picking where I'm always

alternate picking where I'm always

up<00:02:48.240> stroke<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:50.160> know<00:02:50.250> typical<00:02:50.760> shred

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
up stroke so you know typical shred

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.400 
up stroke so you know typical shred
pattern<00:02:52.140> would<00:02:52.260> be<00:02:52.410> like<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.810> down<00:02:58.080> up

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
pattern would be like this so down up

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.070 
pattern would be like this so down up
down<00:03:01.310> down<00:03:02.310> up<00:03:02.580> down<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:03.300> notice<00:03:03.570> when<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.750> go<00:03:03.930> up

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
down down up down I notice when I go up

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.160 
down down up down I notice when I go up
I'm<00:03:04.950> going<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.280> pass<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.850> string<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.450> then

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
I'm going to pass the string and then

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.830 
I'm going to pass the string and then
hitting<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.620> on<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.770> way<00:03:07.890> back<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.750> know

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
hitting it on the way back so you know

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.680 
hitting it on the way back so you know
the<00:03:10.160> economy<00:03:11.160> picking<00:03:11.430> school<00:03:12.120> thought<00:03:12.450> would

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
the economy picking school thought would

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.540 
the economy picking school thought would
say<00:03:12.810> that's<00:03:13.020> inefficient<00:03:13.290> you're<00:03:14.100> wasting

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
say that's inefficient you're wasting

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.530 
say that's inefficient you're wasting
the<00:03:14.640> motion<00:03:15.860> but<00:03:16.860> in<00:03:17.120> practice<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.270> doesn't

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
the motion but in practice and doesn't

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.790 
the motion but in practice and doesn't
always<00:03:18.720> turn<00:03:18.900> out<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.380> shortest

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
always turn out that the shortest

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.280 
always turn out that the shortest
distance<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.850> easy<00:03:21.270> is<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.050> easiest

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
distance is the easy is the easiest

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.890 
distance is the easy is the easiest
thing<00:03:22.470> for<00:03:22.620> your<00:03:22.770> fingers<00:03:23.160> because<00:03:23.850> then<00:03:24.810> you

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
thing for your fingers because then you

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.560 
thing for your fingers because then you
have<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.110> switch<00:03:25.320> direction<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:26.209> it's<00:03:27.209> often

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
have to switch direction so it's often

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.860 
have to switch direction so it's often
easier<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.580> you<00:03:29.580> know<00:03:29.670> go<00:03:29.880> past<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.390> stray<00:03:30.660> and

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
easier to you know go past the stray and

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.449 
easier to you know go past the stray and
then<00:03:31.080> since<00:03:31.920> you're<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.250> have<00:03:32.370> to

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
then since you're going to have to

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.910 
then since you're going to have to
switch<00:03:32.700> directions<00:03:32.970> anyway<00:03:33.769> you'll<00:03:34.769> hit

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
switch directions anyway you'll hit

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.949 
switch directions anyway you'll hit
another<00:03:35.160> way<00:03:35.340> back<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:35.970> that's<00:03:36.720> why<00:03:36.900> you

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
another way back so and that's why you

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.930 
another way back so and that's why you
can<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:37.769> play<00:03:37.950> fast<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.610> play<00:03:38.790> these

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
can you can play fast and play these

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.520 
can you can play fast and play these
matters

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:53.010 

right<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:47.880> with<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:48.910> powder<00:03:51.420> you're<00:03:52.420> using

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
right so with this powder you're using

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.350 
right so with this powder you're using
both<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:54.160> know<00:03:54.250> when<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.490> makes<00:03:54.640> sense<00:03:54.760> using

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
both you know when it makes sense using

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.750 
both you know when it makes sense using
the<00:03:55.830> alternate<00:03:56.830> picking<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:57.130> start<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.640> then

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
the alternate picking to start and then

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.850 
the alternate picking to start and then
you<00:03:58.270> do<00:03:58.420> a<00:03:58.450> little<00:03:58.690> sweep<00:03:59.020> just<00:03:59.440> to<00:03:59.500> get<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.680> the

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
you do a little sweep just to get to the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.510 
you do a little sweep just to get to the
next<00:03:59.890> ring<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:01.150> I'm<00:04:01.480> calling<00:04:01.960> this

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
next ring so I'm calling this

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.930 
next ring so I'm calling this
intelligent<00:04:03.520> picking<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.950> know<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.910> can

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
intelligent picking and you know you can

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.170 
intelligent picking and you know you can
figure<00:04:07.390> out<00:04:07.510> for<00:04:08.110> each<00:04:08.320> link<00:04:08.890> or<00:04:09.070> phrase<00:04:09.340> the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
figure out for each link or phrase the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.420 
figure out for each link or phrase the
best<00:04:10.510> way<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.750> pick<00:04:11.050> it<00:04:11.230> using<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.220> combination

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
best way to pick it using a combination

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.240 
best way to pick it using a combination
of<00:04:12.970> trial<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.020> error<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.530> your<00:04:15.130> own

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
of trial and error and your own

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.210 
of trial and error and your own
intuition<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.170> you<00:04:17.170> know<00:04:17.290> what<00:04:17.500> your<00:04:17.650> what

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
intuition and you know what your what

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.949 
intuition and you know what your what
your<00:04:18.280> friend<00:04:18.640> might<00:04:18.880> how<00:04:19.239> your<00:04:19.570> friend<00:04:19.810> might

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
your friend might how your friend might

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.570 
your friend might how your friend might
pick<00:04:20.170> it<00:04:20.350> might<00:04:20.620> be<00:04:20.770> a<00:04:20.799> little<00:04:21.010> different<00:04:21.250> than

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
pick it might be a little different than

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.670 
pick it might be a little different than
how<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:21.790> were<00:04:22.090> going<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.270> pick<00:04:22.420> it<00:04:22.630> but<00:04:23.590> you

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
how you were going to pick it but you

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.560 
how you were going to pick it but you
want<00:04:23.830> to<00:04:23.860> find<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.160> most<00:04:24.310> natural<00:04:24.550> way<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:27.570> to

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
want to find the most natural way to to

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.830 
want to find the most natural way to to
pick<00:04:28.780> something<00:04:29.070> so<00:04:30.070> with<00:04:30.850> this<00:04:30.880> diatomic

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
pick something so with this diatomic

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.230 
pick something so with this diatomic
pattern<00:04:32.200> it's<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:33.040> same<00:04:33.280> thing<00:04:33.310> it's<00:04:33.730> down<00:04:34.000> up

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
pattern it's the same thing it's down up

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.380 
pattern it's the same thing it's down up
down<00:04:34.270> up<00:04:34.510> down<00:04:37.530> just<00:04:38.530> going<00:04:38.740> down<00:04:38.860> five<00:04:39.100> notes

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
down up down just going down five notes

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:46.910 
down up down just going down five notes
and<00:04:40.390> then<00:04:41.340> sweep<00:04:42.340> with<00:04:42.700> another<00:04:42.970> down<00:04:43.210> stroke

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.910 

and<00:04:47.920> those<00:04:48.100> what<00:04:48.280> I<00:04:48.340> get<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.580> hear<00:04:49.320> I<00:04:50.320> do<00:04:50.890> a

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
and those what I get to hear I do a

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.520 
and those what I get to hear I do a
little<00:04:51.130> slide<00:04:51.460> so<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.690> left<00:04:52.900> hand<00:04:53.050> is<00:04:53.230> another

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
little slide so the left hand is another

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.800 
little slide so the left hand is another
topic<00:04:54.340> we<00:04:54.640> could<00:04:54.790> talk<00:04:54.940> about<00:04:54.970> that<00:04:55.420> in

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
topic we could talk about that in

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
topic we could talk about that in
another<00:04:55.930> lesson<00:04:56.320> but<00:04:56.710> I<00:05:00.270> I<00:05:01.270> want<00:05:02.260> you<00:05:02.380> to<00:05:02.500> get

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
another lesson but I I want you to get

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.680 
another lesson but I I want you to get
this<00:05:02.950> concept<00:05:03.520> of<00:05:03.700> intelligent<00:05:04.330> picking

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
this concept of intelligent picking

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.930 
this concept of intelligent picking
using<00:05:05.620> a<00:05:05.680> combination<00:05:05.920> of<00:05:06.310> alternate<00:05:06.790> picking

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
using a combination of alternate picking

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.990 
using a combination of alternate picking
an<00:05:07.240> economy<00:05:07.690> picking<00:05:07.930> so<00:05:08.920> pick<00:05:09.460> any<00:05:09.700> liq

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
an economy picking so pick any liq

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.900 
an economy picking so pick any liq
phrase<00:05:10.420> whatever<00:05:10.870> and<00:05:11.290> just<00:05:11.980> play<00:05:12.790> around

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
phrase whatever and just play around

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.380 
phrase whatever and just play around
with<00:05:13.270> different<00:05:13.510> ways<00:05:14.290> to<00:05:14.530> pick<00:05:14.740> things<00:05:14.950> and<00:05:15.390> I

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
with different ways to pick things and I

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.690 
with different ways to pick things and I
think<00:05:16.810> it's<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.080> very<00:05:17.260> powerful<00:05:17.410> concept<00:05:18.160> that

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
think it's a very powerful concept that
