00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.790 
one of the top three as far as the other
slot<00:01:43.570> I<00:01:43.750> don't<00:01:44.020> really<00:01:44.200> know<00:01:44.440> I<00:01:44.470> could<00:01:44.920> say

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
slot I don't really know I could say

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.610 
slot I don't really know I could say
gamma<00:01:47.800> Rams<00:01:48.130> taken<00:01:48.550> off<00:01:48.670> pretty<00:01:48.880> big<00:01:49.620> Tirico

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
gamma Rams taken off pretty big Tirico

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.960 
gamma Rams taken off pretty big Tirico
actually<00:01:50.950> that's<00:01:51.070> when<00:01:51.520> i<00:01:51.550> was<00:01:51.670> walking

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
actually that's when i was walking

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.340 
actually that's when i was walking
Tirico<00:01:52.330> is<00:01:52.450> probably<00:01:52.660> gonna<00:01:52.780> be<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.960> next<00:01:53.170> one

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
Tirico is probably gonna be the next one

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.290 
Tirico is probably gonna be the next one
so<00:01:53.440> it's<00:01:53.530> going<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.800> be<00:01:53.890> like<00:01:54.040> fairy<00:01:54.670> tale<00:01:54.940> one

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
so it's going to be like fairy tale one

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.550 
so it's going to be like fairy tale one
piece<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:55.690> Toriko<00:01:55.720> which<00:01:56.200> you're<00:01:56.350> going<00:01:56.500> to

piece and Toriko which you're going to

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.830 
piece and Toriko which you're going to
be<00:01:56.680> like<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:57.010> big<00:01:57.190> three<00:01:57.790> but<00:01:58.330> I<00:01:58.390> want<00:01:58.690> to<00:01:58.780> hear
