believe it's a Remington dime dryer if
I'm<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.290> mistaken<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.310> showing<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
I'm not mistaken and I'm showing you the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.140 
I'm not mistaken and I'm showing you the
settings<00:01:24.740> as<00:01:25.740> three<00:01:26.070> heat<00:01:26.280> settings<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
settings as three heat settings and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.810 
settings as three heat settings and
three<00:01:27.570> fan<00:01:27.869> set<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.740> say<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.040> satin<00:01:29.490> settings

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
three fan set to say in satin settings

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.280 
three fan set to say in satin settings
actually<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.880> also<00:01:33.030> has<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> cool<00:01:33.600> shot<00:01:33.840> so

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
actually and it also has a cool shot so

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.310 
actually and it also has a cool shot so
I'm<00:01:35.159> using<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.880> basically<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.479> high<00:01:36.869> because

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
I'm using it basically on high because

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.890 
I'm using it basically on high because
even<00:01:37.770> though<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> high<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> high

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
even though it is a high on a high

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.170 
even though it is a high on a high
setting<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.770> doesn't<00:01:41.220> produce<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.820> lot<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.030> heat

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
setting it doesn't produce a lot of heat

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.740 
setting it doesn't produce a lot of heat
it<00:01:42.570> takes<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.930> while<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.140> blow-dry<00:01:43.579> your<00:01:44.579> hair

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
it takes a while to blow-dry your hair

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.230 
it takes a while to blow-dry your hair
so<00:01:45.750> I'm<00:01:45.840> using<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.259> tension<00:01:49.670> I'm<00:01:50.670> using<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
so I'm using the tension I'm using the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.190 
so I'm using the tension I'm using the
tension<00:01:51.810> method<00:01:52.200> where<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.439> basically<00:01:54.140> using<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
tension method where I basically using a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.209 
tension method where I basically using a
brush<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.130> brushing<00:01:56.340> down<00:01:56.759> my<00:01:57.030> hair<00:01:57.360> and
