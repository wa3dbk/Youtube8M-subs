00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
Tortuga standard issue phaser so here it

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.189 
Tortuga standard issue phaser so here it
is<00:00:24.589> standard<00:00:25.189> issue<00:00:25.249> phaser<00:00:25.640> for<00:00:26.449> babes<00:00:26.720> yes

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
is standard issue phaser for babes yes

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.810 
is standard issue phaser for babes yes
actually<00:00:27.619> this<00:00:27.740> is<00:00:27.890> a<00:00:28.130> pedal<00:00:28.519> that<00:00:28.640> was

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
actually this is a pedal that was

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.579 
actually this is a pedal that was
designed<00:00:29.269> for<00:00:29.480> guitar<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:30.050> I<00:00:30.109> had<00:00:30.230> originally

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
designed for guitar and I had originally

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.319 
designed for guitar and I had originally
built<00:00:30.769> for<00:00:30.859> guitar<00:00:31.310> and<00:00:31.519> sold<00:00:32.060> the<00:00:32.180> bass

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
built for guitar and sold the bass

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.690 
built for guitar and sold the bass
players<00:00:32.660> who<00:00:33.380> all<00:00:33.800> asked<00:00:34.130> hey<00:00:34.220> could<00:00:34.460> you<00:00:34.550> make

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
players who all asked hey could you make

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.459 
players who all asked hey could you make
this<00:00:34.790> sound<00:00:34.940> better<00:00:35.150> for<00:00:35.390> bass<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:36.230> I<00:00:36.260> said

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
this sound better for bass and I said

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.880 
this sound better for bass and I said
well<00:00:36.620> sure<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.100> I<00:00:37.670> did<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.289> now<00:00:39.289> it's<00:00:39.710> the

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
well sure and I did and now it's the

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.400 
well sure and I did and now it's the
standard<00:00:40.129> pedal<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.420> vase<00:00:41.690> mods<00:00:42.050> I<00:00:42.230> did

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
standard pedal the vase mods I did

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.779 
standard pedal the vase mods I did
didn't<00:00:42.680> really<00:00:42.859> affect<00:00:42.949> the<00:00:43.129> guitar<00:00:43.430> set<00:00:43.670> at

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
didn't really affect the guitar set at

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.450 
didn't really affect the guitar set at
all<00:00:43.910> but<00:00:44.269> made<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.170> huge<00:00:45.620> difference<00:00:46.070> on<00:00:46.340> the

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
all but made a huge difference on the

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.889 
all but made a huge difference on the
base<00:00:46.609> so<00:00:46.850> now<00:00:47.000> if<00:00:47.180> you<00:00:47.269> buy<00:00:47.420> a<00:00:47.449> standard<00:00:47.809> issue

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
base so now if you buy a standard issue

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.529 
base so now if you buy a standard issue
phaser<00:00:48.199> it<00:00:48.800> will<00:00:49.010> kill<00:00:49.250> on<00:00:49.579> your<00:00:49.820> bass<00:00:50.149> guitar

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
phaser it will kill on your bass guitar

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.450 
phaser it will kill on your bass guitar
basically<00:00:51.500> you've<00:00:51.739> got<00:00:51.920> two<00:00:52.070> channels

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
basically you've got two channels

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.040 
basically you've got two channels
they're<00:00:52.640> identical<00:00:53.030> you've<00:00:53.329> got<00:00:53.510> kill<00:00:53.870> and

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
they're identical you've got kill and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.979 
they're identical you've got kill and
stun<00:00:54.489> force<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:55.730> width<00:00:55.910> on<00:00:56.179> each<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.570> them<00:00:56.750> and

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
stun force and width on each of them and

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.009 
stun force and width on each of them and
these<00:00:57.980> are<00:00:58.250> each<00:00:58.460> independently<00:00:59.019> controlled

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
these are each independently controlled

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.919 
these are each independently controlled
forces<00:01:00.949> depth<00:01:01.219> width<00:01:01.579> is<00:01:01.789> rate<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.300> we<00:01:02.780> can

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
forces depth width is rate and we can

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:03.970 
forces depth width is rate and we can
switch<00:01:03.109> between<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.559> two<00:01:03.589> different

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
switch between the two different

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.670 
switch between the two different
channels<00:01:04.699> with<00:01:05.150> this<00:01:05.360> foot<00:01:05.600> switch<00:01:05.840> here's

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
channels with this foot switch here's

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.230 
channels with this foot switch here's
the<00:01:06.770> tone<00:01:06.920> without<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.280> effect<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:14.060> let's

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
the tone without the effect so let's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:26.350 
the tone without the effect so let's
start<00:01:14.600> with<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.170> with<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:15.979> stun<00:01:16.310> side<00:01:16.610> here

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.120 

kind<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:27.020> like<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.290> run<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:27.530> something<00:01:28.100> like

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
kind of like to run it something like

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:44.860 
kind of like to run it something like
this<00:01:28.520> for<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:43.610> then<00:01:43.760> you<00:01:43.850> can<00:01:43.970> set<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.690> other

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
this for and then you can set the other

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.740 
this for and then you can set the other
identical<00:01:45.320> channel<00:01:45.800> up<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.160> be<00:01:46.550> oh<00:01:46.910> let's<00:01:47.210> do

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
identical channel up to be oh let's do

00:01:47.750 --> 00:02:07.960 
identical channel up to be oh let's do
something<00:01:47.960> like<00:01:48.020> this<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.560> faster<00:02:06.970> by

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
something like this so the faster by

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.080 
something like this so the faster by
keeping<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.479> depth<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.500> force<00:02:09.739> down<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.940> can

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
keeping the depth the force down you can

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.250 
keeping the depth the force down you can
kind<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.450> keep<00:02:11.570> that<00:02:11.810> warble<00:02:12.140> in<00:02:12.200> the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
kind of keep that warble in the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.320 
kind of keep that warble in the
background<00:02:12.790> without<00:02:13.790> losing<00:02:14.300> your

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
background without losing your

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.530 
background without losing your
definition<00:02:14.900> with<00:02:14.989> your<00:02:15.110> low<00:02:15.200> end<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:20.270> still

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
definition with your low end you still

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:32.949 
definition with your low end you still
have<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.900> big<00:02:30.850> now<00:02:31.850> we<00:02:31.940> can<00:02:32.060> do<00:02:32.209> some<00:02:32.420> crazier

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
have it big now we can do some crazier

00:02:32.959 --> 00:03:15.630 
have it big now we can do some crazier
stuff<00:02:33.049> here<00:02:33.440> if<00:02:33.530> we<00:02:33.620> like<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:34.459> this

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:39.699 

so<00:03:16.640> now<00:03:16.790> if<00:03:16.969> you<00:03:17.150> set<00:03:17.359> it<00:03:17.450> up<00:03:17.510> more<00:03:17.930> like<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:39.530> two

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
so now if you set it up more like it two

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.099 
so now if you set it up more like it two
very<00:03:40.040> different<00:03:43.540> different<00:03:44.540> sounds<00:03:44.900> on<00:03:45.019> the

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
very different different sounds on the

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.319 
very different different sounds on the
fly
