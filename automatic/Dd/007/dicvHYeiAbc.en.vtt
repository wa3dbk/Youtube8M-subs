00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.110
 the fact that it is transparent but when 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:13.080
 it makes it deep as if swollen 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.640

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.380

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.780
 how to fill it all I did by the way 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.590
 This one planned for these candles. 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.830

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:38.710

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.099
 I wanted to show you girls boys 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:34.639
 the book gave me an interesting gift I don't know 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:37.289
 It is in English and on the edge of php 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:42.539
 swears that all sorts of different 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:45.539
 crafts from simple papers that is 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:49.550
 paper crafts are more interesting than here 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:52.529
 only there is no interesting book 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.169
 I do not know we probably have such here 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:07:00.180
 carve out and we have no such basis, I 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:03.629
 I did not see my friends went for 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:06.090
 Border she brought this book so 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:11.340
 tune up you brought this book and 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:14.430
 so interesting on the student called 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:18.379
 once again here is the name who loves 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:21.270
 creativity who loves is very useful 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:23.370
 such power watches to participate 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:26.599
 This part of the way here I have 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.599
 I watched the pattern
