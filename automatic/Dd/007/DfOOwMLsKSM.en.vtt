00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
as a quarterback

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.469 
as a quarterback
I<00:01:43.590> don't<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.159> grapples<00:01:44.790> flat-footed<00:01:45.270> that

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
I don't think grapples flat-footed that

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.840 
I don't think grapples flat-footed that
he's<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.840> opposite<00:01:46.380> fade<00:01:46.890> route<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.430> think<00:01:47.490> he

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
he's the opposite fade route I think he

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.310 
he's the opposite fade route I think he
throws<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.270> prettiest<00:01:48.720> fade<00:01:48.930> route<00:01:49.110> that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
throws the prettiest fade route that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.240 
throws the prettiest fade route that
I've<00:01:49.439> seen<00:01:49.680> out<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.189> these

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
I've seen out of some of these

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.240 
I've seen out of some of these
quarterbacks<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.880> I've<00:01:51.000> watched<00:01:51.240> including

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
quarterbacks that I've watched including

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.940 
quarterbacks that I've watched including
you<00:01:53.250> know<00:01:53.369> Teddy<00:01:53.700> Bridgewater<00:01:54.409> Blake<00:01:55.409> bortles

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
you know Teddy Bridgewater Blake bortles

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.709 
you know Teddy Bridgewater Blake bortles
I<00:01:56.009> think<00:01:56.430> Garoppolo<00:01:56.700> throws<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> best<00:01:57.420> fade

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
I think Garoppolo throws the best fade

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.429 
I think Garoppolo throws the best fade
route<00:01:57.960> and

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
route and

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.950 
route and
it's<00:02:00.429> just<00:02:00.640> pretty<00:02:00.880> yeah<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.329> just<00:02:01.600> look<00:02:01.719> at

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
it's just pretty yeah you just look at

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.330 
it's just pretty yeah you just look at
your<00:02:02.140> like<00:02:02.229> wow<00:02:02.469> you<00:02:03.039> know

your like wow you know

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.349 
your like wow you know
so<00:02:03.700> grapple<00:02:04.299> of<00:02:04.359> a<00:02:04.569> drought<00:02:04.810> there<00:02:05.079> is<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.920> Perot

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
so grapple of a drought there is a Perot

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.460 
so grapple of a drought there is a Perot
decision-making<00:02:07.359> he<00:02:07.659> likes<00:02:07.929> to<00:02:08.140> throw<00:02:08.289> the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
decision-making he likes to throw the

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.650 
decision-making he likes to throw the
ball<00:02:08.679> away<00:02:08.860> when<00:02:09.190> nothing<00:02:09.580> is<00:02:09.670> open<00:02:09.879> to<00:02:10.179> him<00:02:10.330> um

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
ball away when nothing is open to him um

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.900 
ball away when nothing is open to him um
if<00:02:10.989> he<00:02:11.019> if<00:02:11.290> he<00:02:11.319> just<00:02:11.650> has<00:02:11.830> no<00:02:12.099> idea<00:02:12.129> what<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.730> do

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
if he if he just has no idea what to do

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.270 
if he if he just has no idea what to do
nobody<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:14.019> open<00:02:14.379> he<00:02:14.680> gets<00:02:14.890> rid<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.250> ball

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
nobody is open he gets rid of the ball

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.530 
nobody is open he gets rid of the ball
that's<00:02:15.819> smart

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
that's smart

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.420 
that's smart
don't<00:02:17.170> force<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.650> don't<00:02:17.860> throw<00:02:18.340> an

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
don't force it don't throw an

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.070 
don't force it don't throw an
interception<00:02:18.549> that's<00:02:19.450> something<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.900> look

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
interception that's something you look

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.990 
interception that's something you look
in<00:02:20.230> quarterbacks<00:02:20.709> as<00:02:20.860> well<00:02:21.069> decision-making

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
in quarterbacks as well decision-making

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.479 
in quarterbacks as well decision-making
or<00:02:22.780> throwing<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.530> ball<00:02:23.650> away<00:02:23.769> makes<00:02:24.069> up<00:02:24.280> that

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
or throwing the ball away makes up that

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.400 
or throwing the ball away makes up that
you<00:02:24.730> know<00:02:24.819> decision-making<00:02:25.540> there<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.379> I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
you know decision-making there so I

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.710 
you know decision-making there so I
think<00:02:26.739> that<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.610> also<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:28.000> pro<00:02:28.269> now

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
think that is also a pro now

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.089 
think that is also a pro now
cons<00:02:29.379> I<00:02:29.709> think<00:02:30.150> his<00:02:31.150> running<00:02:31.510> ability<00:02:32.099> is

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
cons I think his running ability is

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.580 
cons I think his running ability is
average<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.209> think<00:02:34.420> if<00:02:34.780> he<00:02:34.900> needs<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.349> make<00:02:35.530> a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
average I think if he needs to make a

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.020 
average I think if he needs to make a
play<00:02:35.890> where<00:02:36.160> he<00:02:36.280> has<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.549> run<00:02:36.700> out<00:02:36.849> of<00:02:36.879> the

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
play where he has to run out of the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.780 
play where he has to run out of the
pocket<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.450> make<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.720> run<00:02:38.049> he<00:02:38.560> can<00:02:38.799> do<00:02:39.099> that<00:02:39.370> but

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
pocket and make a run he can do that but

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.880 
pocket and make a run he can do that but
at<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.030> same<00:02:40.269> time<00:02:40.629> there<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.170> did<00:02:41.560> notice

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
at the same time there I did notice

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.020 
at the same time there I did notice
there<00:02:42.010> were<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.220> couple<00:02:42.400> of<00:02:42.579> times<00:02:42.790> where<00:02:42.940> he

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
there were a couple of times where he

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.640 
there were a couple of times where he
looked<00:02:43.209> like<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.420> deer<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:43.840> headlights<00:02:43.870> he

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
looked like a deer in headlights he

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.559 
looked like a deer in headlights he
would<00:02:44.829> stutter<00:02:45.129> around<00:02:45.610> wouldn't<00:02:46.329> know<00:02:46.420> where

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
would stutter around wouldn't know where

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.119 
would stutter around wouldn't know where
to<00:02:46.599> go<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:46.930> he<00:02:46.989> would<00:02:47.110> just<00:02:47.290> fall<00:02:47.530> over

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
to go and he would just fall over

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.479 
to go and he would just fall over
so<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.420> he's<00:02:49.420> not<00:02:49.629> a<00:02:49.660> running<00:02:50.079> quarterback

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
so I he's not a running quarterback

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.309 
so I he's not a running quarterback
primarily<00:02:51.489> would<00:02:51.970> be<00:02:52.150> used<00:02:52.420> as<00:02:52.569> a<00:02:52.870> pocket

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
primarily would be used as a pocket

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.199 
primarily would be used as a pocket
passer<00:02:53.500> his<00:02:53.829> accuracy<00:02:54.250> I've<00:02:54.609> listed<00:02:54.849> it<00:02:55.060> as<00:02:55.180> a

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
passer his accuracy I've listed it as a

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.339 
passer his accuracy I've listed it as a
pro<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.660> as<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.810> con

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
pro and as a con

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.839 
pro and as a con
there<00:02:56.590> are<00:02:56.680> many<00:02:56.829> times<00:02:57.129> where<00:02:57.400> he<00:02:57.549> had<00:02:57.730> the

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
there are many times where he had the

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.640 
there are many times where he had the
ball<00:02:58.060> right<00:02:58.269> on<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.480> money<00:02:58.599> and<00:02:59.019> there<00:02:59.560> were

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
ball right on the money and there were

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.140 
ball right on the money and there were
you<00:02:59.920> know<00:02:59.980> there<00:03:00.069> were<00:03:00.250> some<00:03:00.459> times<00:03:00.700> where<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
you know there were some times where the

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.509 
you know there were some times where the
ball<00:03:01.329> really<00:03:01.690> just<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.530> didn't<00:03:03.160> look<00:03:03.280> like<00:03:03.340> it

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
ball really just it didn't look like it

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.640 
ball really just it didn't look like it
was<00:03:03.700> thrown<00:03:04.090> well<00:03:04.329> so<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:04.900> think<00:03:05.019> his<00:03:05.290> accuracy

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
was thrown well so I think his accuracy

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.670 
was thrown well so I think his accuracy
I<00:03:06.810> don't<00:03:07.810> know<00:03:07.900> if<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.019> want<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.260> label<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.620> as

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
I don't know if I want to label it as

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.400 
I don't know if I want to label it as
inconsistent<00:03:09.609> but<00:03:10.389> I<00:03:10.450> think<00:03:10.750> he'd<00:03:10.959> be<00:03:11.079> labeled

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
inconsistent but I think he'd be labeled

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.440 
inconsistent but I think he'd be labeled
as<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.500> Pro<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.069> con<00:03:12.250> at<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.519> same<00:03:12.700> time<00:03:12.940> if

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
as a Pro and the con at the same time if

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.970 
as a Pro and the con at the same time if
you<00:03:13.569> want<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.840> call<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.109> inconsistent<00:03:14.560> sure

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
you want to call it inconsistent sure

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.059 
you want to call it inconsistent sure
why<00:03:15.190> not<00:03:15.400> opposing<00:03:16.329> talent<00:03:16.870> there<00:03:17.769> were<00:03:17.829> times

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
why not opposing talent there were times

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.770 
why not opposing talent there were times
where<00:03:18.250> I'd<00:03:18.310> watch<00:03:18.579> you<00:03:19.329> know<00:03:19.419> some<00:03:19.599> of<00:03:19.690> the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
where I'd watch you know some of the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.229 
where I'd watch you know some of the
teams<00:03:19.989> that<00:03:20.109> grappler<00:03:21.040> would<00:03:21.190> play<00:03:21.430> against

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
teams that grappler would play against

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.449 
teams that grappler would play against
and<00:03:22.419> I<00:03:22.900> felt<00:03:23.139> as<00:03:23.319> if<00:03:23.349> I<00:03:23.650> was<00:03:23.859> watching<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.400> a

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
and I felt as if I was watching it a

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.789 
and I felt as if I was watching it a
little<00:03:24.669> bit<00:03:24.849> in<00:03:24.970> slow<00:03:25.239> motion<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.930> obviously

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
little bit in slow motion and obviously

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.319 
little bit in slow motion and obviously
wasn't<00:03:27.130> playing<00:03:27.310> against<00:03:27.639> Alabama<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.239> LSU

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
wasn't playing against Alabama and LSU

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.240 
wasn't playing against Alabama and LSU
and<00:03:29.109> he's<00:03:29.260> playing<00:03:29.500> against<00:03:29.799> teams<00:03:29.950> like

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
and he's playing against teams like

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.379 
and he's playing against teams like
Tennessee<00:03:30.700> State<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.180> UT<00:03:31.510> Martin<00:03:31.900> so<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.970> that

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
Tennessee State and UT Martin so in that

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.059 
Tennessee State and UT Martin so in that
respect<00:03:34.599> I<00:03:34.989> felt<00:03:35.200> as<00:03:35.349> if<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.650> know<00:03:35.769> he<00:03:35.919> took

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
respect I felt as if you know he took

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.099 
respect I felt as if you know he took
advantage<00:03:36.519> of<00:03:36.849> his<00:03:37.000> opposition<00:03:37.180> he

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
advantage of his opposition he

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.620 
advantage of his opposition he
definitely<00:03:39.069> lit<00:03:39.609> up<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.849> scoreboards<00:03:40.419> at

this is a quarterback we could see going

this is a quarterback we could see going
to<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.810> team<00:04:15.140> that<00:04:15.170> doesn't<00:04:15.800> take<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.010> shot<00:04:16.400> on<00:04:16.640> a

to<00:04:31.100> one<00:04:31.280> of<00:04:31.400> those<00:04:31.460> seven<00:04:31.850> teams<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.390> know<00:04:32.510> a

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
to one of those seven teams you know a

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.390 
to one of those seven teams you know a
team<00:04:33.260> that<00:04:33.470> doesn't<00:04:33.800> pull<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.040> trigger<00:04:34.250> on

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
team that doesn't pull the trigger on

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.090 
team that doesn't pull the trigger on
the<00:04:34.490> quarterback<00:04:34.880> in<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.090> first<00:04:35.330> round<00:04:35.600> and

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
the quarterback in the first round and

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.460 
the quarterback in the first round and
goes<00:04:37.100> with<00:04:37.280> grapple<00:04:38.090> in<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.240> second<00:04:38.630> perhaps

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
goes with grapple in the second perhaps

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.370 
goes with grapple in the second perhaps
if<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.800> team<00:04:39.980> absolutely<00:04:40.640> gets<00:04:41.380> ridiculously

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
if a team absolutely gets ridiculously

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.530 
if a team absolutely gets ridiculously
desperate<00:04:43.220> they<00:04:43.520> take<00:04:43.760> them<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.030> first<00:04:44.240> but<00:04:44.420> I

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
desperate they take them the first but I

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.840 
desperate they take them the first but I
doubt<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:45.080> I'm<00:04:45.350> saying<00:04:45.680> second<00:04:46.190> rounder<00:04:46.580> I'm

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
doubt that I'm saying second rounder I'm

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.580 
doubt that I'm saying second rounder I'm
saying<00:04:47.300> Garoppolo<00:04:47.660> this<00:04:48.140> is<00:04:48.200> gonna<00:04:48.320> be<00:04:48.500> an

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
saying Garoppolo this is gonna be an

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.260 
saying Garoppolo this is gonna be an
up-and-coming<00:04:49.130> guy<00:04:49.400> that<00:04:49.700> you're<00:04:49.850> gonna<00:04:50.030> hear

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
up-and-coming guy that you're gonna hear

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.210 
up-and-coming guy that you're gonna hear
about<00:04:50.300> a<00:04:50.540> little<00:04:50.840> bit<00:04:50.960> more<00:04:51.200> in<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.770> following

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
about a little bit more in the following

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.100 
about a little bit more in the following
months<00:04:52.700> I<00:04:52.880> would<00:04:53.150> be<00:04:53.270> surprised<00:04:53.690> if<00:04:53.810> he<00:04:53.870> kind

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
months I would be surprised if he kind

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.600 
months I would be surprised if he kind
of<00:04:54.170> falls<00:04:54.410> off<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:54.830> heads<00:04:55.010> into<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.310> fifth

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
of falls off and heads into the fifth

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.850 
of falls off and heads into the fifth
six<00:04:55.850> or<00:04:56.000> seventh<00:04:56.330> round<00:04:56.390> I<00:04:56.810> think<00:04:57.500> we<00:04:57.650> could

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
six or seventh round I think we could

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.590 
six or seventh round I think we could
see<00:04:58.040> grapple<00:04:58.610> making<00:04:58.910> that<00:04:59.030> second-round

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
see grapple making that second-round
