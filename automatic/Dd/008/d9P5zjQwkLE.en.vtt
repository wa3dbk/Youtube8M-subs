00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
a very good football team but that was

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.490 
a very good football team but that was
pretty<00:02:04.140> pathetic<00:02:04.939> and<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.540> play<00:02:07.020> where<00:02:07.350> they

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
pretty pathetic and that play where they

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.160 
pretty pathetic and that play where they
shifted<00:02:08.039> into<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.119> very<00:02:09.450> weird

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
shifted into like this very weird

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.940 
shifted into like this very weird
formation

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
formation

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.740 
formation
never<00:02:11.190> seen<00:02:11.520> when<00:02:12.030> they<00:02:12.180> were<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.629> kick

a field goal and they shifted into that
weird<00:02:15.450> formation<00:02:16.110> then<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.310> kicker<00:02:17.550> got

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
weird formation then like the kicker got

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.839 
weird formation then like the kicker got
the<00:02:18.090> ball<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.599> then<00:02:18.720> he<00:02:18.989> got<00:02:19.650> hit<00:02:19.980> by<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> giants
