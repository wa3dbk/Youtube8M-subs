00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
first years as a starter are almost

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.200 
first years as a starter are almost
unprecedented<00:01:32.619> in<00:01:33.130> NFL<00:01:33.670> history<00:01:33.700> they've<00:01:34.090> got

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
unprecedented in NFL history they've got

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.459 
unprecedented in NFL history they've got
the<00:01:34.299> Super<00:01:34.509> Bowl<00:01:34.539> what<00:01:35.049> do<00:01:35.109> you<00:01:35.140> do<00:01:35.259> for<00:01:35.409> an

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
the Super Bowl what do you do for an

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:36.870 
the Super Bowl what do you do for an
encore<00:01:35.500> what<00:01:35.859> is<00:01:35.950> Russell<00:01:36.310> Wilson<00:01:36.670> not<00:01:36.789> the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
encore what is Russell Wilson not the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.010 
encore what is Russell Wilson not the
seahawks<00:01:37.180> but<00:01:37.270> what<00:01:37.479> do<00:01:37.539> you<00:01:37.659> do<00:01:37.810> for<00:01:37.960> an

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
seahawks but what do you do for an

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.810 
seahawks but what do you do for an
encore<00:01:38.079> I<00:01:38.530> think<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.070> big<00:01:39.219> the<00:01:39.520> biggest

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
encore I think the big the biggest

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.920 
encore I think the big the biggest
things<00:01:39.969> continue<00:01:40.299> to<00:01:40.359> be<00:01:40.450> consistent

things continue to be consistent

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.260 
things continue to be consistent
continue<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.469> go<00:01:42.189> out<00:01:42.310> there<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:42.729> make<00:01:43.060> the
