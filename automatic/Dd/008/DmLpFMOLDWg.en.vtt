00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
hi I'm Dave Epstein this is growing

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.240 
hi I'm Dave Epstein this is growing
wisdom<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.170> we're<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> garden<00:00:25.980> today<00:00:26.130> you

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
wisdom and we're in the garden today you

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.830 
wisdom and we're in the garden today you
know<00:00:26.460> one<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.820> things<00:00:27.060> about<00:00:27.210> gardening

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
know one of the things about gardening

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.740 
know one of the things about gardening
is<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.099> constantly<00:00:29.820> evolving<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.510> when

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
is that it's constantly evolving so when

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.680 
is that it's constantly evolving so when
you<00:00:30.869> plant<00:00:31.349> plants<00:00:31.520> they<00:00:32.520> hopefully<00:00:32.730> grow<00:00:33.239> so

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
you plant plants they hopefully grow so

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.470 
you plant plants they hopefully grow so
they<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:33.989> bigger<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.530> bigger<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.340> bigger

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
they get bigger and bigger and bigger

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.549 
they get bigger and bigger and bigger
which<00:00:36.480> means<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.870> eventually<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
which means that eventually you have to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.110 
which means that eventually you have to
start<00:00:37.890> moving<00:00:38.190> stuff<00:00:38.370> around<00:00:38.550> now<00:00:38.940> I'm

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
start moving stuff around now I'm

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
start moving stuff around now I'm
fortunate<00:00:39.480> enough<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.469> lot<00:00:41.010> of

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
fortunate enough that I have a lot of

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.030 
fortunate enough that I have a lot of
space<00:00:41.460> behind<00:00:41.760> me<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.140> I'm<00:00:43.350> having<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.860> do

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
space behind me so what I'm having to do

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.729 
space behind me so what I'm having to do
is<00:00:44.340> take<00:00:44.760> some<00:00:44.789> things<00:00:45.270> from<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.170> move

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
is take some things from here and move

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.560 
is take some things from here and move
them<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.100> there<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.059> what<00:00:48.180> we're<00:00:48.300> going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.450> do

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
today we're going to move a Japanese

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.340 
today we're going to move a Japanese
maple<00:00:50.730> which<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.210> very<00:00:51.510> crowded<00:00:51.809> by<00:00:52.170> some

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
maple which is very crowded by some

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
maple which is very crowded by some
other<00:00:52.500> perennials<00:00:53.100> now<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.730> may<00:00:53.940> say<00:00:54.180> well

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
other perennials now you may say well

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.779 
other perennials now you may say well
how<00:00:54.510> did<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.750> happen<00:00:55.379> well<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.100> put<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> lot<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
how did that happen well I put a lot of

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.490 
how did that happen well I put a lot of
plants<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> spring<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.440> don't

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
plants in in the spring and I don't

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.430 
plants in in the spring and I don't
remember<00:00:58.829> exactly<00:00:59.430> where<00:01:00.270> everything<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.960> so

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
remember exactly where everything is so

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.170 
remember exactly where everything is so
sometimes<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.160> put<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> plant<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:03.149> a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
sometimes I put a plant in like a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.690 
sometimes I put a plant in like a
Japanese<00:01:03.690> maple<00:01:03.899> four<00:01:04.799> weeks<00:01:05.040> later<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
Japanese maple four weeks later the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.210 
Japanese maple four weeks later the
hostage<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> ferns<00:01:06.689> come<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.830> just

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
hostage the ferns come up and it's just

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.010 
hostage the ferns come up and it's just
too<00:01:08.340> crowded<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.850> I've<00:01:09.030> got<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.330> move<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
too crowded so I've got to move it the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.140 
too crowded so I've got to move it the
good<00:01:10.290> thing<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.159> Japanese<00:01:11.790> maples

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
good thing is that that Japanese maples

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.060 
good thing is that that Japanese maples
only<00:01:12.570> been<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> ground<00:01:13.049> for<00:01:13.320> about<00:01:13.680> six

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
only been in the ground for about six

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.060 
only been in the ground for about six
weeks<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.090> move<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.390> pretty<00:01:15.720> easily<00:01:19.070> so

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
weeks so we can move it pretty easily so

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.620 
weeks so we can move it pretty easily so
this<00:01:20.250> particular<00:01:20.490> Japanese<00:01:21.180> maple<00:01:21.509> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
this particular Japanese maple is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.510 
this particular Japanese maple is
emerald<00:01:22.049> Laith<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.830> really<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.340> it

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
emerald Laith and I really like it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.370 
emerald Laith and I really like it
because<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.270> Japanese<00:01:24.750> maple<00:01:24.930> has<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
because the Japanese maple has that

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.050 
because the Japanese maple has that
great<00:01:25.619> lacy<00:01:26.009> texture<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.850> it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
great lacy texture to it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.569 
great lacy texture to it
as<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.930> told<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.350> earlier<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:29.009> only<00:01:29.220> been<00:01:29.430> in

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
as I told you earlier it's only been in

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.160 
as I told you earlier it's only been in
the<00:01:29.640> ground<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.150> very<00:01:30.479> short<00:01:30.600> period<00:01:31.110> of

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the ground for a very short period of

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.410 
the ground for a very short period of
time<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.189> will<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:32.549> take<00:01:32.880> me<00:01:33.119> very<00:01:33.150> long

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
time so this will not take me very long

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.440 
time so this will not take me very long
at<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.500> dig<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.280> up<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.759> want<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
at all to dig this up I want you to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.880 
at all to dig this up I want you to
notice<00:01:36.659> how<00:01:36.840> easily<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.470> came<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
notice how easily this came out of the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.950 
notice how easily this came out of the
ground<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.460> look<00:01:38.640> very<00:01:38.939> closely<00:01:39.390> here

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
ground and if you look very closely here

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.620 
ground and if you look very closely here
you'll<00:01:40.409> see<00:01:40.619> some<00:01:40.650> new<00:01:41.009> roots<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.329> want<00:01:42.540> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you'll see some new roots and I want to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.060 
you'll see some new roots and I want to
quickly<00:01:42.869> get<00:01:43.170> those<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> ground<00:01:43.890> before

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
quickly get those in the ground before

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.710 
quickly get those in the ground before
they<00:01:44.460> dry<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.659> be

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
they dry out because it's going to be

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.660 
they dry out because it's going to be
hot<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.290> next<00:01:46.500> couple<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.890> days<00:01:47.070> but

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
hot here in the next couple of days but

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.830 
hot here in the next couple of days but
the<00:01:47.820> good<00:01:48.000> news<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.540> I've<00:01:48.659> basically

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the good news is is I've basically

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.649 
the good news is is I've basically
gotten<00:01:49.380> all<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.130> roots<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.299> plant

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
gotten all of the roots that this plant

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.929 
gotten all of the roots that this plant
has<00:01:51.930> supporting<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.700> when<00:01:53.850> it

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
has supporting it out so that when it

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.350 
has supporting it out so that when it
goes<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> ground<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.750> should<00:01:54.990> be<00:01:55.170> fine

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
goes in the ground it should be fine

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.090 
goes in the ground it should be fine
if<00:01:57.900> you're<00:01:58.170> moving<00:01:58.290> things<00:01:58.680> during<00:01:59.010> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
if you're moving things during the

is an opportunity to amend the soil if

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.620 
is an opportunity to amend the soil if
you<00:02:14.070> need<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.940> means<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.270> could<00:02:15.420> add

you need to that means you could add

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.890 
you need to that means you could add
better<00:02:16.290> soil<00:02:16.710> or<00:02:17.130> other<00:02:17.520> nutrients<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.390> don't

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
compost and humus added to it so I don't

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.360 
compost and humus added to it so I don't
need<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.900> add<00:02:25.050> anything<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.830> I'm<00:02:25.920> not<00:02:26.100> going

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
to the only thing I'll need to do is

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.920 
to the only thing I'll need to do is
water<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.440> plant<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:32.450> whenever<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.660> move<00:02:33.810> a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
water this plant in whenever you move a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.420 
water this plant in whenever you move a
plant<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.350> an<00:02:34.440> opportunity<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.040> look<00:02:35.250> at<00:02:35.340> a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
plant it's an opportunity to look at a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.340 
plant it's an opportunity to look at a
couple<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.760> other<00:02:35.910> things<00:02:36.030> how<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.080> plant

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
couple of other things how is the plant

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.680 
couple of other things how is the plant
faced<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.400> right<00:02:38.640> now<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:39.000> feels<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.540> me<00:02:39.570> like

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
faced so right now it feels to me like

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.230 
faced so right now it feels to me like
the<00:02:39.959> plant<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.440> faced<00:02:40.770> more<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.459> this<00:02:41.790> plane

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
the plant is faced more in this plane

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.190 
the plant is faced more in this plane
from<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.320> path<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:44.400> way<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.510> my<00:02:45.660> right<00:02:45.690> I

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
from the path that way so to my right I

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.230 
from the path that way so to my right I
actually<00:02:46.590> want<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> turn<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.610> plant<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:48.000> little

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
actually want to turn the plant a little

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.660 
actually want to turn the plant a little
bit<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.990> is<00:02:49.200> with<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:50.040> path<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.430> little<00:02:50.459> bit

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
bit so it is with the path a little bit

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.010 
bit so it is with the path a little bit
more<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.120> think<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.570> plant<00:02:51.810> should<00:02:51.959> be

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
more I think that the plant should be

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:02.060 
more I think that the plant should be
facing<00:02:52.350> like<00:02:53.190> this<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:01.320> one<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.800> things<00:03:01.950> I

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
facing like this so one of the things I

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.550 
facing like this so one of the things I
like<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.400> do<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.790> place<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.540> get<00:03:04.140> out<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
like to do is place it get out of the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.890 
like to do is place it get out of the
way<00:03:04.739> look<00:03:05.730> at<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.030> from<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.330> perspective<00:03:06.570> of

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
way look at it from the perspective of

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.320 
way look at it from the perspective of
where<00:03:07.170> you'll<00:03:07.350> see<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.010> most<00:03:08.250> which<00:03:08.640> here

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
where you'll see it the most which here

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.570 
where you'll see it the most which here
would<00:03:09.660> be<00:03:09.780> walking<00:03:10.230> along<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.650> path<00:03:10.890> looking

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
would be walking along the path looking

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.370 
would be walking along the path looking
to<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.850> left<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.239> then<00:03:12.420> seeing<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.900> plant<00:03:13.200> I

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
to the left and then seeing the plant I

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.840 
to the left and then seeing the plant I
need<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.010> straighten<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.400> up<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.820> little

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
need to straighten it up just a little

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.400 
need to straighten it up just a little
bit<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.360> then<00:03:15.630> we're<00:03:15.720> going<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.870> plant<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.260> in

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
bit and then we're going to plant it in

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.800 
bit and then we're going to plant it in
and<00:03:16.620> give<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:16.920> some<00:03:17.070> water<00:03:17.660> I'm<00:03:18.660> actually

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
and give it some water I'm actually

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.540 
and give it some water I'm actually
using<00:03:19.320> some<00:03:19.350> of<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.680> soil<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.100> was<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.430> the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
using some of the soil that was in the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.100 
using some of the soil that was in the
hole<00:03:20.730> before<00:03:20.940> because<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.540> was<00:03:21.660> such<00:03:21.840> great

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
hole before because it was such great

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.940 
hole before because it was such great
soil<00:03:23.900> make<00:03:24.900> sure<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.320> no<00:03:25.440> air<00:03:25.709> pockets

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
soil make sure you have no air pockets

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.040 
soil make sure you have no air pockets
under<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.550> plant<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.269> roots<00:03:27.510> don't<00:03:27.690> want<00:03:27.959> to

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
under the plant the roots don't want to

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.410 
under the plant the roots don't want to
grow<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.320> air<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.070> really<00:03:29.430> pack<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.850> soil<00:03:30.180> in

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
grow in air so really pack that soil in

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.540 
grow in air so really pack that soil in
underneath<00:03:30.780> quite<00:03:31.290> tightly<00:03:34.040> so<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> plant<00:03:35.370> is

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
underneath quite tightly so the plant is

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.820 
underneath quite tightly so the plant is
in<00:03:35.730> we've<00:03:36.209> planted<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.750> correctly<00:03:37.170> we've

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
in we've planted it correctly we've

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.470 
in we've planted it correctly we've
actually<00:03:38.070> increased<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.790> longevity<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:39.390> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
actually increased the longevity of the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.910 
actually increased the longevity of the
plant<00:03:39.720> because<00:03:39.989> now<00:03:40.140> we've<00:03:40.320> given<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.680> space

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
plant because now we've given it space

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.410 
plant because now we've given it space
to<00:03:41.130> grow<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.610> that's<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.970> whole<00:03:42.120> point<00:03:42.300> of

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
to grow and that's the whole point of

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.900
