can't remember exactly what they are but
I<00:04:02.230> figured<00:04:02.620> around<00:04:02.950> they<00:04:03.130> would<00:04:03.280> probably<00:04:03.670> be

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
I figured around they would probably be

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.160 
I figured around they would probably be
around<00:04:03.970> 650<00:04:04.810> 625<00:04:05.350> apiece<00:04:06.209> so<00:04:07.209> two<00:04:07.870> hundred

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
around 650 625 apiece so two hundred

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.260 
around 650 625 apiece so two hundred
eighty<00:04:08.260> eight<00:04:08.500> dollars<00:04:08.530> roughly<00:04:09.520> here<00:04:09.850> four

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
eighty eight dollars roughly here four

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.580 
eighty eight dollars roughly here four
hundred<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.570> forty-three<00:04:10.870> percent<00:04:11.170> profit

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
hundred and forty-three percent profit

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.470 
hundred and forty-three percent profit
actually<00:04:12.400> more<00:04:12.580> than<00:04:12.610> that<00:04:12.820> because<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.270> fact

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
actually more than that because the fact

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.770 
actually more than that because the fact
that<00:04:13.660> i<00:04:14.050> don't<00:04:14.500> think<00:04:14.680> i<00:04:14.740> paid<00:04:14.920> for<00:04:15.160> them<00:04:15.780> and

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780
