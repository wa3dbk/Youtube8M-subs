00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi to all this the room in this 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.549
 video i will introduce you to the team 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.740
 deathmatch so it's the clashes 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.820
 in a team simply why because 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.690
 we do a lot of shopping 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.380
 but we do not do a lot 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.660
 clashes 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.130
 in addition to that we are on ps4 and here it is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.680
 a pc ranking that I'm going to you 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.000
 then show on pc there are people who 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.570
 are really in the background 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.850
 clashes 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.740
 I do not know if it's French I 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.660
 do not know if it's American but in 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.340
 any hat case for what they did 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.699
 so I show you this is this image 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.920
 so top pc crew team deathmatch so 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.559
 clashes in teams of ten to thirty 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.780
 members so by team and that's the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.760
 ranking for the month of April and for 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.260
 the month of May 2015 so then the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.390
 ranking it will evolve over time 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.489
 so already what we notice is that 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.320
 the first they are eleven members then 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.789
 that the second third fourth and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.000
 fifth they all have more than 11 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.430
 therefore already know whether the fact 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.739
 to be as little as possible in the team 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.350
 it's an advantage so we'll see that by 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.890
 following their deathmatch team play 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.409
 so team clashes play 393 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.030
 for the first team including 330 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.369
 victory so already it's still 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.110
 huge what they did so even same 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.490
 if they are not a lot in the team 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.869
 their number of victories it is when 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.380
 even big enough so that they have 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.820
 first place then we win 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.740
 by members and there we have 30 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.020
 so apparently we take the number of 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.490
 victories and then we divide by the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.310
 number of members and we have 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.689
 approximately the number of victories 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.009
 by members we will see in 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.780
 following rankings that it's not 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.610
 really quite that but in any case 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.229
 about and then we have the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.799
 winning percentage so there the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.659
 percentage 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.750
 he is simply well above 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.420
 another 1 84% victory for 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.360
 the team and they are that 11% who 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.770
 is called the xxx it's there so I 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.130
 do not know if you already knew them or 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.070
 no 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.810
 second we have the white skeleton unit 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.670
 so they played a little bit more 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.530
 of clashes they played 423 so 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.729
 that's why they win on this 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.969
 point that's why it's antwerp 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.619
 however, they won 290 out of 423 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.119
 so they played more than the 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.200
 first and they earned less so 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.140
 that's why they're in second 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.090
 place and so they have 20 victories by 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.690
 members and there as you see if we 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.590
 multiplies sale by 14 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.020
 we get 280 so not 290 it's for 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.780
 that I told you that it was 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.120
 approximate and we have 68.6% wins 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.280
 in third we have the magnum dong teams 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.590
 so they are a lot they are 23 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.930
 so by the way in the east in the top 5 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.780
 it is they who have the most members 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.390
 played 294 clashes they have 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.290
 won 233 it's really not bad it's 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.820
 for that there are 79 3% wins and 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.960
 they have ten wins per members but 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.720
 it's simply because they are 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.660
 a lot then being less of that 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.980
 actually allows you to have at least one 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.140
 stuff in which you are the best 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.330
 it's the victories by members then 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.040
 we went and youth them they are twelve 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.090
 members so like the first ones who are 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.170
 eleven they are not much 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.600
 so they have 81 4% of victory they 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.940
 played 275 clashes they have 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.590
 won 221 so they are promising 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.540
 I think when they play the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.980
 same number of clashes as the 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.480
 first they will not be far behind 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.640
 them or maybe even they're going to them 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.410
 catch up so we'll see well and finally in 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.380
 last we have the urban legend they are 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.340
 twenty members 78% 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.840
 despite being 20 members so 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.480
 like the thirds they still 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.010
 a good score but by cons in the top 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.830
 5 the last three of the top 5 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.510
 they have not won anything so they have nothing in 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.190
 glass I present you this ranking 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.230
 even if it is on pc and we play 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.580
 not necessarily on pc but it is so that 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.800
 you see pretty much what's going on 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.030
 in the world of those who love them 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.739
 clashes as we have 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.880
 does a lot of shopping and we do 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.160
 not a lot of clashes 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.480
 if you ever have equivalent stats 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.130
 that you have a team or what 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.360
 do not hesitate to put in the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.489
 comments to present your 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.970
 statistics to you even if you play 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.220
 alone 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.590
 I know that there was a French who 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.269
 was playing quite a lot that had me 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.580
 contacted so he too if he recognizes 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.019
 he can put his stats in the 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.280
 comments 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.660
 because even in France we can say 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.800
 we still have a lot of players 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.370
 who are good there are not only 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.810
 US 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.459
 when there will be a new ranking 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.410
 when it will move in the world of 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.030
 Clashes you I will share it 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.810
 that's all for this video and I 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.410
 tell you just now 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.410
 ciao
