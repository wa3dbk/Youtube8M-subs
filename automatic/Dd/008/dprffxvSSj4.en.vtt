00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.340
 Hello, today I want to show you 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.080
 how to make a cross with 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.810
 biconuses and such large beads 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:44.180
 besides bicone beads required 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:46.690
 a piece of thick fishing line about 90 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.690
 centimeters 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:57.739
 then I gather on the line 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:01:03.980
 one bead and bicone on one side on 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:07.940
 one side of the fishing line and on the other then 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.430
 again, but through him I spend the line already 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.520
 and in the opposite direction so that 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.729
 this big bead fishing line 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:22.490
 crossed over 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:26.570
 and pull it all over the middle again again 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.810
 I put a pub cone on both sides through 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.300
 one of the biconuses I spend the fishing line in 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:41.959
 the opposite direction is one of two 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:44.740
 one down already 2 here here so it 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.740
 should look like 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.649
 then I put a large bead on that 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.080
 which line is here 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.770
 crossed the fishing line in one of the beads here 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:03.759
 on this side I put on a large one then 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.759
 small again and cross lines in it 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.950
 after i got by 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.310
 the edges are two times three large beads and 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:43.870
 middle 4 i just type a large one 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:47.350
 bead and spend a line in extreme well that 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.590
 eat in the next small bead and now 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.510
 you here in the middle I link these two 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.510
 fishing line and ideals somewhere 3 knots 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:13.890
 how do you see the little image 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.950
 cross already ready now we just 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.010
 no matter which way you are 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.260
 decided to further refine this or 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.840
 that you have to take the line 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.970
 so that in one of the major 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.860
 beadin but words ok 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.319
 baptized this most 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.810
 naturally occurs therefore 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.989
 for starters i'm here after and 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.370
 made the knots rule fishing line through one 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:44.400
 small bead now through another and 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.250
 then I can hold them in large 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.720
 beads are not so that they seem to be themselves 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.720
 on their own overlap 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.670
 then i'm picking up little beads 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:18.299
 on the left on the right line and one large 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:21.390
 in which everything intersects last 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.260
 you will have this 4 beads 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.370
 type small large small and 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.030
 tie 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.030
 nodule 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.040
 well now you just rise 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.650
 next bead and do the same 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.870
 only two or three times already 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.880
 but only once you recruit more 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.100
 only one bead on one side and 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.960
 another rome and it will be all set now 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.990
 show must be something that I 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.410
 it turned out there is no special scheme 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.230
 what bead to go through here you 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.080
 looking for all possible ways to bring 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.650
 nice to cross them in large 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:26.600
 beads bead and then dial this one 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:29.120
 piece again go into another bead go with 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.190
 other side again like this type and 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.200
 somewhere then tie a knot and 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.260
 hide their large beads just to 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.830
 there was no noticeable end trim and on this 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.500
 everything 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.480
 but the principle is exactly like she like me 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.740
 here you showed such a cross 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:48.710
 can use as suspension can 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.020
 to the keychain tie it all depends on 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.430
 Olevsk choice if the fishing line is thick 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.560
 here it is holding on its own 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.480
 not if the line is thin then of course it will 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.850
 I will not keep curling therefore 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.220
 take a thicker line about one 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.130
 millimeter but at the same time not 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.290
 too fat because you are through but 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.440
 im the smallest such bead 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:15.620
 have to go three times maximum four times 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.260
 I managed to pass my daughter 3 times 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.820
 no longer receives here on it all 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.820
 Thank you for your attention so far.
