00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
this will temper the chocolate a little

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.710 
this will temper the chocolate a little
bit<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.579> when<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.849> add<00:02:32.970> your<00:02:33.150> eggs<00:02:33.390> they

two eggs to the mixture and then stir
that<00:02:43.739> in<00:02:53.360> then<00:02:54.360> when<00:02:54.690> all<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.110> your<00:02:55.260> liquid

that in then when all of your liquid
ingredients<00:02:56.340> are<00:02:56.489> stirred<00:02:56.849> together<00:02:57.209> you're

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
ingredients are stirred together you're

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.599 
ingredients are stirred together you're
going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.900> add<00:02:58.019> your<00:02:58.230> dry<00:02:58.590> ingredients<00:02:58.950> and

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
you just want to stir this so that

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.610 
you just want to stir this so that
everything<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.489> combined<00:03:03.030> if<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.170> stir<00:03:04.440> this

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
everything is combined if you stir this

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.530 
everything is combined if you stir this
too<00:03:04.889> much<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.310> will<00:03:05.430> add<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.609> lot<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.060> air<00:03:06.329> and

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
too much it will add a lot of air and

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.340 
too much it will add a lot of air and
create<00:03:06.959> more<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.340> baked<00:03:08.940> texture<00:03:09.660> but<00:03:10.170> we're

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
create more of a baked texture but we're

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.440 
create more of a baked texture but we're
looking<00:03:10.560> for<00:03:10.769> more<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.549> fudgy<00:03:12.090> brownie

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
looking for more of a fudgy brownie

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.990 
looking for more of a fudgy brownie
something<00:03:13.109> more<00:03:13.319> to<00:03:13.620> eat<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:14.519> if<00:03:14.639> you<00:03:14.790> stir

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
something more to eat and so if you stir

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.970 
something more to eat and so if you stir
this<00:03:15.180> by<00:03:15.389> hand<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.049> everything<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.799> just

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
this by hand so that everything is just

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:25.059 
this by hand so that everything is just
combined<00:03:17.430> you'll<00:03:17.760> get<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.120> perfect<00:03:18.569> texture

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.699 

then<00:03:26.069> you<00:03:26.370> can<00:03:26.639> graze<00:03:27.150> ahead<00:03:27.480> flour<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:28.319> large

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
then you can graze ahead flour a large

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.949 
then you can graze ahead flour a large
pan<00:03:29.220> or<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:29.700> can<00:03:29.910> use<00:03:30.060> some<00:03:30.329> parchment<00:03:30.600> paper

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959

so that the brownies don't stick when

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:43.699 
so that the brownies don't stick when

the<00:04:33.599> fork<00:04:33.990> you'll<00:04:34.620> know<00:04:34.830> that<00:04:34.860> they're<00:04:35.340> done<00:04:35.370> I

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
the fork you'll know that they're done I

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.790

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
fully cool these brownies are really

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.510 
fully cool these brownies are really
fudgy<00:05:28.050> so<00:05:28.229> if<00:05:28.349> you<00:05:28.439> try<00:05:28.710> and<00:05:28.770> cut<00:05:29.009> them<00:05:29.189> as<00:05:29.309> soon

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
fudgy so if you try and cut them as soon

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.429 
fudgy so if you try and cut them as soon
as<00:05:29.669> they<00:05:29.789> come<00:05:29.999> in<00:05:30.059> in<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.360> oven<00:05:30.749> like<00:05:31.259> I

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:31.439 
as they come in in the oven like I

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:33.320 
as they come in in the oven like I
always<00:05:31.740> do<00:05:32.159> because<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.610> just<00:05:32.789> can't<00:05:33.029> wait<00:05:33.180> to

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
always do because I just can't wait to

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.589 
always do because I just can't wait to
eat<00:05:33.389> them<00:05:33.689> they'll<00:05:34.289> fall<00:05:34.800> apart<00:05:35.249> and<00:05:35.580> so<00:05:36.300> I

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
eat them they'll fall apart and so I

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.459 
eat them they'll fall apart and so I
would<00:05:36.809> just<00:05:37.020> wait<00:05:37.919> the<00:05:38.430> extra<00:05:39.060> 20<00:05:39.930> minutes<00:05:40.319> or

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
would just wait the extra 20 minutes or

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:42.439 
would just wait the extra 20 minutes or
so<00:05:40.770> for<00:05:41.129> them<00:05:41.249> to<00:05:41.279> be<00:05:41.490> completely<00:05:41.939> cooled

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
so for them to be completely cooled

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.450 
so for them to be completely cooled
before<00:05:42.629> cutting<00:05:43.020> them<00:05:43.319> up<00:05:43.469> and<00:05:43.680> then<00:05:44.310> you'll

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
before cutting them up and then you'll

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.279 
before cutting them up and then you'll
have<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:44.759> best<00:05:44.939> results<00:05:45.509> as<00:05:45.719> you<00:05:45.960> can<00:05:46.139> see

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
have the best results as you can see

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.260 
have the best results as you can see
these<00:05:46.469> brownies<00:05:46.919> aren't<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.699> healthiest

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
these brownies aren't the healthiest
