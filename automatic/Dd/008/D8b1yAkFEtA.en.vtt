bicycle and today i'm gonna talk to you

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.029 
bicycle and today i'm gonna talk to you
about<00:00:19.250> chained<00:00:20.089> stretch<00:00:20.570> so<00:00:21.410> if<00:00:21.769> you've<00:00:21.890> had

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
about chained stretch so if you've had

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.769 
about chained stretch so if you've had
your<00:00:22.220> chain<00:00:22.460> on<00:00:22.789> your<00:00:22.849> bicycle<00:00:23.269> for<00:00:23.539> a<00:00:23.570> long

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
your chain on your bicycle for a long

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.749 
your chain on your bicycle for a long
time<00:00:24.050> you've<00:00:24.349> been<00:00:24.470> riding<00:00:24.679> for<00:00:25.130> a<00:00:25.160> season<00:00:25.640> or

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
time you've been riding for a season or

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.050 
time you've been riding for a season or
two<00:00:25.939> seasons<00:00:26.419> and<00:00:26.740> you're<00:00:27.740> wondering<00:00:28.369> you

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
two seasons and you're wondering you

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.060 
two seasons and you're wondering you
know<00:00:29.089> is<00:00:29.329> my<00:00:29.509> chain<00:00:29.779> worn<00:00:29.989> out<00:00:30.169> it<00:00:30.829> might<00:00:30.980> be

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
know is my chain worn out it might be

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.950 
know is my chain worn out it might be
time<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:31.249> check<00:00:31.550> it's<00:00:31.820> pretty<00:00:32.150> easy<00:00:32.360> to<00:00:32.600> do<00:00:32.780> you

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
time to check it's pretty easy to do you

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.780 
time to check it's pretty easy to do you
can<00:00:33.500> do<00:00:33.650> it<00:00:33.770> very<00:00:33.890> simply<00:00:34.310> with<00:00:34.520> either<00:00:34.670> a

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
can do it very simply with either a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.020 
can do it very simply with either a
chain<00:00:35.090> checking<00:00:35.450> tool<00:00:35.630> or<00:00:35.930> just<00:00:35.990> with<00:00:36.590> a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
chain checking tool or just with a

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.290 
chain checking tool or just with a
normal<00:00:38.030> ruler<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.700> what<00:00:40.700> happens<00:00:41.060> when<00:00:41.180> it

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
normal ruler so what happens when it

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.580 
normal ruler so what happens when it
changed<00:00:41.600> stretches<00:00:42.020> it<00:00:42.140> doesn't<00:00:42.350> actually

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
changed stretches it doesn't actually

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.710 
changed stretches it doesn't actually
stretch<00:00:43.010> what<00:00:43.640> happens<00:00:43.940> is<00:00:44.090> that<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.420> the

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
stretch what happens is that the the the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.930 
stretch what happens is that the the the
a<00:00:45.440> chain<00:00:45.950> is<00:00:46.100> basically<00:00:46.430> made<00:00:46.550> up<00:00:46.670> of<00:00:46.760> two

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
a chain is basically made up of two

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.930 
a chain is basically made up of two
plates<00:00:47.240> that<00:00:47.450> press<00:00:47.870> over<00:00:48.290> pins<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:49.550> the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
plates that press over pins and so the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.910 
plates that press over pins and so the
the<00:00:50.240> interaction<00:00:50.720> between<00:00:51.020> those<00:00:51.410> those

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
the interaction between those those

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.340 
the interaction between those those
plates<00:00:52.490> and<00:00:52.730> those<00:00:52.850> pins<00:00:53.180> creates<00:00:53.900> friction

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
plates and those pins creates friction

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.290 
plates and those pins creates friction
the<00:00:54.500> friction<00:00:54.650> wears<00:00:55.100> away<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.550> pins<00:00:55.880> and<00:00:56.240> the

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
the friction wears away the pins and the

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.420 
the friction wears away the pins and the
pins<00:00:57.230> get<00:00:57.410> little<00:00:57.620> tiny<00:00:57.740> grooves<00:00:58.130> in<00:00:58.310> them

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
pins get little tiny grooves in them

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.570 
pins get little tiny grooves in them
over<00:00:58.580> time<00:00:59.410> those<00:01:00.410> grooves<00:01:00.710> add<00:01:00.890> up<00:01:01.130> and<00:01:01.340> the

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
over time those grooves add up and the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.299 
over time those grooves add up and the
chain<00:01:02.090> grows<00:01:02.540> in<00:01:02.810> length<00:01:03.050> and<00:01:03.890> this<00:01:04.009> will<00:01:04.189> make

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
chain grows in length and this will make

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.209 
chain grows in length and this will make
the<00:01:04.430> chain<00:01:04.640> not<00:01:04.879> sit<00:01:05.329> over<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.719> teeth<00:01:05.929> of<00:01:06.920> your

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:07.219 
the chain not sit over the teeth of your

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.429 
the chain not sit over the teeth of your
chain<00:01:07.609> rings<00:01:07.820> very<00:01:07.969> well<00:01:08.240> it<00:01:08.749> will<00:01:08.869> cause<00:01:09.079> the

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
chain rings very well it will cause the

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.200 
chain rings very well it will cause the
shifting<00:01:09.859> to<00:01:09.950> skip<00:01:10.280> no<00:01:10.549> matter<00:01:10.700> how<00:01:10.909> well<00:01:11.179> you

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
shifting to skip no matter how well you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.139 
shifting to skip no matter how well you
you<00:01:11.600> tune<00:01:12.170> your<00:01:12.289> derailleur<00:01:12.530> zin<00:01:12.829> so<00:01:13.549> check<00:01:14.030> in

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
you tune your derailleur zin so check in

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.520 
you tune your derailleur zin so check in
your<00:01:14.210> chain<00:01:14.450> it's<00:01:14.600> always<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.810> good<00:01:14.929> idea<00:01:15.020> it's

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
your chain it's always a good idea it's

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.529 
your chain it's always a good idea it's
very<00:01:15.740> easy<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.310> here's<00:01:16.549> how<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:16.729> do<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:16.909> with

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
very easy and here's how you do it with

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.440 
very easy and here's how you do it with
a<00:01:17.569> chain<00:01:17.869> checker<00:01:18.109> like<00:01:18.409> this<00:01:18.560> one<00:01:18.880> if<00:01:19.880> you

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
a chain checker like this one if you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.899 
a chain checker like this one if you
insert<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.020> chain<00:01:21.229> checker<00:01:21.499> into<00:01:22.249> the<00:01:22.579> chain

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
insert the chain checker into the chain

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.870 
insert the chain checker into the chain
it<00:01:23.780> will<00:01:23.990> tell<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:24.380> in<00:01:24.560> this<00:01:24.740> case<00:01:25.009> if<00:01:25.399> it<00:01:25.609> fits

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
it will tell you in this case if it fits

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.139 
it will tell you in this case if it fits
in<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.210> this<00:01:26.359> side<00:01:26.569> you're<00:01:27.170> 0.75<00:01:28.069> I<00:01:28.700> believe

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
in on this side you're 0.75 I believe

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.719 
in on this side you're 0.75 I believe
it's<00:01:29.299> 0.75<00:01:29.869> millimeters<00:01:30.380> stretched<00:01:30.710> if<00:01:30.979> you

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
it's 0.75 millimeters stretched if you

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.149 
it's 0.75 millimeters stretched if you
insert<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:32.420> on<00:01:32.539> this<00:01:32.810> side<00:01:33.319> your<00:01:33.530> one<00:01:33.859> full

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
insert it on this side your one full

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.580 
insert it on this side your one full
millimeter<00:01:34.549> stretched<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.689> is<00:01:35.899> too<00:01:36.229> far

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
millimeter stretched and that is too far

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.399 
millimeter stretched and that is too far
gone<00:01:36.889> if<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:38.090> see<00:01:38.299> that<00:01:38.479> much<00:01:38.749> chain<00:01:39.049> stretch

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
gone if you see that much chain stretch

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.989 
gone if you see that much chain stretch
in<00:01:39.710> your<00:01:39.920> chain<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:40.219> some<00:01:40.490> chain<00:01:40.700> checkers

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
in your chain and some chain checkers

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.580 
in your chain and some chain checkers
will<00:01:41.149> actually<00:01:41.359> tell<00:01:41.569> you<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.810> measurement<00:01:42.319> of

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
will actually tell you a measurement of

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.069 
will actually tell you a measurement of
how<00:01:42.679> far<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.189> chain<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.609> stretched<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.209> if

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
how far the chain is stretched and if

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.199 
how far the chain is stretched and if
you<00:01:45.170> can<00:01:45.319> see<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.829> it's<00:01:46.280> stretched<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.909> far

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
you can see that it's stretched that far

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.449 
you can see that it's stretched that far
it's<00:01:47.539> time<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.959> replace<00:01:48.289> if<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.100> don't<00:01:49.249> have<00:01:49.429> a

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
it's time to replace if you don't have a

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.370 
it's time to replace if you don't have a
chain<00:01:49.700> tool<00:01:49.969> at<00:01:50.299> a<00:01:50.689> chain<00:01:50.959> check<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.289> your

chain tool at a chain check of your
house<00:01:51.499> you<00:01:51.859> could<00:01:52.039> always<00:01:52.159> just<00:01:52.520> use<00:01:52.850> a

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
house you could always just use a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.510 
house you could always just use a
standard<00:01:53.270> ruler<00:01:53.749> now<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.920> use<00:01:55.039> a<00:01:55.069> ruler<00:01:55.340> to
