okay<00:00:03.870> friends<00:00:04.759> let<00:00:05.759> us<00:00:05.790> talk<00:00:06.089> about<00:00:07.429> the<00:00:08.429> model

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
okay friends let us talk about the model

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.980 
okay friends let us talk about the model
of<00:00:10.670> organization<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.880> Golgi<00:00:12.269> apparatus<00:00:12.450> or

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
of organization of a Golgi apparatus or

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.499 
of organization of a Golgi apparatus or
how<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> Golgi<00:00:14.040> apparatus<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.639> made<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.269> how

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
how a Golgi apparatus is made and how

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.010 
how a Golgi apparatus is made and how
giobertis<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.680> fully<00:00:17.250> function<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.840> this

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
giobertis is fully function so in this

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.900 
giobertis is fully function so in this
picture<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:20.039> representation<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.880> have

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
picture in this representation we have

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.730 
picture in this representation we have
two<00:00:21.180> different<00:00:21.570> pictures<00:00:21.720> stating<00:00:22.500> two

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
two different pictures stating two

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.050 
two different pictures stating two
different<00:00:23.250> models

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
different models

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.089 
different models
if<00:00:24.119> explaining<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> organization<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.710> Golgi

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
if explaining the organization of Golgi

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.609 
if explaining the organization of Golgi
apparatus<00:00:26.240> in<00:00:27.240> first<00:00:27.779> model<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.199> call<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
apparatus in first model we call it the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.679 
apparatus in first model we call it the
vesicle<00:00:29.099> transfer<00:00:29.699> model<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> second

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
vesicle transfer model and the second

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.999 
vesicle transfer model and the second
one<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:30.990> call<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.380> sister<00:00:31.769> neural

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
one we call it the sister neural

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.370 
one we call it the sister neural
maturation<00:00:32.730> model<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.020> vesicular

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
maturation model so in the vesicular

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.700 
maturation model so in the vesicular
transport<00:00:34.739> model<00:00:35.340> what<00:00:36.030> happens<00:00:36.290> just<00:00:37.290> look

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
transport model what happens just look

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.410 
transport model what happens just look
at<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> picture<00:00:38.430> looking<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> which<00:00:39.270> we

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
at the picture looking at the which we

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.139 
at the picture looking at the which we
can<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.110> normally<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.579> peak<00:00:41.760> those

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
can see that normally in the peak those

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.420 
can see that normally in the peak those
pictures<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.809> similar<00:00:43.710> because<00:00:44.070> in

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
pictures are similar because in

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.910 
pictures are similar because in
structural<00:00:45.059> prospective<00:00:45.989> both<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.559> pictures

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
structural prospective both the pictures

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.369 
structural prospective both the pictures
are<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> similar<00:00:47.640> because<00:00:48.239> whenever<00:00:49.170> you

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
are the similar because whenever you

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.680 
are the similar because whenever you
find<00:00:49.620> Golgi<00:00:50.370> bodies<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.850> Cell<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.420> found

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
find Golgi bodies in a Cell we found

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.959 
find Golgi bodies in a Cell we found
this<00:00:52.530> type<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.449> vesicular<00:00:54.449> tubular<00:00:55.020> cluster

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
this type of vesicular tubular cluster

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.049 
this type of vesicular tubular cluster
and<00:00:56.989> ER<00:00:57.989> lumen<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.620> ER<00:00:59.039> endoplasmic<00:00:59.370> reticulum

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and ER lumen so ER endoplasmic reticulum

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.090 
and ER lumen so ER endoplasmic reticulum
right<00:01:00.239> after<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.320> found<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.800> vesicular

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
right after it we found the vesicular

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.009 
right after it we found the vesicular
tibula<00:01:02.579> cluster<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.359> find<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> golgi

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
tibula cluster then we find the golgi

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.140 
tibula cluster then we find the golgi
complex<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.769> very<00:01:05.040> common<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.939> is

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
complex this is very common this is

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.500 
complex this is very common this is
fixed<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:08.010> easily<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.580> seen<00:01:08.909> by

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
fixed this is can easily be seen by

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.200 
fixed this is can easily be seen by
electron<00:01:09.960> microscopy<00:01:10.650> okay<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.640> part<00:01:11.700> is

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
electron microscopy okay so this part is

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.469 
electron microscopy okay so this part is
known<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> question<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.920> how<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:15.030> golgi

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
known but the question is how this golgi

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.300 
known but the question is how this golgi
complex<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:16.020> formed<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.619> how<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.860> golgi

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
complex is formed and how the golgi

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
complex is formed and how the golgi
complex<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.909> come<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.479> existed<00:01:18.960> how<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
complex is come to be existed how the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.740 
complex is come to be existed how the
golgi<00:01:19.590> complex<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:20.040> destroyed<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.850> new

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
golgi complex is destroyed and new

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.590 
golgi complex is destroyed and new
complex<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.290> formed<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.100> two<00:01:23.880> models<00:01:24.390> are

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
complex is formed so two models are

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600 
complex is formed so two models are
there<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.320> explain<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> very<00:01:26.280> first

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
there to explain it in the very first

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
there to explain it in the very first
model<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.140> case<00:01:28.380> is

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
model what is going on in this case is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.859 
model what is going on in this case is
the<00:01:28.710> bulging<00:01:29.189> out<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.000> vesicle<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the bulging out of the vesicle from the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.770 
the bulging out of the vesicle from the
ER<00:01:31.140> lumen<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.590> done<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.970> cargo<00:01:33.240> proteins

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
ER lumen is done with the cargo proteins

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.469 
ER lumen is done with the cargo proteins
so<00:01:33.930> cargo<00:01:34.259> molecules<00:01:34.770> are<00:01:35.009> produced<00:01:35.790> inside

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
so cargo molecules are produced inside

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.319 
so cargo molecules are produced inside
the<00:01:36.659> lumen<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.829> bulged<00:01:38.189> out<00:01:38.340> inside<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the lumen it is bulged out inside the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.149 
the lumen it is bulged out inside the
vesicle<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> cargo<00:01:40.590> molecules<00:01:40.979> are

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
vesicle so the cargo molecules are

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.130 
vesicle so the cargo molecules are
inside<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> vesicle<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.270> vesicles<00:01:42.720> come<00:01:42.960> in

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
inside the vesicle the vesicles come in

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.810 
inside the vesicle the vesicles come in
and<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.439> fuse<00:01:43.680> together<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.130> make<00:01:44.460> that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and they fuse together to make that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.270 
and they fuse together to make that
vesicular<00:01:45.420> tabular<00:01:45.689> cluster<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
vesicular tabular cluster this is the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.819 
vesicular tabular cluster this is the
physical<00:01:47.640> activity<00:01:48.570> which<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:49.110> exactly<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
physical activity which is not exactly a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.039 
physical activity which is not exactly a
part<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.280> golgi<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.000> still<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.840> machine

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
part of golgi but still it's a machine

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.149 
part of golgi but still it's a machine
network<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:53.689> vesicles<00:01:54.689> now<00:01:55.530> from<00:01:55.950> this

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
network of vesicles now from this

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.719 
network of vesicles now from this

vesicle tubular cluster this this

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.530 
vesicle tubular cluster this this
cluster<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.390> come<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.840> fuse<00:02:01.610> with<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
cluster can come and fuse with the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.719 
cluster can come and fuse with the

knee region and after fusion in the
cistern<00:02:19.260> region<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.159> will<00:02:20.280> make<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.790> Golgi

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
cistern region it will make the Golgi

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.809 
cistern region it will make the Golgi
body<00:02:21.299> so<00:02:21.540> Golgi<00:02:22.379> body<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.860> may<00:02:23.159> made

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
body so Golgi body is may made

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.179 
body so Golgi body is may made
continuously<00:02:24.750> by<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.049> attachment<00:02:25.709> on<00:02:25.799> fusion

assistant which is called a sis system

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.369 
assistant which is called a sis system
now<00:02:52.859> how<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.819> sister<00:02:54.569> knee<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.989> actually

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
now how the sister knee is actually

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.819 
now how the sister knee is actually
transferred<00:02:55.950> its<00:02:56.549> its<00:02:57.230> components<00:02:58.230> into<00:02:58.709> the

transferred its its components into the
intermediate<00:02:59.310> system<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.150> finally<00:03:00.659> how<00:03:00.959> the

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
intermediate system and finally how the

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.629 
intermediate system and finally how the
intermediate<00:03:01.590> sister<00:03:01.889> knee<00:03:02.099> transfer<00:03:02.489> is

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
intermediate sister knee transfer is

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.789 
intermediate sister knee transfer is
component<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.329> trans<00:03:03.930> region<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.680> the

component to the trans region of the

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.129 
component to the trans region of the
Gaggia<00:03:05.099> network<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.420> via<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
Gaggia network so it is via the

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.559 
Gaggia network so it is via the
formation<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.799> vesicle<00:03:08.340> okay<00:03:08.939> so<00:03:09.000> vesicle<00:03:09.510> is

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
formation of vesicle okay so vesicle is

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.050 
formation of vesicle okay so vesicle is
formed<00:03:10.019> again<00:03:10.319> by<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> pinching<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.129> this<00:03:11.819> site

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
formed again by a pinching of this site

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.720 
formed again by a pinching of this site
and<00:03:12.389> after<00:03:13.099> physical<00:03:14.099> formation<00:03:14.609> the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
and after physical formation the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.710 
and after physical formation the
physical<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.180> carried<00:03:15.569> out<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:17.340> again<00:03:17.730> another

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
physical is carried out so again another

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.619 
physical is carried out so again another
physical<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.530> pinched<00:03:19.889> out<00:03:20.010> from<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.629> sister

physical is pinched out from this sister

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.750 
physical is pinched out from this sister
knee<00:03:21.810> region<00:03:22.169> and<00:03:22.319> it<00:03:22.620> will<00:03:22.769> go<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.190> fuse<00:03:23.519> with

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
knee region and it will go and fuse with

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.150 
knee region and it will go and fuse with
the<00:03:24.660> intermediate<00:03:24.959> sister<00:03:25.590> knee<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.889> that's

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
the intermediate sister knee and that's

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.309 
the intermediate sister knee and that's
how<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.940> intermediate<00:03:27.389> system<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.870> formed

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
how the intermediate system is formed

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.170 
how the intermediate system is formed
and<00:03:28.410> not<00:03:28.650> only<00:03:28.919> the<00:03:29.040> intermediate<00:03:29.609> cistern<00:03:29.970> is

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
and not only the intermediate cistern is

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.500 
and not only the intermediate cistern is
formed<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:30.750> way<00:03:31.169> but<00:03:31.739> also<00:03:32.510> physical

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
formed like this way but also physical

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
production of this vesicular tabular

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.849 
production of this vesicular tabular
cluster<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:08.970> via<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.930> same<00:04:10.169> method<00:04:10.620> by<00:04:10.799> the

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
cluster is via the same method by the

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.770 
cluster is via the same method by the
pinching<00:04:11.370> out<00:04:11.519> of<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:12.090> physical<00:04:12.510> from

pinching out of the physical from
endoplasmic<00:04:13.169> reticulum<00:04:13.919> then<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.190> fusion<00:04:14.519> of

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
endoplasmic reticulum then the fusion of

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.009 
endoplasmic reticulum then the fusion of
those<00:04:14.790> vesicles<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.359> make<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.690> vesicular

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
those vesicles to make the vesicular

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.379 
those vesicles to make the vesicular
tubular<00:04:16.500> cluster<00:04:16.979> but<00:04:17.789> and<00:04:18.000> then<00:04:18.239> the

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
tubular cluster but and then the

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.909 
tubular cluster but and then the
vesicular<00:04:18.690> tubular<00:04:19.109> cluster<00:04:19.470> come<00:04:19.680> together

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
vesicular tubular cluster come together

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.279 
vesicular tubular cluster come together
nearer<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.970> this<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.299> golgi<00:04:21.599> network<00:04:21.959> in<00:04:22.049> DNA

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
nearer to this is golgi network in DNA

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.890 
nearer to this is golgi network in DNA

form this is golgi network there okay

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.950 
form this is golgi network there okay
till

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
till

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.469 
till
they're<00:04:26.199> all<00:04:26.530> those<00:04:27.100> procedures<00:04:27.370> are<00:04:27.940> same

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
they're all those procedures are same

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.120 
they're all those procedures are same
between<00:04:29.380> these<00:04:29.560> two<00:04:31.470> visualization<00:04:32.470> but<00:04:32.740> and

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
between these two visualization but and

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.570 
between these two visualization but and
now<00:04:33.639> on<00:04:33.970> in<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.599> Golgi<00:04:35.020> maturation<00:04:35.770> the

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
now on in the Golgi maturation the

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.610 
now on in the Golgi maturation the
procedure<00:04:36.970> is<00:04:37.210> different<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:38.169> in<00:04:38.259> this<00:04:38.380> case

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
procedure is different so in this case

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.080 
procedure is different so in this case
what<00:04:38.770> we<00:04:38.919> are<00:04:38.979> looking<00:04:39.340> at<00:04:39.490> we<00:04:39.639> are<00:04:39.699> looking<00:04:39.940> at

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
what we are looking at we are looking at

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.610 
what we are looking at we are looking at
the<00:04:40.210> SIS<00:04:40.419> Golgi<00:04:40.810> Network<00:04:41.169> here<00:04:41.470> you're

looking at in medial gonji and you're
trans-golgi<00:04:44.259> network<00:04:44.789> so<00:04:45.789> what<00:04:46.000> happens<00:04:46.360> when

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
trans-golgi network so what happens when

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.140 
trans-golgi network so what happens when
the<00:04:47.380> these<00:04:47.949> vesicles<00:04:48.310> come<00:04:48.699> together<00:04:48.849> and

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
the these vesicles come together and

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.610 
the these vesicles come together and
fuse<00:04:49.300> with<00:04:49.389> each<00:04:49.630> other<00:04:49.810> they'll<00:04:50.110> form

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
fuse with each other they'll form

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.430 
fuse with each other they'll form

the<00:05:19.960> seas<00:05:20.169> Golgi<00:05:20.500> Network<00:05:20.830> move<00:05:21.250> towards<00:05:21.699> the

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
the seas Golgi Network move towards the

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.089 
the seas Golgi Network move towards the
medial<00:05:22.090> golgi<00:05:22.599> network<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.139> what<00:05:23.320> what<00:05:23.889> was

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
medial golgi network and what what was

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.430 
medial golgi network and what what was
present<00:05:24.490> in<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.610> medial<00:05:25.120> golgi<00:05:25.419> Network<00:05:25.780> will

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
present in the medial golgi Network will

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.920 
present in the medial golgi Network will
go<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:27.099> the<00:05:27.220> trans-golgi<00:05:27.610> network<00:05:27.729> so<00:05:28.330> it<00:05:28.449> is<00:05:28.840> a

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
go to the trans-golgi network so it is a

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.040 
go to the trans-golgi network so it is a
movement<00:05:29.620> it's<00:05:30.130> always<00:05:30.699> moving<00:05:30.970> process<00:05:31.419> so

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
movement it's always moving process so

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.469 
movement it's always moving process so
sis<00:05:32.530> what<00:05:32.979> was<00:05:33.220> sis<00:05:33.580> become<00:05:34.139> medial<00:05:35.139> what<00:05:35.650> was

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
sis what was sis become medial what was

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.330 
sis what was sis become medial what was
the<00:05:37.479> vesicle<00:05:37.870> tubular<00:05:38.229> cluster<00:05:38.680> becomes<00:05:39.039> sis

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
the vesicle tubular cluster becomes sis

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.820 
the vesicle tubular cluster becomes sis
so<00:05:39.699> that's<00:05:39.880> how<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.599> process<00:05:40.810> will<00:05:41.050> go<00:05:41.289> on<00:05:41.530> so

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
so that's how the process will go on so

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.100 
so that's how the process will go on so
physical<00:05:42.340> vesicles<00:05:43.210> coming<00:05:43.539> and<00:05:43.690> they<00:05:43.810> fuse

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
physical vesicles coming and they fuse

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.649 
physical vesicles coming and they fuse
together<00:05:44.289> the<00:05:44.590> fuse<00:05:44.979> together<00:05:45.159> to<00:05:45.460> make<00:05:45.659> Golgi

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
together the fuse together to make Golgi

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.570 
together the fuse together to make Golgi
networks<00:05:47.080> or<00:05:47.349> masters<00:05:47.740> of<00:05:47.860> gorgeou<00:05:48.250> network

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
networks or masters of gorgeou network

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.430 
networks or masters of gorgeou network
whenever<00:05:48.909> they<00:05:49.150> form<00:05:49.360> of<00:05:49.479> the<00:05:49.570> G<00:05:49.750> network<00:05:49.870> then

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
whenever they form of the G network then

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.930 
whenever they form of the G network then
finally<00:05:50.770> it<00:05:50.830> will<00:05:50.889> going<00:05:51.430> towards<00:05:51.849> the

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
finally it will going towards the

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.089 
finally it will going towards the
maturation<00:05:52.419> phase<00:05:52.449> when<00:05:52.840> it's<00:05:52.960> matured<00:05:53.560> it

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
maturation phase when it's matured it

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.730 
maturation phase when it's matured it

so<00:05:58.780> it's<00:05:58.930> a<00:05:59.080> movement<00:05:59.400> from<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.580> sis<00:06:00.789> Golgi

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
so it's a movement from the sis Golgi

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.550 
so it's a movement from the sis Golgi
scheme<00:06:01.570> towards<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:01.990> trans-golgi<00:06:02.440> network

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
scheme towards the trans-golgi network

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.939 
scheme towards the trans-golgi network
and<00:06:03.490> finally<00:06:03.909> it<00:06:04.509> is<00:06:04.659> going<00:06:04.750> to<00:06:04.930> make<00:06:05.139> the

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
and finally it is going to make the

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.040 
and finally it is going to make the
vesicles<00:06:06.550> by<00:06:06.789> the<00:06:06.849> pinching<00:06:07.360> out<00:06:07.509> event<00:06:07.900> and

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
vesicles by the pinching out event and

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.570 
vesicles by the pinching out event and
those<00:06:08.139> vesicles<00:06:08.620> will<00:06:08.889> go<00:06:09.070> and<00:06:09.280> fuse<00:06:09.550> with

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
those vesicles will go and fuse with

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.420 
those vesicles will go and fuse with
their<00:06:09.880> cell<00:06:10.270> membrane<00:06:10.690> and<00:06:10.840> and<00:06:11.620> and<00:06:11.979> all

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
their cell membrane and and and all

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.700 
their cell membrane and and and all
those<00:06:12.639> ingredients<00:06:13.110> which<00:06:14.110> is<00:06:14.259> present

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
those ingredients which is present

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.529 
those ingredients which is present
inside<00:06:14.860> this<00:06:15.219> golgi<00:06:15.580> network<00:06:15.969> of<00:06:16.090> in<00:06:16.210> gaja

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
inside this golgi network of in gaja

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.659 
inside this golgi network of in gaja
vesicles<00:06:17.020> will<00:06:17.409> release<00:06:17.830> will<00:06:18.190> be<00:06:18.219> released

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
vesicles will release will be released

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.610 
vesicles will release will be released
outside<00:06:18.940> the<00:06:19.300> cell<00:06:19.509> that's<00:06:20.020> how<00:06:20.229> the<00:06:20.289> overall

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
outside the cell that's how the overall

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.159 
outside the cell that's how the overall
system<00:06:21.099> is<00:06:21.130> working<00:06:21.639> okay<00:06:22.539> so<00:06:22.599> this<00:06:22.810> in<00:06:23.050> this

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
system is working okay so this in this

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.439 
system is working okay so this in this
model<00:06:23.650> only<00:06:23.889> the<00:06:24.340> sister<00:06:24.699> neural<00:06:24.880> maturation

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
model only the sister neural maturation

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.140 
model only the sister neural maturation
is<00:06:25.570> going<00:06:26.110> on<00:06:26.380> so<00:06:26.919> cisterna<00:06:27.370> comes<00:06:27.729> in<00:06:27.940> and

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
is going on so cisterna comes in and

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.300 
is going on so cisterna comes in and
they<00:06:28.389> will<00:06:28.539> mature<00:06:28.780> to<00:06:29.289> form<00:06:29.530> so<00:06:29.740> one<00:06:29.949> sister

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
they will mature to form so one sister

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.589 
they will mature to form so one sister
knee<00:06:30.460> was<00:06:30.580> there<00:06:30.789> which<00:06:30.940> will<00:06:31.060> mature<00:06:31.210> to<00:06:31.360> make

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
knee was there which will mature to make

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.749 
knee was there which will mature to make
a<00:06:31.630> system<00:06:32.169> is<00:06:32.289> in<00:06:32.409> sister<00:06:32.889> and<00:06:32.979> immature<00:06:33.340> tore

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
a system is in sister and immature tore

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.089 
a system is in sister and immature tore
to<00:06:34.089> make<00:06:34.270> medial<00:06:35.080> sister<00:06:35.469> knee<00:06:35.529> the<00:06:35.740> medial

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:36.099 
to make medial sister knee the medial

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:38.010 
to make medial sister knee the medial
sisterly<00:06:36.550> matures<00:06:36.909> to<00:06:37.089> make<00:06:37.240> the<00:06:37.389> transistor

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
sisterly matures to make the transistor

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.810 
sisterly matures to make the transistor
and<00:06:38.289> then<00:06:38.830> finally<00:06:39.339> the<00:06:39.430> transfer

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
and then finally the transfer

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.910 
and then finally the transfer
pinched<00:06:40.420> out<00:06:40.630> buzzed<00:06:41.050> out<00:06:41.290> and<00:06:41.590> they<00:06:41.710> finally

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
pinched out buzzed out and they finally

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.530 
pinched out buzzed out and they finally
it<00:06:42.820> will<00:06:43.740> make<00:06:44.740> these<00:06:45.010> vesicles<00:06:45.370> and<00:06:45.730> leave

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
it will make these vesicles and leave

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.210 
it will make these vesicles and leave
them<00:06:46.810> for<00:06:47.530> the<00:06:48.130> destination<00:06:49.030> point
