00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
now into the o7z x6 aw

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.429 
now into the o7z x6 aw
we<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.880> compression<00:00:18.330> preload<00:00:19.019> and<00:00:19.140> rebound

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
we have compression preload and rebound

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.620 
we have compression preload and rebound
in<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.650> front<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.849> the<00:00:20.910> shock<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.480> have

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
in the front and in the shock we have

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.450 
in the front and in the shock we have
high<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:21.960> low<00:00:22.140> speed<00:00:22.380> compression<00:00:22.949> preload

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
high and low speed compression preload

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.820 
high and low speed compression preload
and<00:00:23.640> rebound<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:25.410> got<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> lot<00:00:25.800> of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and rebound so got a lot of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.490 
and rebound so got a lot of
adjustability<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.789> bike<00:00:26.939> was<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.869> cycle

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
adjustability and the bike was a cycle

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.249 
adjustability and the bike was a cycle
walk<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.429> ride<00:00:29.759> out<00:00:29.970> with<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> Kawasaki

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
walk in and ride out with the Kawasaki

Plaza<00:00:34.530> cycle<00:00:35.100> walk<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.700> right<00:00:36.360> out

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
Plaza cycle walk in right out

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.840 
Plaza cycle walk in right out
let's<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:37.920> Dave<00:00:38.129> over<00:00:38.600> check<00:00:39.600> free<00:00:39.899> sag

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:58.950 

okay<00:00:46.420> let<00:00:46.570> it<00:00:46.600> go<00:00:48.570> okay<00:00:49.570> all<00:00:50.170> right

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.510 

so<00:00:59.960> just<00:01:00.200> over<00:01:00.470> an<00:01:00.560> inch<00:01:00.680> for<00:01:00.920> Dave<00:01:01.130> which<00:01:01.340> is

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
so just over an inch for Dave which is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.270 
so just over an inch for Dave which is
way<00:01:01.730> too<00:01:02.390> stiff<00:01:02.660> so<00:01:03.470> if<00:01:03.620> you<00:01:03.800> are<00:01:03.860> anywhere

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
way too stiff so if you are anywhere

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.300 
way too stiff so if you are anywhere
from<00:01:04.870> Haley's<00:01:05.870> weight<00:01:06.080> its<00:01:06.380> unraidable<00:01:07.040> if

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
from Haley's weight its unraidable if

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.460 
from Haley's weight its unraidable if
your<00:01:07.730> Dave's<00:01:07.970> weight<00:01:08.210> at<00:01:08.330> 180<00:01:08.690> it's<00:01:09.110> way<00:01:09.410> too

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
your Dave's weight at 180 it's way too

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.110 
your Dave's weight at 180 it's way too
stiff<00:01:09.920> it's<00:01:10.280> probably<00:01:10.610> gonna<00:01:10.760> work<00:01:10.910> much

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
stiff it's probably gonna work much

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:20.410 
stiff it's probably gonna work much
better<00:01:11.150> for<00:01:11.450> Chris<00:01:11.810> at<00:01:11.990> 2:30<00:01:17.979> and<00:01:19.090> as<00:01:20.090> is

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
better for Chris at 2:30 and as is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.360 
better for Chris at 2:30 and as is
typical<00:01:20.450> with<00:01:21.050> Kawasaki<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.890> Front's<00:01:22.190> way

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
typical with Kawasaki is the Front's way

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.300 
typical with Kawasaki is the Front's way
too<00:01:22.430> soft<00:01:22.910> so<00:01:23.330> for<00:01:24.200> Dave's<00:01:24.440> weight<00:01:24.740> given<00:01:25.100> the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
too soft so for Dave's weight given the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.150 
too soft so for Dave's weight given the
preload<00:01:25.729> as<00:01:26.090> we<00:01:26.930> don't<00:01:27.110> have<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.590> lines<00:01:27.860> on

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
preload as we don't have the lines on

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.640 
preload as we don't have the lines on
previous<00:01:28.550> models<00:01:28.700> we<00:01:29.030> just<00:01:29.240> have<00:01:29.390> turns<00:01:29.720> it'll

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
previous models we just have turns it'll

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.130 
previous models we just have turns it'll
probably<00:01:30.950> work<00:01:31.310> out<00:01:31.670> okay<00:01:31.970> in<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.180> front<00:01:32.450> so

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
probably work out okay in the front so

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.130 
probably work out okay in the front so
if<00:01:33.320> you're<00:01:34.090> 130<00:01:35.090> pounds<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.690> forks<00:01:35.990> are

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
if you're 130 pounds the forks are

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.560 
if you're 130 pounds the forks are
perfect<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.100> again<00:01:37.670> we<00:01:37.790> got<00:01:37.940> this<00:01:38.090> mismatch<00:01:38.360> of

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
perfect so again we got this mismatch of

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.350 
perfect so again we got this mismatch of
a<00:01:38.840> stiff<00:01:39.110> shock<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.680> soft<00:01:39.979> front<00:01:40.360> causing

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
a stiff shock and a soft front causing

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.760 
a stiff shock and a soft front causing
all<00:01:41.479> kinds<00:01:41.509> of<00:01:41.869> problems<00:01:42.080> for<00:01:42.380> different

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
all kinds of problems for different

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.389 
all kinds of problems for different
weight<00:01:42.890> categories<00:01:43.810> now<00:01:44.810> on<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.080> Chris<00:01:45.399> let's

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
weight categories now on to Chris let's

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.830 
weight categories now on to Chris let's
see<00:01:46.550> what<00:01:46.729> we<00:01:46.820> got<00:01:46.970> with<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.180> back<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.630> should

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
see what we got with the back it should

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.480 
see what we got with the back it should
be<00:01:48.020> almost<00:01:48.619> perfect<00:01:49.340> in<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.550> back

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.810 

yeah<00:01:55.490> dead<00:01:56.180> on<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.479> money<00:01:56.509> so<00:01:57.110> if<00:01:57.259> you're<00:01:57.439> to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
yeah dead on the money so if you're to

yeah dead on the money so if you're to
22-250<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.149> shock<00:01:59.390> it's<00:01:59.600> perfect

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
22-250 the shock it's perfect

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.260 
22-250 the shock it's perfect
but<00:02:00.770> unfortunately<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.340> front<00:02:01.579> as<00:02:01.759> we<00:02:02.000> saw<00:02:02.149> we

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
but unfortunately the front as we saw we

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.520 
but unfortunately the front as we saw we
Dave<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.600> going<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.810> be<00:02:02.930> catastrophically

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
Dave is going to be catastrophically

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:13.270 
Dave is going to be catastrophically

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
soft yep almost half the travels gone in

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.180 
soft yep almost half the travels gone in
the<00:02:13.370> front<00:02:13.640> so<00:02:14.530> same<00:02:15.530> problem<00:02:15.950> again

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
the front so same problem again

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.680 
the front so same problem again
