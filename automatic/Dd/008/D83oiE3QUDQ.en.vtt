heavy metal video guitar lesson first
two<00:00:16.170> lessons<00:00:16.440> were<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.830> little<00:00:17.160> bit<00:00:17.340> more

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
two lessons were a little bit more

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.519 
two lessons were a little bit more
geared<00:00:17.820> towards<00:00:18.150> beginners<00:00:18.690> today<00:00:19.320> we're

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
geared towards beginners today we're

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.929 
geared towards beginners today we're
going<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.710> go<00:00:19.830> over<00:00:19.859> something<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.520> little<00:00:20.730> bit

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
going to go over something a little bit

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.300 
going to go over something a little bit
more<00:00:21.289> advanced<00:00:22.289> we're<00:00:22.920> going<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.070> do<00:00:23.160> some

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
more advanced we're going to do some

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.759 
more advanced we're going to do some
lead<00:00:23.519> techniques<00:00:24.000> today<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:25.109> my<00:00:25.230> first<00:00:25.439> lead

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
lead techniques today so my first lead

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.050 
lead techniques today so my first lead
ones<00:00:26.160> i'm<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.550> show<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.670> we're<00:00:26.939> going

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
ones i'm going to show you we're going

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.299 
ones i'm going to show you we're going
to<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.240> some<00:00:27.920> sequences<00:00:29.060> what<00:00:30.060> are<00:00:30.179> sequences

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
to do some sequences what are sequences

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.860 
to do some sequences what are sequences
basically<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.610> repeating<00:00:33.300> patterns<00:00:33.719> or

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
basically just repeating patterns or

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.920 
basically just repeating patterns or
repeat<00:00:34.340> ascending<00:00:35.340> or<00:00:35.489> descending<00:00:35.520> over<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
repeat ascending or descending over a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.570 
repeat ascending or descending over a
over<00:00:37.610> a<00:00:38.610> scale

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.220 

okay<00:00:44.580> so<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.940> start<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.390> let's<00:00:45.720> take<00:00:45.900> an<00:00:46.050> E

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
okay so to start with let's take an E

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.930 
okay so to start with let's take an E
minor<00:00:46.380> scale<00:00:48.560> and<00:00:49.560> let's<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.220> an<00:00:50.430> ascending

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
minor scale and let's do an ascending

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.530 
minor scale and let's do an ascending
sequence<00:00:51.900> of<00:00:52.320> threes<00:00:53.360> there's<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> little

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
sequence of threes there's a little

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:06.860 
sequence of threes there's a little
something<00:00:54.720> like<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:59.000> slowly<00:01:05.870> then

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
something like this and slowly then

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.770 
something like this and slowly then
we'll<00:01:07.110> do<00:01:07.230> the<00:01:07.380> same<00:01:07.620> thing<00:01:08.090> descending

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:23.109 

slowly

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.370 

let's<00:01:24.119> try<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.329> sequence<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.079> threes

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
let's try a sequence of threes

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.450 
let's try a sequence of threes
descending<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.820> up<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.210> scale<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:32.280> then

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
descending going up the scale and then

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.400 
descending going up the scale and then
going<00:01:32.700> down

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:46.300 

let's<00:01:40.410> try<00:01:40.530> sequence<00:01:41.010> of<00:01:41.160> fours<00:01:41.460> ascending

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.920 

descending

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:09.090 

hey<00:01:52.930> so<00:01:53.520> sending<00:01:54.520> slowly<00:02:02.579> descending

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.240 

I

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.750 

you

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.979 

okay<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:19.819> if<00:02:20.000> you're<00:02:20.120> doing<00:02:20.300> more<00:02:20.480> than<00:02:20.540> four

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
okay so if you're doing more than four

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.009 
okay so if you're doing more than four
is<00:02:21.170> in<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.349> sequence<00:02:21.800> instead<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.700> them<00:02:23.030> going

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
is in a sequence instead of them going

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.610 
is in a sequence instead of them going
across<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.739> neck<00:02:24.950> like<00:02:25.370> this<00:02:29.260> I'd<00:02:30.260> recommend

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
across the neck like this I'd recommend

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.960 
across the neck like this I'd recommend
going<00:02:31.010> down<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.879> neck<00:02:32.440> like<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.160> I'll

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
going down the neck like this so I'll

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.490 
going down the neck like this so I'll
show<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.239> what<00:02:35.330> I<00:02:35.390> mean<00:02:35.450> with<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.780> sequence<00:02:36.380> of

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
show you what I mean with a sequence of

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:59.110 
show you what I mean with a sequence of
six<00:02:40.239> slowly

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.280 

the<00:03:00.120> next<00:03:00.390> sequence<00:03:00.689> is<00:03:00.840> I'm<00:03:00.989> going<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.140> show

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
the next sequence is I'm going to show

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.759 
the next sequence is I'm going to show
you<00:03:01.640> is<00:03:02.640> going<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:02.909> be<00:03:03.000> done<00:03:03.180> over<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.769> harmonic

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
you is going to be done over a harmonic

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.589 
you is going to be done over a harmonic
minor<00:03:04.920> instead<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.400> an<00:03:05.489> irregular<00:03:06.180> monitor

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
minor instead of an irregular monitor

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.940 
minor instead of an irregular monitor
let<00:03:07.019> me<00:03:07.079> show<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.439> difference<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.920> only

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
let me show you the difference the only

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.800 
let me show you the difference the only
difference<00:03:08.099> is<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.549> one-note<00:03:09.150> difference<00:03:09.629> and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
difference is a one-note difference and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.440 
difference is a one-note difference and
that's<00:03:09.930> on<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.170> seven<00:03:11.390> regular<00:03:12.390> minor

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
that's on the seven regular minor

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.600 
that's on the seven regular minor
harmonic<00:03:15.450> minor<00:03:18.500> these<00:03:19.500> are<00:03:19.680> alternating

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
harmonic minor these are alternating

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.059 
harmonic minor these are alternating
sequences<00:03:21.209> in<00:03:22.110> ascending<00:03:22.500> alternating

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
sequences in ascending alternating

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:31.320 
sequences in ascending alternating
sequence

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.160 

in<00:03:32.330> d<00:03:32.569> city

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:46.720 

let's<00:03:37.170> do<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.440> slowly<00:03:39.440> ascending

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:55.740 

descending

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.800 

you

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.420 

like<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:03.930> said<00:04:03.989> sequences<00:04:04.739> aren't<00:04:05.010> all<00:04:05.160> just

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
like I said sequences aren't all just

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.580 
like I said sequences aren't all just
number<00:04:05.760> sequences<00:04:06.629> can<00:04:06.810> be<00:04:06.870> done<00:04:07.080> over<00:04:07.349> any

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
number sequences can be done over any

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.680 
number sequences can be done over any
scale<00:04:08.010> at<00:04:08.340> any<00:04:08.610> pattern<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.180> can<00:04:09.209> think<00:04:09.510> of

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
scale at any pattern you can think of

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.720 
scale at any pattern you can think of
let<00:04:10.560> me<00:04:10.620> show<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:10.830> a<00:04:10.950> few<00:04:11.099> for<00:04:11.370> some<00:04:11.519> of<00:04:11.640> you

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
let me show you a few for some of you

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.600 
let me show you a few for some of you
pentatonic<00:04:12.420> freaks<00:04:12.690> out<00:04:12.900> there<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:14.430> some

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
pentatonic freaks out there you some

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:22.400 
pentatonic freaks out there you some
pentatonic<00:04:15.530> sequences

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:33.270 

slowly

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.730 

swimming

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.550 

so<00:04:40.490> two<00:04:41.270> very<00:04:41.479> different<00:04:41.870> sequences<00:04:42.349> done

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
so two very different sequences done

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.150 
so two very different sequences done
over<00:04:42.740> a<00:04:42.770> very<00:04:43.009> different<00:04:43.490> scale

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.340 

turning<00:04:49.160> back<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.580> E<00:04:49.610> minor<00:04:50.110> scale<00:04:51.110> i'll

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
turning back to the E minor scale i'll

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.750 
turning back to the E minor scale i'll
show<00:04:51.530> you<00:04:51.590> some<00:04:51.800> other<00:04:51.830> examples<00:04:52.040> of

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
show you some other examples of

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.340 
show you some other examples of
sequences<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:53.420> can<00:04:53.450> come<00:04:53.630> up<00:04:53.750> with<00:04:53.960> whose<00:04:54.170> one

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
sequences you can come up with whose one

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:03.730 
sequences you can come up with whose one
i<00:04:54.380> like<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.800> use<00:04:54.830> a<00:04:54.920> lot

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:14.510 

slowly

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.409 

finally<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.639> one<00:05:15.789> I'd<00:05:15.879> like<00:05:16.059> to<00:05:16.179> show<00:05:16.360> you

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
finally the one I'd like to show you

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.749 
finally the one I'd like to show you
it's<00:05:17.409> really<00:05:17.529> isn't<00:05:17.889> done<00:05:18.099> over<00:05:18.459> any

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
it's really isn't done over any

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.879 
it's really isn't done over any
particular<00:05:19.300> scale<00:05:19.809> but<00:05:20.139> it<00:05:20.229> just<00:05:20.379> sounds<00:05:20.529> cool

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
particular scale but it just sounds cool

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.549 
particular scale but it just sounds cool
i'm<00:05:21.189> going<00:05:21.309> to<00:05:21.369> show<00:05:21.520> you<00:05:21.550> this<00:05:21.759> one<00:05:22.349> just<00:05:23.349> kind

00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:23.559 
i'm going to show you this one just kind

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:39.630 
i'm going to show you this one just kind
of<00:05:23.589> a<00:05:23.709> repeating<00:05:24.189> patterns

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:06:16.600 

I'll<00:05:40.640> see<00:05:40.820> that<00:05:40.970> one<00:05:41.060> a<00:05:41.090> little<00:05:41.180> bit<00:05:41.390> slower

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.650 

so<00:06:17.610> now<00:06:17.730> I've<00:06:17.910> shown<00:06:18.090> you<00:06:18.120> somebody<00:06:18.540> your

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
so now I've shown you somebody your

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.050 
so now I've shown you somebody your
basic<00:06:19.170> sequences<00:06:19.740> that<00:06:20.100> around<00:06:20.790> with<00:06:20.910> them

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
basic sequences that around with them

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.850 
basic sequences that around with them
see<00:06:21.270> how<00:06:21.360> you<00:06:21.389> can<00:06:21.510> incorporate<00:06:21.870> them<00:06:22.680> into

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
see how you can incorporate them into

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.890 
see how you can incorporate them into
some<00:06:23.070> of<00:06:23.160> your<00:06:23.250> old<00:06:23.340> leaf<00:06:23.550> patterns<00:06:23.940> see<00:06:24.750> what

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
some of your old leaf patterns see what

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.450 
some of your old leaf patterns see what
other<00:06:25.020> kind<00:06:25.350> of<00:06:25.440> sequences<00:06:26.010> you<00:06:26.130> can<00:06:26.160> come<00:06:26.340> up

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
other kind of sequences you can come up

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.180 
other kind of sequences you can come up
with<00:06:26.610> on<00:06:26.730> your<00:06:26.760> own<00:06:27.320> I'm<00:06:28.320> fire<00:06:28.650> dragon<00:06:29.070> this

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
with on your own I'm fire dragon this

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.240 
with on your own I'm fire dragon this
has<00:06:29.310> been<00:06:29.460> another<00:06:29.730> video<00:06:30.180> lesson
