the how to use the randomizer the

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.990 
the how to use the randomizer the
randomizer<00:00:07.049> was<00:00:07.440> pretty<00:00:07.950> much<00:00:08.069> made<00:00:08.370> from<00:00:08.730> a

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
randomizer was pretty much made from a

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.940 
randomizer was pretty much made from a
teacher<00:00:09.450> request<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.170> be<00:00:10.410> able<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.740> call<00:00:10.920> on

students in a random fashion but we took
it<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.580> step<00:00:14.610> further<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.440> we<00:00:16.440> can<00:00:16.859> do<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> little

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
bit more so we click on randomizer and

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.160 
bit more so we click on randomizer and
you<00:00:20.520> select<00:00:20.910> which<00:00:21.150> group<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.570> students<00:00:21.990> and

under settings the way this works is in
a<00:00:45.239> typical<00:00:45.719> classroom<00:00:45.960> setting<00:00:46.559> you'll<00:00:47.340> need

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
a typical classroom setting you'll need

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.090 
a typical classroom setting you'll need
to<00:00:47.730> perhaps<00:00:48.629> call<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.200> students<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.770> give<00:00:50.010> an

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
to perhaps call on students to give an

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.680 
to perhaps call on students to give an
answer<00:00:50.219> out<00:00:50.550> loud<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.210> click<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
answer out loud so you can click the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.630 
answer out loud so you can click the
random<00:00:52.020> button<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.559> then<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.980> puts<00:00:53.280> them<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
random button and then it puts them in a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.630 
random button and then it puts them in a
completely<00:00:54.090> random<00:00:54.570> order<00:00:55.430> sometimes<00:00:56.430> I'll

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
completely random order sometimes I'll

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.750 
completely random order sometimes I'll
say<00:00:56.879> okay<00:00:57.239> today<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.859> june<00:00:58.859> third<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.699> i'm

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
say okay today is june third so i'm

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.729 
say okay today is june third so i'm
going<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> click<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.210> random<00:01:00.600> three<00:01:00.899> times<00:01:01.109> one

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
going to click a random three times one

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.770 
going to click a random three times one
two<00:01:02.010> three<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.730> that'll<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.239> what<00:01:03.390> happens

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
two three and that'll be what happens

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.550 
two three and that'll be what happens
and<00:01:04.049> then<00:01:04.920> then<00:01:05.010> we'll<00:01:05.159> go<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.580> order

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
and then then we'll go in that order

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.859 
and then then we'll go in that order
once<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.740> decide<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.520> you've<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.270> list

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
once you decide that you've got the list

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
once you decide that you've got the list
that<00:01:09.990> you're<00:01:10.320> looking<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.580> tap<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that you're looking for you tap on the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
name if you want a green checkmark so

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.649 
name if you want a green checkmark so
this<00:01:14.430> will<00:01:14.580> keep<00:01:14.700> track<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.000> who's<00:01:15.390> actually

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
this will keep track of who's actually

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.450 
this will keep track of who's actually
participated<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:16.740> you're<00:01:16.920> doing<00:01:17.220> something

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
participated if you're doing something

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.929 
participated if you're doing something
that<00:01:18.119> requires<00:01:18.479> participation<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.700> as<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that requires participation and as the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.640 
that requires participation and as the
students<00:01:21.330> participate<00:01:21.930> they<00:01:22.170> get<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> green

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
students participate they get a green

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.490 
students participate they get a green
checkmark<00:01:22.950> once<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.640> tap<00:01:23.820> their<00:01:24.090> name<00:01:24.500> the

checkmark once you tap their name the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.350 
checkmark once you tap their name the
part<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.009> personally<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.790> about<00:01:27.119> this

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
part I personally like about this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.660 
part I personally like about this
randomizer<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.409> once<00:01:28.680> you're<00:01:28.860> done<00:01:29.369> for

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
randomizer is that once you're done for

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.190 
randomizer is that once you're done for
the<00:01:29.700> day<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.090> perhaps<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.570> didn't<00:01:30.810> complete

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the day and perhaps you didn't complete

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.249 
the day and perhaps you didn't complete
your<00:01:31.350> lesson<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.909> leave<00:01:33.299> do

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
your lesson is that you can leave do

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.330 
your lesson is that you can leave do
whatever<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.680> need<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.659> leave<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.869> app

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
whatever you need to do leave the app

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.850 
whatever you need to do leave the app
come<00:01:38.340> back<00:01:38.490> later<00:01:39.200> when<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.320> come<00:01:40.500> back<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
come back later when you come back to

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.800 
come back later when you come back to
the<00:01:40.979> app<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.369> come<00:01:41.549> back<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.909> randomizer<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the app and come back to randomizer and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.929 
the app and come back to randomizer and
you<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.200> first<00:01:43.439> period<00:01:43.710> again<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.340> remembers

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
you have first period again it remembers

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.569 
you have first period again it remembers
that<00:01:45.210> those<00:01:45.450> green<00:01:45.689> check<00:01:45.960> marks<00:01:46.259> are<00:01:46.409> there

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
that those green check marks are there

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.480 
that those green check marks are there
so<00:01:47.579> then<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.820> continue<00:01:48.030> where<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.479> left<00:01:48.570> off

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
so then you continue where you left off

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.160 
so then you continue where you left off
and<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.640> applies<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.000> all<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.479> classes<00:01:51.930> if

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and that applies to all the classes if

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.109 
and that applies to all the classes if
you<00:01:52.950> could<00:01:53.130> tap<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.549> student's<00:01:53.909> name<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
you could tap the student's name a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.899 
you could tap the student's name a
second<00:01:54.600> time<00:01:54.750> it'll<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.649> red<00:01:55.920> X<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.729> can

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
second time it'll be a red X and you can

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.219 
second time it'll be a red X and you can
use<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.299> whatever<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.899> feel<00:01:58.170> like

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
use that for whatever you feel like

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.010 
use that for whatever you feel like
doing<00:01:58.380> if<00:01:58.969> you<00:01:59.969> want<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.240> clear<00:02:00.479> all<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> marks

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
doing if you want to clear all the marks

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.230 
doing if you want to clear all the marks
away<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.590> either<00:02:01.740> tap<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.310> third<00:02:02.640> time<00:02:02.909> or

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
away you can either tap a third time or

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.709 
away you can either tap a third time or
use<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.960> clear<00:02:04.200> marks<00:02:04.530> button<00:02:05.479> that's<00:02:06.479> pretty

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
use the clear marks button that's pretty

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.960 
use the clear marks button that's pretty
much<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> randomizer<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.520> if<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.819> want

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
much the randomizer and then if you want

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.339 
much the randomizer and then if you want
to<00:02:09.030> go<00:02:09.119> back<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.509> way<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.989> was<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
to go back to the way it was the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.780 
to go back to the way it was the
beginning<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:11.220> tap<00:02:11.430> sort

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
beginning you tap sort

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.280 
beginning you tap sort
now<00:02:13.790> let's<00:02:13.970> go<00:02:14.150> talk<00:02:14.390> about<00:02:14.659> groups<00:02:14.959> at<00:02:15.200> the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
now let's go talk about groups at the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.070 
now let's go talk about groups at the
bottom<00:02:15.620> here<00:02:15.830> if<00:02:16.040> we<00:02:16.670> want<00:02:16.819> group<00:02:17.120> sizes<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.900> be

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
bottom here if we want group sizes to be

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.259 
bottom here if we want group sizes to be
groups<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:18.830> two<00:02:19.099> and<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.730> don't<00:02:19.909> want<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.150> have

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
groups of two and I don't want to have

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.750 
groups of two and I don't want to have
to<00:02:20.629> hassle<00:02:20.989> with<00:02:21.260> assigning<00:02:21.769> them<00:02:22.040> myself<00:02:22.280> or

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
to hassle with assigning them myself or

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.059 
to hassle with assigning them myself or
have<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.030> students<00:02:23.420> do<00:02:23.629> it<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:24.500> can<00:02:24.680> just<00:02:24.890> tap

have the students do it you can just tap

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.680 
have the students do it you can just tap
the<00:02:25.129> plus<00:02:25.459> sign<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:25.909> you<00:02:25.970> automatically<00:02:26.540> have

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
the plus sign and you automatically have

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.570 
the plus sign and you automatically have
groups<00:02:27.049> of<00:02:27.230> two<00:02:27.440> throughout<00:02:27.830> your<00:02:27.950> class<00:02:28.220> and

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
groups of two throughout your class and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.850 
groups of two throughout your class and
you<00:02:29.180> can<00:02:29.329> tap<00:02:29.540> random<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.170> randomize<00:02:30.590> those

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
you can tap random to randomize those

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.089 
you can tap random to randomize those
groups<00:02:31.250> as<00:02:31.489> much<00:02:32.000> as<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.269> want<00:02:32.620> same<00:02:33.620> goes<00:02:33.829> for

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
groups as much as you want same goes for

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.589 
groups as much as you want same goes for
any<00:02:34.250> number<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.610> groups<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:35.090> can<00:02:35.150> have<00:02:35.360> group

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
any number of groups you can have group

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.100 
any number of groups you can have group
sizes<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:36.170> any<00:02:36.349> size<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.680> want<00:02:37.870> alright<00:02:38.870> so

sizes of any size you want alright so

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.380 
sizes of any size you want alright so
now<00:02:39.260> we<00:02:39.319> have<00:02:39.470> groups<00:02:39.829> of<00:02:39.980> four<00:02:40.250> perhaps<00:02:41.060> doing

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
now we have groups of four perhaps doing

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.559 
now we have groups of four perhaps doing
a<00:02:41.480> class<00:02:41.690> project<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:42.349> group<00:02:42.590> project<00:02:42.860> when<00:02:43.849> you

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
a class project a group project when you

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.110 
a class project a group project when you
have<00:02:45.200> groups<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.799> are<00:02:45.920> participating<00:02:46.220> you

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
have groups that are participating you

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.300 
have groups that are participating you
can<00:02:47.269> give<00:02:47.450> them<00:02:47.569> check<00:02:47.870> marks<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.440> if<00:02:48.859> just

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
can give them check marks and if just

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.009 
can give them check marks and if just
like<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.700> other<00:02:50.150> functions<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.930> will

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
like the other functions it will

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.390 
like the other functions it will
remember<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:51.560> if<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:51.890> leave<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.220> app<00:02:52.370> and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
remember this if you leave the app and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.270 
remember this if you leave the app and
come<00:02:52.819> back<00:02:52.970> later<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:54.290> you<00:02:54.859> this<00:02:55.099> will

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
come back later so you this will

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.970 
come back later so you this will
remember<00:02:55.489> per<00:02:55.849> class<00:02:56.090> any<00:02:56.840> size<00:02:57.500> or<00:02:57.530> type<00:02:57.920> of

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
remember per class any size or type of

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.009 
remember per class any size or type of
group<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.519> you<00:02:58.640> want<00:02:58.849> so<00:02:59.599> let's<00:02:59.750> go<00:02:59.870> back

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
group that you want so let's go back

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.670 
group that you want so let's go back
down<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.290> one<00:03:01.659> let's<00:03:02.659> sort<00:03:02.959> everybody<00:03:03.290> back<00:03:03.500> in

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
down to one let's sort everybody back in

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.050 
down to one let's sort everybody back in
order<00:03:03.859> clear<00:03:04.250> marks<00:03:04.629> now<00:03:05.629> group<00:03:05.959> number<00:03:06.379> if

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
order clear marks now group number if

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.729 
order clear marks now group number if
you<00:03:08.060> just<00:03:08.540> want<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.780> divide<00:03:09.079> your<00:03:09.290> class<00:03:09.500> in

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
you just want to divide your class in

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.160 
you just want to divide your class in
half<00:03:09.920> really<00:03:10.700> quickly<00:03:11.120> all<00:03:11.329> you<00:03:11.690> do<00:03:11.840> is<00:03:11.870> go

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
half really quickly all you do is go

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.610 
half really quickly all you do is go
group<00:03:12.670> number<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.700> want<00:03:14.000> two<00:03:14.239> groups<00:03:14.629> so<00:03:15.470> it's

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
group number I want two groups so it's

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.770 
group number I want two groups so it's
going<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:15.799> split<00:03:16.010> your<00:03:16.190> class<00:03:16.430> in<00:03:16.639> half<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.720> you

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
going to split your class in half so you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.140 
going to split your class in half so you
have<00:03:17.930> half<00:03:18.380> one<00:03:18.829> half<00:03:18.859> in<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.310> other<00:03:19.489> of

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
have half one half in the other of

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.909 
have half one half in the other of
course<00:03:20.419> still<00:03:20.870> in<00:03:20.989> alphabetical<00:03:21.620> order<00:03:21.680> by

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
course still in alphabetical order by

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.129 
course still in alphabetical order by
first<00:03:22.280> name<00:03:22.519> so<00:03:22.880> we<00:03:23.090> can<00:03:23.239> randomize<00:03:23.630> it<00:03:23.900> as

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
first name so we can randomize it as

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.710 
first name so we can randomize it as
much<00:03:24.410> as<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:24.680> want<00:03:24.889> now<00:03:25.790> we've<00:03:25.970> got<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.389> as

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
much as you want now we've got to as

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.199 
much as you want now we've got to as
close<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.829> equal<00:03:28.190> groups<00:03:28.370> as<00:03:28.609> we<00:03:28.730> can<00:03:28.970> if

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
close to equal groups as we can if

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.259 
close to equal groups as we can if
there's<00:03:29.780> an<00:03:29.930> odd<00:03:30.109> number<00:03:30.139> it's<00:03:31.069> going<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.549> say

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
there's an odd number it's going to say

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.250 
there's an odd number it's going to say
if<00:03:32.389> there<00:03:32.510> were<00:03:32.599> 25<00:03:33.049> will<00:03:33.319> do<00:03:33.530> 12<00:03:33.859> and<00:03:34.069> 13<00:03:35.260> we

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
if there were 25 will do 12 and 13 we

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.960 
if there were 25 will do 12 and 13 we
also<00:03:36.500> do<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:36.859> same<00:03:37.099> for<00:03:37.280> three<00:03:37.519> groups<00:03:37.760> or

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
also do the same for three groups or

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.430 
also do the same for three groups or
four<00:03:38.239> groups<00:03:38.480> or<00:03:38.660> five<00:03:38.870> groups<00:03:39.200> that<00:03:39.379> will

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
four groups or five groups that will

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.020 
four groups or five groups that will
automatically<00:03:39.919> figure<00:03:40.310> out<00:03:40.430> how<00:03:40.639> many<00:03:40.700> need

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
automatically figure out how many need

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.699 
automatically figure out how many need
to<00:03:41.209> be<00:03:41.329> in<00:03:41.480> each<00:03:41.599> group<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.139> then<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:42.560> can

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
to be in each group and then you can

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.650 
to be in each group and then you can
randomize<00:03:43.220> those<00:03:43.519> students<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.209> of<00:03:44.629> course

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
randomize those students and of course

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.509 
randomize those students and of course
tap<00:03:45.260> their<00:03:45.440> names<00:03:45.620> as<00:03:45.829> they<00:03:46.010> participate

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.069 

alright<00:03:49.519> that<00:03:50.030> pretty<00:03:50.239> much<00:03:50.449> does<00:03:50.629> it<00:03:50.810> for<00:03:50.989> the

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
alright that pretty much does it for the

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.629 
alright that pretty much does it for the
randomizer<00:03:51.530> if<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:51.919> have<00:03:52.040> any<00:03:52.160> questions
