00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
and last but not least the apocalypse

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
out of the spider-man line this is mass

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.390

there<00:03:03.859> is<00:03:04.069> a<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.730> think<00:03:04.879> a<00:03:05.090> power<00:03:05.269> armor<00:03:05.569> doc

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230

there is a I think a power armor doc
with<00:03:06.760> orange<00:03:08.590> arms<00:03:09.639> and<00:03:10.639> in<00:03:10.939> this<00:03:11.120> one<00:03:11.359> his

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:11.689 
with orange arms and in this one his

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.890 
with orange arms and in this one his
arms<00:03:12.079> seem<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.769> be<00:03:12.919> metallic<00:03:13.669> which<00:03:13.849> is<00:03:14.090> the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
arms seem to be metallic which is the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.460 
arms seem to be metallic which is the
way<00:03:15.049> I<00:03:15.079> like<00:03:15.829> to<00:03:16.669> see<00:03:17.629> it<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:18.109> know<00:03:18.229> it's
