00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
this is just another example of what you

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.950 
this is just another example of what you
can<00:03:15.890> do<00:03:16.040> because<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.430> do<00:03:16.910> use<00:03:17.270> quite<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.660> bit<00:03:17.810> of

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
can do because you do use quite a bit of

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.230 
can do because you do use quite a bit of
bleach<00:03:18.350> well<00:03:18.860> not<00:03:19.220> really<00:03:19.460> but<00:03:19.760> if<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.120> have

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
bleach well not really but if you have

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.850 
bleach well not really but if you have
leftover<00:03:20.810> bleach<00:03:21.050> there's<00:03:21.320> no<00:03:21.500> point<00:03:21.740> in<00:03:21.830> just

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
leftover bleach there's no point in just

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.520 
leftover bleach there's no point in just
throwing<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.430> out<00:03:22.520> so<00:03:23.150> this<00:03:23.390> is<00:03:23.630> what<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.840> did<00:03:24.170> to

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
throwing it out so this is what I did to

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.610 
throwing it out so this is what I did to
a<00:03:24.700> denim<00:03:25.700> jacket<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.140> just<00:03:27.320> took<00:03:27.470> the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
a denim jacket and I just took the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.560 
a denim jacket and I just took the
sleeves<00:03:27.920> off<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.490> frayed<00:03:28.970> them<00:03:29.270> and<00:03:29.480> made

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
sleeves off and frayed them and made

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.200 
sleeves off and frayed them and made
this<00:03:29.750> into<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.140> vest<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.490> this<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:31.880> just<00:03:32.060> like

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
this into a vest so this is just like

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.140 
this into a vest so this is just like
another<00:03:32.330> idea<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:33.080> what<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.350> guys<00:03:33.380> can<00:03:33.860> do

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
another idea of what you guys can do

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.910 
another idea of what you guys can do
every<00:03:35.150> denim<00:03:35.600> will<00:03:35.900> kind<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.320> react<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.830> little

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
every denim will kind of react a little

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.530 
every denim will kind of react a little
bit<00:03:37.130> differently<00:03:37.580> this<00:03:37.820> is<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:38.090> thicker

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
bit differently this is a thicker

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.840 
bit differently this is a thicker
heavier<00:03:38.780> denim<00:03:39.620> on<00:03:39.800> this<00:03:40.040> vest<00:03:40.370> so<00:03:40.640> it

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
heavier denim on this vest so it

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.330 
heavier denim on this vest so it
bleached<00:03:41.240> quite<00:03:42.020> quickly<00:03:42.590> whereas<00:03:42.980> this

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
bleached quite quickly whereas this

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.510 
bleached quite quickly whereas this
shirt<00:03:43.730> took<00:03:43.970> about<00:03:44.209> 30<00:03:44.690> minutes<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:45.650> depending

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
shirt took about 30 minutes so depending

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.790 
shirt took about 30 minutes so depending
on<00:03:46.640> how<00:03:47.060> heavy<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.810> denim<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.380> it'll<00:03:48.680> either

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
on how heavy the denim is it'll either

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.610 
on how heavy the denim is it'll either
go<00:03:49.040> faster<00:03:49.640> or<00:03:49.670> slower<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:50.570> I<00:03:50.870> hope<00:03:51.350> you<00:03:51.470> guys

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620
