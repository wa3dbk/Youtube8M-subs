00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.969 
enough to you know destroy the whole
planet<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:50.290> I<00:01:50.350> don't<00:01:50.530> think<00:01:50.680> it's<00:01:50.799> powerful

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
planet but I don't think it's powerful

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.910 
planet but I don't think it's powerful
enough<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.490> actually<00:01:51.640> hurt<00:01:51.970> Goku<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.720> think<00:01:53.649> I

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
enough to actually hurt Goku I think I

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.969 
enough to actually hurt Goku I think I
think<00:01:54.700> it's<00:01:54.940> on<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:55.659> don't<00:01:56.649> think<00:01:56.830> it's

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
think it's on I don't think it's

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.529 
think it's on I don't think it's
powerful<00:01:57.159> enough<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.520> kill<00:01:57.820> him<00:01:58.119> that's<00:01:58.420> what

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
powerful enough to kill him that's what

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:59.670 
powerful enough to kill him that's what
I'm<00:01:58.630> really<00:01:58.840> trying<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.259> say

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
I'm really trying to say

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.370 
I'm really trying to say
so<00:02:00.280> when<00:02:00.460> Celebi<00:02:00.909> when<00:02:01.420> Sailor<00:02:01.720> Moon<00:02:01.960> uses

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
so when Celebi when Sailor Moon uses

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.109 
so when Celebi when Sailor Moon uses
that<00:02:02.560> little<00:02:02.799> power<00:02:02.979> against<00:02:03.399> Goku<00:02:03.640> I<00:02:03.970> don't

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
that little power against Goku I don't

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.609 
that little power against Goku I don't
think<00:02:04.299> he'll<00:02:04.420> be<00:02:04.479> enough<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:04.990> actually<00:02:05.170> kill

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
think he'll be enough to actually kill

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.219 
think he'll be enough to actually kill
Goku<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.340> think<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:06.939> would<00:02:07.090> actually<00:02:07.270> burn<00:02:07.720> Goku

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
Goku I think it would actually burn Goku

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.280 
Goku I think it would actually burn Goku
it<00:02:08.410> will<00:02:08.560> burn<00:02:08.800> him<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.819> Goku<00:02:10.239> would<00:02:10.630> be<00:02:10.780> kind

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
it will burn him and Goku would be kind

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.380 
it will burn him and Goku would be kind
of<00:02:11.440> shocked<00:02:11.769> and<00:02:12.069> saying<00:02:12.400> like<00:02:12.730> yeah<00:02:12.910> you're

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
of shocked and saying like yeah you're

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.750 
of shocked and saying like yeah you're
pretty<00:02:13.660> strong<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.470> don't<00:02:14.650> think<00:02:14.760> settlement

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
pretty strong I don't think settlement

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.949 
pretty strong I don't think settlement
attacks<00:02:16.230> will<00:02:17.230> actually<00:02:17.650> kill<00:02:17.890> Goku<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.959> the

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
attacks will actually kill Goku and the

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.199 
attacks will actually kill Goku and the
reason<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.350> say<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:21.010> because<00:02:21.040> if<00:02:21.880> you've

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
reason I say that is because if you've

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.759 
reason I say that is because if you've
watched<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.630> little<00:02:22.810> more<00:02:22.959> every<00:02:23.260> time<00:02:23.470> when

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
watched a little more every time when

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.740 
watched a little more every time when
Sailor<00:02:24.040> Moon<00:02:24.340> try<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.970> finish<00:02:25.390> off<00:02:25.569> her

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
she's been around the circles and you

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.640

called a thunder flash attack I think

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.180

and<00:03:06.030> at<00:03:07.030> first<00:03:07.270> PyCon<00:03:07.930> did<00:03:08.170> got<00:03:08.410> Goku<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.860> couple

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.730 
and at first PyCon did got Goku a couple
of<00:03:09.250> times<00:03:09.459> but<00:03:09.760> then<00:03:09.940> Goku<00:03:10.330> found<00:03:11.319> out<00:03:11.530> his

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
of times but then Goku found out his

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.540 
of times but then Goku found out his
weakness

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
weakness

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.730 
weakness
Goku<00:03:13.030> used<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.540> instant<00:03:13.900> transmission<00:03:14.500> and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
Goku used the instant transmission and

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.000 
Goku used the instant transmission and
got<00:03:14.860> behind<00:03:15.069> him<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:15.670> attacked<00:03:16.569> them<00:03:17.010> and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
got behind him and attacked them and

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.730 
got behind him and attacked them and
that's<00:03:18.220> what<00:03:18.400> Goku<00:03:18.880> would<00:03:19.810> probably<00:03:20.290> do<00:03:20.470> to

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
that's what Goku would probably do to

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.430 
that's what Goku would probably do to
send<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:21.070> move<00:03:21.270> what<00:03:22.270> whether<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:22.990> weapon

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
send a move what whether that weapon

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.199 
send a move what whether that weapon
sailormoon<00:03:23.890> uses<00:03:24.370> it's<00:03:24.610> powerful<00:03:24.940> enough<00:03:25.090> to

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209

settlement used is strong enough to kill

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.970 
settlement used is strong enough to kill
him<00:04:35.880> then<00:04:36.690> yes<00:04:37.110> he's<00:04:37.350> probably<00:04:37.530> gonna<00:04:37.800> use

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.640 
but I don't think Goku actually stand
there<00:04:45.240> if<00:04:45.360> Goku<00:04:45.690> know<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:46.110> weapon<00:04:46.530> that
