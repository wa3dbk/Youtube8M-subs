her forehead
I<00:03:29.549> don't<00:03:30.000> want<00:03:30.209> Lydia<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.660> be<00:03:30.780> overly

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
I don't want Lydia to be overly

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.559 
I don't want Lydia to be overly
highlighted<00:03:31.830> in<00:03:31.950> contoured<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:33.180> is<00:03:33.360> just

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
highlighted in contoured so this is just

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.910 
highlighted in contoured so this is just
to<00:03:33.660> give<00:03:33.810> her<00:03:33.900> some<00:03:34.140> extra<00:03:34.530> light<00:03:34.680> without

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
to give her some extra light without

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:45.140 
to give her some extra light without
going<00:03:35.430> too<00:03:35.790> far<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:44.040> here's<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.880> part<00:03:45.060> that

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
going too far so here's the part that

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.729 
going too far so here's the part that
everyone<00:03:45.480> says<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.140> most<00:03:46.349> complicated

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
everyone says is the most complicated

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.670 
everyone says is the most complicated
the<00:03:47.400> contour<00:03:48.090> it's<00:03:48.780> probably<00:03:49.319> not<00:03:49.470> as

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
the contour it's probably not as

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.710 
the contour it's probably not as
complicated<00:03:50.069> as<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.519> think<00:03:50.849> it<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.000> but<00:03:51.480> if

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
complicated as you think it is but if

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.970 
complicated as you think it is but if
you're<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.900> beginner<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.530> you're<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:52.860> now

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
you're a beginner and you're just now

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.850 
you're a beginner and you're just now
learning<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.640> suggest<00:03:54.599> that<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.989> use<00:03:55.019> a<00:03:55.319> color

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
learning I suggest that you use a color

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.800 
learning I suggest that you use a color
that's<00:03:56.129> maybe<00:03:56.489> one<00:03:56.879> or<00:03:57.120> two<00:03:57.150> shades<00:03:57.599> darker

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
that's maybe one or two shades darker

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.199 
that's maybe one or two shades darker
than<00:03:58.230> your<00:03:58.349> skin<00:03:58.379> tone<00:03:58.799> instead<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.670> going<00:03:59.970> for

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
than your skin tone instead of going for

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.309 
than your skin tone instead of going for
something<00:04:00.510> that's<00:04:00.690> extremely<00:04:01.110> dark<00:04:02.120> as<00:04:03.319> you

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
something that's extremely dark as you

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.770 
something that's extremely dark as you
can<00:04:04.500> see<00:04:04.769> I've<00:04:05.010> brand<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.670> dark<00:04:05.970> color<00:04:06.180> under

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
can see I've brand that dark color under

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.710 
can see I've brand that dark color under
her<00:04:06.930> cheekbones<00:04:07.470> under<00:04:08.040> her<00:04:08.220> chin<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.819> around
