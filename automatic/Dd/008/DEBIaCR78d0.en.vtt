interesting<00:00:59.129> young<00:00:59.579> I<00:01:00.149> think<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.050> position

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
interesting young I think this position

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.770 
interesting young I think this position
is<00:01:01.500> not<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.800> clear<00:01:02.270> but<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.420> could<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.660> just

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
is not so clear but it could be just

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.200 
is not so clear but it could be just
very<00:01:04.019> bad<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:05.489> where<00:01:05.729> did<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.939> go<00:01:06.180> wrong

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
very bad so where did it go wrong

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.910 
very bad so where did it go wrong
because<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.990> between<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.590> look<00:01:07.890> very

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
because in between it look very

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.620 
because in between it look very
dangerous<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.119> thought<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.330> sure<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
dangerous if I thought for sure a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.109 
dangerous if I thought for sure a
mistake<00:01:09.990> i<00:01:10.110> think<00:01:10.320> uh<00:01:10.500> huh<00:01:11.010> although<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.820> must

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
saw this time but I just I mean I

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.920 
saw this time but I just I mean I
underestimated<00:06:06.090> that<00:06:06.210> of<00:06:06.420> the<00:06:06.540> context<00:06:06.810> of

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
underestimated that of the context of

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.450 
underestimated that of the context of
one<00:06:07.110> I<00:06:07.260> was<00:06:07.350> inconvenient<00:06:07.620> completely<00:06:08.280> but<00:06:08.400> I

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
one I was inconvenient completely but I

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.950 
one I was inconvenient completely but I
think<00:06:08.700> days<00:06:08.820> upon<00:06:09.090> he's<00:06:09.600> still<00:06:09.780> fighting

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
think days upon he's still fighting

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.360 
think days upon he's still fighting
because<00:06:10.290> if<00:06:10.530> i<00:06:10.650> go<00:06:10.830> here<00:06:10.860> here<00:06:11.780> here<00:06:12.780> he<00:06:13.650> has<00:06:13.800> i

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
because if i go here here here he has i

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.960 
because if i go here here here he has i
thought<00:06:15.240> only<00:06:15.450> move<00:06:15.750> you<00:06:16.350> should<00:06:16.530> be<00:06:16.680> six

thought only move you should be six

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.630 
thought only move you should be six
because<00:06:17.970> otherwise<00:06:18.180> I<00:06:18.300> thought<00:06:18.800> he<00:06:19.800> was<00:06:19.860> 96

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
because otherwise I thought he was 96

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.730 
because otherwise I thought he was 96
probably<00:06:21.300> seven<00:06:21.600> species<00:06:21.870> or<00:06:22.230> two<00:06:22.380> per<00:06:22.560> I

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740
