three by three by five and i'm just

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.060 
three by three by five and i'm just
going<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.840> mix<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.530> video<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
going to mix it up in this video and

00:00:44.070 --> 00:01:01.849 
going to mix it up in this video and
i'll<00:00:44.160> make<00:00:44.340> another<00:00:44.489> video<00:00:44.910> solving<00:00:45.600> it<00:01:00.859> thing

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
i'll make another video solving it thing

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.750 
i'll make another video solving it thing
is<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:04.100> hard<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
is it's not really hard if you know the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.070 
is it's not really hard if you know the
concepts<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.420> solving<00:01:07.260> Siamese<00:01:07.710> qib<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
concepts of solving Siamese qib and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.300 
concepts of solving Siamese qib and
regular<00:01:10.080> three<00:01:10.290> by<00:01:10.439> three<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
regular three by three it's just the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.550 
regular three by three it's just the
fact<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.060> annoying<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.750> once

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
fact that it's really annoying that once

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.010 
fact that it's really annoying that once
in<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> while<00:01:14.150> you'll<00:01:15.150> get<00:01:15.360> caught<00:01:15.659> up<00:01:15.869> in

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
in a while you'll get caught up in

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.370 
in a while you'll get caught up in
something<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:17.750> if<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.810> wanted<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
something like this if you wanted to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
something like this if you wanted to
turn<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.770> layer<00:01:20.009> which<00:01:20.280> right<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.210> don't

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
turn this layer which right now I don't

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.600 
turn this layer which right now I don't
have<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.250> watch<00:01:23.369> out<00:01:23.580> for

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
have to we just have to watch out for

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.679 
have to we just have to watch out for
things<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> only

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
things like that it's the only

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.490 
things like that it's the only
difference<00:01:25.049> between<00:01:25.670> that<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.939> other

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
difference between that and the other

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.740 
difference between that and the other
two<00:01:28.500> cubes<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.119> normally<00:01:30.119> would<00:01:30.329> make<00:01:30.540> up

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
two cubes that normally would make up

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.580 
two cubes that normally would make up
this<00:01:30.960> particular<00:01:31.470> puzzle<00:01:33.140> this<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.290> just

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this particular puzzle this is just

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.580 
this particular puzzle this is just
probably<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.640> resort<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.210> boredom<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.170> red

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
probably the resort of boredom in red

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:59.130 
probably the resort of boredom in red
bull

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.899 

kind<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.229> unwieldy<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.340> annoying<00:02:01.700> to

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
kind of unwieldy and it's annoying to

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.480 
kind of unwieldy and it's annoying to
have<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.180> balance<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.960> weight<00:02:03.220> because<00:02:04.220> this

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
have to balance the weight because this

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.760 
have to balance the weight because this
always<00:02:04.820> wants<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.509> you<00:02:06.140> know<00:02:06.200> gravity<00:02:06.470> wants

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
always wants to you know gravity wants

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:24.400 
always wants to you know gravity wants
to<00:02:06.979> play<00:02:07.159> with<00:02:07.190> it<00:02:07.550> as<00:02:08.450> much<00:02:08.660> as<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:08.929> do<00:02:23.410> yessir

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
to play with it as much as I do yessir

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.960 
to play with it as much as I do yessir
than<00:02:24.530> anything<00:02:24.890> special<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:25.519> just<00:02:25.610> the

than anything special it's just the
excited<00:02:26.660> version<00:02:27.100> i'll<00:02:28.100> probably<00:02:28.430> make<00:02:28.700> the

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
excited version i'll probably make the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.520 
excited version i'll probably make the
fully<00:02:29.300> functional<00:02:29.810> version<00:02:29.959> if<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.350> have<00:02:30.440> to

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
fully functional version if I have to

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.420 
fully functional version if I have to
find<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.830> time<00:02:32.500> plus<00:02:33.500> I'm<00:02:33.680> not<00:02:33.800> very<00:02:34.070> talented

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
find the time plus I'm not very talented

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.520 
find the time plus I'm not very talented
