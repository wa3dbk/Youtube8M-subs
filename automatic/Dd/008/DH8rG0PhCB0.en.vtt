00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.660
 rio de janeiro making with this record 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.980
 Since I was little I liked to stay 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.529
 drawing the magazines of my stay 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.349
 Mom, I grew up seeing this world. 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.989
 champion of commitment so many things I 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.809
 drawing from little clothes and 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.360
 high clothes as was read more poets 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.309
 small drawings we owed more for the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.410
 imagination and sometimes I wanted more 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.320
 When the research I think more calls 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.120
 I learned to do that income 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.980
 the doll a hair two things doll is 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.590
 like here if you do your hair all over 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.489
 paper I sew I do not know 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.489
 there already do not know 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.660
 I'm going to leave the role and know how to dress better. 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.890
 even more fashionable notion even me 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.350
 I think I started to feel better 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.360
 when you close this cycle 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.810
 I quite like it because you see what 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.060
 is fashionable and you will see if the 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.860
 current trend is a trend that 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.450
 now launches you use of with the stickers 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.430
 stamped nail 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.140
 I even understand that you do not have it here. 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.140
 Brazil, always in the United States alone. 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.970
 I think this point can open doors 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.220
 for other things protection 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.930
 possibilities, then, to develop a 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.000
 collection of teen party dresses 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.030
 for a school job and then 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.060
 through the collection I will produce the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.970
 and making a destination does not have a 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.410
 lots of teen shop is one more adult 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.970
 and teens buy watches 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.410
 adult you got to the wardrobe 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.410
 his mother is not legal 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.930
 I'm trying my viola and drawing 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.390
 always try head 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.790
 when I grow up I want to be a stylist 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.500
 to mix know and show my 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.000
 knowledge for discussions of having 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.000
 known and see their knowledge
