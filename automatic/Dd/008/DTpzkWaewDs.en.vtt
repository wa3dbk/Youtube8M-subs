00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.699
 yes, I'm staging my photos 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.859
 So I'm not just putting people off the wall and somewhere 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:19.900
 but I'm worried 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.419
 that came to the artist 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.310
 and then try to implement that later 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.310
 or sepsis hull 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.460
 So every cover product has to be tough 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.130
 that is perceived that way 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.810
 for example plate shelf 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.600
 he is often where I want to the sprayers and keeps you the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.310
 Artist not at all and then but one 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.280
 So here we just see a photo 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.620
 what would they have done 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.960
 but it does not look like you should look there is something there 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.050
 that the original motif 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.310
 I have different levels here 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.929
 Percent sled sheep added and now much more 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.380
 over 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.490
 to miss the picture a blog 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.140
 that then happens via tuna value corrections and add clicks 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.650
 crossing culture 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.610
 Breeder and so on 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.040
 Of course, here are some weaknesses that proved 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.400
 have to be changed 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.360
 here you can see that the lines are falling that may come with it 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.280
 Camera something coming from below 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.740
 they are straight again 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.760
 thus more natural posture of the hip 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.370
 again a little wider and rejuvenated so the narrower made there 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.340
 to shake 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.320
 in my opinion nice picture 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.320
 that has material provided to the product manager 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.240
 this then distributes 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.560
 these pictures 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.169
 or all pictures to the respective station b 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.250
 the press 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.720
 mosh 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.670
 the graphic artist 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.720
 and percent then become percent 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.060
 Cabral the Valais 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.300
 Posters made 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.300
 of course there are all magazines out there 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.120
 not wanting to win or get there 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.989
 and that should be my future 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.149
 Of course I have to make an effort for the first time 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:16.729
 to arrive an artist 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.279
 Of course that can be done through concerts 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.469
 I may speak with people 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.409
 anyway or to hear and have in the circle of friends 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.309
 first time 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:28.309
 Take pictures of friends who might have a bank 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.639
 and then you catch others who build up in your portfolio 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.689
 with which you can apply for it 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.369
 empathy is very important 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:40.799
 where people can adjust 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.849
 that you can handle the big teams 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:44.660
 because 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.019
 for me that is more artist and the photographer reason the assistant 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.459
 but there is really big cock on it 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.519
 this means 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.899
 Ratchuk complains that is all there 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:57.529
 there the situation must be one so one must 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:00.559
 we also had to lead people 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.129
 and percent make the Bocholter enjoyable dysentery as I do 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.709
 the wars
