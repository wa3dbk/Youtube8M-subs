 explain to the camera what is your 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.190
 problem 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.660
 my problem is that in fact a 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.729
 i like two boys at once rochelle 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.800
 should explain why it's me who 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.050
 must do his guys scales because 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.050
 you promised to help me you forgot the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.600
 gem e2 handsomely the end and one-time 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.920
 my dear little monster you have to know 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.320
 that in all cases 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.259
 love is made to be happy 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.470
 so that's what I think and my two 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.360
 boys at once it's always delicate 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.080
 but it's still a situation 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.200
 a little unhealthy and unstable and my 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.640
 two people yes it is possible but 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.400
 we all know that this is neither 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.340
 nice for you or nice for those 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.430
 two suitors then take a few 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.100
 days to think and especially of 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.799
 stress you this is by panicking done of 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.530
 errors that in general will cost a lot 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.720
 dear then especially stop thinking about it 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.269
 all the time stop torturing you 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.250
 once you become calm again 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.190
 soothed I advise you to good 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.090
 mu think I advise you well 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.640
 think so 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.440
 rational to the situation in there 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.150
 looking more closely I had 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.180
 to see your brain playing 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.910
 squash rounds 5 seconds and 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.930
 thoughtful love with a big one 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.540
 uppercase 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.060
 you live every day with parents 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.069
 youth friends another company 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.170
 brothers and and abstains 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.000
 but every person for whom you 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.560
 look like you do not like 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.599
 the same way it's not the same 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.019
 kind or of love and well there it is 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.720
 exactly the same thing indeed that he 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.030
 must feel that friendship or 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.849
 very strong affection for throwing boys 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.730
 but to love the emotions make that 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.930
 sometimes we get carried away and we have 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.420
 the impression that this or that 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.459
 happens then we zoom in on 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.470
 images we see that in fact it's nothing 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.610
 I really hope that I was able to help you 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.709
 closed and submarines and rochelle 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.920
 go get me I'll break up in 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.810
 business and bettiol game but me i want 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.090
 that I give my briefcase take back I 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.670
 want you to like that by arguing 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.970
 that there I am left to make the term 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.970
 with his mother 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.319
 but let's bet that at la québec 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.790
 now we are more than two on 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.500
 the plateau but it does not matter 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.470
 since we are moving right away to 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.780
 problems now noted knife so 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.579
 it's really very simple 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.459
 really had but hey I explain to you my 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.500
 problem I have a friend and in fact we 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.910
 really away both good 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.730
 it's sure we're not in the same 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.669
 college and suddenly bah we attend 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.710
 people but it is the people 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.840
 without blabla billion and that him 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.730
 does not look like we discussed it told me 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.770
 that he's cheating on me I do not share his 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.480
 notice at a party I could 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.800
 meet his college friends who had 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.620
 the air first to see rather 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.330
 friendly my faith but in reality they 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.160
 have made fun of me because I define myself 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.840
 in zinc or ball battle I want 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.460
 tell me I call it a delirium and they 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.780
 they call it a lack of maturity 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.540
 of these murders 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.250
 and she did not react we know each other 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.740
 for 11 years and she did not even 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.320
 defended I defended them if the theft 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.790
 had been repaid and she's getting in 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.710
 more distant I really afraid that 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.900
 our friendship are extinguished please 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.940
 rochelle what do I have to do and 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.729
 well I know very well this 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.430
 situation that is very embarrassing and 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.580
 believe me it's funny people in 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.010
 this world station of choice is you 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.040
 say rené the links with your friend 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.350
 did not you ring me 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.570
 decided to give up that person is 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.760
 certainly it takes real courage and 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.460
 the yard to do it but it frees 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.150
 so much I advise you rather this 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.340
 Do like me 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.430
 let your friend lead his life of peace 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.290
 school billion jenna the morals and 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.420
 it's definitely a choice 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.220
 very difficult to do but it has to be 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.990
 you make the obvious your friend does not 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.640
 will not go back with you and you have not 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.300
 surely not so much to do with a 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.950
 future mia I do not believe in life 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.210
 people come and go 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.340
 some will leave their mark 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.530
 in your life and will mark your memory to 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.900
 never and it is possible that this is the 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.820
 case here but tell me that each 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.760
 nobody is destined to meet a 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.680
 another specific person and if your 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.630
 friend to live all this grief 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.130
 it is certainly not the right one 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.310
 no one that you were style and a 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.100
 belly then do not despair but 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.420
 raise the head and advance the problem 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.550
 when we move away from certain 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.700
 especially when we change 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.070
 college what happened to me is that we 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.470
 hang out with other people and 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.180
 force to know other people and 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.000
 to evolve in a different environment 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.880
 my habit do not end up changed and 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.610
 our behavior our personality is 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.180
 find necessarily changing them too so 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.440
 therefore have changed and the fact of 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.760
 not to see each other for a whole year 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.600
 and we are getting closer to others 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.310
 people and sometimes even 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.070
 forget for stopover because behind you 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.280
 so especially ahead do not take yourself the 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.890
 head 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.720
 continue to do what you do swami 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.150
 with others who look like you 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.740
 and who shares his life is everything 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.810
 what can I wish you dearly 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.480
 monster viewers I hope this 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.100
 number of ss monster you liked 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.630
 despite the fact that Venus could not 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.430
 to be present to introduce you 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.050
 in any case I make you very big 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:15.540
 kisses and I tell you very soon 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.540
 for a bin number the world
