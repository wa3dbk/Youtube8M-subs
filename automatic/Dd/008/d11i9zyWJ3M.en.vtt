00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
that really like to play at 1080p at

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.610 
that really like to play at 1080p at
60fps<00:03:35.849> they<00:03:36.659> that's<00:03:36.989> what<00:03:37.199> they<00:03:37.229> like<00:03:37.500> to

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
60fps they that's what they like to

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.349

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
spend on the graphics or above three

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.729 
spend on the graphics or above three
hundred<00:03:39.569> dollars<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> little<00:03:40.229> bit<00:03:40.349> too<00:03:40.530> much

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
hundred dollars is a little bit too much

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.129 
hundred dollars is a little bit too much
and<00:03:40.979> under<00:03:41.699> it<00:03:41.849> I<00:03:42.030> think<00:03:42.299> a<00:03:42.419> lot<00:03:42.599> of<00:03:42.629> it<00:03:42.840> can't

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
and under it I think a lot of it can't

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.539 
and under it I think a lot of it can't
they<00:03:43.290> can<00:03:43.500> go<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.739> that<00:03:44.040> three<00:03:44.220> hundred<00:03:44.430> dollar

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
they can go to that three hundred dollar

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.949 
they can go to that three hundred dollar
price<00:03:44.790> point<00:03:45.030> that's<00:03:45.150> all<00:03:45.239> I'm<00:03:45.389> saying<00:03:45.689> and

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
price point that's all I'm saying and

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.740 
price point that's all I'm saying and
the<00:03:46.590> r9<00:03:46.919> 280x<00:03:47.459> definitely<00:03:48.120> seems<00:03:48.299> like<00:03:48.509> it's

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
the r9 280x definitely seems like it's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.869 
the r9 280x definitely seems like it's
the<00:03:49.139> battlefield<00:03:49.709> 4<00:03:50.040> graphic<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.579> I<00:03:50.609> don't

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
the battlefield 4 graphic so I don't

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.280 
the battlefield 4 graphic so I don't
know<00:03:50.970> what<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.239> is<00:03:51.269> about<00:03:51.389> it<00:03:51.780> but<00:03:51.870> it's<00:03:52.019> just

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
know what it is about it but it's just

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.830 
know what it is about it but it's just
like<00:03:52.379> r9<00:03:52.739> 280x<00:03:53.159> screams<00:03:53.729> battlefield<00:03:54.359> 4<00:03:54.629> to<00:03:54.720> me

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
like r9 280x screams battlefield 4 to me

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.749 
like r9 280x screams battlefield 4 to me
it's<00:03:55.259> kind<00:03:55.349> of<00:03:55.439> weird<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:55.919> I<00:03:55.979> think<00:03:56.370> this<00:03:56.519> is<00:03:56.729> a

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:56.759 
it's kind of weird but I think this is a

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:57.949 
it's kind of weird but I think this is a
card<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.209> lot<00:03:57.419> of<00:03:57.449> people<00:03:57.569> are<00:03:57.780> going<00:03:57.870> to

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.379 
finally wanted to throw in some nvidia
love<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.450> EVGA<00:04:29.810> geforce<00:04:30.650> gtx<00:04:31.160> 780<00:04:31.820> i<00:04:32.000> still

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
love to the EVGA geforce gtx 780 i still

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.500 
love to the EVGA geforce gtx 780 i still
like<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.690> 780<00:04:33.139> very<00:04:33.470> much<00:04:33.790> you<00:04:34.790> know<00:04:34.910> I<00:04:35.150> don't

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
like the 780 very much you know I don't

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.260 
like the 780 very much you know I don't
like<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.139> Titan<00:04:36.710> at<00:04:36.889> all<00:04:37.100> I<00:04:37.460> think<00:04:37.880> most<00:04:38.150> of

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
like the Titan at all I think most of

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.790 
like the Titan at all I think most of
you<00:04:38.389> guys<00:04:38.419> know<00:04:38.570> that<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:38.930> think<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.350> time<00:04:39.560> is<00:04:39.590> a

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
you guys know that I think the time is a

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.100 
you guys know that I think the time is a
fairly<00:04:40.190> mediocre<00:04:40.490> card<00:04:41.090> i<00:04:41.150> think<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.450> 690<00:04:42.020> is

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
fairly mediocre card i think the 690 is

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.379 
fairly mediocre card i think the 690 is
better<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:43.280> always<00:04:43.520> raises<00:04:44.060> debate

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
better and that always raises debate

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.750 
better and that always raises debate
well<00:04:44.600> a<00:04:44.630> 69<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.260> a<00:04:45.290> dual<00:04:45.560> GPU<00:04:46.070> card<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.520> tines

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
well a 69 is a dual GPU card the tines

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.610 
well a 69 is a dual GPU card the tines
only<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.030> single<00:04:47.240> GPU<00:04:47.660> card<00:04:47.810> that's<00:04:48.290> besides

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
only a single GPU card that's besides

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.290 
only a single GPU card that's besides
the<00:04:48.710> point<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:49.070> just<00:04:49.250> think<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.490> 780<00:04:49.880> is<00:04:50.060> far

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
the point I just think the 780 is far

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.820 
the point I just think the 780 is far
