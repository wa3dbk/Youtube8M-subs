00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
micro switches the overseas doors always

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.499 
micro switches the overseas doors always
have<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:35.360> blue<00:01:36.360> micro<00:01:37.140> switch<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:38.820> harness<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
have a blue micro switch the harness is

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.420 
have a blue micro switch the harness is
different<00:01:40.020> because<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.439> door<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.799> different

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
different because the door is different

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.600 
different because the door is different
so<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.810> Tauri<00:01:43.170> made<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.710> separate<00:01:44.130> harness

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
so the Tauri made up a separate harness

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.789 
so the Tauri made up a separate harness
it's<00:01:45.360> another<00:01:45.630> weak<00:01:45.899> way<00:01:46.079> although<00:01:46.290> sometimes

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
it's another weak way although sometimes

it's another weak way although sometimes

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
quite a difference in the colour layout

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.560 
quite a difference in the colour layout
and<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.220> could<00:02:12.490> be<00:02:12.730> from<00:02:13.000> fading<00:02:13.570> too<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:15.570> we

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
and that could be from fading too but we

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.720 
and that could be from fading too but we
put<00:02:16.750> blue<00:02:17.410> team<00:02:17.740> molding<00:02:18.130> originally<00:02:18.580> the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
put blue team molding originally the

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.090 
put blue team molding originally the
game<00:02:18.880> had<00:02:19.090> black<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:20.020> we<00:02:20.050> repainted<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.800> front

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
game had black so we repainted the front

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.420 
game had black so we repainted the front
but<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:22.050> thought<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.110> was<00:02:23.350> pretty<00:02:23.560> sharp<00:02:23.920> all

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
but I thought that was pretty sharp all

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.030 
but I thought that was pretty sharp all
right<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.850> 3d<00:02:25.390> effect<00:02:25.780> is<00:02:25.990> created<00:02:26.230> actually

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
right the 3d effect is created actually

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.770 
right the 3d effect is created actually
it<00:02:27.340> makes<00:02:27.490> it<00:02:27.670> easier<00:02:27.970> because<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.390> isn't<00:02:28.570> in

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
it makes it easier because this isn't in

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.500 
it makes it easier because this isn't in
here<00:02:28.990> see<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.680> monitor<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.220> TV's<00:02:30.640> damn<00:02:30.970> here

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
here see the monitor the TV's damn here

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.040 
here see the monitor the TV's damn here
and<00:02:31.770> then<00:02:32.770> this<00:02:33.220> black<00:02:33.550> surround<00:02:34.540> which<00:02:34.930> is

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
and then this black surround which is

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.090 
and then this black surround which is
over<00:02:35.410> this<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.830> here<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.150> black<00:02:38.100> light

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
over this and here is the black light

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.170 
over this and here is the black light
lit<00:02:39.690> planets<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.930> ships<00:02:41.770> you<00:02:42.700> see<00:02:42.880> I'm

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
lit planets and ships you see I'm

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.790 
lit planets and ships you see I'm
wiggling<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:43.960> can<00:02:44.200> kind<00:02:44.350> of<00:02:44.470> see<00:02:44.650> what

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
wiggling it so you can kind of see what

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.230 
wiggling it so you can kind of see what
happens<00:02:45.190> but<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:45.490> is<00:02:45.640> all<00:02:45.790> pain<00:02:46.030> with

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
happens but this is all pain with

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.940 
happens but this is all pain with
fluorescent<00:02:46.720> colors<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.140> there's<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.740> black

fluorescent colors and there's a black
light<00:02:48.190> tube<00:02:48.490> up<00:02:48.790> here<00:02:49.150> I'm<00:02:49.270> actually<00:02:49.390> touching

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
light tube up here I'm actually touching

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.190 
light tube up here I'm actually touching
it<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:51.100> lights<00:02:51.520> this<00:02:51.880> now<00:02:52.150> it's<00:02:52.360> not<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.600> black

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
it that lights this now it's not a black

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.490 
it that lights this now it's not a black
light<00:02:53.470> it's<00:02:53.709> called<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.040> black<00:02:54.280> plate<00:02:55.500> white

light it's called a black plate white
it's<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.670> looks<00:02:57.940> like<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.150> weight<00:02:58.450> fluorescent

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
it's it looks like a weight fluorescent

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.720 
it's it looks like a weight fluorescent
tube<00:02:59.140> until<00:02:59.440> you<00:02:59.500> turn<00:02:59.740> it<00:02:59.830> on<00:02:59.860> not<00:03:00.040> then<00:03:00.610> it

looks<00:03:00.910> purple<00:03:01.240> it's<00:03:02.110> pretty<00:03:02.380> sharp<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:03.250> can

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
looks purple it's pretty sharp you can

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.449 
looks purple it's pretty sharp you can
see<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.820> effect<00:03:04.180> here<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:05.709> look<00:03:05.890> in<00:03:06.070> here

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
see the effect here you look in here

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.870 
see the effect here you look in here
carefully<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:08.140> it's<00:03:08.290> shielded<00:03:08.590> enough<00:03:09.070> you

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
carefully and it's shielded enough you

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.750 
carefully and it's shielded enough you
can<00:03:10.090> see<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:11.230> ship<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:12.070> planets<00:03:12.580> it's

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
can see the ship and the planets it's

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.590 
can see the ship and the planets it's
the<00:03:12.910> same<00:03:13.120> piece<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:14.430> fluorescent<00:03:15.430> lip<00:03:15.610> colors

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600

here today here we go
I<00:03:22.739> always<00:03:23.739> liked<00:03:24.100> x-rays<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.090> lots<00:03:25.269> better

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
I always liked x-rays the lots better

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.930 
I always liked x-rays the lots better
but<00:03:25.930> we<00:03:26.830> actually<00:03:27.250> sell<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.550> lot<00:03:27.910> more

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
but we actually sell a lot more

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.270 
but we actually sell a lot more
asteroids<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.080> asteroids<00:03:29.440> even<00:03:30.040> though<00:03:30.130> they

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
asteroids and asteroids even though they

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.440 
asteroids and asteroids even though they
sell<00:03:30.550> for<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.820> same<00:03:31.060> price<00:03:31.420> $12.99

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.370 

there's<00:03:34.750> another<00:03:34.990> element<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:40.060> shields<00:03:41.020> here

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
there's another element the shields here

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.380 
there's another element the shields here
are<00:03:41.830> really<00:03:42.220> clever<00:03:44.190> see<00:03:45.190> I'd<00:03:45.760> rather<00:03:46.030> have<00:03:46.360> a

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
are really clever see I'd rather have a

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.530 
are really clever see I'd rather have a
shield<00:03:46.750> than<00:03:47.050> hyperspace<00:03:48.030> say<00:03:49.030> like<00:03:49.300> that

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
shield than hyperspace say like that

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.450 
shield than hyperspace say like that
that's<00:03:50.110> what<00:03:50.350> I<00:03:50.500> would<00:03:50.560> rather<00:03:50.920> do<00:03:51.420> but<00:03:53.460> some

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
that's what I would rather do but some

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.820 
that's what I would rather do but some
people<00:03:54.790> still<00:03:55.270> prefer<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.930> hyperspace<00:03:56.590> in

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
people still prefer the hyperspace in

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.950 
people still prefer the hyperspace in
the<00:03:56.920> original<00:03:57.310> game<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.970> think<00:03:58.270> what<00:03:58.750> really

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
the original game I think what really

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.990 
the original game I think what really
people<00:03:59.500> hated<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.890> Baptist<00:04:00.310> for<00:04:00.490> most<00:04:00.670> is

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
people hated the Baptist for most is

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.890 
people hated the Baptist for most is
that<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.240> was<00:04:01.390> a<00:04:01.420> lot<00:04:01.840> harder<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:03.690> Atari<00:04:04.690> did

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
that it was a lot harder and Atari did

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.620 
that it was a lot harder and Atari did
that<00:04:05.020> on<00:04:05.170> purpose<00:04:05.200> because<00:04:05.560> people<00:04:06.400> were

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
that on purpose because people were

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.720 
that on purpose because people were
playing<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:07.930> know<00:04:08.440> for<00:04:08.710> half<00:04:09.190> an<00:04:09.400> hour<00:04:09.520> an

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
playing you know for half an hour an

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.060 
playing you know for half an hour an
hour<00:04:09.940> and<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.450> quarter

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
hour and a quarter

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.650 
hour and a quarter
they<00:04:12.070> also<00:04:12.250> programmed<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.270> ship<00:04:14.080> to<00:04:14.260> come<00:04:14.440> out

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
they also programmed a ship to come out

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.570 
they also programmed a ship to come out
yeah<00:04:16.660> I'm<00:04:16.750> almost<00:04:16.930> out<00:04:17.260> of<00:04:17.320> my<00:04:17.530> shields<00:04:18.100> I<00:04:18.250> get

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
yeah I'm almost out of my shields I get

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.600 
yeah I'm almost out of my shields I get
a<00:04:18.610> new<00:04:18.850> load<00:04:19.300> of<00:04:19.480> shields<00:04:19.960> and<00:04:20.170> I<00:04:21.070> had<00:04:21.220> him<00:04:21.430> back

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
a new load of shields and I had him back

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.330 
a new load of shields and I had him back
nine<00:04:21.880> now<00:04:22.270> he<00:04:22.330> splits<00:04:22.840> up<00:04:23.050> but<00:04:23.260> see<00:04:23.890> if<00:04:24.100> you<00:04:24.190> go

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
nine now he splits up but see if you go

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.530 
nine now he splits up but see if you go
off<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.700> screen<00:04:26.130> they<00:04:27.130> don't<00:04:27.400> follow<00:04:27.670> you<00:04:28.030> so
