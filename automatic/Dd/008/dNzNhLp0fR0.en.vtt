00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
obviously it matches my nails which is

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.310 
obviously it matches my nails which is
kind<00:05:20.460> of<00:05:20.490> perfect<00:05:20.700> and<00:05:21.150> then<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:21.780> just<00:05:21.990> blended

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
kind of perfect and then I just blended

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.200 
kind of perfect and then I just blended
that<00:05:22.350> shadow<00:05:22.650> out<00:05:22.860> with<00:05:23.070> an<00:05:23.190> e30<00:05:23.730> that's<00:05:24.120> a

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
that shadow out with an e30 that's a

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.570 
that shadow out with an e30 that's a

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
pencil brush from Sigma one of my

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.460 
pencil brush from Sigma one of my
favorites<00:05:27.030> I<00:05:27.150> use<00:05:27.270> it<00:05:27.390> every<00:05:27.630> single<00:05:27.960> day<00:05:28.140> and

favorites I use it every single day and

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.620 
favorites I use it every single day and
then<00:05:29.040> I<00:05:29.100> figured<00:05:29.550> that<00:05:29.700> wasn't<00:05:30.060> blue<00:05:30.270> enough<00:05:30.510> I

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
then I figured that wasn't blue enough I

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.180 
then I figured that wasn't blue enough I
guess<00:05:30.810> so<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.080> went<00:05:31.350> into<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.890> Urban<00:05:32.130> Decay

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
guess so I went into the Urban Decay

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.160
