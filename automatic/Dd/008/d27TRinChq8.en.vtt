00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.480
 let's look at the rate of laying firewood in 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.849
 bake along with the theme bake on the day many 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.320
 want the stove to burn all day we 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.590
 annual heat and at the same time not to 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.770
 approach her but never understands 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.230
 the essence of the video released by us so we 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.600
 decided to expand this topic in more detail 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.750
 and that means we see that you have a stove 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.530
 filled with wood to the top of its kindle 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.290
 from the grate side then the object is huge 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.480
 the volume of firewood immediately begins to burn and if 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.329
 you have a chimney of 115 millimeters 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.150
 then in general it will not be enough 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.810
 need a chimney and a big set and when 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:02.950
 this oven will burn completely everything 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.500
 firewood throughout its mass and stove with 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.680
 this can release smoke from all crevices 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.509
 if wet weather is the same 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.960
 the most concerns not only vertically 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.970
 standing ovens but also horizontal 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.610
 recumbent stoves if you lay them 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.210
 firewood up to the top above this one 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.549
 the yellow line which is in the figure then 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.170
 the flames you will not fit again 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.210
 in this oven she will be completely with you 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.590
 eager to burn and in the chimney and of course 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.020
 the stove may be burning some 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.390
 a little bit longer than the stove ash laid 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.250
 normal volume but here are the songs laid 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.560
 by volume, it will normally give out 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.960
 warm on all the walls of your as here you are 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.659
 see that is, the fire burns inside the oven 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.619
 they store firewood brim full time 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.369
 oven evenly 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.200
 heated here is such a furnace without partition 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.520
 without septum should gases need 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.220
 impose can impose 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.490
 and half here and here heights if 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.520
 ovens have this here chamber partition 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.280
 afterburning it is also necessary 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.780
 rationing of wood laying by half 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.450
 combustion chambers 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.299
 bottom as here we have a maximum drawn 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.640
 only such a height can be imposed firewood 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.030
 then the wood will burn gases correctly 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.140
 will go to the afterburner arap kohl chamber 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.540
 I sing completely and warmly with us 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.599
 if you put the stove to the top like this 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.150
 we have a yellow field and only in the cell 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.280
 the mountain will not burn the flame is not in the chamber 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.510
 combustion in the rain chamber above this one 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.450
 Here are the lines we are now 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.030
 then we show you then everything is warm too 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.520
 will fly away from you absolutely into the pipe then 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.739
 there is no way 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.709
 normalize the duration of burning any 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.170
 furnace volume of firewood tab if you 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.180
 oven is usually no pyrolysis oven in 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.300
 which there is a separate camera in which 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.870
 firewood burns Aida separate cell 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.209
 big rain comes here this these 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.660
 flue gas then regulate 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.150
 adjust the amount of wood laid 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.160
 itâ€™s absolutely impossible to bake even these 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.349
 Here we have in this case openly 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.030
 oven buleryan photographed there and in 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.480
 she's very very tight all tight 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.030
 lay there up to the top of that firewood then 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.920
 you still won't get this 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.450
 this daily plan of yours at best 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.790
 case beat will still burn 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.620
 three to four hours at first she will 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.510
 urinate to burn but then she still 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.519
 will burn as it should and will be already 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.860
 act normally but hassle 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.420
 give you enough smoke and listen 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.420
