00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
have my chieftain left with a few

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.800 
have my chieftain left with a few
vampires<00:00:22.920> which<00:00:23.699> are<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:24.090> very<00:00:24.330> good<00:00:24.660> at

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
vampires which are not very good at

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.320 
vampires which are not very good at
killing<00:00:25.310> warthogs<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:27.180> that's<00:00:27.990> all<00:00:28.230> he<00:00:28.260> has

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
killing warthogs and that's all he has

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.620 
killing warthogs and that's all he has
however<00:00:30.330> green<00:00:30.840> has<00:00:31.170> an<00:00:31.320> army<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:32.630> Hornets

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
however green has an army of Hornets

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.840 
however green has an army of Hornets
that<00:00:34.079> were<00:00:34.320> partially<00:00:35.070> destroyed<00:00:35.430> by<00:00:35.700> me

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
that were partially destroyed by me

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.720 
that were partially destroyed by me
earlier<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.680> what<00:00:37.680> I'm<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> do<00:00:38.399> now

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
earlier and what I'm going to do now

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.270 
earlier and what I'm going to do now
that<00:00:38.760> we've<00:00:39.090> won<00:00:39.329> I'm<00:00:39.600> taking<00:00:40.110> my<00:00:40.320> vampires

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
that we've won I'm taking my vampires

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.979 
that we've won I'm taking my vampires
over<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.790> put<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> little<00:00:42.270> bit<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.540> pressure<00:00:42.809> on

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
over to put a little bit of pressure on

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.569 
over to put a little bit of pressure on
them<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.710> they<00:00:43.829> don't<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> time<00:00:44.520> to

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
them so they don't have the time to

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.029 
them so they don't have the time to
rebuild<00:00:45.510> right<00:00:45.809> away<00:00:46.020> because<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.890> would

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
rebuild right away because that would

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.720 
rebuild right away because that would
not<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.219> good<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:48.170> top<00:00:49.170> tranny<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.739> Cameron

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
not be good for a top tranny or Cameron

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.770 
not be good for a top tranny or Cameron
because<00:00:52.370> he<00:00:53.370> needs<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> rebuild<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.270> base<00:00:54.480> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
because he needs to rebuild a base and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.810 
because he needs to rebuild a base and
he<00:00:55.020> needs<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.289> rebuild<00:00:55.559> his<00:00:55.739> army<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.640> I'm

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
he needs to rebuild his army so I'm

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.520 
he needs to rebuild his army so I'm
putting<00:00:57.059> some<00:00:57.360> pressure<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> can't

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
putting some pressure on here I can't

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.430 
putting some pressure on here I can't
really<00:00:58.710> do<00:00:58.980> anything<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.579> just<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.410> fact

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
really do anything but just the fact

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
really do anything but just the fact
that<00:01:01.739> i'm<00:01:01.920> behind<00:01:02.160> their<00:01:02.340> base<00:01:02.570> probably

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
that i'm behind their base probably

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.500 
that i'm behind their base probably
would<00:01:04.199> cause<00:01:04.559> them<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.000> little<00:01:06.330> bit

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
would cause them to get a little bit

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.859 
would cause them to get a little bit
stressed<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.330> one<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> things<00:01:09.570> that

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
stressed out and one of the things that

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.770 
stressed out and one of the things that
I<00:01:10.020> should<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.619> checked<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.240> we<00:01:12.240> are<00:01:12.540> missing

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
I should have checked is we are missing

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.080 
I should have checked is we are missing
one<00:01:12.960> base<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> map<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.490> no<00:01:14.760> one's<00:01:14.939> ever

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
one base on the map that no one's ever

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.410 
one base on the map that no one's ever
looked<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.960> they're<00:01:16.830> probably<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.729> but

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
looked at and they're probably there but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.270 
looked at and they're probably there but
at<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> time<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.500> never<00:01:19.799> even<00:01:19.920> thought<00:01:20.100> about

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
at the time I never even thought about

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.469 
at the time I never even thought about
this<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.880> little<00:01:24.240> bit<00:01:24.450> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
this so we do have a little bit of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.749 
this so we do have a little bit of
advantage<00:01:24.930> considering<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:26.009> more<00:01:26.280> basis

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
advantage considering we have more basis

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.630 
advantage considering we have more basis
however<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.720> disadvantage<00:01:28.049> because

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
however we have a disadvantage because

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.219 
however we have a disadvantage because
Cameron<00:01:29.640> space<00:01:29.820> was<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.270> destroyed<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.049> he

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
Cameron space was just destroyed so he

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.249 
Cameron space was just destroyed so he
has<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> rebuild<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> base

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
has to rebuild so we have a base

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.719 
has to rebuild so we have a base
advantage<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:34.979> right<00:01:35.159> now<00:01:35.280> they<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
advantage but right now they have the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.880 
advantage but right now they have the
army<00:01:36.270> advantage<00:01:37.280> I'm<00:01:38.280> trying<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.590> now<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
army advantage I'm trying to now that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.800 
army advantage I'm trying to now that
they<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:42.229> all<00:01:43.229> these<00:01:43.740> vampires

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
they know I have all these vampires

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.370 
they know I have all these vampires
we're<00:01:45.810> getting<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.700> cameron<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.030> make<00:01:48.630> cobras

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
we're getting a cameron to make cobras

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.580 
we're getting a cameron to make cobras
because<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:50.009> should<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.520> making<00:01:51.590> Wolverines

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
because they should be making Wolverines

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.609 
because they should be making Wolverines
to<00:01:53.070> try<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.549> counter<00:01:53.939> all<00:01:54.119> my<00:01:54.299> air<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.380> I'm

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
to try and counter all my air so I'm

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.969 
to try and counter all my air so I'm
going<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.890> keep<00:01:56.070> them<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.530> make<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.680> look

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
going to keep them here and make it look

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.859 
going to keep them here and make it look
like<00:02:01.610> I'm<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.060> make<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.299> look<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.689> I'm

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
like I'm going to make it look like I'm

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.520 
like I'm going to make it look like I'm
keeping<00:02:04.590> with<00:02:04.740> air<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.990> Cameron's<00:02:06.990> going<00:02:07.259> to

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
keeping with air and Cameron's going to

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.360 
keeping with air and Cameron's going to
build<00:02:08.220> some<00:02:08.459> cobras<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.000> hide<00:02:09.509> them<00:02:09.780> until<00:02:10.470> we

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
build some cobras and hide them until we

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.460 
build some cobras and hide them until we
come<00:02:11.610> out<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:12.030> final<00:02:12.629> attack

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
come out for final attack

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.720 
come out for final attack
and<00:02:13.560> right<00:02:13.740> now<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.580> protect

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and right now I have to protect

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.730 
and right now I have to protect
Cameron's<00:02:15.570> base<00:02:15.870> over<00:02:16.830> arm<00:02:17.160> south<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> map

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
Cameron's base over arm south of the map

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
Cameron's base over arm south of the map
because<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.880> being<00:02:21.270> attacked<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.610> I'll

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
because it is being attacked so I'll

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.580 
because it is being attacked so I'll
have<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:23.970> back<00:02:24.270> out<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.690> second<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.170> go<00:02:25.290> over

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
have to back out in a second and go over

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.070 
have to back out in a second and go over
to<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.160> can't<00:02:26.730> remember<00:02:26.970> if<00:02:27.210> I<00:02:27.330> do<00:02:27.390> did<00:02:27.990> they

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
to it I can't remember if I do did they

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
to it I can't remember if I do did they
destroy<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:29.640> get<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.030> back<00:02:30.210> after<00:02:31.100> I'm

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
destroy it but we get it back after I'm

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.680 
destroy it but we get it back after I'm
still<00:02:32.430> putting<00:02:32.580> pressure<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.240> here<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:35.690> by

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
still putting pressure on here and by

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.760 
still putting pressure on here and by
the<00:02:36.750> way<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.080> might<00:02:37.260> be<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.380> little<00:02:37.560> confusing

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
the way this might be a little confusing

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.800 
the way this might be a little confusing
if<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.250> never<00:02:38.370> saw<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.610> first<00:02:38.730> part<00:02:39.210> because

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
if you never saw the first part because

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.660 
if you never saw the first part because
the<00:02:39.960> first<00:02:40.170> part<00:02:40.410> is<00:02:40.560> us<00:02:40.830> building<00:02:41.370> and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the first part is us building and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.070 
the first part is us building and
getting<00:02:41.760> all<00:02:41.970> these<00:02:42.090> bases<00:02:42.540> but<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.930> come

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
getting all these bases but if you come

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.630 
getting all these bases but if you come
in<00:02:43.110> this<00:02:43.290> part<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.830> guess<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.430> get<00:02:44.520> the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
in this part I guess you get the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.720 
in this part I guess you get the
entertaining<00:02:45.680> video<00:02:46.680> watching<00:02:47.250> everything

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
entertaining video watching everything

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.960 
entertaining video watching everything
so<00:02:48.630> they're<00:02:48.840> trying<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.320> exterminate<00:02:50.220> Cameron

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
so they're trying to exterminate Cameron

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.430 
so they're trying to exterminate Cameron
basically<00:02:51.420> they're<00:02:51.600> going<00:02:51.630> in<00:02:51.990> for<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.260> final

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
basically they're going in for the final

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.570 
basically they're going in for the final
kill<00:02:52.800> he's<00:02:53.010> only<00:02:53.190> got<00:02:53.370> two<00:02:53.640> bases<00:02:54.120> left<00:02:54.390> and

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
kill he's only got two bases left and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.940 
kill he's only got two bases left and
I'm<00:02:56.580> trying<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.240> protect<00:02:57.600> him<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.380> trying

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
I'm trying to protect him and I trying

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.880 
I'm trying to protect him and I trying
to<00:02:59.280> keep<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.910> base<00:03:00.209> from<00:03:00.510> being<00:03:00.720> destroyed

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
to keep that base from being destroyed

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.680 
to keep that base from being destroyed
he's<00:03:01.890> only<00:03:02.040> got<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.340> few<00:03:02.790> warthogs<00:03:03.240> and<00:03:03.510> he's

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
he's only got a few warthogs and he's

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.390 
he's only got a few warthogs and he's
putting<00:03:03.959> them<00:03:04.140> straight<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.530> his<00:03:04.830> base<00:03:05.040> and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
putting them straight on his base and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.160 
putting them straight on his base and
luckily<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.870> wasn't<00:03:07.410> destroyed<00:03:07.620> but<00:03:08.340> they<00:03:09.030> do

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
luckily it wasn't destroyed but they do

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.730 
luckily it wasn't destroyed but they do
come<00:03:10.170> back<00:03:10.380> with<00:03:10.790> some<00:03:11.790> more<00:03:11.820> warthogs<00:03:12.740> again

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
come back with some more warthogs again

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.920 
come back with some more warthogs again
and<00:03:13.890> again<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.400> right<00:03:14.940> here<00:03:15.240> I<00:03:15.270> think<00:03:15.750> we

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
and again and right here I think we

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.190 
and again and right here I think we
actually<00:03:16.140> thought<00:03:16.500> we<00:03:16.560> were<00:03:16.709> going<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:16.950> lose

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
actually thought we were going to lose

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.600 
actually thought we were going to lose
we're<00:03:19.200> actually<00:03:19.380> playing<00:03:19.739> against<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.220> general

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
we're actually playing against a general

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
we're actually playing against a general
which<00:03:20.940> means<00:03:21.720> they've<00:03:22.019> played<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> lot<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:24.600> I

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
which means they've played a lot so I

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.630 
which means they've played a lot so I
want<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.170> destroy<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.800> air<00:03:26.100> because<00:03:26.459> that

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
want to destroy this air because that

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.009 
want to destroy this air because that
air<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:26.880> annoying<00:03:27.510> me<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:28.019> lot<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:30.690> makes

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
air is annoying me a lot and that makes

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.740 
air is annoying me a lot and that makes
them<00:03:31.430> more<00:03:32.430> likely<00:03:32.489> that<00:03:32.970> they'll<00:03:33.480> make

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
them more likely that they'll make

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.750 
them more likely that they'll make
Wolverines<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.560> Cameron's<00:03:34.920> Cobras<00:03:35.400> can

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
Wolverines and Cameron's Cobras can

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.120 
Wolverines and Cameron's Cobras can
counter<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.959> if<00:03:37.680> they<00:03:37.830> don't<00:03:37.920> make

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
counter that and if they don't make

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.620 
counter that and if they don't make
Wolverines<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:38.880> they<00:03:38.940> continue<00:03:39.300> make<00:03:39.420> air

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
Wolverines and they continue make air

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.840 
Wolverines and they continue make air
I've<00:03:39.930> got<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.110> counter<00:03:40.530> for<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.800> anyways<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:41.790> I'm

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
I've got a counter for it anyways so I'm

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.610 
I've got a counter for it anyways so I'm
just<00:03:42.030> going<00:03:42.180> behind<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:42.930> showing<00:03:43.290> them<00:03:43.440> that

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
just going behind and showing them that

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.610 
just going behind and showing them that
i<00:03:43.680> can<00:03:44.010> destroy<00:03:44.280> stuff<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.090> as<00:03:46.049> soon<00:03:46.290> as<00:03:46.440> they

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
i can destroy stuff and as soon as they

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.860 
i can destroy stuff and as soon as they
come<00:03:46.830> there<00:03:47.040> i'm<00:03:47.220> going<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.489> ditch<00:03:47.870> because

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
come there i'm going to ditch because

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.470 
come there i'm going to ditch because
there's<00:03:49.200> more<00:03:49.350> of<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.530> hit-and-run<00:03:50.180> because<00:03:51.180> of

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
there's more of a hit-and-run because of

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.080 
there's more of a hit-and-run because of
banshees<00:03:52.170> while<00:03:52.560> they<00:03:52.709> are<00:03:52.920> extremely<00:03:53.459> good

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
banshees while they are extremely good

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.890 
banshees while they are extremely good
at<00:03:54.120> taking<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:55.519> basis<00:03:56.519> they're<00:03:56.910> very<00:03:57.390> very<00:03:57.600> very

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
at taking a basis they're very very very

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.479 
at taking a basis they're very very very
very<00:03:58.350> weak<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:01.470> see<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.709> have<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.160> run<00:04:02.340> away

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
very weak so you see I have to run away

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.630 
very weak so you see I have to run away
once<00:04:02.850> these<00:04:03.120> army<00:04:03.630> gets<00:04:03.810> there<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.530> this<00:04:05.459> is

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
once these army gets there and this is

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.310 
once these army gets there and this is
actually<00:04:05.880> where<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.390> discover<00:04:06.870> they<00:04:07.140> have<00:04:07.170> a

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
actually where I discover they have a

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.790 
actually where I discover they have a
face<00:04:07.650> right<00:04:08.280> next<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.610> Cameron

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
face right next to Cameron

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.340 
face right next to Cameron
this<00:04:10.430> whole<00:04:10.700> game<00:04:10.970> we<00:04:11.300> never<00:04:11.630> even<00:04:11.780> noticed<00:04:12.200> it

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
this whole game we never even noticed it

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.310 
this whole game we never even noticed it
which<00:04:12.620> is<00:04:12.800> a<00:04:12.830> stupid<00:04:13.280> mistake<00:04:13.550> on<00:04:14.110> both<00:04:15.110> our

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
which is a stupid mistake on both our

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.560 
which is a stupid mistake on both our
parts<00:04:15.380> more<00:04:16.190> mine<00:04:16.489> because<00:04:16.970> camera<00:04:17.330> doesn't

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
parts more mine because camera doesn't

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.090 
parts more mine because camera doesn't
have<00:04:17.720> an<00:04:17.900> army<00:04:18.170> so<00:04:18.470> I<00:04:18.500> should<00:04:18.830> have<00:04:18.920> checked

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
have an army so I should have checked

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.840 
have an army so I should have checked
there<00:04:19.459> long<00:04:19.820> ago<00:04:20.030> so<00:04:20.900> it's<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:22.460> doesn't<00:04:22.580> look

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
there long ago so it's it doesn't look

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.130 
there long ago so it's it doesn't look
like<00:04:22.910> he's<00:04:23.180> had<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.480> very<00:04:23.570> long<00:04:23.660> because<00:04:23.960> he

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
like he's had it very long because he

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.840 
like he's had it very long because he
still<00:04:24.350> didn't<00:04:24.560> have<00:04:24.680> one<00:04:24.860> pad<00:04:25.130> there<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.730> it

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
still didn't have one pad there and it

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.540 
still didn't have one pad there and it
was<00:04:25.970> only<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.240> resource<00:04:26.660> space<00:04:27.080> but<00:04:28.010> still<00:04:28.310> he

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
was only a resource space but still he

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.690 
was only a resource space but still he
can<00:04:28.700> be<00:04:28.910> getting<00:04:29.240> warthogs<00:04:29.750> from<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.290> and

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
can be getting warthogs from that and

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.250 
can be getting warthogs from that and
those<00:04:31.700> extra<00:04:32.180> resources<00:04:32.570> now<00:04:32.900> I'm<00:04:33.050> gonna

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
those extra resources now I'm gonna

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.190 
those extra resources now I'm gonna
start<00:04:34.040> building<00:04:34.610> bases<00:04:35.090> on<00:04:35.270> these<00:04:35.480> spots<00:04:35.870> and

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
start building bases on these spots and

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.080 
start building bases on these spots and
I'm<00:04:36.500> going<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:36.770> turtle<00:04:37.160> them<00:04:37.310> which<00:04:37.550> means<00:04:37.760> i'm

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
I'm going to turtle them which means i'm

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.480 
I'm going to turtle them which means i'm
going<00:04:38.240> to<00:04:38.360> put<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.810> ton<00:04:39.410> of<00:04:39.440> shield<00:04:39.920> generators

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
going to put a ton of shield generators

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.850 
going to put a ton of shield generators
on<00:04:40.700> them<00:04:40.940> so<00:04:41.600> they<00:04:41.750> can't<00:04:42.050> get<00:04:42.260> these<00:04:42.380> bases

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
on them so they can't get these bases

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.850 
on them so they can't get these bases
back<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:44.180> if<00:04:44.360> they<00:04:44.510> do<00:04:44.570> they'll<00:04:45.410> be<00:04:45.530> wasting

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
back and if they do they'll be wasting

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.320 
back and if they do they'll be wasting
their<00:04:45.980> time<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.400> I<00:04:46.460> can<00:04:46.640> go<00:04:46.730> hit<00:04:46.940> their<00:04:47.150> base

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
their time and I can go hit their base

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.020 
their time and I can go hit their base
while<00:04:47.810> they<00:04:48.140> are<00:04:48.350> taking<00:04:49.340> our<00:04:49.430> base<00:04:49.640> that<00:04:49.850> only

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
while they are taking our base that only

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.290 
while they are taking our base that only
has<00:04:51.280> shields<00:04:52.280> on<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.580> which<00:04:52.850> doesn't<00:04:53.210> really

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
has shields on it which doesn't really

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.090 
has shields on it which doesn't really
matter<00:04:53.540> if<00:04:53.750> they<00:04:53.870> kill<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.320> then<00:04:54.620> we<00:04:54.740> can<00:04:54.890> get

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
matter if they kill and then we can get

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.680 
matter if they kill and then we can get
a<00:04:55.310> key<00:04:55.520> part<00:04:55.760> of<00:04:55.880> their<00:04:55.970> base<00:04:56.150> right<00:04:56.450> there<00:04:56.510> I

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
a key part of their base right there I

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.010 
a key part of their base right there I
managed<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.470> get<00:04:57.770> his<00:04:58.640> two<00:04:59.060> reactors<00:04:59.690> off<00:04:59.840> his

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
managed to get his two reactors off his

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.870 
managed to get his two reactors off his
base<00:05:00.200> which<00:05:00.590> means<00:05:00.800> he<00:05:00.950> goes<00:05:01.100> down<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.640> tech

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
base which means he goes down to tech

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.080 
base which means he goes down to tech
levels<00:05:02.860> which<00:05:03.860> means<00:05:04.130> he'll<00:05:04.400> have<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.820> rebuild

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
levels which means he'll have to rebuild

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.650 
levels which means he'll have to rebuild
them<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.630> upgraded<00:05:06.440> units<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:07.420> even<00:05:08.420> build

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
them to upgraded units and even build

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.450 
them to upgraded units and even build
some<00:05:09.080> units<00:05:10.090> like<00:05:11.090> cobras<00:05:11.840> and<00:05:11.870> Wolverines<00:05:12.460> so

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
some units like cobras and Wolverines so

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.890 
some units like cobras and Wolverines so
right<00:05:14.000> now<00:05:14.030> we're<00:05:14.960> just<00:05:15.910> I've<00:05:16.910> taken

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
right now we're just I've taken

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.790 
right now we're just I've taken
everything<00:05:18.440> on<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.919> map<00:05:19.130> and<00:05:20.470> Cameron<00:05:21.470> is

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
everything on the map and Cameron is

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.940 
everything on the map and Cameron is
Army<00:05:22.550> is<00:05:22.730> almost<00:05:23.180> done<00:05:23.480> so<00:05:23.960> we're<00:05:24.680> getting

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
Army is almost done so we're getting

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.950 
Army is almost done so we're getting
ready<00:05:25.310> for<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.640> final<00:05:25.940> attack<00:05:26.240> and<00:05:26.570> I'm<00:05:26.660> just

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
ready for the final attack and I'm just

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.409 
ready for the final attack and I'm just
making<00:05:27.410> sure<00:05:27.440> that<00:05:27.950> if<00:05:28.490> they're<00:05:28.730> gonna<00:05:28.940> come

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
making sure that if they're gonna come

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.420 
making sure that if they're gonna come
through<00:05:29.630> here<00:05:29.990> they're<00:05:30.650> probably<00:05:31.010> not<00:05:31.280> going

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
through here they're probably not going

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.100 
through here they're probably not going
to<00:05:31.520> get<00:05:31.610> these<00:05:31.790> bases<00:05:32.240> I<00:05:32.450> believe<00:05:32.810> I've

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
to get these bases I believe I've

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.580 
to get these bases I believe I've
upgraded<00:05:34.240> I'm<00:05:35.240> upgrading<00:05:35.540> my<00:05:35.900> turret<00:05:36.290> so<00:05:36.530> i

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
upgraded I'm upgrading my turret so i

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.610 
upgraded I'm upgrading my turret so i
can<00:05:36.890> fill<00:05:37.610> these<00:05:37.760> with<00:05:37.820> turrets<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:38.630> i've

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
can fill these with turrets and i've

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.860 
can fill these with turrets and i've
upgraded<00:05:39.890> so<00:05:40.460> my<00:05:40.610> shields<00:05:41.000> will<00:05:41.120> regen<00:05:41.450> twice

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
upgraded so my shields will regen twice

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.650 
upgraded so my shields will regen twice
as<00:05:42.080> fast<00:05:42.320> and<00:05:43.180> right<00:05:44.180> there<00:05:44.360> i'm<00:05:44.450> actually

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
as fast and right there i'm actually

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.430 
as fast and right there i'm actually
showing<00:05:45.530> cameron<00:05:46.360> just<00:05:47.360> that<00:05:47.960> i<00:05:47.990> have<00:05:48.260> all

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
showing cameron just that i have all

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.590 
showing cameron just that i have all
these<00:05:48.590> shields<00:05:48.830> on<00:05:49.130> them<00:05:49.310> and<00:05:49.460> their<00:05:50.150> warthogs

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
these shields on them and their warthogs

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.430 
these shields on them and their warthogs
come<00:05:50.960> and<00:05:51.730> they're<00:05:52.730> terribly<00:05:53.450> outnumbered<00:05:54.050> so

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
come and they're terribly outnumbered so

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.650 
come and they're terribly outnumbered so
that's<00:05:54.860> the<00:05:55.040> reason<00:05:55.070> i<00:05:55.430> win<00:05:55.669> here<00:05:56.150> but<00:05:56.480> they

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
that's the reason i win here but they

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.860 
that's the reason i win here but they
would<00:05:56.900> have<00:05:56.930> beat<00:05:57.350> me<00:05:57.530> if<00:05:57.740> they<00:05:58.240> if<00:05:59.240> they<00:05:59.720> had

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
would have beat me if they if they had

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.590 
would have beat me if they if they had
more<00:06:00.230> warthogs<00:06:00.680> because<00:06:01.370> banshees<00:06:02.180> for<00:06:02.450> some

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
more warthogs because banshees for some

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.770 
more warthogs because banshees for some
reason<00:06:03.070> died<00:06:04.070> too<00:06:04.150> warthogs<00:06:05.150> pretty<00:06:05.540> easily

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
reason died too warthogs pretty easily

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.040 
reason died too warthogs pretty easily
especially<00:06:06.350> if<00:06:06.650> they're<00:06:06.800> Gauss

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.600 

I'm<00:06:10.050> not<00:06:10.320> sure<00:06:10.820> why<00:06:11.820> exactly<00:06:12.680> that<00:06:13.680> something

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
I'm not sure why exactly that something

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.150 
I'm not sure why exactly that something
gets<00:06:14.880> the<00:06:15.360> opportunity<00:06:15.780> to<00:06:16.440> be<00:06:16.620> a<00:06:16.860> good

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
gets the opportunity to be a good

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.650 
gets the opportunity to be a good
against<00:06:17.670> infantry<00:06:18.300> and<00:06:18.720> air<00:06:19.550> it's<00:06:20.550> like<00:06:21.330> the

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
against infantry and air it's like the

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.150 
against infantry and air it's like the
the<00:06:22.590> only<00:06:22.980> unit<00:06:23.310> like<00:06:23.550> that<00:06:23.880> so<00:06:25.100> I'm<00:06:26.100> not

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
is not what I don't know why he that

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.760 
is not what I don't know why he that
base<00:06:50.670> over<00:06:51.240> there<00:06:51.480> has<00:06:51.720> two<00:06:52.020> shields<00:06:52.320> on<00:06:52.590> it

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
base over there has two shields on it

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.550 
base over there has two shields on it
and<00:06:52.920> just<00:06:52.970> some<00:06:53.970> resources<00:06:54.600> and<00:06:55.050> I<00:06:55.230> think<00:06:55.470> I

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 
and just some resources and I think I

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.280 
and just some resources and I think I
summit<00:06:56.100> so<00:06:56.760> it's<00:06:56.880> not<00:06:56.970> worth<00:06:57.270> very<00:06:57.540> much<00:06:57.750> to<00:06:58.140> me

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
summit so it's not worth very much to me

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.160 
summit so it's not worth very much to me
and<00:06:58.760> Cameron's<00:06:59.760> gonna<00:07:00.000> go<00:07:00.300> over<00:07:00.510> there<00:07:00.870> and

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
watching my minimap so in a moment I'm

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.850 
watching my minimap so in a moment I'm
going<00:07:10.320> to<00:07:10.590> run<00:07:11.220> with<00:07:11.520> all<00:07:11.760> these<00:07:11.940> units<00:07:12.860> but

I'm<00:07:13.980> going<00:07:14.100> to<00:07:14.160> try<00:07:14.340> and<00:07:14.430> get<00:07:14.640> this<00:07:14.760> base<00:07:14.970> first

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.420 
I'm going to try and get this base first

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.690 
I'm going to try and get this base first
because<00:07:16.230> as<00:07:16.410> soon<00:07:16.590> as<00:07:16.800> those<00:07:16.950> wolverines<00:07:17.310> get

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:17.700 
because as soon as those wolverines get

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.300 
because as soon as those wolverines get
there<00:07:17.970> I<00:07:18.150> cannot<00:07:18.630> do<00:07:18.870> anything<00:07:19.140> and<00:07:19.440> I'll<00:07:20.160> have

there I cannot do anything and I'll have
to<00:07:20.460> run<00:07:21.170> but<00:07:22.170> now<00:07:22.860> that<00:07:23.100> this<00:07:23.220> base<00:07:23.430> is

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 
to run but now that this base is

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.980 
to run but now that this base is
destroyed<00:07:23.970> we're<00:07:24.270> not<00:07:24.450> going<00:07:24.630> to<00:07:24.690> let<00:07:24.840> them
