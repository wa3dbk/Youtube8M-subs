00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.400
 Hello 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.050
 God, we'll show you how we do 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.470
 to vibrate a speaker at 200 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.230
 hertz 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.870
 so to do that we use a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.210
 transformer that my colleague you 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.880
 9 volt watch so what can be better 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.260
 that we use to recharge 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.050
 car batteries but you can 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.829
 also use a pipe a stack of one 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.310
 volt 5 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:32.340
 it did the same effect a loudspeaker 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.860
 that we recovered in pregnant 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.140
 1.5 watt and a penny 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.180
 so it does not really help but 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.399
 good it can be funny and for 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.859
 impress friends is not too much 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.140
 wrong you are left with 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.140
 we spend a year not his demonstration 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.410
 so here we realized the 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.739
 mounting hooked to the socket 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.660
 you can see the transformer 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.390
 to which the speakers have been connected by 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.550
 via two cables 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.310
 then we can see that only by 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.330
 their dime piece was attached 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.950
 and rest remained mint and on the top 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.770
 speaker with the vibrations by the c1 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:31.800
 causes him a little painful 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.160
 but as soon as we remove we no longer hear 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.160
 big thing 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.300
 apart from this little sizzle 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.900
 so that's the editing when 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.400
 at the court in duplicate it is a montage 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.580
 simple enough to realize sent only to 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.690
 three times nothing like material and also 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.540
 we can take much more pieces 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.850
 big and that's so thank you to all 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.500
 to watch our video and more 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.500
 late for next videos his law
