this one too much but a lot of them do

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.929 
this one too much but a lot of them do
seem<00:03:57.310> to<00:03:57.459> be<00:03:57.609> like<00:03:57.939> a<00:03:58.209> cut-down<00:03:58.870> silica

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
seem to be like a cut-down silica

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:08.910 
seem to be like a cut-down silica
possibly<00:04:00.939> of<00:04:01.090> Allens<00:04:01.509> again

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.320

Junie<00:04:14.810> actually<00:04:15.290> this<00:04:15.410> one<00:04:15.650> would<00:04:15.830> probably

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
Junie actually this one would probably

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:25.180 
Junie actually this one would probably
be<00:04:16.400> about<00:04:16.580> 175<00:04:22.480> say<00:04:23.480> got<00:04:23.720> 14<00:04:24.260> stand<00:04:24.740> in<00:04:24.980> there
