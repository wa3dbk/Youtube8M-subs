00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.880 
wire supply to 5 volts the resistor is
here<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.890> limit<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.370> current<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.650> basically

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
here to limit the current so basically

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.069 
here to limit the current so basically
the<00:02:45.040> voltage<00:02:45.160> comes<00:02:45.609> up<00:02:45.790> comes<00:02:46.629> up<00:02:46.780> here

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
the voltage comes up comes up here

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.650 
the voltage comes up comes up here
through<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:47.920> resistor<00:02:48.430> down<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.299> red<00:02:49.450> wire

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
through the resistor down the red wire

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.530 
through the resistor down the red wire
to<00:02:49.930> power<00:02:50.400> down<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.459> red<00:02:51.670> wire<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:52.120> power<00:02:52.299> the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
to power down the red wire to power the

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.039 
to power down the red wire to power the
microphone<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.269> audio<00:02:55.510> then<00:02:55.629> comes<00:02:55.840> back

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
microphone and the audio then comes back

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.059 
microphone and the audio then comes back
down<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:56.590> it's<00:02:57.010> picked<00:02:57.609> up<00:02:58.349> through<00:02:59.349> the

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
down and it's picked up through the

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.849 
down and it's picked up through the
capacitor<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.019> voltage<00:03:02.019> can't<00:03:02.530> get<00:03:02.709> through

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
capacitor the voltage can't get through

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.589 
capacitor the voltage can't get through
because<00:03:04.319> it's<00:03:05.319> it's<00:03:05.859> DC<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.359> won't<00:03:07.510> go

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
because it's it's DC and it won't go

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.119 
because it's it's DC and it won't go
through<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.900> capacitor<00:03:08.379> so<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.590> blocks<00:03:08.829> at<00:03:09.069> a

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
through the capacitor so it blocks at a

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.789 
through the capacitor so it blocks at a
DC<00:03:09.430> voltage<00:03:09.690> but<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:10.870> was<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.109> audio<00:03:11.440> through

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
DC voltage but I was the audio through

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.509 
DC voltage but I was the audio through
and<00:03:12.430> up<00:03:13.180> through<00:03:13.419> the<00:03:13.630> yellow<00:03:13.870> wire<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:15.430> the

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
and up through the yellow wire to the

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.309 
and up through the yellow wire to the
actual<00:03:16.139> mics<00:03:17.139> which<00:03:17.730> then<00:03:18.730> allows<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.180> go<00:03:20.109> down

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
actual mics which then allows it go down
