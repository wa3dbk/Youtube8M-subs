going on basically this vote goes

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.010 
going on basically this vote goes
through<00:06:31.639> you'll<00:06:31.880> be<00:06:32.000> able<00:06:32.090> to<00:06:32.210> intervene<00:06:32.720> a

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
through you'll be able to intervene a

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.379

them<00:06:35.630> while<00:06:35.840> it's<00:06:35.990> doing<00:06:36.200> so<00:06:36.620> I'm<00:06:36.919> definitely

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
them while it's doing so I'm definitely

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.100 
them while it's doing so I'm definitely
voting<00:06:37.700> yes<00:06:37.970> I<00:06:38.180> think<00:06:38.240> it'll<00:06:38.510> make<00:06:38.690> the<00:06:38.810> wild

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
voting yes I think it'll make the wild

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.230 
voting yes I think it'll make the wild
much<00:06:39.350> more<00:06:39.680> dangerous<00:06:40.220> you<00:06:40.639> won't<00:06:40.850> be<00:06:40.970> able<00:06:41.060> to

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
much more dangerous you won't be able to

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.320 
much more dangerous you won't be able to
escape<00:06:41.510> by<00:06:42.410> having<00:06:42.889> an<00:06:43.010> NPC<00:06:43.580> save<00:06:43.880> you<00:06:44.090> and

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
escape by having an NPC save you and

teams<00:06:44.810> know<00:06:45.050> what<00:06:45.139> I'm<00:06:45.230> talking<00:06:45.410> about<00:06:45.710> if

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
teams know what I'm talking about if

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.200 
teams know what I'm talking about if
you're<00:06:45.980> in<00:06:46.250> some<00:06:46.460> mage<00:06:46.669> team<00:06:46.970> and<00:06:47.120> you're

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
you're in some mage team and you're

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.820 
you're in some mage team and you're
trying<00:06:47.360> to<00:06:47.480> hunt<00:06:47.600> someone<00:06:47.840> down<00:06:47.960> your<00:06:48.560> prey

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
trying to hunt someone down your prey

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.890 
trying to hunt someone down your prey
could<00:06:49.100> easily<00:06:49.550> get<00:06:49.669> away<00:06:49.940> especially<00:06:50.270> if<00:06:50.690> you

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
could easily get away especially if you

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.900 
could easily get away especially if you
get<00:06:51.080> attacked<00:06:51.169> by<00:06:51.560> an<00:06:51.740> MPC<00:06:52.040> yourself<00:06:52.580> because

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 
get attacked by an MPC yourself because

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.490 
get attacked by an MPC yourself because
it's<00:06:53.090> gonna<00:06:53.210> make<00:06:53.419> you<00:06:53.600> stop<00:06:53.840> attacking<00:06:54.200> them

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
it's gonna make you stop attacking them

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.710 
it's gonna make you stop attacking them
I<00:06:54.680> don't<00:06:55.070> know<00:06:55.160> about<00:06:55.340> this<00:06:55.460> one<00:06:55.790> guys<00:06:56.000> I<00:06:56.030> think

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 
I don't know about this one guys I think

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.630 
I don't know about this one guys I think
that<00:06:56.990> it<00:06:57.110> would<00:06:57.290> be<00:06:57.350> a<00:06:57.560> good<00:06:57.770> idea<00:06:57.860> to<00:06:58.190> limit

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
that it would be a good idea to limit

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.250 
that it would be a good idea to limit
the<00:06:58.760> worlds<00:06:59.150> and<00:06:59.300> take<00:06:59.450> away<00:06:59.690> ton<00:06:59.930> of<00:07:00.080> them

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
the worlds and take away ton of them

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.500 
the worlds and take away ton of them
which<00:07:00.590> is<00:07:00.770> what<00:07:01.040> they're<00:07:01.250> promoting<00:07:02.090> gear<00:07:02.330> I

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
which is what they're promoting gear I

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.390 
which is what they're promoting gear I
kind<00:07:02.840> of<00:07:02.960> wish<00:07:03.110> they'd<00:07:03.380> release<00:07:03.860> free<00:07:04.160> to<00:07:04.280> play

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
kind of wish they'd release free to play

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.580 
kind of wish they'd release free to play
before<00:07:04.610> doing<00:07:04.970> this<00:07:05.240> they<00:07:05.870> could<00:07:06.020> always<00:07:06.350> add

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590 
before doing this they could always add

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.340 
before doing this they could always add
world's<00:07:07.010> back<00:07:07.250> but<00:07:08.090> as<00:07:08.210> of<00:07:08.480> what<00:07:09.230> the

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:09.350 
world's back but as of what the

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.930 
world's back but as of what the
community<00:07:09.530> is<00:07:09.770> right<00:07:10.100> now<00:07:10.280> I<00:07:10.310> think<00:07:10.490> it<00:07:10.820> would

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
community is right now I think it would

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.909 
community is right now I think it would
be<00:07:11.090> better<00:07:11.270> with<00:07:11.419> timeless<00:07:11.930> worlds<00:07:12.410> remember

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
be better with timeless worlds remember

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:15.100 
be better with timeless worlds remember
guys<00:07:13.040> this<00:07:13.280> is<00:07:13.460> an<00:07:13.610> actual<00:07:14.120> pole<00:07:14.630> yet<00:07:14.900> this

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
guys this is an actual pole yet this

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.900 
guys this is an actual pole yet this
will<00:07:15.320> probably<00:07:15.560> be<00:07:15.740> released<00:07:16.280> in<00:07:16.460> a<00:07:16.550> week<00:07:16.580> or

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:16.910 
will probably be released in a week or

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.120 
will probably be released in a week or
so<00:07:17.120> this<00:07:17.720> is<00:07:17.900> sort<00:07:18.200> of<00:07:18.290> like<00:07:18.440> a<00:07:18.500> food<00:07:18.830> for
