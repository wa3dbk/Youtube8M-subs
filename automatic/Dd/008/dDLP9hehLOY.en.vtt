Queen Natalya overtakes the planet the
soldiers<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:41.790> wiped<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.390> they<00:00:42.510> start<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
soldiers are wiped out but they start to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.720 
soldiers are wiped out but they start to
remember<00:00:42.989> whose<00:00:43.230> side<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.550> can

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
remember whose side you so like we can

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.760 
remember whose side you so like we can
throw<00:00:45.239> away<00:00:45.360> our<00:00:45.629> lives<00:00:45.840> give<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.410> all<00:00:46.590> our

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
throw away our lives give up all our

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.680 
throw away our lives give up all our
energy<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.520> use<00:00:47.700> our<00:00:47.850> morphing<00:00:48.329> energy

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
energy if we use our morphing energy

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.270 
energy if we use our morphing energy
will<00:00:48.870> die<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.320> maybe<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.649> will<00:00:49.739> reach<00:00:49.980> Sailor

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
will die but maybe it will reach Sailor

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.029 
will die but maybe it will reach Sailor
Moon<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.149> they<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.680> turns<00:00:52.860> out

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
Moon so they do that and so it turns out

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.189 
Moon so they do that and so it turns out
salmon<00:00:53.579> wasn't<00:00:54.059> dead<00:00:54.300> because<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.960> watch

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
salmon wasn't dead because the watch

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.560 
salmon wasn't dead because the watch
took<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:55.949> swords<00:00:56.399> impact<00:00:56.879> which

took that like swords impact which

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.900 
took that like swords impact which
doesn't<00:00:58.020> make<00:00:58.170> any<00:00:58.379> sense<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.160> ok

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
doesn't make any sense but ok

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.599 
doesn't make any sense but ok

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
either which is really confusing and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.719

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.730 
the silver crystal the feet Natalya
which<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.720> real<00:01:15.900> easy<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> say

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
which is real easy for you to say

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.200 
which is real easy for you to say
because<00:01:16.799> you're<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> one<00:01:17.460> who<00:01:17.549> has<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.880> do

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
because you're not the one who has to do

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.440 
because you're not the one who has to do
it

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
it

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.420

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
so Sailor Moon uses the crystal but it's

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.520 
so Sailor Moon uses the crystal but it's
not<00:01:20.580> enough<00:01:20.820> power<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:22.020> get<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> gems

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
not enough power and so we get the gems

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
not enough power and so we get the gems

kind of plain and boring the episode
moved<00:02:13.060> very<00:02:13.510> slowly<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.380> not<00:02:14.530> much<00:02:14.740> really

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
moved very slowly and not much really

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.080 
will give storyline a two-on-two plot
development<00:02:23.320> um<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:24.310> all<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.550> soldiers<00:02:24.790> are

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
development um so all the soldiers are

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.530 
development um so all the soldiers are
dead

dead
the<00:02:25.720> generals<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.410> guess<00:02:26.620> are<00:02:26.950> definitively

silver crystal takes almost like final

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.620 
silver crystal takes almost like final
form<00:02:36.610> or<00:02:36.730> whatever<00:02:36.850> was<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.330> lotus

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630

steel<00:02:39.370> metalia<00:02:39.820> so<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.030> lot<00:02:40.270> mean<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.450> lot

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
steel metalia so a lot mean a lot

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.310 
steel metalia so a lot mean a lot
happened

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
happened

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.699 
happened
so<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.100> guess<00:02:42.310> plot<00:02:42.550> development<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.209> five

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
so I guess plot development is a five

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.930 
so I guess plot development is a five
then<00:02:44.709> for<00:02:45.160> artwork<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:47.020> was<00:02:47.320> great<00:02:48.280> at<00:02:48.550> times

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
then for artwork it was great at times

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.640 
then for artwork it was great at times
there<00:02:49.330> were<00:02:49.390> some<00:02:49.450> really<00:02:49.660> cool<00:02:49.750> parts<00:02:50.320> but<00:02:50.590> it

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
there were some really cool parts but it

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.310 
there were some really cool parts but it
was<00:02:50.680> also<00:02:50.890> very<00:02:51.280> kind<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.730> simple<00:02:52.239> like<00:02:52.750> for

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
was also very kind of simple like for

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.810 
was also very kind of simple like for
instance<00:02:53.410> penises<00:02:54.010> chained<00:02:54.220> just<00:02:54.489> wasn't

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
instance penises chained just wasn't

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.699 
instance penises chained just wasn't
there<00:02:55.090> for<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.360> second<00:02:55.780> that's<00:02:55.959> cool<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.590> then

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
there for a second that's cool and then

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.100 
there for a second that's cool and then
a<00:02:56.920> lot<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.610> times<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:58.060> was<00:02:58.150> just<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:58.780> very

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
a lot of the times it was just that very

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.470 
a lot of the times it was just that very
basic<00:02:59.500> kind<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.160> standard<00:03:00.880> go<00:03:01.000> with<00:03:01.420> the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
basic kind of standard go with the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.759 
basic kind of standard go with the
updated<00:03:01.930> version<00:03:02.019> will<00:03:02.290> look<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.440> lot<00:03:02.590> cooler

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
updated version will look a lot cooler

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.380
