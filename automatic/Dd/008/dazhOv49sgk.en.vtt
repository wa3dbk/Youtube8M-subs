whatever I am right now I think it's 20
but<00:01:57.280> I'm<00:01:57.640> gonna<00:01:57.790> head<00:01:58.000> it<00:01:58.120> now<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.630> didn't<00:01:58.990> check

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
but I'm gonna head it now I didn't check

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.690 
but I'm gonna head it now I didn't check
the<00:01:59.230> right<00:01:59.560> side<00:01:59.800> but<00:02:00.070> there<00:02:00.220> was<00:02:00.400> a<00:02:00.430> guy<00:02:00.670> there

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
the right side but there was a guy there

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.920 
the right side but there was a guy there
now<00:02:01.030> if<00:02:01.210> he<00:02:01.330> would<00:02:01.420> have<00:02:01.480> been<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.630> little<00:02:01.750> bit

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
now if he would have been a little bit

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.240 
now if he would have been a little bit
closer<00:02:02.170> he<00:02:02.440> probably<00:02:02.650> would<00:02:02.860> have<00:02:02.920> picked<00:02:03.130> me

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
closer he probably would have picked me

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.980 
closer he probably would have picked me
up<00:02:03.280> that's<00:02:03.640> why<00:02:04.210> it's<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:04.480> important<00:02:04.900> when
