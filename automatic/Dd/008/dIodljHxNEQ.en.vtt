watching my geek show okay today we've

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.670 
watching my geek show okay today we've
got<00:00:03.510> something<00:00:03.810> exciting<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.170> show<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:04.380> we've

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
got a new sensor on the strike if you

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.379 
got a new sensor on the strike if you
look<00:00:08.189> here<00:00:08.519> we've<00:00:09.450> added<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:10.730> pedo<00:00:11.730> here<00:00:12.059> it

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
look here we've added the pedo here it

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.410 
look here we've added the pedo here it
was<00:00:12.570> good<00:00:12.719> or<00:00:12.900> Pete<00:00:13.200> talked<00:00:13.790> about<00:00:14.790> that's<00:00:15.059> got

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
was good or Pete talked about that's got

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.109 
was good or Pete talked about that's got
a<00:00:15.450> screen<00:00:15.839> on<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.020> one<00:00:16.580> this<00:00:17.580> one's<00:00:17.789> got<00:00:17.910> it's

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
a screen on that one this one's got it's

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.420 
a screen on that one this one's got it's
got<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.420> one<00:00:18.600> tube<00:00:18.840> actually<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.160> middle

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
got the one tube actually in the middle

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.500 
got the one tube actually in the middle
and<00:00:20.580> get<00:00:20.640> down<00:00:20.820> through<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.060> center<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.420> it

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
and get down through the center of it

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.090 
and get down through the center of it
and<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.689> other<00:00:21.720> one<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.140> kind<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.470> encompassed

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
and the other one is kind of encompassed

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.710 
and the other one is kind of encompassed
around<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.880> there's<00:00:24.180> two<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.539> there

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
around it so this there's two in there

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.599 
around it so this there's two in there
but<00:00:24.900> just<00:00:25.019> kind<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.439> concentric<00:00:26.010> rings<00:00:26.340> there

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
but just kind of concentric rings there

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.060 
but just kind of concentric rings there
and<00:00:26.789> then<00:00:27.920> that<00:00:28.920> connects<00:00:29.400> right<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.779> here<00:00:31.500> let

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
and then that connects right to here let

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.510 
and then that connects right to here let
me<00:00:32.099> show<00:00:32.189> up<00:00:32.630> this<00:00:33.630> wire<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> APM

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
me show up this wire here to the APM

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
me show up this wire here to the APM
board<00:00:35.730> there<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.239> Trent's<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> try<00:00:37.469> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
board there so Trent's going to try and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.360 
board there so Trent's going to try and
fly<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.739> thing<00:00:37.860> from<00:00:38.100> inside<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.460> car

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.330 

okay<00:00:46.030> it's<00:00:46.240> an<00:00:46.360> autopilot<00:00:46.800> switch<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:48.070> return

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
okay it's an autopilot switch to return

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.170 
okay it's an autopilot switch to return
to<00:00:48.400> launch<00:00:48.550> just<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:48.970> test<00:00:50.340> GPS<00:00:51.340> coordinates

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
to launch just a test GPS coordinates

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.410 
to launch just a test GPS coordinates
and<00:00:52.510> it's<00:00:52.980> cruising<00:00:53.980> around<00:00:54.070> so<00:00:54.400> it<00:00:54.489> says<00:00:54.640> I'm

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
and it's cruising around so it says I'm

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.120 
and it's cruising around so it says I'm
showing<00:00:55.660> our<00:00:55.750> speed<00:00:55.989> okay<00:00:56.559> so<00:00:56.620> let<00:00:56.770> me<00:00:56.800> take<00:00:57.070> a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
showing our speed okay so let me take a

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.640 
showing our speed okay so let me take a
look<00:00:57.220> at<00:00:57.340> that<00:00:57.430> yeah<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.350> airspeed<00:00:59.800> is<00:00:59.980> 44<00:01:00.790> km/h

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
look at that yeah so airspeed is 44 km/h

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.859 
look at that yeah so airspeed is 44 km/h
ground<00:01:02.650> speeds<00:01:02.890> 30<00:01:03.190> I'll<00:01:04.030> just<00:01:04.720> show<00:01:04.839> a

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
ground speeds 30 I'll just show a

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.020 
ground speeds 30 I'll just show a
headwind<00:01:05.229> and<00:01:05.470> everything<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.880> they're

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
headwind and everything so they're

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.600 
headwind and everything so they're
pretty<00:01:07.150> pretty<00:01:07.720> similar<00:01:08.050> there<00:01:08.229> yeah<00:01:08.610> which

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
pretty pretty similar there yeah which

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.740 
pretty pretty similar there yeah which
means<00:01:09.790> we<00:01:10.090> know<00:01:10.180> that's<00:01:10.330> kind<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.600> not<00:01:10.720> very

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
means we know that's kind of not very

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.050 
means we know that's kind of not very
windy<00:01:11.110> today<00:01:11.229> this<00:01:11.440> is<00:01:11.619> a<00:01:11.790> meters<00:01:12.790> and

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
windy today this is a meters and

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.460 
windy today this is a meters and
altitude<00:01:13.420> we<00:01:13.570> didn't<00:01:13.750> reset<00:01:14.050> it<00:01:14.200> so<00:01:14.229> that's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
altitude we didn't reset it so that's

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.380 
altitude we didn't reset it so that's
from<00:01:14.979> sea<00:01:15.220> level<00:01:15.250> we're<00:01:15.940> about<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.090> hundred

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
from sea level we're about a hundred

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.240 
from sea level we're about a hundred
meters<00:01:16.450> in<00:01:16.960> altitude<00:01:17.110> right<00:01:17.440> now<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:18.040> see

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
meters in altitude right now you see

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.350 
meters in altitude right now you see
right

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
right

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.110 
right
there<00:01:20.900> is<00:01:21.770> where<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:22.280> at<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.520> airspeed<00:01:23.000> and

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
there is where you at the airspeed and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.520 
there is where you at the airspeed and
ground<00:01:23.300> speed<00:01:23.600> 55<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:26.090> 86<00:01:26.630> yeah

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
ground speed 55 and 86 yeah

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.350 
ground speed 55 and 86 yeah
you<00:01:27.860> should<00:01:28.310> show<00:01:28.580> them<00:01:28.760> on<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.940> indicators

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
you should show them on the indicators

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.580 
you should show them on the indicators
down<00:01:29.510> here<00:01:29.690> you've<00:01:29.810> got<00:01:29.960> speed<00:01:30.320> that's

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
down here you've got speed that's

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
definitely not going to be the 100kph

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.420 
definitely not going to be the 100kph
that<00:02:06.229> I'd<00:02:06.320> like<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.650> see<00:02:06.830> but<00:02:07.100> we<00:02:07.280> knew<00:02:07.400> that

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
nice it looks like the airspeed

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.570 
nice it looks like the airspeed
indicator<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:07.800> pretty<00:04:07.980> accurate<00:04:08.130> works

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
indicator is pretty accurate works

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.890 
indicator is pretty accurate works
really<00:04:08.760> well<00:04:08.940> yeah<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.480> helped<00:04:09.660> us<00:04:09.720> find

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
really well yeah and I helped us find

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.480 
really well yeah and I helped us find
out<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:09.990> disgust<00:04:10.470> tip<00:04:10.890> stall<00:04:11.130> which<00:04:11.370> is

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
out the disgust tip stall which is

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.330 
out the disgust tip stall which is
basically<00:04:11.790> about<00:04:11.970> 30<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:13.050> need<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.290> 30<00:04:13.680> kph<00:04:14.190> and

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
basically about 30 you need a 30 kph and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.150 
basically about 30 you need a 30 kph and
you're<00:04:14.550> you're<00:04:15.150> gonna<00:04:15.240> lose<00:04:15.630> it<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.109> which<00:04:17.040> I'm

you're you're gonna lose it so which I'm

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.440 
you're you're gonna lose it so which I'm
not<00:04:17.280> sure<00:04:17.459> up<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.579> look<00:04:17.790> at<00:04:17.940> research<00:04:18.239> that

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
not sure up to look at research that

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.569 
not sure up to look at research that
seems<00:04:18.690> kind<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.070> higher<00:04:20.070> than<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.340> thought<00:04:20.489> it

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
seems kind of higher than I thought it

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.949 
seems kind of higher than I thought it
would<00:04:20.670> be<00:04:20.790> at<00:04:20.910> but<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.299> likes<00:04:21.450> it<00:04:21.570> tooks<00:04:21.780> all<00:04:21.930> a

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
would be at but it likes it tooks all a

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.080 
would be at but it likes it tooks all a
little<00:04:22.140> lower<00:04:22.260> speed<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:23.640> is<00:04:23.730> what<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:23.970> is

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
little lower speed but it is what it is

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.270 
little lower speed but it is what it is
so<00:04:24.450> yeah<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:25.440> was<00:04:25.530> awesome<00:04:25.740> to<00:04:26.040> kind<00:04:26.220> of

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
so yeah and it was awesome to kind of

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.470 
so yeah and it was awesome to kind of
get<00:04:26.370> an<00:04:26.490> air<00:04:26.610> speed<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:27.060> looks<00:04:27.090> like<00:04:27.360> our

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
get an air speed it looks like our

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.250 
get an air speed it looks like our
maximum<00:04:27.990> cruise<00:04:28.320> is<00:04:28.530> about<00:04:28.770> 70<00:04:29.340> 80<00:04:29.550> kph<00:04:30.260> which

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
maximum cruise is about 70 80 kph which

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.120 
maximum cruise is about 70 80 kph which
is<00:04:31.410> moving<00:04:31.740> pretty<00:04:31.860> good

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
is moving pretty good

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:43.370 
is moving pretty good
that's<00:04:32.340> what<00:04:32.520> 50<00:04:33.780> someone<00:04:40.880> dragged<00:04:42.169> all<00:04:43.169> sorts

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
that's what 50 someone dragged all sorts

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.860 
that's what 50 someone dragged all sorts
of<00:04:43.410> crazy<00:04:43.530> stuff<00:04:43.919> it<00:04:44.910> was<00:04:45.030> awesome<00:04:45.240> like<00:04:45.600> when

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
of crazy stuff it was awesome like when

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.180 
of crazy stuff it was awesome like when
I<00:04:45.930> was<00:04:45.990> coming<00:04:46.230> in<00:04:46.320> for<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.470> landing<00:04:46.500> over<00:04:46.980> here

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
I was coming in for a landing over here

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.430 
I was coming in for a landing over here
I<00:04:47.370> can<00:04:48.180> watch<00:04:48.450> my<00:04:48.630> airspeed<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.230> i-news

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
I can watch my airspeed and i-news

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.650 
I can watch my airspeed and i-news
getting<00:04:49.770> close<00:04:49.950> to<00:04:50.040> like<00:04:50.190> 30<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:51.330> I'm<00:04:51.419> like<00:04:51.570> I

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
getting close to like 30 and I'm like I

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.300 
getting close to like 30 and I'm like I
gotta<00:04:51.840> get<00:04:51.960> more<00:04:52.110> throttle<00:04:52.350> because<00:04:52.800> I'm<00:04:53.070> so

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
gotta get more throttle because I'm so

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.710 
gotta get more throttle because I'm so
close<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.700> ground<00:04:53.790> that<00:04:54.240> a<00:04:54.270> bike<00:04:54.450> tip

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
close to the ground that a bike tip

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.880 
close to the ground that a bike tip
stone<00:04:54.930> right<00:04:55.050> here<00:04:55.080> I'm<00:04:55.320> gonna<00:04:55.410> it's<00:04:55.800> gonna

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
stone right here I'm gonna it's gonna

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.070 
stone right here I'm gonna it's gonna
crash<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.430> so<00:04:56.640> that<00:04:57.360> is<00:04:57.510> where<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:57.750> airspeed

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
crash and so that is where the airspeed

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.240 
crash and so that is where the airspeed
was<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:58.320> most<00:04:58.590> valuable<00:04:59.010> because<00:04:59.310> now

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
was the most valuable because now

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.130 
was the most valuable because now
that's<00:05:00.790> I<00:05:01.090> need<00:05:01.450> to<00:05:01.510> get<00:05:01.600> give<00:05:01.930> it<00:05:02.050> more

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
that's I need to get give it more

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.870 
that's I need to get give it more
throttle<00:05:02.320> because<00:05:02.770> you<00:05:03.010> can't<00:05:03.190> see<00:05:03.460> or<00:05:03.610> hear

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
at the airplane it's the only rely on

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.260 
at the airplane it's the only rely on
your<00:05:05.620> instruments<00:05:06.100> so<00:05:06.310> that<00:05:06.850> was<00:05:06.970> invaluable
