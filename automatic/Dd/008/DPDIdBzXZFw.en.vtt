and<00:00:13.880> I<00:00:14.880> guess<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.230> guess<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.770> can't<00:00:17.010> really

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
and I guess you I guess you can't really

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.890 
and I guess you I guess you can't really
I<00:00:17.310> mean<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.670> guess<00:00:17.820> were<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.270> well<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.779> can

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
I mean I guess were in a well you can

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.050 
I mean I guess were in a well you can
tell<00:00:19.050> we're<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.320> village<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:21.029> is

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
tell we're in a village and that it is

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.609 
tell we're in a village and that it is
nighttime<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:21.660> everybody's<00:00:22.020> rushing<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.529> get

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
nighttime so everybody's rushing to get

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.080 
nighttime so everybody's rushing to get
inside<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.670> because<00:00:23.789> they're

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
inside and that is because they're

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.870 
inside and that is because they're
running<00:00:24.359> from<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> new<00:00:24.750> zombie<00:00:25.619> well<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.609> guess

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
running from the new zombie well I guess

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.660 
running from the new zombie well I guess
AI<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.990> attacks<00:00:28.529> them<00:00:28.740> now<00:00:28.890> since<00:00:29.220> old

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
AI that it attacks them now since old

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.880 
AI that it attacks them now since old

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
just they are great they decided I guess

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.760 
just they are great they decided I guess
there's<00:01:14.460> speed<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.970> once<00:01:15.420> they<00:01:16.170> start<00:01:16.439> going

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
there's speed up once they start going

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.270 
there's speed up once they start going
moving<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> little<00:01:17.340> faster<00:01:17.939> once<00:01:18.240> they<00:01:19.280> once

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
moving a little faster once they once

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.030 
moving a little faster once they once
they<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.610> zombies<00:01:21.299> or<00:01:21.479> some<00:01:21.780> sort<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.080> mob

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
actually how to make how to make one of

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.600 
actually how to make how to make one of
these<00:01:53.520> guys<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.240> make<00:01:54.479> them<00:01:54.689> typically

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
these guys you can make them typically

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.660 
these guys you can make them typically
villages<00:01:56.610> will<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:57.469> one<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.799> these<00:01:59.189> guys<00:01:59.430> in

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
villages will have one of these guys in

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.130 
villages will have one of these guys in
there<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.119> i'll<00:02:00.329> show<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.570> how<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.750> make<00:02:00.930> them

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
there but i'll show you how to make them

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.920 
there but i'll show you how to make them
you'll<00:02:01.680> take<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.180> iron<00:02:03.180> blocks<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.810> then

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
you'll take for iron blocks and then

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.319 
you'll take for iron blocks and then
like<00:02:04.500> slap<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> pumpkin<00:02:05.280> right<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.820> right

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
like slap a pumpkin right on the right

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.540 
like slap a pumpkin right on the right
on<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.509> top<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.869> it'll<00:02:07.020> make<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.250> that's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
on the top and it'll make one so that's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.309 
on the top and it'll make one so that's
how<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.759> make<00:02:09.030> these<00:02:09.270> Gomes<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.170> guess

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
how you make these Gomes and I guess

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.309 
how you make these Gomes and I guess
we'll<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.679> ahead<00:02:10.770> and

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
we'll go ahead and

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.309 
we'll go ahead and
heck<00:02:11.409> I<00:02:11.739> don't<00:02:12.340> really<00:02:12.579> want<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:12.909> I<00:02:13.260> wonder<00:02:14.260> if

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
heck I don't really want to I wonder if

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.809 
heck I don't really want to I wonder if
he'll<00:02:14.499> attack<00:02:14.799> let's<00:02:14.950> see<00:02:15.129> if<00:02:15.189> he'll<00:02:15.370> tech<00:02:15.639> me

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
he'll attack let's see if he'll tech me

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.959 
he'll attack let's see if he'll tech me
too<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.829> guess<00:02:17.829> I<00:02:17.980> guess<00:02:18.189> either<00:02:18.340> he<00:02:18.519> didn't<00:02:18.760> see

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:18.969 
too I guess I guess either he didn't see

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.330 
too I guess I guess either he didn't see
me<00:02:18.999> or<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.840> think<00:02:20.560> he's<00:02:20.650> running<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.010> he<00:02:21.129> running

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
me or I think he's running is he running

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.679 
actually caught one of these iron golems
carrying<00:03:23.769> around<00:03:23.889> a<00:03:24.220> rose<00:03:24.519> and<00:03:24.909> I'm<00:03:25.299> not<00:03:25.659> sure

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:25.689 
carrying around a rose and I'm not sure

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.030 
carrying around a rose and I'm not sure
why<00:03:26.079> I<00:03:26.109> don't<00:03:26.409> know<00:03:26.500> if<00:03:26.560> he's<00:03:26.650> in<00:03:26.799> love<00:03:27.009> with

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
why I don't know if he's in love with

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.129 
why I don't know if he's in love with
one<00:03:27.310> of<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.489> villagers<00:03:28.060> or<00:03:28.359> he's<00:03:28.599> got<00:03:29.109> a

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
one of the villagers or he's got a

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.699 
one of the villagers or he's got a
long-lost<00:03:29.739> soul<00:03:30.340> mate<00:03:30.609> or<00:03:31.209> something<00:03:31.659> but<00:03:31.930> he

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
long-lost soul mate or something but he

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.349 
long-lost soul mate or something but he
was<00:03:32.919> carrying<00:03:33.159> one<00:03:33.489> around<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:34.030> caught<00:03:34.239> him

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
was carrying one around and I caught him

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.429 
was carrying one around and I caught him
so<00:03:34.659> I'm<00:03:34.750> pretty<00:03:34.870> sure<00:03:34.989> that's<00:03:35.229> where<00:03:35.379> that

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
so I'm pretty sure that's where that

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.520 
so I'm pretty sure that's where that
rose<00:03:35.650> came<00:03:35.919> from<00:03:36.159> and<00:03:36.819> if<00:03:37.659> you<00:03:38.290> didn't<00:03:38.439> know

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
about this we got upside down stairs now
