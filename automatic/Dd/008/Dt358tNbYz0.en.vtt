earrings<00:00:09.420> out<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.050> polymer<00:00:10.559> clay<00:00:10.820> so<00:00:11.820> what<00:00:11.969> I

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
earrings out of polymer clay so what I

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.600 
earrings out of polymer clay so what I
have<00:00:12.300> here<00:00:12.630> are<00:00:12.929> two<00:00:12.960> silicone<00:00:13.950> molds<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.580> I

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
have here are two silicone molds that I

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.689 
have here are two silicone molds that I
made<00:00:15.000> from<00:00:15.650> imprinting<00:00:17.630> actual<00:00:18.630> Oreo<00:00:19.109> cookie

the cookie part of it I guess into into

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.750 
the cookie part of it I guess into into
the<00:00:24.510> silicone<00:00:25.019> mold<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.830> had<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.490> can

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
just some oven-baked clay so its polymer

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.940 
just some oven-baked clay so its polymer
clay<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.930> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> sculpey

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
clay and this is going to be the sculpey

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.139 
clay and this is going to be the sculpey
clay<00:00:47.390> this<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.960> black<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.940> all<00:00:50.940> you

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
clay this is just in black and all you

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.470 
clay this is just in black and all you
need<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.690> condition<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> clay<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
need to do is condition the clay and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.670 
need to do is condition the clay and
conditioning<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.140> means<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.649> that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
conditioning it all that means is that

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.400 
conditioning it all that means is that
you're<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.270> kneading<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.870> squishing<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
you're just kneading it and squishing it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.819 
you're just kneading it and squishing it
together<00:00:59.300> to<00:01:00.300> make<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.510> soft<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.500> I'm<00:01:01.710> gonna

for the cookie and I'm just gonna squish

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.559 
for the cookie and I'm just gonna squish
it<00:02:22.750> together<00:02:22.980> now<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.700> other<00:02:24.940> part<00:02:25.330> has

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
it together now that the other part has

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.160 
it together now that the other part has
baked<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.380> don't<00:02:27.310> really<00:02:27.489> have<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.819> worry<00:02:28.000> about

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
baked I don't really have to worry about

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.370 
baked I don't really have to worry about
breaking<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.560> or<00:02:29.860> shaping<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:31.230> because<00:02:32.230> if<00:02:32.349> we

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
breaking it or shaping it because if we

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.500 
breaking it or shaping it because if we
had<00:02:32.680> done<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:33.040> right<00:02:33.220> away<00:02:33.400> that's<00:02:33.790> what<00:02:34.269> would

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
had done it right away that's what would

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.430 
had done it right away that's what would
have<00:02:34.690> happened

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
have happened

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.890 
have happened
now<00:02:36.430> I'm<00:02:36.489> gonna<00:02:36.670> squish<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.180> together<00:02:37.569> and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
now I'm gonna squish this together and

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.350 
now I'm gonna squish this together and
I'm<00:02:38.140> going<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.590> bake<00:02:38.860> this<00:02:39.130> what<00:02:39.790> I'm<00:02:39.970> going<00:02:40.000> to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
I'm going to bake this what I'm going to

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.750 
I'm going to bake this what I'm going to
do<00:02:40.599> because<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:40.930> happen<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.470> have<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:42.130> happen

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
do because I happen to have it I happen

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.539 
do because I happen to have it I happen
to<00:02:42.790> have<00:02:43.060> some<00:02:43.870> liquid<00:02:44.349> sculpey<00:02:44.650> here<00:02:45.160> so

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
to have some liquid sculpey here so

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.940 
to have some liquid sculpey here so
there's<00:02:45.790> liquid<00:02:46.030> polymer<00:02:46.480> clay<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.799> can

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
there's liquid polymer clay and you can

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.280 
there's liquid polymer clay and you can
bake<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.310> without<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.450> if<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.080> doesn't

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
bake it without it and if it doesn't

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.949 
bake it without it and if it doesn't
stick<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:51.010> can<00:02:51.310> always<00:02:51.730> add<00:02:52.060> glue<00:02:52.330> after<00:02:52.870> the

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
stick you can always add glue after the

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.120 
stick you can always add glue after the
fact<00:02:53.200> that's<00:02:53.500> okay<00:02:53.860> too

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
fact that's okay too

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.039 
fact that's okay too
but<00:02:54.640> since<00:02:54.819> I<00:02:54.940> have<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.329> I'm<00:02:55.450> gonna<00:02:55.630> just<00:02:55.870> throw

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
but since I have it I'm gonna just throw

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.050 
but since I have it I'm gonna just throw
it<00:02:56.500> on<00:02:56.620> there<00:02:58.680> throw<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.739> glob<00:03:00.040> on<00:03:00.069> this<00:03:00.519> one<00:03:00.760> and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
it on there throw a glob on this one and

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.789 
it on there throw a glob on this one and
a<00:03:01.120> glob<00:03:01.329> on<00:03:01.360> this<00:03:01.750> one<00:03:04.170> what<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.260> bakes<00:03:05.500> that

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
a glob on this one what it bakes that

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.650 
a glob on this one what it bakes that
will<00:03:05.980> act<00:03:06.190> as<00:03:06.400> an<00:03:06.640> adhesive<00:03:06.940> but<00:03:07.239> again<00:03:07.450> that's

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
will act as an adhesive but again that's

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.650 
will act as an adhesive but again that's
really<00:03:07.989> an<00:03:08.350> optional<00:03:09.540> thing<00:03:10.540> because<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:13.480> can

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
really an optional thing because you can

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.210 
really an optional thing because you can
just<00:03:13.780> glue<00:03:14.079> it<00:03:14.200> after<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.680> fact<00:03:14.859> and<00:03:15.130> it

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
just glue it after the fact and it

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.069 
just glue it after the fact and it
wouldn't<00:03:15.489> make<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.760> bit<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.390> difference<00:03:16.930> and

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
wouldn't make a bit of difference and

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.259 
wouldn't make a bit of difference and
there's<00:03:17.350> our<00:03:17.500> Oreo<00:03:17.859> cookie<00:03:18.280> now<00:03:18.790> what<00:03:19.060> I'm
