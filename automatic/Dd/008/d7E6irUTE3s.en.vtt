the<00:04:56.940> fries<00:04:57.150> up<00:04:57.390> a<00:04:57.479> little<00:04:57.690> better

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
the fries up a little better

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.750 
the fries up a little better
the<00:04:58.530> bigger<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.890> fillet<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.340> harder<00:04:59.640> it<00:04:59.700> is

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
the bigger the fillet the harder it is

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.080

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
to get it fry it up even with the rest

to get it fry it up even with the rest
I'm<00:05:03.270> going<00:05:03.419> deeper

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.739 

here<00:05:06.490> we<00:05:06.610> go<00:05:06.909> this<00:05:07.030> can<00:05:07.180> be<00:05:07.270> a<00:05:07.300> little<00:05:07.509> tricky

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:07.749 
here we go this can be a little tricky

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:09.420 
here we go this can be a little tricky
you'll<00:05:08.530> probably<00:05:08.710> do<00:05:08.919> better<00:05:09.069> than<00:05:09.280> I'm<00:05:09.400> doing

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
you'll probably do better than I'm doing

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.409 
you'll probably do better than I'm doing

because I'm on camera but you just stay

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.909 
because I'm on camera but you just stay
above<00:05:13.749> the<00:05:14.080> skin<00:05:14.639> when<00:05:15.639> you<00:05:15.729> go<00:05:15.849> in<00:05:15.999> here<00:05:16.919> cut

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:33.300 

don't<00:05:27.449> tell

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.600 

do<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.460> same<00:05:34.640> thing<00:05:34.880> on<00:05:34.970> the<00:05:35.090> other<00:05:35.150> side<00:05:36.610> now

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
do the same thing on the other side now

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.250 
do the same thing on the other side now
if<00:05:37.760> you<00:05:37.850> missed<00:05:38.060> any<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:38.690> can<00:05:38.810> always<00:05:38.990> pick<00:05:39.170> it

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
if you missed any you can always pick it

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:49.850 
if you missed any you can always pick it

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.490 

there<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.550> go<00:05:50.729> it<00:05:51.449> probably<00:05:51.629> isn't<00:05:51.900> even<00:05:52.050> up<00:05:52.289> I

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
there you go it probably isn't even up I

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.830 
there you go it probably isn't even up I
know<00:05:52.680> there's<00:05:52.979> not<00:05:53.129> even<00:05:53.159> a<00:05:53.370> bite<00:05:53.580> there<00:05:53.849> but

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
know there's not even a bite there but

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.719
