00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.360
 jumping boy is the only one going to be bet 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.890
 of make up mod 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.420
 today we will talk about a daily amount 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.300
 and as you can already see some elements 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.670
 which is called greenstone mode which will be 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.860
 day 172 precisely this fashion 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.570
 what introduces us of the stones of 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.110
 dubious provenance that does not seem to do 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.690
 effects candles candles with made with 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.390
 zombie heads all the way we have 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.980
 therefore found also skeletons and whiters 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.920
 the wider cards also give us some 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.960
 tombs graves on the ground standing tombs 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.559
 several graves also in the shape of a sword 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.899
 different color and shape and material 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:57.649
 these especially swords and these 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.410
 flat and raised they shoot when we 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.019
 we die then I'll show you why instead 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.269
 these are the statues of when they die 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.610
 then our companions say the dog 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.390
 the horse a blackmail of when 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.790
 they will die these statues will be formed e 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.060
 the altar instead serves to sacrifice the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.689
 bodies that we have resurrected from ours 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.740
 horses or dogs or the like and to put them back on 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.689
 life very strange thing in practice 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.659
 these instead are very strange a 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.999
 the same thing can happen 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.439
 and are real features that you 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.999
 expose skeletons but there are also of 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.439
 avoid zombies so you can 

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:39.140
 use them even mixing I read some 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:43.390
 this is a very fun party 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.679
 in Toulouse evening name with the skeleton 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.709
 in addition to the one with the skeleton there is 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.179
 also the one with the bat with the bats 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.700
 several bats will answer see 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:56.840
 what is this so let's say they will be 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.390
 of the baskets how can I say let's say a 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.560
 little teasing as you go 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.539
 this recess is proof inside 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.629
 instead after it succeeds the zombie begins to 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.690
 to lead heavily but now why 

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:18.180
 molds school and now me no leo 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:22.250
 it was not obvious 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.719
 it will start to lead heavily too 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.810
 the boar is leading the skeleton no 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:31.230
 because it seemed nothing also introduces 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.099
 other elements though strangely though 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.920
 not raining 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.200
 strangely they cannot be summoned 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.459
 probably these are vain 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.739
 automatic went to kill the mob 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.139
 specific but alternate come 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.489
 placed in creative we don't know why 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.900
 so it would be to be seen then in the game 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.739
 later if they work like that of 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.480
 zombies and some big ones don't come 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.739
 placed 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.030
 ap where others are also 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.269
 public I didn't show you that 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.310
 these are what you do with bones 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:03.599
 are just qb parts of bones 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.040
 you can't say they are beautiful 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.500
 ugly 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.180
 well the model this one 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.329
 main feature of this fashion 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:17.129
 now I'll show you right away 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:20.340
 let me see you die are made of 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.739
 physical evil we are dead 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.329
 I should have formed ours 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.829
 grave of the making me see without 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.260
 chatel because this light with let 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.500
 which would make you see the grave in 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.180
 this case is a sword this happens e 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.430
 what is this tomb for if we go to 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.579
 to break the earth that there is in part yes 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.290
 take it from the grave but it will give us everything 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.519
 the inventory we had lost by falling 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.930
 so let's say don't lose 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.150
 of the inventory by land after a total of 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.799
 so time is very useful as a way to 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.889
 that sense though a lot even if fatigue 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.510
 for those exhibits event that will be the 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.849
 night a mod and very fast and a lot 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.379
 useful in some cases also very tolosa 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.970
 because anyway it will also give you gods 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:02.669
 new villages will also give us are 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.510
 in the villages of villager di 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.980
 cemeteries and there will also be cemeteries 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.220
 with which league available will respond 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.000
 double throttle then type zombie fury 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.819
 that you will have to escape 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.209
 beautiful then nothing to lend to 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.739
 excuse that cell phone 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.490
 I always remember you come f ball 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.039
 would launch bakhit and update a 72 e 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.400
 would have linking description then to 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.400
 next episode
