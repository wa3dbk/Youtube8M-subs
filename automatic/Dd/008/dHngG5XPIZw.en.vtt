00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.050

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.270
 I will choose the winner first I 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.129
 made a list of all who repost 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.180
 our video which can be seen here 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.000
 on the link and all who learn new fortresses 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.690
 everyone who liked everyone who participated in 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.640
 the contest investigated his terms I rendered 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.520
 the list is now on a special site 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.789
 just got generated in good 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.610
 number and choose a winner who is under 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.680
 this number is all who will say that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.680
 it 's somehow fabricated a million thousand 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.780
 once somehow redone there sorry 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.790
 please i don't want to spoil my karma 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.030
 that's why I decided to hold a competition 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.560
 honestly how it will turn out and not 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.810
 the only exception that may 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.240
 be it if the prize falls on me 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.909
 because I also repost this video but 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.189
 for other reasons and so we crawl on 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.130
 site and we will see who is the winner 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.090
 and so among the participant we have 84 people 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.679
 which the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.829
 you share our record here they are all 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:45.359

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.869

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:53.520
 who reposted on the right we have a list 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.200
 people I rendered from this list in 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.719
 separate my list so that i just 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.490
 it was easier to look for a number man as well 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.429
 due to the fact that the conditions of the competition were 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.950
 some people are slightly inaccurate 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.899
 their links were thrown in the comments on 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.090
 that two more people have been added and 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.310
 so a full list of participants would give 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.739
 no one thought that he was deceived start 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.739

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.310
 sweepstakes because i was saying that 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.319
