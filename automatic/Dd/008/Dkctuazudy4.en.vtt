still<00:03:29.579> bringing<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.909> same<00:03:30.239> lip<00:03:30.450> color<00:03:30.690> from

still bringing that same lip color from
the<00:03:31.019> previous<00:03:31.409> outfit<00:03:31.799> because<00:03:32.370> I'm<00:03:32.790> not

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
the previous outfit because I'm not

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000 
the previous outfit because I'm not
gonna<00:03:33.209> lie<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.720> was<00:03:33.959> too<00:03:34.200> lazy<00:03:34.379> to<00:03:34.590> take<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.890> off

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.759 
gonna lie I was too lazy to take it off
and<00:03:35.310> for<00:03:35.970> shoes<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.420> chose<00:03:36.780> my<00:03:36.989> black<00:03:37.319> pointy

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
and for shoes I chose my black pointy

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.369 
and for shoes I chose my black pointy
flats<00:03:38.069> that<00:03:38.579> have<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.790> flash<00:03:39.329> of<00:03:39.569> gold<00:03:39.870> on<00:03:40.200> the

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
flats that have a flash of gold on the

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.610

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620

there's<00:03:44.310> also<00:03:44.940> gold<00:03:45.269> on<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.569> heel<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:46.049> think<00:03:46.319> it

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
there's also gold on the heel I think it

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:58.369 
there's also gold on the heel I think it
