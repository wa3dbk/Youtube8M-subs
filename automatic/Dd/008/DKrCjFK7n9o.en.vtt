00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone how good this is a 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.120
 video tutorial to teach how to play 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.550
 the dollar scale I will try to put 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.009
 a series of videos that will teach 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.139
 about the scales in this case we're going to 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.500
 start with the scale of what is the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.170
 simpler and that has no sharps 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.869
 no flats then let's start with 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.380
 the right hand basically what we're going 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.380
 do is this 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.640
 and if it goes through the back 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.000
 what we do with the right hand what 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.100
 what we are doing is that we play here 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.880
 123 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.600
 and then we're going to cross this crazy 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.600
 thumb 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.960
 and then be dry 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.500
 the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.500
 what 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:20.630
 in the scale of 2 basically it is do re 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:25.509
 my sun 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:30.110
 then everyone and not only for me I surrender that 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:34.030
 is the scale the scale of what I do 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.030
 Now what do we do with our left hand? 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.500
 and here we cross with this brown finger 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.210
 This is going to go to the street 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:02.740
 If you look what we are 1 2 3 4 5 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.240
 and then there will be three notes left 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.020
 that we cross the third finger so that 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:13.110
 there are three here 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.110
 5 here we use 23 to 5 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.190
 ah 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.650
 then back 3 and there are five notes left 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:28.299
 here to get to 2 then we're going to 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.299
 cross this side to stay here 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.239
 the same is here 1 2 3 and there are five 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.300
 notes 2 3 4 5 to get to 40 we go to 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.660
 play from 2 to another 2 seconds until 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.660
 other 2 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.090
 then it will be 5 and that's why we passed 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.819
 finger 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.819
 by others that do not 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:07.120
 and there are three then then both 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.120
 hands together 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.500
 do not 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.500
 and if a finger is missing 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.340
 i 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.810
 but again more slowly 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.489
 at first do it slowly 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.489
 and who comes out super good 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.689
 and 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.970
 Y 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.850
 basically what they are doing is that 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.750
 he is investing that yes they are going 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.010
 changing the fingers basically the 3 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.560
 these are going to be the two fingers that 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.260
 they will be changing what is the 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.260
 third and one shift to the 5th 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.780
 and the space 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.780
 Y 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.400
 from the scale of 2 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.640
 basically it's not going to have any 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.570
 sustained all the letters that we are going to 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.570
 touch are going to be like that 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.729
 and so 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.729
 graphic would you be 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.610
 if the scale 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.150
 so to put up there that they can 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.890
 see would also be the tone scale 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:18.000
 I adore my sun fa well and I valued it and 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:20.640
 they return two and the solfa 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.090
 and well I hope you liked it we go 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.090
 to the next
