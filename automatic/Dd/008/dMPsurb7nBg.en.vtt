cage<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.440> Hercules<00:00:16.650> old<00:00:17.190> cage<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
cage so this is Hercules old cage and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.620 
cage so this is Hercules old cage and
this<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.630> super<00:00:18.900> pet<00:00:19.260> my<00:00:19.920> first<00:00:20.220> home

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
this is the super pet my first home

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.870 
this is the super pet my first home
extra-large<00:00:21.630> cage<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.980> marketed

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
extra-large cage and it's marketed

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.609 
extra-large cage and it's marketed
towards<00:00:24.240> rabbits<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.810> ferrets<00:00:25.109> but<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.470> too

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
towards rabbits and ferrets but it's too

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.920 
towards rabbits and ferrets but it's too
small<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:25.949> both<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.430> those<00:00:26.519> species<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.300> I'll

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
small for both of those species and I'll

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.349 
small for both of those species and I'll
leave<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> link<00:00:28.260> down<00:00:28.320> below<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.769> his<00:00:29.279> old<00:00:29.880> cage

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
leave a link down below to his old cage

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.330 
leave a link down below to his old cage
tour<00:00:30.750> where<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.080> showed<00:00:31.410> all<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.769> stuff<00:00:32.070> in

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
tour where I showed all the stuff in

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.030 
tour where I showed all the stuff in
this<00:00:32.880> cage<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:33.540> honestly<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.320> really<00:00:34.860> don't

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
this cage but honestly I really don't

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.310 
this cage but honestly I really don't
like<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.340> cage<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.820> think<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.300> really<00:00:37.140> hard

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
like this cage I think it's really hard

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.650 
like this cage I think it's really hard
to<00:00:37.469> clean<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.550> into<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.390> hard<00:00:39.570> to

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
to clean and get into and it's hard to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.780 
to clean and get into and it's hard to
pick<00:00:39.809> Hercules<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.469> because<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.399> only<00:00:41.520> has

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
pick Hercules up because it only has

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.619 
pick Hercules up because it only has
very<00:00:42.329> small<00:00:42.480> doors<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.270> really<00:00:45.600> don't

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
very small doors and I just really don't

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.930 
very small doors and I just really don't
like<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.320> think<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.680> way<00:00:47.250> too<00:00:47.280> narrow

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
like it and I think it's way too narrow

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.500 
like it and I think it's way too narrow
and<00:00:48.329> small<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:49.020> Hercules<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.620> he<00:00:50.219> has

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
and small for Hercules so he has

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.720 
and small for Hercules so he has
transferred<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> CNC<00:00:52.829> cage<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.579> is

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
transferred to a CNC cage so this is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.229 
transferred to a CNC cage so this is
Hercules<00:00:53.879> cage<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> 2<00:00:55.500> by<00:00:55.860> 3<00:00:56.239> CNC

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
Hercules cage now it is a 2 by 3 CNC

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
Hercules cage now it is a 2 by 3 CNC
cage<00:00:57.510> except<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.140> actually<00:00:58.469> made<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
cage except it's actually made out of

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.090 
cage except it's actually made out of
cubes<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.969> cardboard<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> time

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
cubes and cardboard just for the time

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.450 
cubes and cardboard just for the time
being

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
being

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.810 
being
I<00:01:02.730> couldn't<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.480> good<00:01:04.140> coroplast<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.309> just

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
I couldn't get good coroplast so I just

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.149 
I couldn't get good coroplast so I just
used<00:01:05.970> cardboard<00:01:06.299> instead<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.890> cardboard

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
used cardboard instead and the cardboard

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.550 
used cardboard instead and the cardboard
does<00:01:08.430> work<00:01:08.610> ok<00:01:08.970> for<00:01:09.299> him<00:01:09.479> because<00:01:10.020> he<00:01:10.409> only

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
does work ok for him because he only

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.130 
does work ok for him because he only
goes<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> washroom<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:12.060> his<00:01:12.689> litter<00:01:13.080> box

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
goes to the washroom in his litter box

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.160 
goes to the washroom in his litter box
but<00:01:13.670> for<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:14.820> guinea<00:01:15.060> pigs<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.450> example<00:01:15.960> it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
but for like guinea pigs for example it

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.050 
but for like guinea pigs for example it
wouldn't<00:01:16.470> work<00:01:16.560> very<00:01:16.860> well<00:01:16.979> because<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
wouldn't work very well because the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.789 
wouldn't work very well because the
cardboard<00:01:18.750> would<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.200> soggy

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
cardboard would get soggy

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.249 
cardboard would get soggy
so<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.729> works<00:01:20.939> ok<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.330> Hercules<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:21.930> wouldn't

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
so it works ok for Hercules but wouldn't

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.410 
so it works ok for Hercules but wouldn't
necessarily<00:01:22.290> work<00:01:22.979> for<00:01:23.220> all<00:01:23.369> CNC<00:01:23.850> cages<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
necessarily work for all CNC cages and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.260 
necessarily work for all CNC cages and
the<00:01:24.780> cage<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.229> located<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.979> top<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.369> Toffees

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the cage is located on top of Toffees

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.800 
the cage is located on top of Toffees
crate<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.700> first<00:01:30.000> I'll<00:01:30.150> start<00:01:30.240> off<00:01:30.450> with<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
crate so first I'll start off with the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.429 
crate so first I'll start off with the
wheel<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.710> Hercules<00:01:31.920> wheel<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
wheel this is Hercules wheel it is a

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.710 
wheel this is Hercules wheel it is a
Carolina<00:01:34.439> storm<00:01:34.950> hedgehogs<00:01:35.700> bucket<00:01:36.570> wheel

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
Carolina storm hedgehogs bucket wheel

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.160 
Carolina storm hedgehogs bucket wheel
it's<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.470> sparkly<00:01:38.250> blue<00:01:38.490> color<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
it's in the sparkly blue color and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.120 
it's in the sparkly blue color and
Hercules<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.350> likes<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.650> wheel<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
Hercules really likes this wheel so I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.230 
Hercules really likes this wheel so I
would<00:01:41.310> definitely<00:01:41.460> recommend<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:42.180> for

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
would definitely recommend it for

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690 
would definitely recommend it for
hedgehogs<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.680> wheel<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.070> placed<00:01:44.430> in

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
hedgehogs and the wheel is placed in

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.179 
hedgehogs and the wheel is placed in
this<00:01:44.909> black<00:01:45.720> litter<00:01:46.140> box<00:01:46.409> which<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.799> got<00:01:46.950> from

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
this black litter box which I got from

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.710 
this black litter box which I got from
Dollarama<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.939> we<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.479> cut<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> little

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
Dollarama and we just cut a little

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.859 
Dollarama and we just cut a little
doorway<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.920> Hercules<00:01:50.520> has<00:01:50.939> easy<00:01:51.149> access<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.659> a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
doorway so Hercules has easy access to a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810 
doorway so Hercules has easy access to a
Hercules<00:01:52.409> only<00:01:52.740> goes<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> washroom<00:01:53.610> on

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
Hercules only goes to the washroom on

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.569 
Hercules only goes to the washroom on
his<00:01:54.210> wheel<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.950> placed<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.490> a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
his wheel so I just placed it in a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.480 
his wheel so I just placed it in a
litter<00:01:56.790> box<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:58.110> easily<00:01:58.920> clean

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
litter box so that I can easily clean

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.819 
litter box so that I can easily clean
out<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.210> poop<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.810> falls<00:02:01.110> off<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.649> wheel

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
out the poop that falls off the wheel
