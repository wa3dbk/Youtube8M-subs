00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.200 
around to the front you've got what
looks<00:00:31.520> to<00:00:31.820> match<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:32.750> 4-inch<00:00:33.170> leaks<00:00:33.469> and

display<00:00:38.329> going<00:00:39.070> vertically<00:00:40.070> higher<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:40.760> this

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
display going vertically higher so this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.660 
display going vertically higher so this
is<00:00:41.060> the<00:00:41.180> original<00:00:41.270> iphone<00:00:41.840> 4s<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.860> this<00:00:43.520> is

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
is the original iphone 4s and this is

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.050 
is the original iphone 4s and this is
how<00:00:44.300> big<00:00:44.540> how<00:00:45.230> tall<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.829> new<00:00:46.010> iphone<00:00:46.790> display

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
would be assuming that this mock-up is

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.100 
would be assuming that this mock-up is
actually<00:00:49.730> legitimate<00:00:50.239> we<00:00:50.540> have<00:00:50.660> gotten<00:00:50.840> ahold

the little duct for opening up what we

just to flip it around to the back you

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.699 
just to flip it around to the back you
still<00:02:39.150> go<00:02:39.360> up<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.540> camera<00:02:39.959> in<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.500> top

from this position put an LED flash near
it<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> whole<00:02:46.560> bunch<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.920> ecstasy

notably<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.780> iphone<00:02:52.350> font<00:02:53.840> doesn't<00:02:54.840> seem<00:02:54.959> to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
notably the iphone font doesn't seem to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.870 
notably the iphone font doesn't seem to
match<00:02:55.290> Apple<00:02:55.890> styling<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:56.459> again<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.820> is

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
match Apple styling but again this is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.289 
match Apple styling but again this is
just<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.180> more<00:02:57.330> powerful<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:59.580> come<00:02:59.940> around<00:03:00.120> to

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
just a more powerful and come around to

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.449 
just a more powerful and come around to
the<00:03:00.390> front<00:03:00.540> perhaps<00:03:01.260> biggest<00:03:01.709> change<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
the front perhaps biggest change is the

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.630 
the front perhaps biggest change is the
move<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.630> front-facing<00:03:03.989> camera<00:03:04.560> from<00:03:05.489> the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
move of the front-facing camera from the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.360 
move of the front-facing camera from the
side<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.090> EPS<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.410> top

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
side of the EPS to the top

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.199 
side of the EPS to the top
so<00:03:10.000> that's<00:03:10.150> really<00:03:10.269> it<00:03:10.420> really<00:03:10.739> seems<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.860> look

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
so that's really it really seems to look

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.699 
so that's really it really seems to look
exactly<00:03:13.209> as<00:03:13.629> of<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.840> league's<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.200> suggested

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
exactly as of the league's to suggested

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.640 
exactly as of the league's to suggested
that<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:15.010> would<00:03:15.129> look<00:03:15.340> upon<00:03:15.640> five<00:03:16.180> in<00:03:17.110> Stanner

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
that it would look upon five in Stanner

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.570 
that it would look upon five in Stanner
it<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.310> Torah<00:03:18.580> in<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.180> iphone<00:03:19.480> 4<00:03:19.629> and<00:03:19.659> 4s<00:03:19.810> and

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
it is Torah in the iphone 4 and 4s and

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.509 
it is Torah in the iphone 4 and 4s and
we<00:03:21.580> just<00:03:22.299> have<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.540> wait<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.260> see<00:03:23.459> how<00:03:24.459> the

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
we just have to wait to see how the

we just have to wait to see how the
software<00:03:24.760> works<00:03:25.150> how<00:03:25.959> much<00:03:26.230> of<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.379> difference

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
software works how much of a difference

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.369 
software works how much of a difference

that makes in day-to-day use so that's

that makes in day-to-day use so that's
