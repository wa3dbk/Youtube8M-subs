00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
video real short video how to do the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.609 
video real short video how to do the
same<00:00:30.240> thing<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> PC<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.140> actually<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
same thing on a PC it's actually a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.799 
same thing on a PC it's actually a
little<00:00:32.130> bit<00:00:32.250> easier<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.880> PC<00:00:33.329> side<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.600> think

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
little bit easier on the PC side I think

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.920 
little bit easier on the PC side I think
a<00:00:34.680> couple<00:00:35.190> ways<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.880> easiest<00:00:36.270> way<00:00:36.630> I

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
a couple ways to do it the easiest way I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.750 
a couple ways to do it the easiest way I
should<00:00:37.649> probably<00:00:37.739> clarify<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
should probably clarify this is going to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.639 
should probably clarify this is going to
be<00:00:38.879> Windows<00:00:39.210> 7<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.750> Windows<00:00:40.079> Vista<00:00:40.110> Windows

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
be Windows 7 and Windows Vista Windows

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.500 
be Windows 7 and Windows Vista Windows
Vista<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> little<00:00:41.760> bit<00:00:41.910> different<00:00:42.300> than

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
Vista is a little bit different than

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.180 
Vista is a little bit different than
Windows<00:00:42.660> 7<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.440> same<00:00:43.590> idea<00:00:43.950> same

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
Windows 7 but it's the same idea same

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.790 
Windows 7 but it's the same idea same
place<00:00:44.520> Windows<00:00:45.270> XP<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.930> different<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.620> much

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
place Windows XP is different and much

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.200 
place Windows XP is different and much
harder<00:00:47.010> yet<00:00:47.280> your<00:00:47.489> right<00:00:47.640> hand<00:00:47.850> click<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.120> your

going to say properties here instead of

going to say properties here instead of
personalized<00:00:52.140> then<00:00:52.500> you've<00:00:52.649> got<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> whole

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
personalized then you've got a whole

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.670

can go to display settings and most of

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.819 
can go to display settings and most of
that<00:00:57.449> information<00:00:57.719> will<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.230> found<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.620> there

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
that information will be found in there

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
that information will be found in there
a<00:00:59.039> little<00:00:59.370> bit<00:00:59.609> harder<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.149> too<00:01:00.300> bad<00:01:00.510> but

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
a little bit harder not too bad but

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.420 
a little bit harder not too bad but
hopefully<00:01:01.770> he'll<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.920> able<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.129> figure<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.399> out

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
hopefully he'll be able to figure it out

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.369 
hopefully he'll be able to figure it out
anyways<00:01:03.000> here's<00:01:03.390> how<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.719> Windows<00:01:04.049> 7

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
anyways here's how to do it Windows 7

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.350 
anyways here's how to do it Windows 7
the<00:01:04.619> easiest<00:01:05.189> way<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.000> hold<00:01:06.119> down

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the easiest way to do it is to hold down

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.030 
the easiest way to do it is to hold down
your<00:01:06.390> Windows<00:01:06.930> key<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.229> your<00:01:07.500> keyboard<00:01:07.740> and
