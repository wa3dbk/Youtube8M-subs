00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello girls excuse me if I'm gone 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.910
 for a few days but had a lot 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.639
 of things to do and study 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.730
 so it's a little taken with the study 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.450
 with the school with long also because 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.430
 that fact that I started there too 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.939
 the university we almost never succeed in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.140
 tell us then at least a weekend 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.800
 let's try our best to stay 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.300
 together and I'm still a little cold 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.189
 those who follow me on facebook have had a bit 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.199
 the influence is also why not 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.800
 he made videos otherwise you don't have 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.880
 you would have heard the voice you have better 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.340
 so 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.700
 and then nothing came back wanted a little 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.030
 update you on what on some 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.670
 things we say then first of all do 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.840
 see these earrings that I have them 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.070
 buy them in the color sam bruti and I have them 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.140
 paid 12 euros 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.920
 I must say that things do not cost there 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.400
 but very little things are nice 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:08.490
 26 in color color if side and minutes 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.010
 so what can i tell you how then 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.659
 I would like to start 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.229
 I had asked a few days ago for good 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.610
 green maybe on facebook 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.890
 if I wanted to tell you a little 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.600
 what had happened to me in the sense of a little 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.450
 updates on the fact of the monarchy 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.130
 as is how I told you I did a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.720
 some exams so he wanted a little bit 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:37.060
 updated e 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:40.720
 so I don't feel like doing it now 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.240
 cantone sense I don't want to hide 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 nothing interests me nothing so it goes 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.910
 so good 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.810
 the names I'm not ashamed to tell in 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:54.190
 a master and yet it all started one 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.080
 a few weeks ago on facebook 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.190
 I had written that they are anyway 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.560
 going to the hospital 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.710
 however, I am also very pale though 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:10.390
 bombs and I didn't wear so much but 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:14.490
 I'm a little more home and I started having 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.700
 always dizzy headache 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.290
 thick and was dead tired that there is a 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.530
 work comes back and it felt like i had it 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.270
 made a hallucinating marathon and me 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.790
 I threw it on the couch and until I went to 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.880
 school I was there on the couch that is not 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.980
 want to do anything but just like it 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.870
 I had done a marathon because I was precise 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.630
 actually maybe it's not that I had 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.580
 tired that much and then passes a 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.800
 day passes two finally passed 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.200
 ten days I said maybe there is something 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.850
 which is wrong then I called mine 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.480
 neurologist and told me to go and do 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.250
 a visit 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.650
 nay before I went directly 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.300
 to the emergency room because welcome 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.310
 of the head-splitting pains e 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.959
 so decided to go to the anyway 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.269
 rescue brand told me he has 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.230
 did blood tests anyway 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.100
 it was all right 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.590
 that maybe it was not an effect anyway 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.010
 collateral, however, the disease from these 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:17.530
 effects here and so nothing has me 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.080
 made a time and motor that is, they have me 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.820
 made a drip of anti-inflammatories 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.430
 very strong that they stoned me 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.489
 but they let me pass 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.799
 a bit of pangs however I had and only 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.359
 which in any case I haven't been yet 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.900
 well then i went to mine 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:36.629
 neurologist directly and I did one 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.840
 MRI is practically is the 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.840
 result 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:48.079
 we say to make you understand how I had you 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.079
 said the disease already divided 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.519
 let's say this disease involves 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:57.500
 small engine trainings for 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.500
 make you understand inside the brain e 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.530
 with the last resonance he wrote it 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.409
 that there was an extra speck 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.629
 compared to the previous one, however, it was not 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.549
 inflamed so what happens that if 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.590
 my body is not inflamed 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.230
 suffers in the sense it cannot come to me 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.659
 something else, for example, one had taken 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.239
 the eye cannot come to me something else 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.160
 if it is not inflamed, if it is 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.620
 inflamed there is to worry in the sense 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.150
 which means that there is still the 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.370
 illness is just for those who are already 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.110
 Going forward 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.729
 the fact that there was this anyway 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.280
 extra car was not a very thing 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.889
 nice in the sense that it meant that 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.840
 it had not stopped but it is slowly 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:42.270
 however going on then nothing not 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.210
 both now there was a speck so not 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.440
 you can do anything just told me to 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.449
 increase the amount of medication I do 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.120
 to keep more under control 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:56.190
 and in six months to make a resonance e 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.860
 in practice this is normal 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.630
 head like they can but said they can 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.970
 to be due precisely to this too 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.740
 or simply to the fact that this 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.650
 disease, however, involves headaches 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.840
 and these things here I went home 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.539
 and more or less two weeks ago I am 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.910
 went to the hospital and I 'm still not 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.440
 still very well 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.630
 after a while i 'm standing maybe 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.820
 I make an effort any discomfort b 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.110
 happens when I'm around people 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.450
 if I stay for a long time in the middle of the 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:30.300
 People broke my head 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:32.850
 I don't know why it is and so nothing is not 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.100
 past all I dissolved i 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:40.770
 hair because they bothered me tied up 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:43.410
 the more I just washed I feel no okay between 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.970
 the other I grew up quite a bit from 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.160
 when i was cut they are a lot 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.860
 glad because they were enough 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:54.120
 nuisance courts are slowly re 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:57.990
 therefore growing nothing apart from this 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.870
 what I wanted to remind you then that 30 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:04.130
 it seems to me that bonasso expires giveaway it 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.720
 I'm making this last so long I thought 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.670
 I do not know no well that I will endure 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:14.010
 more, however, to live I put it here 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:16.440
 at the top and then I wanted then I wanted 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:21.290
 tell you that yesterday I went to the 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.850
 viridea and there are already noliko of Christmas 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.590
 that there is that goes in July they have the air 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.620
 I still don't feel like Christmas 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.919
 honestly that is that it is not hot though 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.960
 it is not cold from atmosphere-like snow 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.750
 Christmas 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.110
 yet having an idea as early as August begins 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.020
 to decorate since yesterday was already good 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.250
 it's mid-October 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.660
 I had already done everything Christmas 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.750
 because I don't know if you've ever been there 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:53.320
 but in viridea at least that of rho 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:55.780
 does so there is practically an area that 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.710
 during the year it is normally set up 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.930
 like a normal department when it does 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.780
 the Christmas season take away everything and 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.880
 they are like this shed and inside it is 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.110
 a whole Christmas route but it is 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.270
 very beautifull 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.370
 that is, there is really everything and it is really 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.300
 beautiful inside to see every year there 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.310
 I go 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.620
 cost the wrath of god things are there 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.260
 ball 4 euros ie one must do 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.120
 the tree leaves us the salary though 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.260
 like I remember you once with mine 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.070
 every year we changed the color of the balls 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.840
 lake a little when prices are 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.340
 we have increased but we said 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.920
 we leave that kind of color and then 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:36.180
 maybe every year against a little something in 

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.300
 more to decorate this way but I must say that 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.250
 I 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.890
 the country's Christmas atmosphere a 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:44.620
 casino I like to put all the packages 

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.720
 under the tree you can buy a lot too 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.510
 gifts I like a mess 

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.620
 bundle them buy the paper all 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.370
 Fiocchettini is something I love 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.890
 lot 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:57.280
 I love making gifts so I like it 

00:07:53.890 --> 00:08:00.100
 very much to receive them also and therefore 

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.660
 nothing I send you a kiss I greet you e 

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.020
 I wait for you at my next video bye 

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.020
 boys
