of the cars that we do in this series
the<00:00:28.019> 1950s<00:00:28.710> f-series<00:00:29.130> wasn't<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> particularly

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the 1950s f-series wasn't a particularly

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.820 
the 1950s f-series wasn't a particularly
fast<00:00:30.300> car<00:00:30.630> but<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> pretty<00:00:31.590> common

now<00:00:33.960> back<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> 1950s<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
now back in the 1950s the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
now back in the 1950s the
second-generation<00:00:35.750> f-series<00:00:36.750> pickup<00:00:37.320> had<00:00:37.530> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
second-generation f-series pickup had a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.630 
second-generation f-series pickup had a
couple<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.920> different<00:00:38.160> motors<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.520> its

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
couple of different motors in its

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.850 
couple of different motors in its
lifetime<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> most<00:00:39.960> powerful<00:00:40.200> was<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.590> y

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
lifetime but the most powerful was the y

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.369 
lifetime but the most powerful was the y
block<00:00:41.160> v8<00:00:41.489> which<00:00:41.940> was<00:00:42.120> about<00:00:42.329> 170<00:00:43.050> horsepower

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
block v8 which was about 170 horsepower

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.470 
block v8 which was about 170 horsepower
and<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.730> imagine<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.180> being<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and as you can imagine this being a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.299 
and as you can imagine this being a
half-ton<00:00:45.960> pickup<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.410> wasn't<00:00:46.739> terribly<00:00:47.010> fast

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
half-ton pickup it wasn't terribly fast

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.680 
half-ton pickup it wasn't terribly fast
and<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.610> probably<00:00:47.760> wasn't<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.300> good<00:00:48.600> in

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and it probably wasn't all that good in

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.540 
and it probably wasn't all that good in
the<00:00:48.750> corners<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.530> vehicle<00:00:49.980> was<00:00:50.070> primarily

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the corners this vehicle was primarily

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.819 
the corners this vehicle was primarily
built<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.000> utility<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.629> not<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:51.960> speed<00:00:52.199> like

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
built for utility and not for speed like

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.080 
built for utility and not for speed like
I<00:00:52.920> said<00:00:53.100> though<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.430> vehicle<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.850> very

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
I said though this vehicle is very

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.150 
I said though this vehicle is very
common<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.660> done<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> hot<00:00:55.469> rod<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
common to see done up as a hot rod and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.619 
common to see done up as a hot rod and
these<00:00:56.340> rods<00:00:56.579> usually<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> huge<00:00:57.360> amount<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
these rods usually have a huge amount of

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.299 
these rods usually have a huge amount of
horsepower<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.440> crazy<00:00:58.710> amount<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.039> speed

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
horsepower and a crazy amount of speed

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.680 
horsepower and a crazy amount of speed
that<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> original<00:00:59.910> vehicles<00:01:00.239> didn't<00:01:00.510> have

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that the original vehicles didn't have

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.569 
that the original vehicles didn't have
now<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.680> game<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> vehicle<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.430> most

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
now in game the vehicle that most

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.310 
now in game the vehicle that most
closely<00:01:02.940> represents<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.510> f-series<00:01:03.870> pickup

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
