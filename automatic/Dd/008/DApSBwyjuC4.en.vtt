00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
what the map was like but I've seen it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.219 
what the map was like but I've seen it
before<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:20.000> ridiculously<00:01:21.000> easy<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:22.020> wall

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
before it's ridiculously easy to wall

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.039 
before it's ridiculously easy to wall
off<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.729> terran<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.479> might<00:01:24.659> actually<00:01:24.869> be

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
off as terran and you might actually be

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.929 
off as terran and you might actually be
able<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.350> wall<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.710> off<00:01:25.860> well<00:01:26.430> permanently

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
able to wall it off well permanently

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.210 
able to wall it off well permanently
where<00:01:27.090> any<00:01:27.330> race<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:28.049> maybe<00:01:28.680> zeg<00:01:28.979> not

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
where any race really maybe zeg not

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.429 
where any race really maybe zeg not
because<00:01:29.520> they<00:01:29.610> usually<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.150> shafted<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.259> we

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
because they usually get shafted so we

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.670 
because they usually get shafted so we
have<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.860> gateway<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:33.680> I'm

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
have one gateway going up here I'm

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.020 
have one gateway going up here I'm
really<00:01:34.920> curious<00:01:35.100> what<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.400> sound<00:01:35.700> volumes

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030

every single little detail that he does
oh<00:01:54.750> yeah<00:01:55.140> what<00:01:55.890> was<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> speed<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:57.000> increase

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
oh yeah what was the speed that increase

oh yeah what was the speed that increase
speed<00:01:57.960> faster<00:01:58.680> fastest<00:01:59.369> now<00:02:00.329> that's<00:02:00.600> not<00:02:00.899> what

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
speed faster fastest now that's not what

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.800 
speed faster fastest now that's not what
the<00:02:02.100> game<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.340> being<00:02:02.700> played<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.659> it

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the game is being played on is it is it

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.889 
the game is being played on is it is it
faster<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.649> might<00:02:04.860> actually<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.219> faster<00:02:05.899> looks

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
faster it might actually be faster looks

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.469 
faster it might actually be faster looks
very<00:02:07.020> fast<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.860> me

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
very fast to me

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.719 
very fast to me
just<00:02:08.810> going<00:02:09.019> fast<00:02:09.560> i<00:02:09.800> think<00:02:10.009> is<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.340> normal

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
just going fast i think is the normal

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.920 
just going fast i think is the normal
speed<00:02:11.030> I<00:02:11.090> already<00:02:11.480> can<00:02:11.930> um<00:02:12.970> faster<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.269> faster

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
speed I already can um faster is faster

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.729 
speed I already can um faster is faster
okay<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.580> anywhos<00:02:17.390> it's<00:02:17.659> I<00:02:17.900> like<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.379> this<00:02:18.530> way

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
okay so anywhos it's I like it this way

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.619 
okay so anywhos it's I like it this way
actually<00:02:18.980> gives<00:02:19.400> me<00:02:19.549> time<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:19.849> say<00:02:20.239> something

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
actually gives me time to say something

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.229 
actually gives me time to say something
about<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.959> game<00:02:21.140> because<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.650> gets<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.519> quick

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
about the game because it gets a quick

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.960 
about the game because it gets a quick
game<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.540> mean<00:02:23.870> yeah<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.349> Scouts<00:02:24.970> norlin

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
prison scene that getting banged up

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.110 
prison scene that getting banged up
against<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.260> wall<00:02:36.549> anyway<00:02:37.549> they<00:02:37.730> have<00:02:37.909> got

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
against the wall anyway they have got

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.089 
against the wall anyway they have got
the<00:02:38.239> orbital<00:02:38.629> command<00:02:38.900> also<00:02:39.170> going<00:02:39.709> in

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
the orbital command also going in

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.430 
the orbital command also going in
already<00:02:40.970> we've<00:02:41.209> got<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:41.390> few<00:02:41.629> and<00:02:41.870> are<00:02:42.049> we<00:02:42.290> have

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
already we've got a few and are we have

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.710 
already we've got a few and are we have
straight<00:02:43.010> away<00:02:43.250> we<00:02:43.430> have<00:02:43.579> an<00:02:43.670> expansion<00:02:44.360> going

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
straight away we have an expansion going

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.830 
straight away we have an expansion going
for<00:02:45.590> our<00:02:45.980> dear<00:02:46.220> David<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:46.910> this<00:02:47.239> map<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.629> course

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
for our dear David so this map of course

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.839 
for our dear David so this map of course
cross<00:02:48.140> position<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.220> good<00:02:49.430> thing<00:02:49.700> to

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
cross position it is the good thing to

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.259 
cross position it is the good thing to

into<00:02:55.670> cybernetics<00:02:56.269> core<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:56.750> might<00:02:57.019> be

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
into cybernetics core this might be

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.550 
into cybernetics core this might be
interesting<00:02:57.459> because<00:02:59.140> we're<00:03:00.140> going<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.379> see

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
interesting because we're going to see

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.800 
interesting because we're going to see
early<00:03:01.099> expansion<00:03:01.510> versus<00:03:02.950> death<00:03:03.950> incarnate

early expansion versus death incarnate

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.599 
early expansion versus death incarnate
vs<00:03:05.810> tech<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.560> we'll<00:03:06.890> see<00:03:07.129> what's<00:03:07.310> going<00:03:07.519> to

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
vs tech and we'll see what's going to

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.539 
vs tech and we'll see what's going to
happen<00:03:07.849> with<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.090> tech<00:03:08.739> yeah<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:10.010> one<00:03:10.250> marine

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
happen with that tech yeah so one marine

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.339 
happen with that tech yeah so one marine
has<00:03:10.790> managed<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:12.250> da<00:03:13.959> coming<00:03:14.959> from<00:03:15.079> Davy

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
has managed to da coming from Davy

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.530 
has managed to da coming from Davy
that's<00:03:15.709> good<00:03:15.919> that's<00:03:16.130> maybe<00:03:16.489> codes<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.239> think

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
that's good that's maybe codes I think

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.360 
that's good that's maybe codes I think
he's<00:03:17.630> typing<00:03:18.049> in<00:03:18.169> cheat<00:03:18.380> codes<00:03:18.709> I'm<00:03:18.829> pretty

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
he's typing in cheat codes I'm pretty

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.280 
he's typing in cheat codes I'm pretty
sure<00:03:19.639> the<00:03:19.819> blizzard<00:03:20.090> dimple<00:03:20.419> employees<00:03:21.049> have

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
sure the blizzard dimple employees have

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.759 
sure the blizzard dimple employees have
Keith<00:03:21.620> goes<00:03:21.829> let's<00:03:22.099> see<00:03:22.310> um<00:03:23.290> yep<00:03:24.290> that<00:03:24.500> marine

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
Keith goes let's see um yep that marine

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.270 
Keith goes let's see um yep that marine
wasn't<00:03:25.099> there<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.819> spawned<00:03:26.419> again<00:03:27.280> anyway

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
wasn't there it spawned again anyway

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.559 
wasn't there it spawned again anyway
I'll<00:03:28.430> better<00:03:28.639> come<00:03:28.819> out<00:03:28.970> we've<00:03:29.120> got<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.329> mule

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
I'll better come out we've got the mule

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.420 
I'll better come out we've got the mule
going<00:03:30.139> something<00:03:30.709> that<00:03:30.859> a<00:03:31.069> lot<00:03:31.130> of<00:03:31.310> people

going something that a lot of people
seem<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:31.940> forget<00:03:32.150> exists<00:03:33.109> in<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:34.040> early<00:03:34.280> days

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
seem to forget exists in the early days

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.520 
seem to forget exists in the early days
probably<00:03:35.060> will<00:03:35.419> become<00:03:35.810> second<00:03:36.169> nature<00:03:36.200> to

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
probably will become second nature to

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.770 
probably will become second nature to
starcraft<00:03:37.130> in<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.340> minute<00:03:37.669> anyway<00:03:38.269> there<00:03:38.510> we<00:03:38.630> go

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
starcraft in a minute anyway there we go

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.140 
starcraft in a minute anyway there we go
we<00:03:38.930> finally<00:03:39.440> have<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:39.859> guys<00:03:40.099> and<00:03:40.370> now<00:03:40.579> going<00:03:40.910> in

what's happening yet we've got the

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.270 
what's happening yet we've got the
twilights<00:03:47.690> council<00:03:48.169> and<00:03:48.349> stock<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.859> already

Council<00:03:51.410> sort<00:03:51.650> of<00:03:51.859> citadel<00:03:52.250> of<00:03:52.280> doing<00:03:52.579> I<00:03:52.639> think

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
Council sort of citadel of doing I think

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.210 
Council sort of citadel of doing I think
that<00:03:53.660> maybe<00:03:53.989> because<00:03:54.410> of<00:03:54.530> this<00:03:54.650> block<00:03:54.950> here

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
that maybe because of this block here

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.069 
that maybe because of this block here
that<00:03:55.790> sonic<00:03:56.209> might<00:03:56.480> actually<00:03:56.660> go<00:03:56.900> for

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
that sonic might actually go for

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.619 
that sonic might actually go for

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
really go but anyway so it's taking a

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.189 
really go but anyway so it's taking a
swipe<00:06:39.229> I<00:06:39.620> believe<00:06:40.580> there's<00:06:41.120> no<00:06:41.720> it's<00:06:41.870> actually

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 
swipe I believe there's no it's actually

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.770 
swipe I believe there's no it's actually
quite<00:06:43.039> seen<00:06:43.400> the<00:06:43.430> massager<00:06:43.940> it's<00:06:44.090> us<00:06:44.270> okay
