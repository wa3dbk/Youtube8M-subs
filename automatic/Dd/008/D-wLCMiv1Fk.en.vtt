00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.440 
and so they just used random colors but
I<00:00:42.710> thought<00:00:43.100> it'd<00:00:43.250> be<00:00:43.280> such<00:00:43.580> a<00:00:43.610> great<00:00:43.880> idea<00:00:44.180> to

I thought it'd be such a great idea to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.150

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.490 

and<00:01:13.800> then<00:01:14.010> you're<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.400> gonna<00:01:14.640> cut<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.500> right

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500

and then you're just gonna cut it right
down<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.890> center<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.560> then<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.130> should

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
down the center and then that should

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.750 
down the center and then that should
give<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:22.790> sheet<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:23.940> this<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:26.550> from

give you a sheet like this and then from

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.430 
give you a sheet like this and then from
here<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:28.620> easiest<00:01:28.980> way<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.270> fold<00:01:31.230> it<00:01:31.410> back

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
here the easiest way is to fold it back

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.580 
here the easiest way is to fold it back
up<00:01:31.830> against<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.520> creases<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.350> cut<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
up against the creases so you can cut it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.860 
up against the creases so you can cut it
all<00:01:37.740> at<00:01:37.920> once<00:01:38.070> pretty<00:01:38.340> easily<00:01:38.550> and<00:01:39.150> then

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
all at once pretty easily and then

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.810 
all at once pretty easily and then
you're<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> cut<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.800> one<00:01:40.860> into<00:01:41.580> three

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
you're going to cut this one into three

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.990 
you're going to cut this one into three
sections<00:01:42.260> so<00:01:43.260> you<00:01:43.820> put<00:01:44.820> there<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:46.730> cut<00:01:47.730> there

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.530 

okay<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:52.320> now<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:53.790> should<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.090> three<00:01:54.330> pieces

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
okay so now you should have three pieces

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.090 
okay so now you should have three pieces
that<00:01:54.780> look<00:01:55.050> like<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:56.180> then<00:01:57.180> from<00:01:57.360> here

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
that look like this and then from here

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.760 
that look like this and then from here
you're<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.960> take<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> ruler<00:02:01.320> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
you're going to want to take a ruler and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.660 
you're going to want to take a ruler and
measure<00:02:02.700> out<00:02:03.650> four<00:02:04.650> inches<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:04.980> every<00:02:05.430> four

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
measure out four inches so every four

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.090 
measure out four inches so every four
inches<00:02:06.000> cut<00:02:06.330> it<00:02:06.480> off<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.350> if<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:09.810> should<00:02:10.100> get

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
inches cut it off so if you should get

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.730 
inches cut it off so if you should get
quite<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> few<00:02:11.970> little<00:02:12.530> rectangles<00:02:13.530> out<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.860> it

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
quite a few little rectangles out of it

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.550 
quite a few little rectangles out of it
and<00:02:16.740> then<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.190> should<00:02:17.520> get<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.150> bunch<00:02:18.560> sheets

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
and then you should get a bunch sheets

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.390 
and then you should get a bunch sheets
that<00:02:19.709> look<00:02:19.830> like<00:02:19.950> this

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400

that look like this
this<00:02:20.790> size<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:22.200> then<00:02:22.350> you're<00:02:22.590> gonna<00:02:22.680> take

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
this size and then you're gonna take

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.810 
this size and then you're gonna take
four<00:02:23.270> sheets<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.980> stack<00:02:26.250> them<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:26.520> top<00:02:26.760> of

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820

that's<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.350> center<00:03:05.090> then<00:03:06.090> you're<00:03:06.300> gonna<00:03:06.420> take

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
that's the center then you're gonna take

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.450 
that's the center then you're gonna take
one<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.200> your<00:03:07.350> pipe<00:03:07.560> cleaners<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:10.280> then<00:03:11.280> you

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
one of your pipe cleaners and then you

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.510 
one of your pipe cleaners and then you
can<00:03:11.610> actually<00:03:11.760> cut<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.240> in<00:03:12.420> half

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.920 

you<00:03:17.520> only<00:03:17.640> need<00:03:17.880> once<00:03:18.090> 1/2<00:03:18.810> for<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.930> just

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
you only need once 1/2 for it and just

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.840 
you only need once 1/2 for it and just
take<00:03:22.350> it

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
take it

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:30.740 
take it
wrap<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:24.090> around<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.920> center<00:03:26.450> one<00:03:27.450> time<00:03:29.750> okay

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
wrap it around the center one time okay

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.100 
wrap it around the center one time okay
so<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.170> should<00:03:31.320> look<00:03:31.350> like<00:03:31.470> that

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.240 

okay<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:37.030> then<00:03:37.240> next<00:03:38.050> step<00:03:38.260> you're<00:03:39.040> just

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
okay and then next step you're just

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:52.100 
okay and then next step you're just
gonna<00:03:39.400> cut<00:03:40.000> off<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.420> corners<00:03:40.840> on<00:03:41.050> an<00:03:41.170> angle

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.540 

so<00:03:52.650> now<00:03:52.830> it<00:03:52.980> should<00:03:53.010> look<00:03:53.310> like<00:03:53.340> this

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
so now it should look like this

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.700 
so now it should look like this
and<00:03:55.970> then<00:03:56.090> now<00:03:56.240> you<00:03:56.300> just<00:03:56.720> spread<00:03:56.990> out<00:03:57.020> each

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
and then now you just spread out each

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.160 
and then now you just spread out each
side<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.730> then<00:04:02.030> just<00:04:02.240> start<00:04:02.450> pulling<00:04:02.660> layer

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
side and then just start pulling layer

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:27.970 
side and then just start pulling layer
after<00:04:04.040> layer<00:04:04.310> up<00:04:04.790> alternating<00:04:05.540> sides<00:04:26.890> and<00:04:27.890> you

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
after layer up alternating sides and you

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.350 
after layer up alternating sides and you
just<00:04:28.160> pull<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.460> up<00:04:28.520> like<00:04:28.700> that<00:04:28.730> and<00:04:28.940> then<00:04:29.120> just

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
just pull it up like that and then just

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.950 
just pull it up like that and then just
keep<00:04:29.780> going<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:30.290> each<00:04:30.590> side<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.750> then<00:04:32.750> that

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
keep going to each side and then that

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.260 
keep going to each side and then that
should<00:04:33.230> give<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.680> flower<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:34.910> looks<00:04:34.940> like

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
should give you a flower that looks like

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.070 
should give you a flower that looks like
this<00:04:36.610> okay

we<00:04:50.069> should<00:04:50.280> be<00:04:50.310> able<00:04:50.520> to<00:04:50.639> put<00:04:50.849> them<00:04:50.940> together

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
we should be able to put them together

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.010 
we should be able to put them together
like<00:04:51.569> this<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.460> just<00:04:53.460> adjust<00:04:54.120> them<00:04:54.599> to<00:04:54.629> make

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
like this and just adjust them to make

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.320 
like this and just adjust them to make
it<00:04:55.169> like<00:04:55.620> sit<00:04:55.979> nicely<00:04:56.250> in<00:04:56.759> this<00:04:57.090> little

it like sit nicely in this little

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.219 
it like sit nicely in this little
triangle<00:04:57.539> kind<00:04:58.020> of<00:04:58.139> shape<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:59.509> then<00:05:00.509> you're

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
triangle kind of shape and then you're

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.170 
triangle kind of shape and then you're
going<00:05:01.319> to<00:05:01.440> take<00:05:01.620> like<00:05:01.770> a<00:05:01.830> little<00:05:02.039> little<00:05:03.000> piece

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
going to take like a little little piece

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.570 
going to take like a little little piece
of<00:05:03.419> pipe<00:05:03.900> cleaner<00:05:04.819> mm<00:05:05.819> 2<00:05:06.449> inches<00:05:06.750> max<00:05:07.050> and

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
of pipe cleaner mm 2 inches max and

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.339 
of pipe cleaner mm 2 inches max and
you'll<00:05:08.580> actually<00:05:08.789> end<00:05:09.360> up<00:05:09.750> with<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:09.960> bunch<00:05:10.169> of

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
you'll actually end up with a bunch of

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.409 
you'll actually end up with a bunch of
these<00:05:10.440> after<00:05:10.830> we're<00:05:11.490> done<00:05:11.639> we<00:05:11.819> trim<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.210> the

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
these after we're done we trim that the

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:13.909 
these after we're done we trim that the
edges<00:05:12.810> off<00:05:12.930> anyway<00:05:13.229> so<00:05:13.289> you<00:05:13.530> end<00:05:13.680> up<00:05:13.770> with<00:05:13.889> a

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
edges off anyway so you end up with a

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.339 
edges off anyway so you end up with a
bunch<00:05:14.069> of<00:05:14.159> these<00:05:14.219> anyway<00:05:14.520> so<00:05:15.389> now<00:05:15.960> you're<00:05:16.169> just

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
bunch of these anyway so now you're just

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.020 
bunch of these anyway so now you're just
going<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.560> want<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.830> take<00:05:17.009> this<00:05:17.219> and<00:05:17.460> wrap<00:05:17.819> it

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
going to want to take this and wrap it

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.770 
going to want to take this and wrap it
around<00:05:18.590> right<00:05:19.590> here<00:05:19.800> right<00:05:20.099> underneath<00:05:20.780> so

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
around right here right underneath so

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:41.120 
around right here right underneath so
they<00:05:21.900> stick<00:05:22.169> together

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.040 

so<00:05:41.640> make<00:05:41.790> sure<00:05:41.820> to<00:05:42.120> press<00:05:42.360> on<00:05:42.540> the<00:05:42.690> edges<00:05:43.020> of

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
so make sure to press on the edges of

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.110 
so make sure to press on the edges of
the<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:43.530> little<00:05:43.740> one<00:05:43.980> pretty<00:05:44.730> good<00:05:44.970> because

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
the the little one pretty good because

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.460 
the the little one pretty good because
the<00:05:45.390> end<00:05:45.540> of<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.720> pipe<00:05:45.900> cleaner<00:05:45.930> can<00:05:46.380> be

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
the end of the pipe cleaner can be

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.780 
the end of the pipe cleaner can be
pretty<00:05:46.740> sharp<00:05:47.010> so<00:05:47.280> we<00:05:47.400> want<00:05:47.580> to<00:05:47.640> make<00:05:47.760> sure

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
pretty sharp so we want to make sure

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.790 
pretty sharp so we want to make sure
that<00:05:48.060> it's<00:05:48.270> tucked<00:05:48.510> in<00:05:48.630> pretty<00:05:48.870> good<00:05:49.080> so<00:05:49.710> it

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
that it's tucked in pretty good so it

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.510 
that it's tucked in pretty good so it
doesn't<00:05:50.100> hurt<00:05:50.190> anybody<00:05:50.610> okay<00:05:51.530> so<00:05:52.530> now<00:05:52.800> it's

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
doesn't hurt anybody okay so now it's

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.970 
doesn't hurt anybody okay so now it's
standing<00:05:54.330> together<00:05:54.510> on<00:05:54.690> its<00:05:54.930> own<00:05:55.050> like<00:05:55.890> this

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980
