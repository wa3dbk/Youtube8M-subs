00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
oh I'm below the plane okay son you

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:21.110 
oh I'm below the plane okay son you
don't<00:02:04.840> lift<00:02:05.020> it<00:02:05.140> up

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.340 

we're<00:02:22.120> gonna<00:02:22.210> stretch<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:22.960> that<00:02:23.110> it's<00:02:23.230> the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
we're gonna stretch it so that it's the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
either move the object rotate the object

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.260 
either move the object rotate the object
scale<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:31.000> object<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:33.460> actually<00:02:33.790> do<00:02:34.090> not

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
scale the object and I actually do not

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.970 
scale the object and I actually do not
know<00:02:34.450> what<00:02:34.570> that<00:02:34.690> does<00:02:34.900> I've<00:02:35.350> never<00:02:35.710> used<00:02:35.860> it

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
know what that does I've never used it

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.310 
know what that does I've never used it
for<00:02:36.540> one<00:02:37.540> day<00:02:39.090> get<00:02:40.090> top<00:02:40.390> use<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.900> can<00:02:41.050> see<00:02:41.200> him

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
for one day get top use you can see him

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.900 
for one day get top use you can see him
from<00:02:41.350> stretching<00:02:41.890> movements<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:48.670> works

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
from stretching movements and that works

00:02:48.910 --> 00:03:07.370 
from stretching movements and that works
for<00:02:49.710> we're<00:02:50.710> going<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:59.370> okay<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:00.400> we<00:03:00.670> got<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:01.090> wall
