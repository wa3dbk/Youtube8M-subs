Western Conference Finals I think a lot

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.590 
Western Conference Finals I think a lot
of<00:00:32.130> teams<00:00:32.369> would<00:00:32.579> agree<00:00:32.820> with<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.120> right<00:00:33.329> so

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
of teams would agree with that right so

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.260 
of teams would agree with that right so
still<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> great<00:00:34.770> year<00:00:34.950> for<00:00:34.980> Montreal<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
still a great year for Montreal but the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.670 
still a great year for Montreal but the
thing<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.570> don't<00:00:36.630> like<00:00:36.780> about<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.170> series<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.649> I

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
thing I don't like about the series is I

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.260 
thing I don't like about the series is I
feel<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.190> there's<00:00:38.610> still<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> lot<00:00:39.090> between

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
feel like there's still a lot between

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.880 
feel like there's still a lot between
these<00:00:39.629> two<00:00:39.780> teams<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.320> when<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.469> say<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.860> I

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
these two teams and when I say that I

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.930 
these two teams and when I say that I

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
feel like they could have won if

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.119 
feel like they could have won if
so-and-so<00:00:48.450> didn't<00:00:49.289> happen<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:49.920> so-and-so

Tokarski<00:04:47.069> before<00:04:47.940> he<00:04:48.060> was<00:04:48.180> just<00:04:48.330> a<00:04:48.419> prospect

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
Tokarski before he was just a prospect

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.230 
Tokarski before he was just a prospect
now<00:04:49.050> I'd<00:04:49.650> imagine<00:04:50.220> tons<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.639> teams<00:04:50.819> would<00:04:51.030> want

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
now I'd imagine tons of teams would want

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.939 
now I'd imagine tons of teams would want
to<00:04:51.360> get<00:04:51.509> him<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:51.840> try<00:04:52.050> and<00:04:52.259> snag<00:04:52.530> him<00:04:52.710> up<00:04:52.800> as<00:04:52.919> a

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
to get him to try and snag him up as a

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.159 
to get him to try and snag him up as a
starting<00:04:53.490> goalie<00:04:53.669> of<00:04:53.789> the<00:04:53.909> future<00:04:54.270> right<00:04:54.479> I'd

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
starting goalie of the future right I'd

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.200 
starting goalie of the future right I'd
say<00:04:55.440> he's<00:04:55.620> more<00:04:55.650> valuable<00:04:56.190> than<00:04:56.430> James<00:04:56.759> rhymer

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
say he's more valuable than James rhymer

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.369 
say he's more valuable than James rhymer
and<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.389> was<00:04:57.479> thinking<00:04:57.599> James<00:04:57.930> Robert<00:04:58.289> could

00:04:58.369 --> 00:04:58.379 
and I was thinking James Robert could

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.529 
and I was thinking James Robert could
get<00:04:58.530> at<00:04:58.680> least<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:59.069> second<00:04:59.520> maybe<00:04:59.729> right<00:05:00.360> so

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
get at least the second maybe right so

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:01.969 
get at least the second maybe right so
Tokarski<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:01.229> mean<00:05:01.349> could<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:01.560> get<00:05:01.740> maybe<00:05:01.860> a

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
Tokarski I mean could you get maybe a

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.249 
Tokarski I mean could you get maybe a
first<00:05:02.250> for<00:05:02.520> Tokarski<00:05:02.819> or<00:05:03.180> do<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.050> want<00:05:04.169> to

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
first for Tokarski or do you want to

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:05.920 
first for Tokarski or do you want to
hold<00:05:04.349> on<00:05:04.530> to<00:05:04.740> him<00:05:04.860> for<00:05:05.039> one<00:05:05.159> more<00:05:05.340> year<00:05:05.400> as<00:05:05.789> a

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.939 
hold on to him for one more year as a
designated<00:05:06.930> backup<00:05:07.349> right<00:05:07.590> or<00:05:07.710> is<00:05:07.800> that<00:05:07.889> a

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
designated backup right or is that a

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.980 
designated backup right or is that a
