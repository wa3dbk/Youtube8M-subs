pouring as we go and then I'm going to

pouring as we go and then I'm going to
come<00:03:20.459> back<00:03:20.639> with<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.299> color<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:21.900> utes<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.709> one

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
come back with a color and utes is one

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.710 
come back with a color and utes is one
simple<00:03:23.370> way<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.639> coloring<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.329> can<00:03:24.480> simply

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
simple way of coloring it you can simply

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.710 
simple way of coloring it you can simply
broadcast<00:03:25.790> coloring<00:03:26.790> right<00:03:27.269> into<00:03:27.599> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
broadcast coloring right into the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.210 
broadcast coloring right into the
material<00:03:28.139> wet<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:30.379> then<00:03:31.379> what<00:03:31.590> we'll<00:03:31.739> do<00:03:31.950> is

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
material wet and then what we'll do is

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.319 
material wet and then what we'll do is
we'll<00:03:33.150> blend<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.659> color<00:03:34.730> with<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> roller<00:03:37.190> and

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
we'll blend the color with a roller and

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.470 
we'll blend the color with a roller and
this<00:03:39.329> gives<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.750> real<00:03:39.989> subtle<00:03:41.480> marbleized

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
this gives it a real subtle marbleized

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.860 
this gives it a real subtle marbleized
effect<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.199> it's<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.620> easy<00:03:44.389> to<00:03:45.389> get<00:03:45.599> some

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
effect and it's that easy to get some

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.680 
effect and it's that easy to get some
really<00:03:46.290> interesting<00:03:46.980> color<00:03:47.459> effects<00:03:47.910> now

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
really interesting color effects now

all<00:05:07.880> right<00:05:08.030> we<00:05:08.150> put<00:05:08.180> our<00:05:08.419> first<00:05:08.600> bucket<00:05:09.020> down<00:05:09.169> a

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
all right we put our first bucket down a

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.520 
all right we put our first bucket down a
couple<00:05:10.760> of<00:05:10.910> minutes<00:05:11.150> minutes<00:05:11.630> is<00:05:11.780> transpired

couple of minutes minutes is transpired

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.140 
couple of minutes minutes is transpired
probably<00:05:12.889> two<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.100> three<00:05:13.280> minutes<00:05:13.610> which<00:05:14.120> is

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
probably two to three minutes which is

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.640 
probably two to three minutes which is
actually<00:05:14.660> in<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:14.840> heat<00:05:15.020> it's<00:05:15.199> warm<00:05:15.470> in<00:05:15.620> here

this<00:05:17.330> warehouse<00:05:17.540> and<00:05:18.729> normally<00:05:19.729> I<00:05:19.760> would<00:05:20.000> have

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
this warehouse and normally I would have

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.360 
this warehouse and normally I would have
trialed<00:05:20.510> it<00:05:20.600> by<00:05:20.750> now<00:05:20.900> like<00:05:21.470> I<00:05:21.620> said<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.979> longer

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
trialed it by now like I said the longer

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.490 
trialed it by now like I said the longer
you<00:05:22.520> wait<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:26.720> less<00:05:26.960> it's<00:05:27.169> going<00:05:27.229> to

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
you wait the the less it's going to

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.770 
you wait the the less it's going to
level<00:05:27.830> out<00:05:27.979> so<00:05:28.280> you<00:05:28.340> want<00:05:28.699> to<00:05:28.880> virtually<00:05:29.479> trial

level out so you want to virtually trial

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.909 
level out so you want to virtually trial
it<00:05:29.900> as<00:05:29.990> quick<00:05:30.260> as<00:05:30.410> you<00:05:30.500> can

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
trials I'm using a nice 20 inch trial a

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.730 
trials I'm using a nice 20 inch trial a
lot<00:05:35.479> of<00:05:35.600> people<00:05:35.810> would<00:05:35.930> say<00:05:36.050> let's<00:05:36.320> use<00:05:36.380> a<00:05:36.530> pool

lot of people would say let's use a pool

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.159 
lot of people would say let's use a pool
trial<00:05:37.130> because<00:05:37.850> it's<00:05:38.000> easier<00:05:38.419> actually<00:05:38.870> I

I mean is in normal conditions I'll come

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.740 
I mean is in normal conditions I'll come
back<00:06:05.180> and<00:06:05.479> I'll<00:06:06.200> hit<00:06:06.470> this<00:06:06.680> a<00:06:06.710> second<00:06:07.250> time

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
back and I'll hit this a second time

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.790 
back and I'll hit this a second time

doled out meaning there's no damp or
moist<00:06:31.279> spots<00:06:31.639> so<00:06:32.210> I'm<00:06:32.330> going<00:06:32.479> to<00:06:32.509> go<00:06:32.599> ahead<00:06:32.719> and

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
moist spots so I'm going to go ahead and

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.279 
moist spots so I'm going to go ahead and
proceed<00:06:33.319> with<00:06:33.559> my<00:06:33.830> second<00:06:34.249> troweling<00:06:35.289> step

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
proceed with my second troweling step

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.469 
proceed with my second troweling step
gingerly<00:06:36.800> you<00:06:37.069> don't<00:06:37.249> want<00:06:37.460> to<00:06:37.580> step<00:06:37.819> with

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
gingerly you don't want to step with

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:42.010 
gingerly you don't want to step with
with<00:06:39.169> your<00:06:39.319> weight<00:06:39.589> distributed<00:06:40.689> evenly<00:06:41.689> or

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
with your weight distributed evenly or

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.869 
with your weight distributed evenly or
right<00:06:42.319> over<00:06:42.349> the<00:06:42.589> boards<00:06:42.949> I<00:06:43.099> have<00:06:43.309> seen<00:06:43.580> people

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:43.879 
right over the boards I have seen people

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:45.820 
right over the boards I have seen people
step<00:06:44.509> out<00:06:44.689> and<00:06:44.900> see<00:06:45.050> the<00:06:45.169> board<00:06:45.379> just<00:06:45.469> go

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
step out and see the board just go

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.529 
step out and see the board just go
scraping<00:06:46.219> right<00:06:46.490> across<00:06:46.699> and<00:06:46.819> they<00:06:47.150> end<00:06:47.300> up<00:06:47.419> on

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:47.539 
scraping right across and they end up on

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:49.179 
scraping right across and they end up on
their<00:06:47.689> tail<00:06:47.930> so<00:06:48.409> you<00:06:48.469> got<00:06:48.559> to<00:06:48.680> be<00:06:48.740> careful<00:06:49.099> when

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:49.189 
their tail so you got to be careful when

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:50.920 
their tail so you got to be careful when
you're<00:06:49.279> stepping<00:06:49.490> on<00:06:49.699> these<00:06:49.849> boards<00:06:50.120> so

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
you're stepping on these boards so

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.839 
you're stepping on these boards so
remember<00:06:51.469> my<00:06:51.770> first<00:06:52.009> pass<00:06:52.249> I<00:06:52.460> went<00:06:52.639> this

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:52.849 
remember my first pass I went this

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:54.760 
remember my first pass I went this
direction<00:06:53.029> so<00:06:53.719> now<00:06:53.870> I'm<00:06:53.990> going<00:06:54.110> to<00:06:54.199> see<00:06:54.620> if<00:06:54.680> I

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
direction so now I'm going to see if I

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.670 
direction so now I'm going to see if I
can't<00:06:55.009> cross<00:06:55.339> it<00:06:55.400> and<00:06:55.819> this<00:06:56.749> is<00:06:56.960> perfect<00:06:57.469> this

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
can't cross it and this is perfect this

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.209 
can't cross it and this is perfect this
is<00:06:58.189> where<00:06:58.370> you<00:06:58.460> really<00:06:58.729> get<00:06:59.060> this<00:06:59.180> beautiful

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:00.219 
is where you really get this beautiful

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:03.670 
is where you really get this beautiful
burnished<00:07:01.219> appearance<00:07:02.050> there's<00:07:03.050> just<00:07:03.379> enough

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
burnished appearance there's just enough

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.279 
burnished appearance there's just enough
surface<00:07:04.009> moisture<00:07:04.669> as<00:07:04.879> you<00:07:05.300> can<00:07:05.479> see<00:07:05.749> to

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:06.289 
surface moisture as you can see to

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:09.459 
surface moisture as you can see to
really<00:07:06.860> blend<00:07:07.729> the<00:07:07.909> color<00:07:08.150> now<00:07:08.749> obviously<00:07:09.349> on

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
really blend the color now obviously on

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.379 
really blend the color now obviously on
a<00:07:09.529> much<00:07:09.740> larger<00:07:09.949> job<00:07:10.400> you<00:07:11.180> would<00:07:11.300> have

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.389 
a much larger job you would have

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.029 
a much larger job you would have
probably<00:07:11.689> got<00:07:11.810> on<00:07:11.839> it<00:07:12.050> just<00:07:12.229> a<00:07:12.319> bit<00:07:12.499> sooner<00:07:12.889> and

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 
probably got on it just a bit sooner and

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:15.309 
probably got on it just a bit sooner and
certainly<00:07:13.819> you<00:07:13.999> would<00:07:14.120> have<00:07:14.210> had<00:07:14.360> enough<00:07:15.020> help

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 
certainly you would have had enough help

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:17.980 
certainly you would have had enough help
to<00:07:15.649> help<00:07:16.460> out<00:07:16.759> trial<00:07:17.089> on<00:07:17.240> this<00:07:17.360> second<00:07:17.749> trial

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 
to help out trial on this second trial

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.439 
to help out trial on this second trial
but<00:07:18.529> this<00:07:18.740> type<00:07:18.979> of<00:07:19.009> trial<00:07:19.460> in<00:07:19.610> here<00:07:19.879> is<00:07:20.029> what

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:20.449 
but this type of trial in here is what

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:22.839 
but this type of trial in here is what
really<00:07:20.870> takes<00:07:21.469> it<00:07:21.680> over<00:07:21.740> the<00:07:21.860> top<00:07:21.949> and<00:07:22.399> you'll

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:22.849 
really takes it over the top and you'll

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:24.670 
really takes it over the top and you'll
actually<00:07:23.089> see<00:07:23.479> a<00:07:23.509> shine<00:07:23.870> I'll<00:07:24.199> be<00:07:24.469> able<00:07:24.559> to

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
actually see a shine I'll be able to

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:31.100 
actually see a shine I'll be able to
polish<00:07:24.949> this<00:07:25.279> out

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.110 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.170
