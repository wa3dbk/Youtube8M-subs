00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
book is formatted actually can have a

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.689

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
first I want to talk about the actual

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.349 
first I want to talk about the actual
casing<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.310> book<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.880> constant

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
casing of a book and the constant

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.839 
casing of a book and the constant
struggle<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:27.900> between<00:00:28.890> hard<00:00:29.189> covers<00:00:29.640> and

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
struggle we have between hard covers and

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.209 
struggle we have between hard covers and
soft<00:00:30.570> covers<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.439> feel<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> biggest

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
soft covers I feel like the biggest

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.400 
soft covers I feel like the biggest
advantage<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.090> hard<00:00:33.360> covers<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
advantage that hard covers have is that

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.500 
advantage that hard covers have is that
they're<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.800> durable<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.730> got<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.300> book

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.040 
secondhand and it's still in great
condition<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.879> think<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.239> gonna<00:00:39.390> last<00:00:39.690> in

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
condition and I think it's gonna last in

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.979 
condition and I think it's gonna last in
great<00:00:40.260> condition<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:41.700> long<00:00:41.879> time

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
great condition for a really long time

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.080

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090

whereas a paperback I just don't feel it
you<00:00:45.450> know<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.870> thing<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.170> don't<00:00:46.260> like

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
about hard covers though is that they're

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
about hard covers though is that they're
kind<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.690> unforgiving<00:00:49.590> when<00:00:49.739> you're<00:00:49.890> reading

to me and it kind of felt a bit gimmicky

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
and weird okay so we've talked about the

casing and we've talked about the pages
but<00:03:28.930> now<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.380> want<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:29.890> talk<00:03:30.070> about<00:03:30.190> what<00:03:30.459> can

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
but now I want to talk about what can

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.819 
but now I want to talk about what can
usually<00:03:30.910> be<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.600> biggest<00:03:32.019> problem<00:03:32.620> for<00:03:32.769> me

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
usually be the biggest problem for me

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.600 
usually be the biggest problem for me
and<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.120> font<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:35.200> font<00:03:35.230> isn't<00:03:35.950> just

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
and that is the font the font isn't just

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.880 
and that is the font the font isn't just
detrimental<00:03:37.420> sometimes<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.290> think<00:03:38.410> we've<00:03:38.650> all

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
detrimental sometimes I think we've all

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.500 
detrimental sometimes I think we've all
had<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.190> experience<00:03:39.700> where<00:03:40.030> you're<00:03:40.150> reading

a book you open it to the first page and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.000 
a book you open it to the first page and
you<00:03:42.730> think<00:03:43.000> oh<00:03:43.209> dear<00:03:43.540> God<00:03:43.840> I'm<00:03:44.140> blind<00:03:44.560> because

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.620 
the font that they chose is so tiny it

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
also really happened to me where I look

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.770 
also really happened to me where I look
at<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:03.970> page<00:04:04.239> I'm<00:04:04.540> like<00:04:04.720> oh<00:04:04.900> my<00:04:05.260> god<00:04:06.000> do<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.090> know

at a page I'm like oh my god do you know

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.770 
at a page I'm like oh my god do you know
double-space<00:04:08.470> is<00:04:08.890> why<00:04:09.520> are<00:04:09.580> these<00:04:09.940> words<00:04:10.330> so

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
double-space is why are these words so

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.200 
double-space is why are these words so
crowded<00:04:11.290> together<00:04:12.010> now<00:04:12.430> there<00:04:12.700> are<00:04:12.850> solutions

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
crowded together now there are solutions

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.060 
crowded together now there are solutions
to<00:04:13.570> this<00:04:13.720> problem<00:04:14.170> I<00:04:14.290> know<00:04:14.380> that<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.680> lot<00:04:14.800> of

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
to this problem I know that a lot of

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.520 
to this problem I know that a lot of
classics<00:04:15.760> are<00:04:15.910> printed<00:04:16.299> really<00:04:16.690> terribly<00:04:17.170> and

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
classics are printed really terribly and

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.870 
classics are printed really terribly and
I<00:04:17.769> think<00:04:18.010> that's<00:04:18.160> because<00:04:18.340> since<00:04:18.700> they're<00:04:18.850> in

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
I think that's because since they're in

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.670 
I think that's because since they're in
the<00:04:19.060> public<00:04:19.359> domain<00:04:19.510> anyone<00:04:20.140> can<00:04:20.290> print<00:04:20.470> them

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
the public domain anyone can print them

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.020 
the public domain anyone can print them
and<00:04:20.769> they<00:04:20.859> want<00:04:21.040> to<00:04:21.070> print<00:04:21.280> them<00:04:21.400> cheaply<00:04:21.790> so

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
and they want to print them cheaply so

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.240 
and they want to print them cheaply so
they<00:04:22.120> kind<00:04:22.360> of<00:04:22.450> cop<00:04:22.720> out<00:04:22.990> on<00:04:23.260> printing<00:04:24.010> them

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
they kind of cop out on printing them

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.400 
they kind of cop out on printing them
nicely<00:04:24.820> but<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.510> does<00:04:25.780> mean<00:04:25.810> that<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.290> have

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
nicely but that does mean that you have

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.200 
nicely but that does mean that you have
a<00:04:26.440> huge<00:04:26.830> selection<00:04:27.130> make<00:04:27.670> sure<00:04:27.820> that<00:04:27.940> you<00:04:28.060> look

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
a huge selection make sure that you look

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.790 
a huge selection make sure that you look
at<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.390> couple<00:04:28.630> of<00:04:28.900> stores<00:04:29.230> because<00:04:29.500> you<00:04:29.620> can

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
at a couple of stores because you can

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.880 
at a couple of stores because you can
usually<00:04:30.070> find<00:04:30.700> quite<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.150> few<00:04:31.240> versions

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
usually find quite a few versions

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.470 
usually find quite a few versions
another<00:04:32.890> solution<00:04:33.460> that<00:04:33.610> I<00:04:33.640> know<00:04:33.730> people<00:04:34.150> use

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
another solution that I know people use

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.810 
another solution that I know people use
is<00:04:34.720> downloading<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.590> book<00:04:35.740> on<00:04:35.950> their<00:04:36.130> iPad<00:04:36.580> or

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
is downloading the book on their iPad or

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.970 
is downloading the book on their iPad or
their<00:04:36.970> on<00:04:37.150> their<00:04:37.300> eBook<00:04:37.780> because<00:04:38.410> there<00:04:38.710> you

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
their on their eBook because there you

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.920 
their on their eBook because there you
can<00:04:39.190> completely<00:04:39.700> just<00:04:40.030> change<00:04:40.300> everything

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
can completely just change everything

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.020 
can completely just change everything
but<00:04:41.200> let's<00:04:41.680> say<00:04:41.890> you<00:04:41.950> found<00:04:42.400> your<00:04:42.790> perfect

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
but let's say you found your perfect

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.780 
but let's say you found your perfect
book<00:04:43.570> would<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:43.960> want<00:04:44.500> all<00:04:44.830> books<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.669> be
