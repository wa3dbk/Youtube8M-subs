00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 the component marked on the plate as 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.799
 pf 1 that in the body has one and is a 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.870
 3 a smd fuse in some cases 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.509
 has a 3 instead of the iv and some 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.250
 I've seen it with a different letter 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.960
 this is the fuse that opens when 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.660
 there are problems with the connection of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.880
 charger or you connect an incorrect one if 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.859
 you can not get it you can bridge it but 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.900
 with a calibrated wire extracted from a 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.750
 fuse of common glass that is 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.119
 of the same amperage 3a because if you put 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.130
 any wire or a diode as I have 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.930
 seen that they place the protection that 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.239
 provides the fuse is completely 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.100
 canceled and the next time there is a 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.649
 similar problem is going to damage some 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.110
 another component or more than one on the plate 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.020
 mother making it more difficult and even 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.090
 impossible times its repair and also 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.890
 you must be careful when welding what the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.079
 part of the wire that will remain in the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.360
 air is not contaminated with the tin of the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.550
 welding since this would increase your 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.620
 section causing it to also increase its 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.079
 breaking current with the consequent 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.270
 loss of protection goes to any 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.060
 electronics house and buy fuses 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.870
 3 glass come in 20 millimeters and 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.400
 32 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.010
 meters long you can buy 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.590
 you're going to disarm the whole 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.420
 32 millimeters are easier to 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.220
 disarm only because they are more 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.380
 large but those of 20 millimeters 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.660
 they can also serve you for some 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.910
 charger or source so you can buy 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.830
 a few of those and you have left for 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.780
 welding is easy to weld what 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.660
 directly on the ends of the fuse 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.760
 broken if you already got it out you're going to have to 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.890
 solder it directly to the plate with 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.260
 very little tin and trying to be what 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.200
 neat as possible is a matter of skill 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.940
 and practice is important as I said before 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.710
 that the bit of wire that goes to 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.020
 be between the welds is not 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.450
 contaminate with tin because it would lose 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.970
 fuse properties so if you 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.250
 You pass with tin better take it out short 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.350
 another bit and start again until 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.510
 that you hold his hand after passing him 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.640
 a toothbrush or similar with a 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.620
 little bit of fine alcohol to clean the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.140
 resin that spreads on the plate 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.300
 and ready and cut the excess wire 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.310
 well flush with the weld leave it there 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.220
 It can be dangerous when you put the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.350
 step cap you have a fuse for some 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.350
 3 more netbooks at least 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.230
 our netbook will be carrying many 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.420
