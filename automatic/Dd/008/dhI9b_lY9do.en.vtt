00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the right ones and you can pretty much

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.660 
the right ones and you can pretty much
do<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:25.170> by<00:00:25.650> looking<00:00:26.070> at<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.310> way<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
do that a by looking at the way the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.929 
do that a by looking at the way the
threads<00:00:27.269> are<00:00:27.449> wound<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.990> top<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.820> in<00:00:29.820> this

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
threads are wound on top and in this

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.700 
threads are wound on top and in this
case<00:00:30.210> these<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.570> opposite<00:00:31.050> stems<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
case these are opposite stems but the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.979 
case these are opposite stems but the
easy<00:00:31.890> way<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.189> tell<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.630> look<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.960> my

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
easy way to tell is if you look in my

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.330 
easy way to tell is if you look in my
left<00:00:34.290> hand<00:00:34.530> you're<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.920> see<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> little

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
left hand you're going to see a little

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.119 
left hand you're going to see a little
line<00:00:35.820> around<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.540> bottom<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:36.960> stem<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:37.649> and

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
line around the bottom and stem here and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.819 
line around the bottom and stem here and
on<00:00:38.640> my<00:00:38.879> hot<00:00:39.329> side<00:00:39.629> here<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.170> very<00:00:40.379> smooth

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
on my hot side here this is very smooth

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.770 
on my hot side here this is very smooth
and<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.520> manufacturers<00:00:42.210> put<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.570> little

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
and the manufacturers put that little

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.299 
and the manufacturers put that little
marking<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.800> differentiate

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
marking there so you can differentiate

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.630 
marking there so you can differentiate
between<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.149> cold<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> hot<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.770> quickly

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
between the cold and the hot so quickly

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.479 
between the cold and the hot so quickly
at<00:00:48.360> quick<00:00:48.750> glance<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.469> tell<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
at quick glance you can tell this is the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.880 
at quick glance you can tell this is the
cold<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> hot<00:00:51.420> or<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.620> look<00:00:52.800> at

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
cold this is the hot or you can look at

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.250 
cold this is the hot or you can look at
the<00:00:52.980> way<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> threads<00:00:53.550> are<00:00:53.699> wound<00:00:53.989> now<00:00:54.989> in

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the way the threads are wound now in

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.020 
the way the threads are wound now in
either<00:00:55.620> case<00:00:55.980> you're<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.820> make

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
either case you're going to have to make

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.420 
either case you're going to have to make
sure<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.930> pick<00:00:58.170> up<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.500> ones<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.280> you're

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
sure you pick up the ones that you're

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.000 
sure you pick up the ones that you're
looking<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.850> from<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.120> supply<00:01:00.449> house<00:01:00.660> and

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
looking for from the supply house and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.139 
looking for from the supply house and
generally<00:01:02.010> across<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> board<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.879> don't<00:01:02.910> care

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
generally across the board I don't care

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.820 
generally across the board I don't care
who<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> manufacturer<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.080> but<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.589> have

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
who the manufacturer is but if you have

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.170 
who the manufacturer is but if you have
straight<00:01:05.189> handles<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:05.909> lever<00:01:06.869> type<00:01:07.200> handles

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
straight handles or lever type handles

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.030 
straight handles or lever type handles
they<00:01:09.180> take<00:01:09.510> opposite<00:01:10.170> stems<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.740> you're<00:01:10.890> going

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
they take opposite stems so you're going

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.490 
they take opposite stems so you're going
to<00:01:11.100> need<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.460> cold<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.119> hot<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.320> other

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
to need a cold and a hot on the other

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.760 
to need a cold and a hot on the other
hand<00:01:14.299> if<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> faucet<00:01:16.110> with<00:01:16.409> round

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
hand if you have a faucet with round

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.580 
hand if you have a faucet with round
handles<00:01:17.390> they<00:01:18.390> are<00:01:18.570> actually<00:01:18.990> going<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> take

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
handles they are actually going to take

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.350 
handles they are actually going to take
the<00:01:19.770> same<00:01:20.040> stem<00:01:20.400> meaning<00:01:20.909> they're<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the same stem meaning they're going to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.530 
the same stem meaning they're going to
take<00:01:21.570> two<00:01:21.840> hots<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.409> instead<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.009> cold<00:01:23.540> you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
take two hots so instead of a cold you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.980 
take two hots so instead of a cold you
would<00:01:24.689> actually<00:01:25.670> use<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.970> hot<00:01:27.420> two<00:01:27.720> hots

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
would actually use a hot two hots

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.999 
would actually use a hot two hots
because<00:01:28.650> they<00:01:28.770> got<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.009> open<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> left<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
because they got to open to the left and

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.060 
because they got to open to the left and
they<00:01:32.009> get<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> close<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.650> open<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
they get a close to the right open to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.100 
they get a close to the right open to
the<00:01:35.189> left<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.640> close<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> right<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.659> the

other hand if you have a lever type

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.609 
other hand if you have a lever type
handle<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:41.640> are<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.090> pull<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.720> handles
