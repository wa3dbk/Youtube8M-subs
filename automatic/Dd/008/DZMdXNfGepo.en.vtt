00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
I think the sixth I think the 60 or 65

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.539 
I think the sixth I think the 60 or 65
was<00:01:56.840> just<00:01:57.049> one<00:01:57.200> class<00:01:57.439> but<00:01:57.920> again<00:01:58.040> that<00:01:58.310> just

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
was just one class but again that just

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.070 
was just one class but again that just
kind<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:58.850> mean<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.090> promoter<00:01:59.420> has<00:01:59.600> an<00:01:59.750> option

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
kind I mean the promoter has an option

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.469 
kind I mean the promoter has an option
there<00:02:00.229> it<00:02:00.439> just<00:02:00.799> happens<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.400> see<00:02:01.549> what<00:02:01.850> is<00:02:02.090> you
