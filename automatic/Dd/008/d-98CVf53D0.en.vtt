and<00:00:02.280> this<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.760> part<00:00:03.030> 2<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.659> my<00:00:04.230> triptych<00:00:04.740> around

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
and this is part 2 a my triptych around

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.890 
and this is part 2 a my triptych around
Jupiter<00:00:05.490> this<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.210> about<00:00:06.390> Jupiter<00:00:08.780> Jupiter<00:00:09.780> as

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
Jupiter this is about Jupiter Jupiter as

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.580 
Jupiter this is about Jupiter Jupiter as
in<00:00:10.080> Jove<00:00:10.410> joviality<00:00:11.809> Jupiter<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.049> neutral

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
in Jove joviality Jupiter in a neutral

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.670 
in Jove joviality Jupiter in a neutral
state<00:00:14.509> and<00:00:15.509> perhaps<00:00:15.750> what<00:00:16.049> I'll<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.350> with<00:00:16.529> this

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
state and perhaps what I'll do with this

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.320 
state and perhaps what I'll do with this
is<00:00:16.920> do<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> run-through<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.730> what<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:18.150> each<00:00:18.300> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
is do a run-through of what if each of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.980 
is do a run-through of what if each of
the<00:00:19.400> signs<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> bit<00:00:21.029> weird<00:00:21.300> because<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.840> see

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the signs is a bit weird because you see

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.509 
the signs is a bit weird because you see
Jupiter<00:00:22.230> has<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> twelve<00:00:23.039> year<00:00:23.310> orbit

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
Jupiter has a twelve year orbit

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.929 
Jupiter has a twelve year orbit
Jupiter's<00:00:24.150> orbit<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.869> eleven<00:00:25.500> point<00:00:25.769> nine<00:00:26.070> one

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
Jupiter's orbit is eleven point nine one

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.480 
Jupiter's orbit is eleven point nine one
years<00:00:27.420> something<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.080> that

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
years something like that

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.800 
years something like that
it's<00:00:29.880> something<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.330> 11<00:00:30.539> years<00:00:30.630> 11

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
it's something like in 11 years 11

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.549 
it's something like in 11 years 11
months<00:00:31.790> basically<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.120> 12<00:00:33.420> years<00:00:33.630> which<00:00:34.410> is

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
months basically is 12 years which is

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
months basically is 12 years which is
why<00:00:34.710> twelve<00:00:35.070> year<00:00:35.280> cycles<00:00:35.880> feature<00:00:36.180> so

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
why twelve year cycles feature so

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.350 
why twelve year cycles feature so
commonly<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.170> people's<00:00:37.590> lives<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.940> each

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
commonly in people's lives it is in each

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.760 
commonly in people's lives it is in each
sign<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.050> zodiac<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.710> average<00:00:42.290> 12<00:00:43.290> months

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
sign of a zodiac on average 12 months

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.729 
sign of a zodiac on average 12 months
per<00:00:44.550> every<00:00:44.820> 12<00:00:45.090> years<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:46.020> at<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.379> year<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
per every 12 years one at one year at a

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.400 
per every 12 years one at one year at a
time<00:00:47.390> sometimes<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.780> goes<00:00:48.899> through<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> sign

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
time sometimes it goes through a sign

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.139 
time sometimes it goes through a sign
really<00:00:49.620> fast<00:00:49.950> I've<00:00:50.190> seen<00:00:50.399> Jupiter<00:00:50.610> travel

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
really fast I've seen Jupiter travel

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.760 
really fast I've seen Jupiter travel
through<00:00:51.329> certain<00:00:51.719> signs<00:00:51.960> really<00:00:52.350> fast<00:00:52.590> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
through certain signs really fast and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.279 
through certain signs really fast and
and<00:00:52.920> linger<00:00:53.520> 18<00:00:53.879> 20<00:00:54.329> months<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.809> other<00:00:54.960> signs

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and linger 18 20 months in other signs

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.529 
and linger 18 20 months in other signs
but<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.039> average<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.550> 12<00:00:56.850> months<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.300> year

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
but on average it's 12 months one year

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.819 
but on average it's 12 months one year
on<00:00:57.660> each<00:00:57.750> sign<00:01:00.260> because<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> their<00:01:01.500> stupid

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
on each sign because of their stupid

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.229 
on each sign because of their stupid
tour<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.070> each<00:01:02.160> size<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> bit<00:01:02.730> difficult<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
tour in each size a bit difficult to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.950 
tour in each size a bit difficult to
define<00:01:04.010> but<00:01:05.010> Jupiter<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.240> houses<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
define but Jupiter in the houses is a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.219 
define but Jupiter in the houses is a
lot<00:01:07.170> easier<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.710> perhaps<00:01:08.040> I'll<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
lot easier so perhaps I'll do that and

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.140 
lot easier so perhaps I'll do that and
Jupiter<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.470> neutral<00:01:10.920> level<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.729> brings

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
Jupiter at the neutral level it brings

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.580 
Jupiter at the neutral level it brings
the<00:01:12.330> opportunity<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:13.229> growth<00:01:13.290> for

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the opportunity for growth for

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.710 
the opportunity for growth for
development<00:01:15.740> when<00:01:16.740> young<00:01:17.330> Jupiter<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.479> very

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
development when young Jupiter is very

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780 
development when young Jupiter is very
difficult<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.439> manage<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.100> neutral<00:01:20.400> level

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
difficult to manage at a neutral level

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.060 
difficult to manage at a neutral level
because<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.479> either<00:01:21.860> very<00:01:22.860> large

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
because it is either very large

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.980 
because it is either very large
over-the-top<00:01:23.790> large<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.299> life<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:24.780> very

over-the-top large of a life or very

order em Jupiter becomes very much the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.810 
order em Jupiter becomes very much the
planet<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.090> wisdom<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.780> at<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.229> neutral<00:02:01.680> level

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
planet of wisdom so at the neutral level

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.429 
planet of wisdom so at the neutral level
Jupiter<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.969> basically<00:02:03.509> where<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.259> make

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
Jupiter is basically where you can make

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.330 
Jupiter is basically where you can make
opportunities<00:02:05.189> for<00:02:05.490> yourself<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.810> also

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
opportunities for yourself but it's also

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.770 
opportunities for yourself but it's also
it's<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.550> area<00:02:08.729> where<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.450> moderate

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
it's the area where you have to moderate

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.570 
it's the area where you have to moderate
yourself<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.619> where<00:02:10.800> Jupiter<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
yourself it's where Jupiter is the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.500 
yourself it's where Jupiter is the
opposite<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.030> south

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
