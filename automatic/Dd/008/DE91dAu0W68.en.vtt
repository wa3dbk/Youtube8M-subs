00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the quality is fine then I'll just stick

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.009 
the quality is fine then I'll just stick
it<00:00:26.580> like<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> world

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
it like this just in this on the world

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.939 
it like this just in this on the world
map<00:00:28.230> it's<00:00:28.439> like<00:00:28.970> but<00:00:30.140> overall<00:00:31.140> like<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
map it's like but overall like in the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.010 
map it's like but overall like in the
battling<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.550> whatnot<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:32.910> okay<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.660> mean

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
battling and whatnot it's okay I mean

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.260 
battling and whatnot it's okay I mean
and<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> text<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.520> kind<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.969> choppy

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
and but the text is like kind of choppy

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.930 
and but the text is like kind of choppy
so<00:00:36.899> if<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.250> other<00:00:38.340> way<00:00:38.489> maybe

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
so if you like it the other way maybe

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.490
