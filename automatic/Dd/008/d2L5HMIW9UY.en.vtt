 computing 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.010
 percent 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.300
 m scientists 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.289
 it was thought to be the basis of everything 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.909
 what are you 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.459
 and now the Jews trim would be unnoticed 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.659
 language and now results because all 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.999
 rewrote all remade sources 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.229
 no one is interested in the source 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:23.170
 and all 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.170
 we took eppel alter all 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.069
 don't use it 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.589
 qicin 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.730
 according to nature 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.899
 but this prepare people don't care 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:36.129
 because they 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.059
 baptism will come to the disclosure of one 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:39.609
 only higher power 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.609
 there is nothing in the world 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.629
 will come gradually and when they see that 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.339
 what is written in the techniques 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:47.729
 in original 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:49.389
 this is 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:50.949
 uah 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.959
 with their guidebook 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.699
 instructions 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.659
 to reveal the upper world 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.659
 how to enter it 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.829
 for now use it 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.999
 but something I, too 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.999
 it seems ways for themselves 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:11.569
 with such interpretations 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.569
 heaped 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:16.999
 took of course 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:18.979
 many words and swat 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.669
 hallelujah almeida there all these here 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.439
 elements which prayers 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.249
 used took all the psalms of david 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.159
 Of course, how can you be without them 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.439
 and sing them on the planks took orders and all 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.819
 this 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.089
 m story 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:39.119
 out of Egypt and in general all these 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.189
 mayor hiking and there 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.349
 he fell in the desert 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.770
 it's like, if not the bible 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.160
 man did not have all these cultures which 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.949
 today there is 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.949
 it's all based on those close 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.109
 legends 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.680
 further from May or third eye 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.159
 look at these pictures 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.849
 where does all the plots all look l 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:07.940
 tenge clean and stuff 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:08.930
 everything goes 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.709
 so from there 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.839
 Riga 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.839
 sure that there are 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.930
 divide teaches first child 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.449
 ruin stuffed it is that it remains to portray 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.449
 hearth animals 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.020
 I what exactly what came today 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.990
 where are you here a few hundred years ago 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.479
 beginning to end 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.860
 is ending 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.050
 all this 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.969
 an era 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.360
 spiritual pseudo spiritual but 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.360
 bible based 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.360
 anyway but all this is a technique 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.840
 number low culture with all these 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.300
 patient affairs 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.360
 today we are already at all 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.360
 somewhere else we are 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:02.270
 but it's good it's as usual 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.800
 exit required 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.800
 in order to enter the basis 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:09.839
 but the culture is true 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:11.459
 in human dorm
