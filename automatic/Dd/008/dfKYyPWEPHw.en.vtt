00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 a student is working overtime and that 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.919
 quite voluntarily because of this 15 year old 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.730
 is about big about alternative 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.990
 Energy and its consistent use 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.219
 Raphael Vollmer works on one 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.049
 school building that almost 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.850
 only with electricity and heat 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.039
 own production 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.689
 the environmentally conscious architect 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.779
 takes into account all 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.029
 alternative energy uses one 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.310
 its sources of energy is the should 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.439
 solar system made of photovoltaic panels 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.920
 is caused by a tendency of the south dax 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.930
 40 degrees ideal 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.030
 raffael's very own invention awning 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.910
 and shutters equipped with 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.950
 solar cells, the sun is shining 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.280
 Sunscreen automatically turns off and on 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.170
 to the sun catcher how does that work in 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.690
 his design plans have rafael 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.610
 everything exactly outlines those from the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.949
 photovoltaic panels related energy 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.989
 is first in gas and then 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.989
 converted from a motor into electricity 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.549
 some of you are always happy 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.840
 and energy reserves are going to end've 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.119
 I think even now anything 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.250
 let me be so strong 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.070
 on my children's grandson or something like that 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.180
 the group then meet somehow 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.060
 almost nothing left 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.860
 then heat or something and another 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.640
 natural phenomenon is added to raphael 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.140
 his energy concept to use his 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.869
 Plans foresee that the rainwater 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.970
 passed over a trough to four towers 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.310
 in which are located one above the other 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.930
 screwed pipes with sand and gravel 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.730
 are filled 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.820
 through these layers ensures that 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.410
 rainwater and is thereby cleaned the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.270
 Water from the four towers flows in 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.700
 a cistern in the basement of the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.740
 school together 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.150
 from here should the sanitary 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.150
 be supplied 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.890
 a thoughtful concept 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.050
 rafael has recalculated how expensive the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.920
 construction of such a school would 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.989
 Cost point school is still closed 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.090
 a development research continues 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.550
 then can the fuel cell and 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.660
 everything else would be less and petroleum 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.340
 price will be strong at will 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.709
 but probably still govern now 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.150
 Not 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.519
 and one more question has rafael 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.950
 Dedicated in detail what to do with the 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.140
 wastewater from the school will happen 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.819
 15-year-old's response to the sewage 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.280
 is collected in a pipe and closed 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.739
 a biogas plant outside the place 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.530
 There it will be removed from the sewage sludge 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.340
 a gas in turn generates electricity 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.340
 is converted 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.440
 but there is a little problem 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.330
 chemicals in the toilets 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.220
 cleaning may not be used 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.640
 get into the biogas plant 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.500
 raphaela but an answer 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.600
 The toilets of the school are allowed only to 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.220
 be cleaned and a certain time 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.410
 At this time, the wastewater 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.150
 just in the general sewer 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.220
 directed 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.500
 an alternative energy concept for one 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.010
 whole school building created by one 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.140
 student 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.459
 Well, if that's not a reason, be proud 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.459
 to be on the youth of today
