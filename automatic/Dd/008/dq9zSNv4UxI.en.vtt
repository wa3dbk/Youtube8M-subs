00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 or the people caught on in my name is the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.790
 immense concept that we are in 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.460
 the month of love we are going to make a video 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.160
 about love but love when not 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.309
 it works and in this list we will have five 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.900
 next sweethearts and five little girlfriends 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.900
 in the history of cinema 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.650
 starting with the women of the character 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.810
 by Mary Jane Watson from the trilogy of 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.040
 spiderman not only because always 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.230
 I was playing a little in the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.449
 feelings of the superhero sure that 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.239
 in the second movie he left plant 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.830
 distimo on the altar to his fiance and in 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.150
 medium change james preferred to leave 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.990
 running with the pigeons 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.990
 in the square 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.910
 and even worse what the character of 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.890
 list in the movie of my girlfriend polly 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.200
 that once they had married and 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.570
 they were going to their honeymoon to the 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.690
 woman happens to be unfaithful to the husband 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.699
 on the honeymoon and with a separate bust 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.400
 such was our list between the character 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.049
 of 500 days software with her who 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.970
 the truth is basically a riot to 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.250
 doors since it makes us believe so much 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.869
 we like our protagonist who 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.930
 the thing can work that there 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.000
 hope read your hugs of your affections 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.280
 but really the thing does not go beyond 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.619
 as we all wanted as he wanted and 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.020
 as really well we already see that she does not 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.060
 wanted to 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.770
 and of course the character that his 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.039
 Mom told everyone to tell them that 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.079
 yes but did not tell you when you sail in the 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.299
 twilight trilogy that although it has 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.270
 a very strong romance with Edward a son 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.670
 with eduard all well with edward but 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.439
 he has his stuff with jake or here 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.539
 basically the software style applies 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.149
 to give you hope but really already 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.950
 everything stays there in hope but then 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.500
 also poor and eduard like he is not 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.159
 my father who watched over there 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.869
 swirls 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.729
 I think there are also the characters 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.560
 that maybe they'll break our hearts 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.740
 half of infidelities but if with a 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.110
 very reduced head as is the case with 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.239
 amy in the movie of loss who 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.670
 it looks like an excellent daughter is going to be 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.099
 excellent friend an excellent wife 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.750
 really a very very good woman up 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.610
 that we realize that underneath all 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.440
 this kindness is a very woman 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.049
 deranged in the head that the only thing 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.420
 he wants and his only real goal is 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.420
 destroy the life of your partner 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.760
 continuing with that of men is 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.310
 the character of daniel from the movie 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.410
 bridget jones who introduces himself as a 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.320
 very seductive boss that immediately 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.630
 manages to conquer the protagonist for 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.720
 then make your heart to pieces 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.370
 being unfaithful to another woman for 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.380
 Of course there is something worse than a boss 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.380
 unfaithful and this is the character of harry 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.750
 of the Requiem movie for a dream 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.030
 thematically he is a drug addict 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.980
 but forces his girlfriend to get in 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.040
 Prostitution to get money 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.650
 to keep having his drugs I think that 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.989
 I stay with the psychopathic boss 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.640
 on the contrary someone with more class 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.220
 but drier than a Christmas tree 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.189
 in July is the character of lime of the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.349
 titanic movie who from minute 1 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.810
 we realize that it is a lousy 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.819
 boyfriend a lousy promised a lousy 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.010
 person who really was not 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.049
 interested in painting his wife in a 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.740
 great and majestic picture if not 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.020
 simply what he does with all his life 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.390
 we have the character of David in the 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.250
 dolphin movie who at the beginning seems 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.590
 be a very good boyfriend really a 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.360
 person with a lot of love to be a 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.580
 person very interested in your partner 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.110
 until the limitations start 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.870
 part of his girlfriend's family and all 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.880
 is lost and those limitations do 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.280
 lose your head completely and 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.040
 go crazy affecting not only 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.390
 his girlfriend but the family and us 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.240
 we are watching the movie 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.300
 the wonderful christian king who 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.400
 He seemed to be the perfect boyfriend with his 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.450
 perfect face to your perfect millions 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.030
 his perfect work and his perfect mind 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.860
 disturbed since after looking like a 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.190
 very good choice of couple turns out to be 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.819
 a manipulative controller and maniac 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.750
 about his partner 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:21.940
 then the finalist who wanted them 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.830
 share without the first short and you 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.380
 tell me with what character of hamas they 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.300
 It would be interesting to go out on a date and let him 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.330
 down the comments as well as in 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.819
 our last video of 10 movies that 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.500
 they should never have won the Oscar 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.720
 you commented that the animation 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.220
 brave must not have won over the 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.250
 real the demolisher 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.810
 neither rockies about 'taxi driver' and 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.639
 that Mary changed and they think one of the 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.800
 most overrated movies of the 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.180
 story and a great discussion that 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.130
 accepted from this that you 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.110
 can see on the premiere film page 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.509
 and be very aware of the different 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.500
