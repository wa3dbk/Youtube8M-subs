headphones<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.509> good<00:01:57.719> thing<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.710> there

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
headphones that's a good thing so there

headphones that's a good thing so there
it<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.250> new<00:01:59.430> reimagined<00:02:00.060> studio

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
it is the new reimagined studio

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.330 
it is the new reimagined studio
available<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> white<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.680> see<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:02.189> as

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
available in the white you see here as

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.789 
available in the white you see here as
well<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:02.700> red<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.180> black<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:04.259> hard<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.649> say

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
well as red and black it's hard to say

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.990 
well as red and black it's hard to say
whether<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.040> worth<00:02:05.280> three<00:02:05.520> hundred<00:02:05.549> dollars

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
whether it's worth three hundred dollars

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.940 
whether it's worth three hundred dollars
but<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.659> certainly<00:02:06.930> worth<00:02:07.200> more<00:02:07.560> than<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
but it's certainly worth more than the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.040 
but it's certainly worth more than the
original<00:02:08.069> Beats<00:02:08.550> Studio<00:02:08.640> which<00:02:09.360> also<00:02:09.629> caused

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
original Beats Studio which also caused

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.839 
original Beats Studio which also caused
three<00:02:10.349> hundred<00:02:10.679> I'm<00:02:10.830> David<00:02:11.550> Carr<00:02:11.700> noise

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849
