have to do this you have to do that but

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.959 
have to do this you have to do that but
as<00:00:10.830> much<00:00:11.010> as<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.309> been<00:00:11.370> changing<00:00:11.790> all<00:00:11.910> of

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
as much as it's been changing all of

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.789 
as much as it's been changing all of
those<00:00:12.300> different<00:00:12.509> trends<00:00:13.380> have<00:00:13.559> been

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
those different trends have been

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.650 
those different trends have been
supporting<00:00:14.219> each<00:00:14.309> other<00:00:14.429> what<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> love<00:00:15.630> about

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
supporting each other what I love about

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.029 
supporting each other what I love about
this<00:00:15.990> console<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.650> think<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
this console is that I think it's the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.170 
this console is that I think it's the
first<00:00:17.279> time<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.460> these<00:00:17.670> trends<00:00:17.970> are<00:00:18.060> going

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
first time that these trends are going

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.760 
first time that these trends are going
to<00:00:18.240> really<00:00:18.390> be<00:00:18.449> brought<00:00:18.750> together<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.590> is

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
to really be brought together this is

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.560 
to really be brought together this is
where<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.100> promise<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.640> what<00:00:20.939> we<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.180> do<00:00:21.359> is

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
where the promise of what we can do is

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.020 
where the promise of what we can do is
bigger<00:00:21.810> than<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.529> drawn

this time sony came around to us and

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.200 
this time sony came around to us and
they<00:00:31.340> came<00:00:31.460> to<00:00:31.580> our<00:00:31.610> office<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:32.090> they<00:00:32.180> said

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
they came to our office and they said

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.550 
they came to our office and they said
here's<00:00:32.540> what<00:00:32.720> we're<00:00:32.840> thinking<00:00:33.020> what<00:00:33.440> are<00:00:33.470> you

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
here's what we're thinking what are you

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.050 
here's what we're thinking what are you
guys<00:00:33.740> thinking<00:00:33.800> what<00:00:34.370> have<00:00:34.610> you<00:00:34.730> been<00:00:34.850> held

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
guys thinking what have you been held

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.270 
guys thinking what have you been held
back<00:00:35.240> by<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:35.750> what<00:00:36.050> would<00:00:36.620> you<00:00:36.770> do<00:00:36.980> if<00:00:37.190> you

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
back by and what would you do if you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.770 
back by and what would you do if you
didn't<00:00:37.550> have<00:00:37.640> any<00:00:37.730> technical<00:00:38.180> limitations

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
didn't have any technical limitations

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.450 
didn't have any technical limitations
that<00:00:39.140> they<00:00:39.290> gave<00:00:39.590> us<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:39.920> possibility<00:00:40.070> to

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
that they gave us the possibility to

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.700 
that they gave us the possibility to
provide<00:00:40.760> feedback<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:41.240> to<00:00:41.900> adapt<00:00:42.230> based<00:00:42.500> on

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
provide feedback and to adapt based on

provide feedback and to adapt based on
the<00:00:42.800> feedback<00:00:42.920> they<00:00:43.250> received<00:00:43.580> from

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
the feedback they received from

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.070 
the feedback they received from
developers<00:00:44.180> were<00:00:44.330> was<00:00:44.660> for<00:00:44.870> me<00:00:44.990> a<00:00:45.020> very

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
developers were was for me a very

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.200 
developers were was for me a very
important<00:00:45.620> message<00:00:45.950> all<00:00:46.220> these<00:00:46.670> developers

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
important message all these developers

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.140 
important message all these developers
had<00:00:47.510> a<00:00:47.540> hand<00:00:47.960> in<00:00:48.230> actually<00:00:49.130> helping<00:00:49.520> form<00:00:49.850> what

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
had a hand in actually helping form what

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.970 
had a hand in actually helping form what
the<00:00:50.300> PlayStation<00:00:50.900> 4<00:00:51.140> would<00:00:51.350> eventually<00:00:51.739> turn

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
the PlayStation 4 would eventually turn

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.430 
the PlayStation 4 would eventually turn
out<00:00:52.190> to<00:00:52.340> be<00:00:52.489> we<00:00:53.000> took<00:00:53.210> all<00:00:53.480> that<00:00:53.809> into

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
out to be we took all that into

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.000 
out to be we took all that into
consideration<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:56.000> create<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.260> system<00:00:57.680> that

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
consideration to create the system that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.450 
consideration to create the system that
just<00:00:58.700> walks<00:00:59.059> when<00:00:59.930> we<00:01:00.110> think<00:01:00.379> about<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:01.070> word

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
just walks when we think about the word

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.820 
just walks when we think about the word
simple<00:01:01.910> we've<00:01:02.600> chosen<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.170> interpret<00:01:03.680> that

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
simple we've chosen to interpret that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.090 
simple we've chosen to interpret that
with<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.430> comparable<00:01:05.150> word<00:01:05.410> elegance<00:01:06.410> and<00:01:06.650> to
