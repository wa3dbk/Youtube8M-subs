00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
februari perhaps yeah I think since

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.520 
februari perhaps yeah I think since
March<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.719> it<00:00:42.719> only<00:00:42.840> holds<00:00:43.110> about<00:00:43.260> eight

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
March and it only holds about eight

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.069 
March and it only holds about eight
people<00:00:43.710> oh<00:00:44.100> my<00:00:44.940> god<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.510> keeps<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.899> happening

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
people oh my god this keeps on happening

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.250 
people oh my god this keeps on happening
ah<00:00:46.610> anyway<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:48.539> only<00:00:48.690> holds<00:00:48.870> about<00:00:49.020> eight

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
ah anyway it only holds about eight

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
ah anyway it only holds about eight
people<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:50.070> not<00:00:50.250> paying<00:00:50.520> much<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:51.059> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
people and I'm not paying much for it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.450 
people and I'm not paying much for it
because<00:00:51.500> yeah<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.680> isn't<00:00:52.860> being<00:00:53.070> run<00:00:53.219> off<00:00:53.250> my

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
because yeah this isn't being run off my

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.479 
because yeah this isn't being run off my
own<00:00:53.579> computer<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.390> 24-hour<00:00:55.370> thingy<00:00:56.370> I

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
own computer it's a 24-hour thingy I

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.430 
own computer it's a 24-hour thingy I
signed<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.840> not<00:00:57.960> costing<00:00:58.260> much

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
signed up for so it's not costing much

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.529 
signed up for so it's not costing much
which<00:00:58.770> means<00:00:59.039> only<00:00:59.699> eight<00:00:59.879> players<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:00.449> on

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
which means only eight players can go on

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.240 
which means only eight players can go on
it<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:00.840> I'm<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.289> big<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> youtubes

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
it but I'm not so big on the youtubes

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.729 
it but I'm not so big on the youtubes
anyway<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.510> doubt<00:01:04.140> there'll<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.379> more<00:01:04.589> than

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
anyway so I doubt there'll be more than

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.550 
anyway so I doubt there'll be more than
a<00:01:04.799> people<00:01:05.129> trying<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.990> yeah<00:01:07.260> and
