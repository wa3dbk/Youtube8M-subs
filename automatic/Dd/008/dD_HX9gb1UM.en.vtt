00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.650
 they had pretty simple we announce 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.090
 on which days we don't have one next year 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.639
 play for the me for the premier division and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.330
 the heap relics the cup competitions 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.109
 competition matches 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.109
 design in this diagram 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.029
 well that's a bit more elaborate 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.670
 a fifa first determines which days 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.000
 used internationally 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.140
 uefa on which days they are the uefa 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.800
 competition players the the chimps league and 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.960
 europe league 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.110
 and then we have to puzzle where we are 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.930
 the dutch competitions plan as 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.020
 competition line did you discuss 2 2 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.730
 say who advise you first is say 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.890
 but technically there are people sitting there 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.789
 in as a leo leg hacker on behalf of the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.610
 coaches 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.870
 mass fire together they are premier league clubs 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.850
 herman with all assumptions 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.410
 technical matters of the NFL 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.780
 who advise on sporting technical issues 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.129
 on the other hand have a club every 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.500
 chairman of the under presidency 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.060
 from a mayor who advise us 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.260
 about well what's in the field of 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.900
 public order 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.680
 you're talking about things like marathons 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.830
 you in the country 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:20.700
 the trains and road network 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.259
 what that can cause complications 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.909
 also come proposals but we have this 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.060
 year have a week at the end what 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.010
 start on 12 June 25 days before may 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.590
 no more football matches for you 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.020
 and according to the regulations there should 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.030
 19 my we must already be finished with all 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.370
 our competitions play everything off and on 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.210
 so yes then you can not 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.210
 other than starting early 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.300
 well that tension with you with 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.710
 you that we have to be ready early if 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.290
 we would not do this we would 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.790
 Learning another week to start but 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.620
 we also have to make enough room 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.510
 catch up if needed so we 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.430
 actually have to compromise on this 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.430
 said to do a midweek round 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.479
 for the Eredivisie 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.310
 pains don't mind it remains 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.380
 everyone just needs to heat the fields 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.900
 so that the children can play football there are 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.460
 take a little less space for catching up 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.290
 for the hydraulics that play tap 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.820
 Friday then she is easy to see 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.020
 Monday an extra round or one 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.709
 to schedule an extra competition 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.510
 but also try there with the stand 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.550
 must be as equal as possible so we 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.790
 do our best to do as much as possible 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.790
 play 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.520
 no never but what for our caspar bomb 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.230
 important is that we are the the sporting 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.570
 principles for on the sidelines that we 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.120
 ensure that our competitions run smoothly 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.130
 tight walk fair walk and my old 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:50.190
 our teams in europe is quite possible 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:52.170
 able to do protein is that the following 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.450
 phase of the process but we are trying 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.370
 as much as possible the dutch clubs or 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.900
 I guarantee richly that two days rest 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.420
 sit when she comes between them 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.340
 competition and a European action but 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.739
 on trying to make it even wider 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.269
 and to ensure that if indeed Ajax is up 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.150
 tuesday james league that is on 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.650
 play Saturday competition or our club 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.750
 plays a large audience on Thursday 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.000
 that she comes to play something on Sunday 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.450
 and that you have maximum rest in between 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.450
 those matches
