want to show you my favorite way of

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.740 
want to show you my favorite way of
connecting<00:00:04.890> cameras<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.790> whatever<00:00:06.120> gear<00:00:06.509> you

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
connecting cameras to whatever gear you

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.209 
connecting cameras to whatever gear you
might<00:00:06.779> want<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.529> connect<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:07.799> to

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.470 

actually<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.250> also<00:00:14.549> own<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.150> quick-release

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
actually I also own a quick-release

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.499 
actually I also own a quick-release
system<00:00:15.900> from<00:00:16.230> an<00:00:16.349> frodo<00:00:16.820> yet<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.939> can<00:00:18.119> see<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.509 
system from an frodo yet you can see the

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:19.939 
system from an frodo yet you can see the
biggest<00:00:18.689> problem<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> biggest<00:00:19.680> flaw

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
biggest problem so the biggest flaw

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.190 
biggest problem so the biggest flaw
actually<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.669> size<00:00:20.880> because<00:00:21.509> this<00:00:21.900> plate

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
actually is the size because this plate

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.640 
actually is the size because this plate
is<00:00:22.470> really<00:00:22.860> huge<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.550> cannot<00:00:24.029> really<00:00:24.650> wrap

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
is really huge I cannot really wrap

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.339 
is really huge I cannot really wrap
around<00:00:26.009> the<00:00:26.279> lens<00:00:26.490> anymore<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.360> if<00:00:28.020> I<00:00:28.110> had

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
around the lens anymore and if I had

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.200 
around the lens anymore and if I had
gears<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> follow<00:00:29.550> focus<00:00:29.730> system

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
gears on it for a follow focus system

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.450 
gears on it for a follow focus system
for<00:00:30.390> example<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.960> would<00:00:31.410> get<00:00:31.650> many<00:00:31.980> problems<00:00:32.339> as

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
for example I would get many problems as

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.130 
for example I would get many problems as
well<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.480> really<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.930> biggest

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
well and this is really the biggest

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.960 
well and this is really the biggest
problem<00:00:34.589> in<00:00:34.680> my<00:00:34.710> opinion<00:00:34.830> is<00:00:35.339> when<00:00:35.699> you<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
problem in my opinion is when you have a

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.970 
problem in my opinion is when you have a
smaller<00:00:36.239> camera<00:00:36.510> maybe<00:00:37.019> when<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.440> 60d

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
smaller camera maybe when you have a 60d

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.310 
smaller camera maybe when you have a 60d
or<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.220> 70<00:00:38.730> or<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> 5d<00:00:39.330> mark<00:00:39.510> ii<00:00:39.540> or<00:00:39.900> mach3

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
or a 70 or a 5d mark ii or mach3

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.170 
or a 70 or a 5d mark ii or mach3
this<00:00:40.769> isn't<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> problem<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.400> you<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
this isn't a problem for you but the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.939 
this isn't a problem for you but the
biggest<00:00:42.420> problem<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:42.989> me<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.589> small

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
biggest problem for me with small

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.270 
biggest problem for me with small
kamsa's<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.150> simply<00:00:45.360> cannot<00:00:46.100> open<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
kamsa's that you simply cannot open the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.780 
kamsa's that you simply cannot open the
battery<00:00:47.460> door<00:00:47.930> anymore<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.530> because<00:00:49.920> later

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
battery door anymore this because later

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.520 
battery door anymore this because later
than<00:00:50.970> the<00:00:51.059> way<00:00:51.210> my<00:00:51.750> solution<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.350> problem

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
than the way my solution to this problem

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.950 
than the way my solution to this problem
was<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.920> getting<00:00:53.549> using<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.479> the<00:00:54.600> arca-swiss

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
was to getting using up the arca-swiss

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.049 
was to getting using up the arca-swiss
standard<00:00:55.589> Marcus<00:00:56.129> was<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.519> actually<00:00:56.879> nothing

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
standard Marcus was is actually nothing

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.229 
standard Marcus was is actually nothing
more<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:58.199> some<00:00:58.739> custom<00:00:59.309> plate<00:00:59.519> design<00:00:59.850> some

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
more but some custom plate design some

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.189 
more but some custom plate design some
custom<00:01:00.949> older<00:01:01.949> design<00:01:02.519> where<00:01:03.269> you<00:01:03.299> simply<00:01:03.540> get

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
custom older design where you simply get

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.800 
custom older design where you simply get
the<00:01:04.260> plate<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> holder<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.430> tied<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.510> in

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the plate in the holder and tied it in

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.780 
the plate in the holder and tied it in
and<00:01:07.850> now<00:01:09.049> actually<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.170> rock<00:01:11.009> solid<00:01:11.250> one

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and now actually it's rock solid one

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.219 
and now actually it's rock solid one
cool<00:01:11.970> thing<00:01:12.000> about<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.509> actors<00:01:12.750> who<00:01:12.869> ascended

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
cool thing about the actors who ascended

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
cool thing about the actors who ascended
is<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.070> many<00:01:14.280> things<00:01:14.700> already<00:01:15.180> use<00:01:15.509> it

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
is that so many things already use it

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.660 
is that so many things already use it
because<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.250> something<00:01:17.550> like

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
because if you just get something like

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.300 
because if you just get something like
this<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> yogi<00:01:18.540> ball<00:01:18.720> hit<00:01:18.870> X<00:01:19.310> which

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
this this is the yogi ball hit X which

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.180 
this this is the yogi ball hit X which
actually<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.940> arca-swiss<00:01:21.720> already<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.980> have

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
actually is arca-swiss already so I have

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.730 
actually is arca-swiss already so I have
my<00:01:23.340> darkest<00:01:23.730> was<00:01:23.880> played<00:01:24.120> here<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.710> then<00:01:25.710> I

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
my darkest was played here and then I

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.100 
my darkest was played here and then I
can<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.280> pop<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.820> here<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.750> screw<00:01:28.050> it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
can just pop it in here it screw it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.820 
can just pop it in here it screw it
tight<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:30.150> there's<00:01:30.450> no<00:01:30.659> way<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.290> could<00:01:31.560> be

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
tight and there's no way this could be

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.340 
tight and there's no way this could be
run<00:01:32.640> out<00:01:32.670> easily<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.780> course<00:01:33.990> there<00:01:34.260> are

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
run out easily so of course there are

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.990 
run out easily so of course there are
many<00:01:34.530> benefits<00:01:34.680> when<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:35.730> system

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
many benefits when you have one system

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.480 
many benefits when you have one system
for<00:01:36.480> your<00:01:36.570> whole<00:01:36.840> gear<00:01:37.260> this<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.860> example<00:01:38.130> is

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
for your whole gear this for example is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.120 
for your whole gear this for example is
my<00:01:38.909> base<00:01:39.060> plate<00:01:39.330> for<00:01:39.659> my<00:01:39.870> shoulder<00:01:40.170> rig<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:40.620> my

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
my base plate for my shoulder rig or my

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.360 
my base plate for my shoulder rig or my
rake<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:41.820> all<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.620> this<00:01:43.620> is<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> pretty<00:01:44.070> cool

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
rake at all and this is a pretty cool

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.719 
rake at all and this is a pretty cool
place<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.640> coma<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:46.800> I<00:01:46.830> have<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.520> plate

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
place to coma and now I have the plate

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.310 
place to coma and now I have the plate
on<00:01:47.850> my<00:01:47.909> camera<00:01:48.150> I<00:01:48.330> just<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.140> here

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
on my camera I just can get it in here

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.219 
on my camera I just can get it in here
flick<00:01:50.010> it<00:01:50.100> down<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.810> it's<00:01:51.810> locked<00:01:52.050> and

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
flick it down and it's locked and

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.260 
flick it down and it's locked and
there's<00:01:52.500> no<00:01:52.800> way<00:01:53.010> this<00:01:53.460> camera<00:01:53.880> could<00:01:54.060> fall

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
there's no way this camera could fall

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.149 
there's no way this camera could fall
off<00:01:54.300> another<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.440> cool<00:01:55.590> thing<00:01:55.650> is<00:01:55.950> that

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
off another really cool thing is that

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.160 
off another really cool thing is that
many<00:01:56.520> different<00:01:57.030> manufacturers<00:01:57.600> make<00:01:57.900> some

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
many different manufacturers make some

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.649 
many different manufacturers make some
things<00:01:58.409> for<00:01:58.650> it<00:01:58.799> Aquos<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.880> example<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.540> is

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
things for it Aquos for example this is

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.360 
things for it Aquos for example this is
a<00:02:00.690> plate<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> company<00:02:01.500> called<00:02:01.710> Siri<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
a plate of the company called Siri and

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.000 
a plate of the company called Siri and
this<00:02:03.210> little<00:02:03.420> plate<00:02:03.659> has<00:02:03.870> some<00:02:04.290> feet<00:02:04.650> on<00:02:04.830> them

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
this little plate has some feet on them

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.100 
this little plate has some feet on them
so<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.790> push<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.330> camera<00:02:06.690> against<00:02:06.930> these

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
so we can push a camera against these

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.410 
so we can push a camera against these
feet<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:07.920> good<00:02:08.099> tight<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.909> then<00:02:09.119> there<00:02:09.330> is

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
feet just a good tight and then there is

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.660 
feet just a good tight and then there is
no<00:02:09.629> way<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:10.200> camera<00:02:10.470> could<00:02:10.920> change

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
no way that your camera could change

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.790 
no way that your camera could change
position

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
position

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.560 
position
on<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.980> excess<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.490> this<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.180> pretty<00:02:14.360> cool

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
on the excess and this is pretty cool

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.740 
on the excess and this is pretty cool
because<00:02:14.720> these<00:02:15.350> are<00:02:15.500> ours<00:02:15.650> don't<00:02:15.860> have<00:02:16.750> two

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
because these are ours don't have two

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.390 
because these are ours don't have two
sockets<00:02:17.990> where<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.470> can<00:02:18.620> screw<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:18.920> in<00:02:19.010> or<00:02:19.190> you

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
sockets where you can screw it in or you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.100 
sockets where you can screw it in or you
have<00:02:19.520> don't<00:02:19.700> have<00:02:19.850> locked<00:02:20.480> in<00:02:20.690> or<00:02:20.810> something

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
have don't have locked in or something

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.740 
have don't have locked in or something
like<00:02:21.170> this<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:22.100> with<00:02:22.280> this<00:02:22.430> system<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.720> can

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
like this and with this system you can

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.140 
like this and with this system you can
really<00:02:24.140> be<00:02:24.320> sure<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.250> always<00:02:25.670> points

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
really be sure that this always points

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.730 
really be sure that this always points
in<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.330> reduction<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.900> want<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.500> course

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
in the reduction you want and of course

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.680 
in the reduction you want and of course
my<00:02:27.860> favorite<00:02:28.250> feature<00:02:28.460> is<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.150> can<00:02:29.300> open

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
my favorite feature is that you can open

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.380 
my favorite feature is that you can open
the<00:02:29.960> battery<00:02:30.110> door<00:02:30.490> even<00:02:31.490> though<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:32.180> plate

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
the battery door even though the plate

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.330 
the battery door even though the plate
is<00:02:32.510> connected<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.140> that's<00:02:33.620> even<00:02:34.070> on<00:02:34.190> small

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
is connected and that's even on small

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.550 
is connected and that's even on small
cameras<00:02:34.910> like<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.240> Panasonic<00:02:35.720> gh2<00:02:35.990> which<00:02:36.410> is

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
cameras like the Panasonic gh2 which is

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.140 
cameras like the Panasonic gh2 which is
really<00:02:36.830> small<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.490> is<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.700> same<00:02:37.880> for

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
really small and this is the same for

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.450 
really small and this is the same for
the<00:02:38.300> gh3<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:39.380> can<00:02:39.650> open<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.010> battery<00:02:40.130> doors

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
the gh3 you can open the battery doors

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.240 
the gh3 you can open the battery doors
and<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.360> really<00:02:41.770> my<00:02:42.770> favorite<00:02:42.920> feature

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
and this is really my favorite feature

and this is really my favorite feature
about<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:43.730> problem<00:02:44.150> with<00:02:44.360> arca-swiss<00:02:44.660> is

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
about this problem with arca-swiss is

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.650 
about this problem with arca-swiss is
that<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.380> is<00:02:45.620> not<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:45.950> cheap<00:02:46.360> actually<00:02:47.360> this

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
that it is not that cheap actually this

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.990 
that it is not that cheap actually this
plate<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.380> an<00:02:48.590> original<00:02:48.950> arcs<00:02:49.280> with<00:02:49.550> original

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
plate is an original arcs with original

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.430 
plate is an original arcs with original
artists<00:02:50.330> whose<00:02:50.510> stuff<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.810> really<00:02:51.140> expensive

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
artists whose stuff is really expensive

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.650 
artists whose stuff is really expensive
this<00:02:52.040> little<00:02:52.280> plate<00:02:52.430> here<00:02:52.460> was<00:02:52.940> around<00:02:53.240> 20

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
this little plate here was around 20

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.300 
this little plate here was around 20
euros<00:02:54.020> but<00:02:54.200> maybe<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.560> can<00:02:54.710> get<00:02:54.830> it<00:02:54.950> cheaper

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
euros but maybe you can get it cheaper

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.560 
euros but maybe you can get it cheaper
when<00:02:55.520> you<00:02:55.580> order<00:02:55.820> from<00:02:55.850> China<00:02:56.180> or<00:02:56.390> something

when you order from China or something

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.930 
when you order from China or something
this<00:02:57.170> is<00:02:57.230> from<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.650> okay<00:02:57.980> talking<00:02:58.670> about<00:02:58.850> the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
this is from the okay talking about the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.030 
this is from the okay talking about the
price<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.600> little<00:02:59.900> guy<00:03:00.080> here<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.410> was<00:03:00.590> 60

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
price this little guy here it was 60

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.950 
price this little guy here it was 60
euros<00:03:01.520> in<00:03:01.700> its<00:03:01.820> hole<00:03:02.060> but<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.540> also<00:03:02.750> liked

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
euros in its hole but I also liked

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.660 
euros in its hole but I also liked
really<00:03:03.200> much<00:03:03.350> is<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.010> don't<00:03:04.280> have<00:03:04.340> a

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
really much is that you don't have a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.300 
really much is that you don't have a
plate<00:03:05.090> um<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:05.900> has<00:03:06.050> to<00:03:06.170> connect<00:03:06.500> in<00:03:06.890> one<00:03:07.130> way

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
plate um that has to connect in one way

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.170 
plate um that has to connect in one way
you<00:03:08.210> can<00:03:08.420> some<00:03:09.200> play<00:03:09.470> in<00:03:09.740> sliding<00:03:10.190> your<00:03:10.820> plate

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
you can some play in sliding your plate

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.780 
you can some play in sliding your plate
or<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.990> camera<00:03:12.640> across<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.960> holder<00:03:15.260> and

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
or a camera across the the holder and

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.820 
or a camera across the the holder and
this<00:03:16.790> might<00:03:17.090> not<00:03:17.120> be<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.780> safest<00:03:18.260> route<00:03:18.470> but

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
this might not be the safest route but

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.699 
this might not be the safest route but
still<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.310> think<00:03:19.970> this<00:03:20.330> is<00:03:20.450> really<00:03:20.630> stable<00:03:20.959> one

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
still I think this is really stable one

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.320 
still I think this is really stable one
problem<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.220> there<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:22.760> no<00:03:22.880> general<00:03:23.090> rised

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
problem is there is no general rised

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.210 
problem is there is no general rised

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
that you push in a metal plate to

that you push in a metal plate to
release<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.290> plate<00:03:27.470> oh<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.739> can't<00:03:28.130> fall<00:03:28.370> off

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
release the plate oh it can't fall off

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.690 
release the plate oh it can't fall off
only<00:03:29.690> we<00:03:30.350> know<00:03:30.410> for<00:03:30.739> example<00:03:30.830> buy<00:03:31.280> something

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
are always have their own locking

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.479 
are always have their own locking
mechanisms<00:03:36.140> but<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.470> is<00:03:36.590> not<00:03:36.830> compatible<00:03:37.130> with

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
mechanisms but it is not compatible with

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.979 
mechanisms but it is not compatible with
other<00:03:37.610> ones<00:03:37.910> there<00:03:38.090> is<00:03:38.120> no<00:03:38.270> general<00:03:38.510> locking

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
other ones there is no general locking

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.930 
other ones there is no general locking
system<00:03:39.350> I<00:03:39.500> admit<00:03:39.890> it<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.220> may<00:03:40.550> be<00:03:40.610> a<00:03:40.760> big

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
system I admit it this may be a big

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.510 
system I admit it this may be a big
problem<00:03:41.180> still<00:03:41.930> had<00:03:42.080> never<00:03:42.320> had<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.860> one

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
problem still had never had that one

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.280 
problem still had never had that one
single<00:03:43.970> camera<00:03:44.150> or<00:03:44.420> one<00:03:44.600> single<00:03:44.959> piece<00:03:45.110> of

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
single camera or one single piece of

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:54.509 
single camera or one single piece of
gear<00:03:45.590> moved<00:03:46.310> just<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.940> tiny<00:03:47.150> bit

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.160 

so<00:03:55.519> you<00:03:56.030> enjoyed<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:56.510> little<00:03:56.659> presentation

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
so you enjoyed this little presentation

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.350 
so you enjoyed this little presentation
and<00:03:57.620> understand<00:03:58.280> maybe<00:03:58.489> a<00:03:58.610> bit<00:03:58.790> better<00:03:58.970> while

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
and understand maybe a bit better while

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.699 
and understand maybe a bit better while
like<00:03:59.659> the<00:03:59.840> ARCA<00:04:00.080> Swiss<00:04:00.140> Mountain<00:04:00.560> that

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
like the ARCA Swiss Mountain that

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.740 
like the ARCA Swiss Mountain that
maschmann<00:04:00.920> why<00:04:01.250> I<00:04:01.280> use<00:04:01.700> it<00:04:01.849> everywhere<00:04:02.299> in<00:04:02.629> my

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
maschmann why I use it everywhere in my

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.530 
maschmann why I use it everywhere in my
kit<00:04:03.159> thanks<00:04:04.159> for<00:04:04.280> watching<00:04:04.519> so<00:04:04.640> far<00:04:04.849> and<00:04:05.330> after

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
kit thanks for watching so far and after
