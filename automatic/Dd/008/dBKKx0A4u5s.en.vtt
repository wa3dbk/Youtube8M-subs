00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:01.480
(woman crying)

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.731
(typing)

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.791
- [Voiceover] Hey guys, this
is Versatile from VSTPower.

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:09.311
We've got a really quick
game tutorial today.

00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:11.571
I'm going to show you how simple
it is to do your LAN online

00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:14.272
using Need for Speed: Most
Wanted, and we're gonna use

00:00:14.272 --> 00:00:15.771
the Tungle program for today.

00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:17.751
If you are using the Tungle
program, if you click

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.512
on the question mark or click
on the "Don't Panic" button,

00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:21.672
here is the wiki.

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:23.232
So the bottom line is install your game,

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:25.472
download and install update 1.3,

00:00:25.472 --> 00:00:27.611
and then go to your game install folder

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:30.692
and edit the "server.cfg" file like so.

00:00:30.692 --> 00:00:32.692
So basically, what you do is,

00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:33.732
let me do that right now.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:37.553
Go to server.cfg, and
by default you will have

00:00:37.553 --> 00:00:40.052
some type of IP address inside here.

00:00:40.052 --> 00:00:42.772
So change it to have
your Tungle IP address.

00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:44.672
If you don't know what
your Tungle IP address is,

00:00:44.672 --> 00:00:47.652
it's basically right here in
the lower left hand corner.

00:00:47.652 --> 00:00:51.012
So let's go back to server.cfg,
enter in your IP address,

00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:53.792
your Tungle IP address,
here for the TRUST_MATCH.

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:56.352
And then do it once more
time at the very bottom

00:00:56.352 --> 00:00:58.752
for this address, and
then go to File&gt;Save,

00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:00.352
and then you're good to go.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:01.592
If we continue reading this wiki,

00:01:01.592 --> 00:01:04.092
we see that you join the Need
for Speed: Most Wanted network

00:01:04.092 --> 00:01:05.772
and then you start the game.

00:01:05.772 --> 00:01:08.331
As a client, all you
gotta do is go to LAN Play

00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:09.452
and join any match.

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:11.651
If you're hosting, this is
where it gets interesting.

00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:14.112
What you gotta do is start
your game, now disconnect

00:01:14.112 --> 00:01:16.392
from the internet,
that's what I like to do,

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:18.592
and then go ahead and
create your LAN server.

00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:21.052
Once your LAN server is up
and you're inside a match,

00:01:21.052 --> 00:01:24.453
then reconnect to the internet
and then your computer

00:01:24.453 --> 00:01:26.432
will automatically reconnect to Tungle,

00:01:26.432 --> 00:01:28.012
and after about a minute or two minutes,

00:01:28.012 --> 00:01:30.612
then other people will see your
game and they can join you,

00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:32.352
and you can have a lot of good times.

00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:33.992
So with that said,
let's jump straight into

00:01:33.992 --> 00:01:37.193
the game-play footage tutorial.

00:01:37.193 --> 00:01:37.904
Sweet!

00:01:37.904 --> 00:01:39.805
So here we are at the main menu

00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:41.485
on Need for Speed: Most Wanted.

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:45.045
So let's go to LAN Play real quick here,

00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:46.745
and, if you want to create a server,

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:48.006
what you should do right now

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:49.566
is disconnect from the internet,

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:52.086
press 1, create your LAN server,

00:01:52.086 --> 00:01:53.646
reconnect back to the internet,

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:56.846
wait for your computer to
reconnect back to the Tungle room,

00:01:56.846 --> 00:01:59.006
and then people can connect
to you successfully,

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:00.325
but I'm not gonna do that right now.

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:03.146
So let's go ahead and
join my other laptop game.

00:02:03.146 --> 00:02:04.346
It's called "Name."

00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:06.066
So let's press Enter and
give myself a name here.

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:09.346
Press Enter, and if all's well,
you'll automatically launch,

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:10.806
just like that. Sweet.

00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:12.026
So if you want to create a game,

00:02:12.026 --> 00:02:13.666
you go to Create Game right here,

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.546
but my laptop already created the game,

00:02:15.546 --> 00:02:17.486
so let's go to the Session
Match, for example,

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:19.427
have it search for any game here,

00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:23.666
and here we see that the
Name has created a game.

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:26.606
And if you want to chat 1 and say "sup",

00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:28.726
and if you guys don't believe me,

00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:32.246
I'm gonna have the laptop say "hello123."

00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:36.086
So let's see. "Hello123"

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:37.266
See? There you go.

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:39.907
So this is all real,
and none of it is fake.

00:02:39.907 --> 00:02:43.406
So, what we gotta do is basically
wait for this countdown.

00:02:43.406 --> 00:02:45.826
9, 8, 7, 6...

00:02:45.826 --> 00:02:48.246
and pretty soon, we'll
be in the game racing.

00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:49.656
It's gonna be a lot of good times.

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:51.526
(rock music)

00:02:53.816 --> 00:02:54.939
(engines revving)

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.979
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:58.898
And now it's basically myself playing

00:02:58.898 --> 00:03:00.499
on two keyboards right now,

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.378
so the race is gonna be sorta interesting,

00:03:03.378 --> 00:03:08.059
and it's gonna be a little
biased because one car will win.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.008
Ah yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:16.079
See? Oh no, the other
car got a head start.

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.460
But anyways, we can clearly see

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.740
that this game works out fine.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.199
so if you've got any nit-picky questions,

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.719
leave a comment here on the Youtube page

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.229
and I'll get back to
you as soon as possible.

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.490
Once again, thank you for watching.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.329
Take care. Bye.
