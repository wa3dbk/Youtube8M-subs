00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
know i've been using changing 90 a lot

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.260 
know i've been using changing 90 a lot
lately<00:00:17.980> you<00:00:18.189> probably<00:00:18.490> noticed<00:00:18.939> that<00:00:19.060> and

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
lately you probably noticed that and

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.390 
lately you probably noticed that and
then<00:00:19.450> I<00:00:19.689> still<00:00:20.560> maintain<00:00:20.740> that<00:00:20.950> the<00:00:21.160> jaenshi

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
then I still maintain that the jaenshi

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.530 
then I still maintain that the jaenshi
it's<00:00:21.790> the<00:00:21.910> best<00:00:22.500> overall<00:00:23.939> sniper<00:00:24.939> rifle<00:00:25.419> in

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
it's the best overall sniper rifle in

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.870 
it's the best overall sniper rifle in
the<00:00:25.660> game<00:00:25.810> right<00:00:26.020> now<00:00:26.079> but<00:00:26.560> that<00:00:26.849> does<00:00:27.849> not

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
the game right now but that does not

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.639 
the game right now but that does not
mean<00:00:28.300> it's<00:00:28.540> the<00:00:28.630> weapon<00:00:28.840> I'm<00:00:29.079> having<00:00:29.380> the<00:00:29.500> most

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
mean it's the weapon I'm having the most

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.319 
mean it's the weapon I'm having the most
fun<00:00:29.860> with<00:00:30.369> because<00:00:30.669> right<00:00:30.849> now<00:00:30.880> I'm<00:00:31.300> having

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
fun with because right now I'm having

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.510 
fun with because right now I'm having
the<00:00:31.630> most<00:00:31.779> fun<00:00:31.960> with<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.439> sv<00:00:32.770> 98<00:00:33.190> and<00:00:33.370> the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
the most fun with the sv 98 and the

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.040 
the most fun with the sv 98 and the
reason<00:00:33.790> for<00:00:33.880> that<00:00:33.970> is<00:00:34.090> that<00:00:34.239> I<00:00:34.420> can<00:00:34.570> go<00:00:34.750> really

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
reason for that is that I can go really

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.930 
reason for that is that I can go really
aggressively<00:00:35.649> like<00:00:35.890> I<00:00:36.010> do<00:00:36.070> in<00:00:36.190> this<00:00:36.309> round<00:00:36.700> and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
aggressively like I do in this round and

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.880 
aggressively like I do in this round and
I<00:00:37.120> figure<00:00:37.750> I<00:00:37.780> was<00:00:37.930> just<00:00:38.110> gonna<00:00:38.320> run<00:00:38.440> in<00:00:38.740> there

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
I figure I was just gonna run in there

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.470 
I figure I was just gonna run in there
with<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.220> with<00:00:39.520> a<00:00:39.550> sniper<00:00:39.730> rifle<00:00:39.910> like<00:00:40.240> it<00:00:40.390> was

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
with the with a sniper rifle like it was

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.040 
with the with a sniper rifle like it was
an<00:00:40.570> lmg<00:00:40.990> or<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.490> shotgun<00:00:42.490> and<00:00:42.610> just<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:44.020> know

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
an lmg or a shotgun and just you know

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.930 
an lmg or a shotgun and just you know
bring<00:00:44.440> some<00:00:44.650> mayhem<00:00:44.830> down<00:00:45.250> in<00:00:45.400> a<00:00:45.490> minute<00:00:45.700> it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
weekend I think I i racked up a total of

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.499 
weekend I think I i racked up a total of
eighty<00:01:02.800> five<00:01:03.100> thousand<00:01:03.820> points<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.390> was

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
eighty five thousand points that was

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.710 
eighty five thousand points that was
pretty<00:01:04.720> awesome<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.229> I'm<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.820> know<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.119> sv

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
pretty awesome and I'm you know the sv

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.889 
pretty awesome and I'm you know the sv
9a<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.380> sv<00:01:08.740> 98<00:01:09.159> is<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.909> bit<00:01:10.240> different<00:01:10.479> than

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
9a the sv 98 is a bit different than

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.090 
9a the sv 98 is a bit different than
different<00:01:11.380> than<00:01:11.469> all<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.619> other<00:01:11.770> sniper

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
different than all the other sniper

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.340 
different than all the other sniper
rifle<00:01:12.460> because<00:01:12.579> it<00:01:12.880> has<00:01:13.030> improved<00:01:13.569> hipfire

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
rifle because it has improved hipfire

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.849 
rifle because it has improved hipfire
accuracy<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.729> I'm<00:01:16.509> gonna<00:01:16.719> be<00:01:17.380> testing<00:01:17.770> that

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
accuracy so I'm gonna be testing that

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.190 
accuracy so I'm gonna be testing that
out<00:01:17.920> really<00:01:18.429> you<00:01:18.939> know<00:01:19.090> align<00:01:19.780> this<00:01:19.960> game

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
out really you know align this game

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.319 
out really you know align this game
place<00:01:20.469> you<00:01:20.679> will<00:01:20.799> see<00:01:21.069> a<00:01:21.340> couple<00:01:21.639> of<00:01:21.819> no<00:01:21.939> scopes

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
place you will see a couple of no scopes

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.399 
place you will see a couple of no scopes
here<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.719> there<00:01:22.929> and<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:25.600> I've<00:01:25.689> noticed<00:01:25.899> the

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
here and there and what I've noticed the

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.989 
here and there and what I've noticed the
the<00:01:27.069> svn<00:01:27.759> idea<00:01:27.969> is<00:01:28.119> actually<00:01:28.479> very<00:01:28.509> very<00:01:29.350> very

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
the svn idea is actually very very very

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:34.160 
the svn idea is actually very very very
accurate<00:01:30.999> at<00:01:31.299> when<00:01:31.539> hip<00:01:31.659> firing<00:01:31.960> its<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:33.030> do

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
accurate at when hip firing its I do

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.529 
accurate at when hip firing its I do
like<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.200> 15<00:01:35.740> meter<00:01:36.039> headshot<00:01:36.700> with<00:01:36.939> it<00:01:37.060> in<00:01:37.299> a

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
like a 15 meter headshot with it in a

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.660 
like a 15 meter headshot with it in a
couple<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.810> minutes<00:01:38.079> as<00:01:38.709> you'll<00:01:39.100> see<00:01:39.130> coming

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
couple of minutes as you'll see coming

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.449 
couple of minutes as you'll see coming
up<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:39.909> it's<00:01:40.060> just<00:01:40.149> I<00:01:40.600> mean<00:01:41.530> sometimes<00:01:42.039> the

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
up and it's just I mean sometimes the

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:45.179 
up and it's just I mean sometimes the
bullet<00:01:42.729> just<00:01:42.880> kind<00:01:43.149> of<00:01:43.209> flies<00:01:43.479> off<00:01:43.749> to<00:01:44.189> where

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
bullet just kind of flies off to where

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.520 
bullet just kind of flies off to where
who<00:01:45.429> the<00:01:45.549> fuck<00:01:45.729> knows<00:01:45.880> but<00:01:46.149> most<00:01:47.109> of<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.319> time

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
who the fuck knows but most of the time

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.559 
who the fuck knows but most of the time
it<00:01:47.709> seems<00:01:48.039> to<00:01:48.219> go<00:01:48.429> pretty<00:01:48.759> much<00:01:48.880> dead<00:01:49.420> on

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
it seems to go pretty much dead on

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.129 
it seems to go pretty much dead on
target<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:50.200> mean<00:01:50.619> straight<00:01:50.950> ahead<00:01:51.069> so<00:01:51.579> I<00:01:52.139> know

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.139 
target I mean straight ahead so I know

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:54.870

range<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.420> chest<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.620> can<00:03:03.920> do<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.190> a

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
range to the chest so you can do this a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.500 
range to the chest so you can do this a
bit<00:03:04.459> more<00:03:04.609> successfully<00:03:05.120> than<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.329> could
