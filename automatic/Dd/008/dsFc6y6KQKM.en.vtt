00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
you've won a few Italian cups new time

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.870 
you've won a few Italian cups new time
as<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> player<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.260> as<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.470> manager<00:02:34.920> but<00:02:35.130> how

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
as a player and as a manager but how

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.430 
as a player and as a manager but how
special<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.420> think<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.690> FA<00:02:36.959> Cup<00:02:37.200> is

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
special you think the FA Cup is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.160 
special you think the FA Cup is
different<00:02:37.920> well<00:02:38.489> first<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.420> all<00:02:39.480> because<00:02:39.660> we

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
different well first of all because we

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.900 
different well first of all because we
will<00:02:40.590> be<00:02:40.620> if<00:02:41.040> it's<00:02:41.250> possibly<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.640> first

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
will be if it's possibly the first

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.059 
will be if it's possibly the first
because<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.930> think<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.260> will<00:02:43.500> be<00:02:43.560> more<00:02:44.310> odd

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
because I think that will be more odd

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.520 
because I think that will be more odd
because<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:48.030> FA<00:02:48.420> Cup<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> very<00:02:49.410> very

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
because the FA Cup is a very very

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.860 
because the FA Cup is a very very
important<00:02:50.069> in<00:02:50.190> England<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.640> what<00:02:51.630> would<00:02:51.750> your

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
important in England and what would your

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.780
