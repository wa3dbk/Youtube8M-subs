farther he has to come in hot it goes
right<00:00:39.170> at<00:00:39.380> the<00:00:39.500> end<00:00:39.650> of<00:00:39.830> the<00:00:39.920> ramp<00:00:40.070> he's<00:00:40.309> got<00:00:40.489> a

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
right at the end of the ramp he's got a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.240 
right at the end of the ramp he's got a
polar<00:00:40.880> front<00:00:41.270> brake<00:00:41.630> he<00:00:42.410> backed<00:00:42.650> out<00:00:42.920> of<00:00:42.980> it

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
polar front brake he backed out of it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.729 
polar front brake he backed out of it
I'm<00:00:43.790> real<00:00:44.150> it<00:00:44.450> he<00:00:44.690> took<00:00:44.960> his<00:00:45.110> head<00:00:45.320> out<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.530> it

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.479 
right yeah let's take a look at that
again<00:00:47.180> it<00:00:47.690> looks<00:00:47.870> like<00:00:48.350> he<00:00:48.590> opens<00:00:49.010> up<00:00:49.129> his<00:00:49.190> head

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
again it looks like he opens up his head

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.299 
again it looks like he opens up his head
watch<00:00:49.820> he<00:00:50.540> stopped<00:00:50.900> looking<00:00:51.230> down<00:00:51.440> hook

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
watch he stopped looking down hook

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.100 
watch he stopped looking down hook
starts<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:52.879> pull<00:00:53.090> off<00:00:53.269> and<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:53.600> was<00:00:53.780> that

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
starts to pull off and that was that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.840 
starts to pull off and that was that
look<00:00:54.379> like<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.680> end<00:00:54.890> of<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:55.160> momentum<00:00:55.699> right

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
look like the end of the momentum right

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.630 
look like the end of the momentum right
there<00:00:56.150> yeah<00:00:56.510> second<00:00:57.140> gas<00:00:57.350> dick<00:00:57.680> on<00:00:58.400> the

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
there yeah second gas dick on the

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.509 
there yeah second gas dick on the
take-off<00:00:59.530> really<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:00.710> mean<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:01.040> can't<00:01:01.280> back

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
take-off really I mean you can't back

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.910 
take-off really I mean you can't back
out<00:01:01.699> of<00:01:01.879> tricks<00:01:02.120> okay<00:01:03.080> let's<00:01:03.320> take<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.559> look<00:01:03.799> and

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
out of tricks okay let's take a look and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.680 
out of tricks okay let's take a look and
see<00:01:03.979> we've<00:01:04.309> seen

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.690 

knows<00:01:09.990> what's<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> happen<00:01:11.250> before<00:01:11.430> he

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
knows what's going to happen before he

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.280 
knows what's going to happen before he
leaves<00:01:11.910> the<00:01:12.060> ramp<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:12.630> he<00:01:12.750> hasn't<00:01:13.020> got

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
leaves the ramp because he hasn't got

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.170 
leaves the ramp because he hasn't got
the<00:01:13.410> brakes<00:01:13.710> at<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.980> right<00:01:14.160> time<00:01:14.490> don't<00:01:15.120> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the brakes at the right time don't you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.970 
the brakes at the right time don't you
throw<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> bike<00:01:15.690> around<00:01:15.900> enough<00:01:16.410> let's<00:01:16.740> take

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
throw the bike around enough let's take

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.160 
throw the bike around enough let's take
a<00:01:17.010> look<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.790> think<00:01:18.180> he<00:01:18.330> missed<00:01:18.660> the<00:01:18.810> break

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
a look at I think he missed the break

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.550 
a look at I think he missed the break
actually<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.980> don't<00:01:20.520> think

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.530 

they<00:01:26.560> did<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.860> snowball<00:01:27.400> dance<00:01:27.610> top<00:01:28.030> down<00:01:28.300> look

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
they did a snowball dance top down look

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.810 
they did a snowball dance top down look
at<00:01:28.660> the<00:01:28.810> extension<00:01:29.260> on<00:01:29.620> that<00:01:29.650> look<00:01:30.340> at<00:01:30.580> the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
at the extension on that look at the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.000 
at the extension on that look at the
beautiful<00:01:31.180> extension<00:01:31.780> that's<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:32.800> whole

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
beautiful extension that's a whole

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.640 
beautiful extension that's a whole
different<00:01:33.310> trick<00:01:33.760> than<00:01:34.060> what<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:35.170> jaws<00:01:35.410> have

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
different trick than what the jaws have

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.160 
different trick than what the jaws have
done<00:01:35.890> I<00:01:36.160> mean<00:01:36.400> this<00:01:36.580> is<00:01:36.640> good<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.780> another

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
done I mean this is good to another

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.500 
done I mean this is good to another
level<00:01:38.440> to<00:01:38.890> another<00:01:39.670> level

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
level to another level

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.780 
level to another level
and<00:01:41.660> taking<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.380> look<00:01:42.410> again<00:01:42.770> watch<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
and taking a look again watch the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.090 
and taking a look again watch the
extension<00:01:43.820> on<00:01:44.630> his<00:01:44.810> body<00:01:45.050> straight<00:01:45.620> up<00:01:45.860> and

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
extension on his body straight up and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.170 
extension on his body straight up and
down<00:01:47.530> fast<00:01:48.530> he<00:01:48.770> committed<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.430> going<00:01:49.670> for<00:01:49.790> both

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
down fast he committed to going for both

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.150 
down fast he committed to going for both
of<00:01:50.390> those<00:01:50.540> grabs<00:01:50.960> before<00:01:51.890> he<00:01:51.980> was<00:01:52.130> even

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
of those grabs before he was even

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.430 
of those grabs before he was even
completely<00:01:52.910> upside<00:01:53.210> down<00:01:53.480> cannot<00:01:53.990> walk<00:01:54.230> it

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
completely upside down cannot walk it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.040 
completely upside down cannot walk it
back<00:01:54.620> he<00:01:55.040> says<00:01:55.370> cannot<00:01:56.030> walk<00:01:56.330> back<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.780> tricky

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
back he says cannot walk back the tricky

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:06.970 
back he says cannot walk back the tricky
can't<00:01:57.290> go<00:01:57.410> one<00:01:57.620> hand<00:01:57.890> in

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.970 

there<00:02:07.580> he<00:02:07.670> goes<00:02:07.880> barhom<00:02:08.510> twist<00:02:09.290> over<00:02:09.560> crabs

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:09.980 
there he goes barhom twist over crabs

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.490 
there he goes barhom twist over crabs
have<00:02:10.160> plenty<00:02:10.580> of<00:02:10.610> time<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:10.970> land<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.600> blends<00:02:12.320> it

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
have plenty of time to land it blends it

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.140 
have plenty of time to land it blends it
smooth<00:02:12.830> not<00:02:13.160> enough<00:02:13.400> run<00:02:13.640> out<00:02:13.820> for<00:02:14.120> a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
smooth not enough run out for a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.170 
smooth not enough run out for a
basically<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:14.870> he<00:02:14.930> just<00:02:15.110> egg<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.470> stage<00:02:15.710> left

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
basically and he just egg the stage left

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.180 
basically and he just egg the stage left
yeah
