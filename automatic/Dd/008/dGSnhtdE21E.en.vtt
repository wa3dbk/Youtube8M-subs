to help you learn the fingerboard

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.049 
to help you learn the fingerboard
it's<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.179> take<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.570> five<00:00:12.809> positions<00:00:13.139> of

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
it's going to take the five positions of

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.630 
it's going to take the five positions of
the<00:00:15.059> Caged<00:00:15.330> sequence<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.590> case<00:00:16.890> we're

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
the Caged sequence in this case we're

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:26.450 
the Caged sequence in this case we're
going<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.789> use<00:00:17.940> D<00:00:18.270> minor<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:25.280> we're<00:00:26.280> going<00:00:26.400> to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
going to use D minor and we're going to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.870 
going to use D minor and we're going to
base<00:00:26.640> our<00:00:27.320> improvisation<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.650> two<00:00:29.340> five<00:00:29.610> one

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880

going to do is we're going to limit
ourselves<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.560> a<00:00:37.620> couple<00:00:37.950> different<00:00:38.190> ways

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
ourselves in a couple different ways

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670 
ourselves in a couple different ways
first<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:38.940> we're<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> keep<00:00:40.470> our

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
first of all we're going to keep our

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and secondly we're going to base our

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.250 
and secondly we're going to base our
improvisation<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.250> positional<00:00:48.260> chord

take the two five one six we're going to

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.379 
take the two five one six we're going to
play<00:01:19.469> over<00:01:19.709> it<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.219> one<00:01:20.399> position<00:01:20.850> we're<00:01:21.270> going

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:21.389 
play over it in one position we're going

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:22.760 
play over it in one position we're going
to<00:01:21.479> move<00:01:21.569> up<00:01:21.719> to<00:01:21.749> the<00:01:21.929> next<00:01:22.139> position<00:01:22.259> play

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to move up to the next position play

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.840 
to move up to the next position play
over<00:01:23.069> it<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.609> a<00:01:23.639> while

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
over it there for a while

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.480 
over it there for a while
etc<00:01:24.600> etc<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.439> I'm<00:01:25.709> going<00:01:25.859> to<00:01:25.889> demonstrate<00:01:26.009> how

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
etc etc and I'm going to demonstrate how

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.779 
etc etc and I'm going to demonstrate how
that's<00:01:26.729> done<00:01:26.969> and<00:01:27.240> here's<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.170> sequence<00:01:33.380> and

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
that's done and here's the sequence and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:49.779 
that's done and here's the sequence and
here<00:01:35.789> we<00:01:35.880> go

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:02:51.470 

next<00:01:50.789> position<00:02:48.079> and<00:02:49.880> that's<00:02:50.880> how<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.090> do<00:02:51.299> this

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
next position and that's how you do this

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.210 
next position and that's how you do this
sequence<00:02:51.930> now<00:02:52.109> you<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.769> stay<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.100> each

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
sequence now you can stay in each

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.750 
sequence now you can stay in each
position<00:02:53.760> as<00:02:53.910> long<00:02:54.120> as<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.420> want<00:02:55.010> in<00:02:56.010> some

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
position as long as you want in some

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.800 
position as long as you want in some
positions<00:02:57.180> are<00:02:57.329> going<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.540> find<00:02:57.720> yourself

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
positions are going to find yourself

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.449 
positions are going to find yourself
very<00:02:58.260> uncomfortable<00:02:58.920> because<00:02:59.130> you're

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
very uncomfortable because you're

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.099 
very uncomfortable because you're
probably<00:02:59.700> used<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.060> playing<00:03:00.389> everything<00:03:00.690> in

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
probably used to playing everything in

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.890 
probably used to playing everything in
the<00:03:01.799> most<00:03:02.010> comfortable<00:03:02.489> position<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:03.209> terms

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
the most comfortable position in terms

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.410 
the most comfortable position in terms
of<00:03:04.230> where<00:03:04.859> you<00:03:05.040> are<00:03:05.069> in<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.489> fingerboard<00:03:05.790> but

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
of where you are in the fingerboard but

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.970 
of where you are in the fingerboard but
instead<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:07.079> is<00:03:07.139> going<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.470> force<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.950> to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
instead this is going to force you to

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.039 
instead this is going to force you to
learn<00:03:08.250> those<00:03:08.489> places<00:03:08.940> when<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.750> get<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.019> a

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
learn those places when you get to a

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.750 
learn those places when you get to a
point<00:03:10.319> where<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.680> can't<00:03:10.950> play<00:03:11.160> at<00:03:11.340> all<00:03:11.519> eighth

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
point where you can't play at all eighth

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.740 
notes over particular sequence slow it
down<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.060> means<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.329> don't<00:03:15.510> know<00:03:15.569> the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
down and it means you don't know the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.470 
down and it means you don't know the
fingerboard<00:03:16.049> very<00:03:16.440> well<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:16.950> position

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
fingerboard very well in that position

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.479 
fingerboard very well in that position
now<00:03:18.480> I'm<00:03:18.630> going<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.900> take<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.560> same<00:03:19.799> chord

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
now I'm going to take the same chord

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.699 
now I'm going to take the same chord
progression<00:03:20.519> same<00:03:21.299> sequence<00:03:21.810> except<00:03:22.590> this

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
progression same sequence except this

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.759 
progression same sequence except this
time<00:03:22.980> I'm<00:03:23.310> going<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:23.970> change<00:03:24.209> positions<00:03:24.810> every

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
time I'm going to change positions every

00:03:25.769 --> 00:04:02.320 
time I'm going to change positions every
time<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.250> chord<00:03:26.519> sequence<00:03:26.970> repeats

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:38.750 

I'm<00:04:03.330> going<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.540> go<00:04:03.599> back<00:04:03.780> down<00:04:04.019> now<00:04:37.460> so<00:04:38.460> what<00:04:38.639> we

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
I'm going to go back down now so what we

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.580 
I'm going to go back down now so what we
did<00:04:38.910> is<00:04:39.090> we<00:04:39.120> sequenced<00:04:39.690> our<00:04:39.960> way<00:04:40.110> up<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.500> down

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
did is we sequenced our way up and down

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.620 
did is we sequenced our way up and down
the<00:04:40.770> fingerboard<00:04:41.070> we<00:04:41.940> learn<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.360> play

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
the fingerboard we learn to play

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.659 
the fingerboard we learn to play
everything<00:04:43.260> that<00:04:43.590> we<00:04:43.710> know<00:04:43.889> how<00:04:43.950> to<00:04:44.010> play<00:04:44.310> in

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
everything that we know how to play in

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.690 
everything that we know how to play in
all<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.600> positions<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.289> what<00:04:47.280> you<00:04:47.400> can<00:04:47.550> do

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
all the positions and what you can do

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.490 
all the positions and what you can do
with<00:04:47.880> this<00:04:48.030> is<00:04:48.330> take<00:04:48.780> some<00:04:49.020> of<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.169> licks<00:04:49.380> that

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
with this is take some of the licks that

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.710 
with this is take some of the licks that
you<00:04:49.770> might<00:04:49.950> know<00:04:50.280> some<00:04:51.030> of<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.240> things<00:04:51.479> that

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
you might know some of the things that

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.800 
you might know some of the things that
are<00:04:51.810> common<00:04:52.200> like<00:04:54.139> and<00:04:56.360> learn<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.479> play<00:04:57.630> them

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
are common like and learn to play them

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.140 
are common like and learn to play them
in<00:04:57.840> all<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.169> positions<00:04:58.590> so<00:04:58.740> instead<00:04:59.010> of<00:04:59.070> going

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.000 

learn<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.270> play<00:05:03.419> that<00:05:03.450> lick<00:05:03.780> there

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.160 

and<00:05:07.210> that's<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.390> whole<00:05:08.570> purpose<00:05:08.780> of<00:05:09.080> this

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
and that's the whole purpose of this

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.100 
and that's the whole purpose of this
line<00:05:09.440> now<00:05:10.190> I've<00:05:10.580> done<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.210> same<00:05:11.540> sequence

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
line now I've done the same sequence

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.410 
line now I've done the same sequence
over<00:05:12.290> giant<00:05:12.620> steps<00:05:12.980> countdown<00:05:13.790> moment's

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
over giant steps countdown moment's

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.690 
over giant steps countdown moment's
notice<00:05:14.450> and<00:05:14.990> many<00:05:15.620> very<00:05:15.860> complicated<00:05:16.400> chord

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
notice and many very complicated chord

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.370 
notice and many very complicated chord
progressions<00:05:17.210> if<00:05:17.450> you<00:05:17.720> take<00:05:17.930> this<00:05:18.080> approach

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
progressions if you take this approach

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.950 
progressions if you take this approach
and<00:05:18.800> you<00:05:19.220> practice<00:05:19.670> it<00:05:19.820> rigorously<00:05:20.060> you'll

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
and you practice it rigorously you'll

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.270 
and you practice it rigorously you'll
also<00:05:21.170> be<00:05:21.440> able<00:05:21.500> to<00:05:21.650> play<00:05:21.830> over<00:05:22.070> some<00:05:22.250> very

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
also be able to play over some very

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.540 
also be able to play over some very
complicated<00:05:22.790> tunes<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.770> I<00:05:24.770> hope<00:05:25.160> to<00:05:25.310> see<00:05:25.490> you
