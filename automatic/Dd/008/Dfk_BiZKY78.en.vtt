00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.289
 after the exit of a game created outside 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.360
 Seneca called the king of fighters and 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.369
 that was quickly catapulted as one 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.050
 of the best games to win if it's not 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.730
 what better was it leading us to do 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.310
 different deliveries with the name on the 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.020
 which said game play or published and so 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.700
 with the passage of time he left 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.860
 becoming the most played game of 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.630
 the recreational machines but as 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.399
 we still know that in this video 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.309
 let me share some 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:43.829
 curiosities maybe you did not know about the king 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.929
 of fighters so we started well 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.640
 the creation and incorporation of angel or 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.429
 it was given that there was a certain bet 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.109
 or agreement between Zéneca and a 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.409
 developer of games established in 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.690
 mexico in which it consisted of English 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.059
 winner of said bet or agreement 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.059
 could a character of his in the king 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.710
 King of Fighters or partner ghosn and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.450
 winner was bojan so the filling 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.190
 fighters had to implement this 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.980
 character known as an angel 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.780
 the chosen one was from 394 place the firm that 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.480
 he can turn the statue into 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.910
 fighters that he played and in a scene 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.500
 where he shows his data clearly he 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.750
 can see that the fighters that 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.190
 turns into a statue are neither more nor less 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.190
 that street fighter fighters 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.460
 the scene is the character that more times 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.900
 Costume has changed in 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.200
 different deliveries of the king of 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.409
 fighters 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.320
 every 9999 is based on the co 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.080
 protagonist of the akira anime called 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.420
 Quechua 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.110
 and today although it is hard to believe the hatred 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.270
 the violence 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.070
 Mexico is a country where they play 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.600
 many the king of fighters them like 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.580
 thank you sign they decided 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.290
 put landscapes of mexico in their 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.830
 different deliveries as well as characters 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.830
 Mexicans 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.080
 in 1999 two kilos emerged, this was 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.880
 because the developers do not 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.360
 they knew whether to put the team design 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.400
 with the design of 94 or 95 so that 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.960
 better they decided to put them both and 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.960
 redesign the original 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.650
 we all wondered what they meant 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.590
 the little faces that appeared in the verse of 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.599
 the delivery of 98 well the truth 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.269
 happy means you get along the 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.910
 angry they get and the neutral is 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.220
 who do not know each other 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.990
 the sicarios warriors appear as 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.270
 playable characters in the metal slug 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.180
 double x of psp 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.150
 now it is the easiest final boss of 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.519
 beat all deliveries 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.019
 lioness in being possessed was brothers and 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.019
 dead to his true family 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.260
 the character called fact and this 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.420
 obviously he has inspired the character 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.120
 called freddy krueger 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.640
 mine was the character in using a 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.770
 2d effect to be able to do the animation 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.200
 of his posture in which the hairs 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.910
 will bounce as well as in the posture 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.910
 of victory called nippon ichi 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.970
 We all had asked if it was 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.300
 boy or girl until it was claimed that it was 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.300
 boy 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.470
 although it does not seem like it, main is the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.780
 character with the greatest beauties in 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.120
 The king of fighters as it is surpassed 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.630
 for characters like what are my and 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.110
 Angel 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.780
 there is also a link but it is not known if the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.440
 exceeds no but at first glance you can see that 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:43.099
 if so it is caught with you miley 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.989
 has an inspiration door in roppongi 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.900
 I do not have a clone of nes nor is it 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.610
 that I kusanagi owned by rossi but 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.959
 which is actually a product of magic 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.959
 from chizuru kagura 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.410
 in the king of fighters 2002 the special 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.260
 or fifth angel is based on the 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.620
 famous rock key called people 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.540
 the bou 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.849
 in the king of fighters again because 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.060
 you can play with yuki the girlfriend of 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:13.159
 9999 whom I would no longer be the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.680
 following integral equine fighters 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:18.109
 that's because the company that had 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.989
 the rights called the lead did not want him 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.400
 sell the rights to snk that is already 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.620
 had returned to a company of its own 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.139
 new so they better decided to make a 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.930
 character with different design but with 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.710
 the new powers of cars 9999 called 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.050
 gamers 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.180
 without the golden chest if you can see 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.580
 clearly represented the eight heads 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.340
 of snake as it is represented 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.889
 inside Japanese mythology 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.600
 calculates they use the same technique of the fist 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.510
 of an inch from brooklyn 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.430
 The color of regular hair expresses 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.650
 blond and this is affirmed after a 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.280
 big fight animation in the the 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.800
 king of fighters 2000 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.960
 Robert is based on the actor and artist 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.330
 martial steven seagal 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.789
 oh clear he likes wrestling so much 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.289
 it is so it has other ramón floor 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.569
 as king d 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.189
 Legend has it that one day 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.770
 you play with pray in the king of 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.909
 fighters of 2002 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.749
 unfortunately you are a great coward 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.749
 son of 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.860
 and well those are some curiosities 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.900
 of the king of fighters if you know 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.700
