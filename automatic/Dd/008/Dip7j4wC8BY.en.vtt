 in the year 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.809
 and if you want to know something or so I wanted to ask you last question 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:46.949
 now that it's lending me lately or something like that, or something like that 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.949

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.989
 Euro the socks now in the bureau of last year's Swiss game minute 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.659
 It was still a lot of venue 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.649
 and if so, what would you rather hear the mouth was 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:01.690
 hissing 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.889
 personally is getting from these cells and 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.959
 also dismiss funny comments if it is about German 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.559
 Stick at the stroke with innocence it does not strike Borgward again 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:13.459

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.590
 and I think so much but too much 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.370
 or too little 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.719

 Andy february may be so busy because we are all here 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:46.469
 and that will take five days four days three days 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.410
 then record completely unnecessary 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.270

 the race is over 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.589
 where God is the driver or 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:08.589
 and God becomes Mercury 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.210
 Euro 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.680
 after the Werder 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.050
 God knows that he is not Greenpeace 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.050
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.229
 Hmm 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.909
 everything is shaking 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.490
 Roman God, what is that? 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.330
 Vauxhall 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.659
 This is 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:40.529
 BogotÃ¡ 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:43.529
 I do not want to know what it is 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.360
 for determining son 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.189
 89 euros 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:50.189
 so that should be most dangerous or something 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:53.039
 the appearance is never 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.039
 became the houses 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:59.539
 Bruni to us 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.199
 without a box 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.770
 the beaten 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.780

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.309
 how the lodging relate 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:10.939
 But I hope I agree 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:12.770
 claiming 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.770
 good food marching 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.590
 and then 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.660
 which Speers market has not stored organized delimited discovered 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.379
 demonstrate 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:25.740
 just 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.059
 if the content is extremely scared the first time 

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:31.379
 and worry in the city 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:33.339
 worried with scare 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:34.669
 for him the fear 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:35.840
 the area is 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.999
 Menderes 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:40.610
 so that's what the DB is for research 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.159
 with the novel stands 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:46.159
 they look a bit disgusting 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.020
 and look 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.740
 the bankruptcy 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.110
 you are dead 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.800

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:08.149
 volume up 

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:10.860
 then I have already shown that 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.860
 this giant part 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:17.939
 I'll make the fight narrow Index Part 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.639
 because I do not know if Milan lasts 

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:25.180
 I'm no longer saying Kleinschmidt 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.009
 Footprint so full footbridge 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:31.210
