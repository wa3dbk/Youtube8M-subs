leaning<00:02:03.890> over<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.490> probably<00:02:05.060> should<00:02:05.240> have<00:02:05.360> done

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
leaning over I probably should have done

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.420 
leaning over I probably should have done
this<00:02:05.810> before<00:02:06.290> I<00:02:06.320> crop<00:02:06.710> but<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.040> really<00:02:07.189> doesn't

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
this before I crop but it really doesn't

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.219 
this before I crop but it really doesn't
matter<00:02:07.700> we're<00:02:08.450> just<00:02:08.659> going<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.840> straighten

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
matter we're just going to straighten

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.830 
matter we're just going to straighten
this<00:02:09.409> thing<00:02:09.470> out<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.970> is<00:02:11.420> better<00:02:11.599> to

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
this thing out it is better to

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.960

straighten<00:02:12.769> before<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.159> crop<00:02:13.400> because<00:02:13.610> when

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
straighten before you crop because when

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.220 
straighten before you crop because when
you<00:02:14.090> straighten<00:02:14.629> you<00:02:14.720> often<00:02:15.250> leave<00:02:17.230> it'll

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
you straighten you often leave it'll

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.229 
you straighten you often leave it'll
mess<00:02:18.379> up<00:02:18.560> your<00:02:18.769> crop<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.549> you<00:02:19.640> have<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:19.849> recrawl

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
going to give us the opportunity to just

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.910 
going to give us the opportunity to just
look<00:04:48.150> at<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.480> sky<00:04:48.780> let's<00:04:49.320> do<00:04:49.440> it<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.650> sky

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
look at the sky let's do it the sky

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.790 
look at the sky let's do it the sky
first<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.820> want<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.840> bring<00:04:52.170> it<00:04:52.350> down<00:04:52.380> about

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
first I want to bring it down about

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.790 
first I want to bring it down about
right<00:04:53.070> there<00:04:53.340> now<00:04:53.640> realize<00:04:54.540> I'm<00:04:54.900> also<00:04:55.530> going

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
right there now realize I'm also going

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.650 
right there now realize I'm also going
to<00:04:55.860> darken<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.400> sign<00:04:56.760> because<00:04:57.300> it's<00:04:57.450> going<00:04:57.600> to

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
to darken the sign because it's going to

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.910 
to darken the sign because it's going to
be<00:04:57.780> too<00:04:58.370> critical<00:04:59.370> and<00:04:59.960> too<00:05:00.960> difficult<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.770> not

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
be too critical and too difficult to not

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.960 
be too critical and too difficult to not
get<00:05:02.160> halos<00:05:02.580> around<00:05:02.610> this<00:05:03.090> sign<00:05:03.420> here<00:05:03.750> so

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
get halos around this sign here so

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.670 
get halos around this sign here so
that's<00:05:05.970> okay<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:06.600> I<00:05:06.660> can<00:05:07.020> be<00:05:07.140> a<00:05:07.170> kind<00:05:07.530> of

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
that's okay and I can be a kind of

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.740 
that's okay and I can be a kind of
radical<00:05:07.890> with<00:05:08.460> this<00:05:08.670> when<00:05:09.090> I'm<00:05:09.180> looking<00:05:09.450> at<00:05:09.570> it

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
radical with this when I'm looking at it

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.350 
radical with this when I'm looking at it
that's<00:05:10.710> fine<00:05:11.040> because<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.460> can<00:05:11.640> readjust<00:05:11.970> it

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
that's fine because I can readjust it

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.210 
that's fine because I can readjust it
after<00:05:12.750> I<00:05:12.780> brush<00:05:13.050> it<00:05:13.110> in<00:05:13.410> now<00:05:13.620> we'll<00:05:13.770> say<00:05:13.950> brush

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
after I brush it in now we'll say brush

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.460 
after I brush it in now we'll say brush
curves<00:05:14.550> in<00:05:14.870> we<00:05:15.870> want<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.140> fairly<00:05:16.620> large<00:05:18.290> we<00:05:19.290> want

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
curves in we want a fairly large we want

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.590 
curves in we want a fairly large we want
a<00:05:19.560> pretty<00:05:19.800> large<00:05:20.070> brush<00:05:20.610> here<00:05:20.940> now<00:05:21.150> notice<00:05:21.450> I'm

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
a pretty large brush here now notice I'm

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.970 
a pretty large brush here now notice I'm
just<00:05:21.780> kind<00:05:21.960> of<00:05:22.020> get<00:05:22.170> in<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.320> middle<00:05:22.560> just<00:05:22.830> to

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
just kind of get in the middle just to

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.690 
just kind of get in the middle just to
get<00:05:23.100> a<00:05:23.130> feel<00:05:23.460> for<00:05:23.730> this<00:05:23.880> let's<00:05:25.430> decrease<00:05:26.430> the

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
get a feel for this let's decrease the

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.560 
get a feel for this let's decrease the
size<00:05:26.910> of<00:05:27.180> our<00:05:27.270> brush<00:05:27.860> quite<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:28.890> lot<00:05:29.480> take<00:05:30.480> it

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
size of our brush quite a lot take it

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.930 
size of our brush quite a lot take it
down<00:05:30.660> about
