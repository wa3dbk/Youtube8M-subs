00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.509

 of autumn brings green tones and brown coughs and 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.820
 good this palette I have it sealed 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.440
 because I have two the one that I'm using 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.440
 for the look is this from here 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.440
 that as you can see here this does not bring 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.829
 that tone but good obviously not what 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.420
 need but use others and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.860
 well this is the proposal that I 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.780
 I bring this is my option of this 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.399
 makeup although the truth with all 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 these are the ones we have here we can 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.460
 make many variations of makeup 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.559
 jazz in green tones in greens and also 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.720
 we can make a kind of tuxedo 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.720
 with this tone that is very nice 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.049
 there it is so if you want to watch the video 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.509
 so keep watching I'm going to start 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.509
 using my first shadow of him 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.969
 let's apply it and blur it for everything 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:24.969
 eyelid 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.850
 the first shadow that I will take will be this 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.070
 tone here that is a very dark green 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.200
 with flashes I'm going to apply it with a 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.909
 flat brush what I will do is mark 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.909
 from the corner of my eye 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.110
 and getting into the account 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.229
 since I did that I'm going to take this shadow 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.659
 hence, it is a coffee with very bright 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.850
 pretty the shadow I'm going to apply it with a 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.320
 brush to blur I will blur 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.320
 this tone rising 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.320
 without reaching my eyebrows 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.010
 As the dark tone is lost I'm going to 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.010
 retouch it 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.359
 I'm going to take this vanilla shadow of 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.620
 I visu with a clean brush and go to 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.620
 clean my eyebrow 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.849
 and now I'm going to take this click study 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.069
 clear with a clean little bag and what 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.120
 I will apply this miracle and evil to 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.120
 one third of the eye 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.480
 with the same brush I'm going to take this 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.470
 green tone I'm going to apply it in the second 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.470
 third of the eye 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.360
 blurring both tones 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.890
 here I am taking a bit of the tone 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.890
 dark and I'm going to blur 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.189
 from the bottom I'm also going to 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.189
 apply the green tone 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.640
 and I'm going to take this dark tone and I'm going 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.640
 apply it in the corner of my eye 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.590
 and now I'm going to do my delineated with 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.590
 This plugin viso 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.320
 and I'm going to be applying this tab in 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.320
 false 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.830
 and well, it's already there to start the 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.400
 change that the false eyelash gives 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.400
 this makeup 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.719
 and well there she is and our eye 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.719
 finished 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.709
 of the track do not use an orange tone 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.459
 I put this best lady called law 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.459
 without handle 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.040

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.199
 on top of that lipstick like this tone is 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.380
 mui mate and in this case there is a 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:28.710
 little bit of brightness apply this gloss of 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.720
 visu that is this coconut but then 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.550
 any transparent is fine and 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.800
 well nothing this is the makeup I hope 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.290
 that they liked that they put it in 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.750
 practice if they have the pallet share they are 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.710
 of wet and white or looking for environments 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.630
