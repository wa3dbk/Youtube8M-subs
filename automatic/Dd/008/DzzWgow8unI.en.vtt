survival<00:00:34.700> three<00:00:35.630> days<00:00:35.810> without<00:00:36.020> water<00:00:36.200> and

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
survival three days without water and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.010 
survival three days without water and
you<00:00:37.010> become<00:00:37.310> totally<00:00:37.730> dehydrated<00:00:37.900> and<00:00:38.900> you

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.160 
Pakistan and in Africa and the LifeStraw
is<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.330> really<00:02:49.870> super<00:02:50.830> lightweight<00:02:52.170> water

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
is a really super lightweight water

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.380 
is a really super lightweight water
filtration<00:02:53.560> system<00:02:54.250> that<00:02:54.400> is<00:02:54.489> so<00:02:54.760> easy<00:02:55.150> to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
filtration system that is so easy to

LifeStraw<00:02:58.120> was<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:58.540> innovative<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.800> was

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
LifeStraw was so innovative that it was

LifeStraw was so innovative that it was
Time<00:03:00.250> Magazine's<00:03:00.880> best<00:03:01.000> invention<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:01.989> 2005

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
Time Magazine's best invention of 2005

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.220 
Time Magazine's best invention of 2005
now<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.519> filtration<00:03:04.030> system<00:03:04.209> itself<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.200> a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
now the filtration system itself is a

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.890 
now the filtration system itself is a
hollow<00:03:05.620> fiber<00:03:06.070> membrane<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.660> means

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
hollow fiber membrane and that means

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.560 
hollow fiber membrane and that means
that<00:03:08.170> there's<00:03:08.440> no<00:03:08.799> chemicals<00:03:09.459> no<00:03:10.000> batteries

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
that there's no chemicals no batteries

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.170 
that there's no chemicals no batteries
no<00:03:10.840> iodine<00:03:11.170> no<00:03:12.070> moving<00:03:12.370> parts<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.910> really

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
no iodine no moving parts is really

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.090 
no iodine no moving parts is really
simple<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:14.350> way<00:03:14.470> this<00:03:14.650> can<00:03:14.860> be<00:03:14.950> given

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
simple and that way this can be given

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.860 
simple and that way this can be given
out<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.700> different<00:03:16.360> people

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
out to different people

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.979 
out to different people
just<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.709> use<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.130> it's<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:18.430> simple<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:19.299> use<00:03:19.810> it

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
just to use and it's so simple to use it

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.800 
just to use and it's so simple to use it

breaks down contaminants to 0.2 microns

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.420 
breaks down contaminants to 0.2 microns
and<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.650> filters<00:03:24.070> out<00:03:24.690> 99.99%<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:26.500> any

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
and that filters out 99.99% of any

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.050 
and that filters out 99.99% of any
bacteria<00:03:28.170> even<00:03:29.170> ecoli<00:03:30.060> Cryptosporidium

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
Giardia and it does meet EPA standards

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.900 
Giardia and it does meet EPA standards
it<00:03:34.690> has<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.840> three<00:03:35.200> year<00:03:35.410> shelf<00:03:35.440> life<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.310> it

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
it has a three year shelf life and it

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.340 
it has a three year shelf life and it
will<00:03:37.060> filter<00:03:37.570> up<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.950> 1,000<00:03:38.950> liters<00:03:39.310> or<00:03:40.350> 264

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
will filter up to 1,000 liters or 264

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.590 
will filter up to 1,000 liters or 264
gallons<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.519> really<00:03:42.880> equates<00:03:43.299> to<00:03:43.420> about

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
gallons and that really equates to about
