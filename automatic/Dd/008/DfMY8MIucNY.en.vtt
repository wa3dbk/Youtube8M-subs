00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
all right so today we're gonna have a

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.919 
all right so today we're gonna have a
look<00:00:06.509> at<00:00:06.750> how<00:00:07.099> oxidation<00:00:08.099> effects<00:00:09.030> your

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
look at how oxidation effects your

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.459 
look at how oxidation effects your
smoothie<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:11.120> used<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.240> make<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> smoothie<00:00:12.960> using

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
smoothie I used to make a smoothie using

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.230 
smoothie I used to make a smoothie using
this<00:00:13.590> blender<00:00:14.420> all<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.630> time<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:17.240> that

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
this blender all the time and that

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.240 
this blender all the time and that
seemed<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.539> work<00:00:18.570> alright<00:00:19.050> but<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.710> did<00:00:20.070> notice

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
seemed to work alright but I did notice

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.000 
seemed to work alright but I did notice
that<00:00:20.490> my<00:00:21.090> smoothie<00:00:21.449> did<00:00:21.630> turn<00:00:21.840> brown<00:00:22.289> after<00:00:22.680> a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
that my smoothie did turn brown after a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.000 
that my smoothie did turn brown after a
little<00:00:23.160> while<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.730> start<00:00:24.570> tasting<00:00:24.900> not<00:00:25.680> so

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
little while and start tasting not so

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.040 
little while and start tasting not so
good<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.000> course<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.330> all<00:00:27.449> know<00:00:27.480> what

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
good and of course we all know what

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.650 
good and of course we all know what
happens<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.740> banana<00:00:29.099> left<00:00:29.699> out<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> while

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
happens to a banana left out for a while

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.020 
happens to a banana left out for a while
it<00:00:30.900> turns<00:00:31.140> brown<00:00:31.410> cut<00:00:32.250> an<00:00:32.369> apple<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.850> turns

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it turns brown cut an apple it turns

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.690 
it turns brown cut an apple it turns
brown<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.870> called<00:00:34.230> oxidation<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
brown this is called oxidation it's the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.049 
brown this is called oxidation it's the
oxygen<00:00:35.969> acting<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:38.070> fruit<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.610> food<00:00:38.820> and

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
oxygen acting on the fruit the food and

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.060 
oxygen acting on the fruit the food and
oxidizing<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.469> don't<00:00:40.620> want<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.860> because

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
oxidizing and we don't want that because

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100 
oxidizing and we don't want that because
that<00:00:41.489> means<00:00:41.640> we're<00:00:41.910> losing<00:00:42.270> nutrients<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.020> of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
that means we're losing nutrients and of

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.860 
that means we're losing nutrients and of
course<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.469> tastes<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:44.840> then<00:00:45.840> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
course it tastes like then I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.590 
course it tastes like then I
realize<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.160> avoid<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.969> vortex

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
realize that if I can avoid the vortex

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.619 
realize that if I can avoid the vortex
that<00:00:48.899> forms<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.590> blender<00:00:50.510> island<00:00:51.510> by

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
that forms in the blender island by

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.110 
that forms in the blender island by
pulse<00:00:52.020> blending<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> wort<00:00:53.340> X<00:00:53.520> never<00:00:53.699> forms

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
pulse blending so the wort X never forms

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.930 
pulse blending so the wort X never forms
or<00:00:54.480> by<00:00:54.960> using<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.379> stick<00:00:55.710> blender<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.370> hand

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
or by using a stick blender or a hand

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.569 
or by using a stick blender or a hand
mixer<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.539> some<00:00:57.780> people<00:00:58.020> call<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:59.280> just

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
mixer like some people call it and just

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.330 
mixer like some people call it and just
blend<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> straight<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> jar<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:01.340> could

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
blend it straight in the jar I could

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.399 
blend it straight in the jar I could
avoid<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> filled<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.750> my<00:01:03.780> jar<00:01:04.229> with

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
avoid that so I filled up my jar with

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.890 
avoid that so I filled up my jar with
bananas<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.939> filled<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> blender<00:01:06.510> open

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
bananas and I filled up the blender open

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.539 
bananas and I filled up the blender open
ass<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.320> I'm<00:01:07.409> gonna<00:01:07.560> start<00:01:08.070> blending<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
ass and I'm gonna start blending and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.330 
ass and I'm gonna start blending and
then<00:01:08.700> we're<00:01:08.790> gonna<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> look<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.479> how<00:01:09.720> it

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
then we're gonna have a look at how it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.100 
then we're gonna have a look at how it
effects<00:01:11.340> our<00:01:11.640> smoothie<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.570> I'm<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.020> gonna

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
effects our smoothie so I'm just gonna

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:31.890 
effects our smoothie so I'm just gonna
start<00:01:13.380> blending

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:50.859 

that<00:01:32.900> vortex<00:01:33.200> sucks<00:01:33.979> in<00:01:34.369> air<00:01:49.360> so<00:01:50.360> because<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
that vortex sucks in air so because the

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.870 
that vortex sucks in air so because the
stick<00:01:51.290> blender<00:01:51.440> always<00:01:52.009> stay<00:01:52.250> immersed

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
stick blender always stay immersed

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.399 
stick blender always stay immersed
thousand<00:01:53.509> dollars<00:01:53.690> an<00:01:53.869> immersion<00:01:54.380> blender

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
thousand dollars an immersion blender

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.249 
thousand dollars an immersion blender
actually<00:01:55.040> always<00:01:55.970> they<00:01:56.210> immersed<00:01:56.570> under<00:01:56.780> the

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
actually always they immersed under the

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.600 
actually always they immersed under the
surface<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.040> smoothie

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
surface of the smoothie

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.930 
surface of the smoothie
it<00:01:59.179> doesn't<00:01:59.840> suck<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.530> lot<00:02:00.800> of<00:02:00.920> oxygen<00:02:01.460> into<00:02:01.820> the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
it doesn't suck a lot of oxygen into the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.870 
it doesn't suck a lot of oxygen into the
smoothie<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.479> oxidizes<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:03.830> it's<00:02:04.700> much

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
smoothie and oxidizes it so it's much

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.259 
smoothie and oxidizes it so it's much
better<00:02:05.800> so<00:02:06.800> now<00:02:06.830> we're<00:02:07.490> going<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.670> leave<00:02:07.909> our

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
better so now we're going to leave our

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.170 
better so now we're going to leave our
to<00:02:08.959> smoothies<00:02:09.500> on<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.920> counter<00:02:10.369> for<00:02:10.550> about

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
to smoothies on the counter for about

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.960 
to smoothies on the counter for about
five<00:02:11.510> or<00:02:11.540> ten<00:02:11.989> minutes<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:12.730> then<00:02:13.730> we're<00:02:13.850> going

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
five or ten minutes and then we're going

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.660 
five or ten minutes and then we're going
to<00:02:14.000> come<00:02:14.209> back<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.630> we're<00:02:14.810> going<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.959> see<00:02:15.670> how

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
to come back and we're going to see how

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.670 
to come back and we're going to see how
they're<00:02:16.880> doing<00:02:17.000> actually<00:02:17.810> already<00:02:18.319> if<00:02:18.530> you

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
they're doing actually already if you

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.500 
they're doing actually already if you
look<00:02:19.160> here<00:02:19.370> well<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.670> could<00:02:19.850> already<00:02:19.970> see

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
look here well you could already see

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.979 
look here well you could already see
that<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:21.200> one<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:21.530> kind<00:02:21.709> of<00:02:21.800> grey<00:02:22.989> whereas

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
that this one is kind of grey whereas

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.960 
that this one is kind of grey whereas
this<00:02:24.140> one<00:02:24.319> is<00:02:24.350> more<00:02:24.620> yellow<00:02:24.860> looking<00:02:25.340> we're

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
this one is more yellow looking we're

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.050 
this one is more yellow looking we're
back<00:02:26.120> in<00:02:26.239> five<00:02:26.450> minutes<00:02:26.480> okay<00:02:27.489> so<00:02:28.489> it's<00:02:28.880> been

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
back in five minutes okay so it's been

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.340 
back in five minutes okay so it's been
about<00:02:29.209> five<00:02:29.660> minutes<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.810> smooth<00:02:33.079> is<00:02:33.230> up

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
about five minutes and the smooth is up

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.890 
about five minutes and the smooth is up
just<00:02:33.380> been<00:02:34.100> sitting<00:02:34.400> on<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.579> counter<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.209> I

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
just been sitting on the counter and I

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.860
