 official minecraft server with which 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.970
 you can install a series of plugins 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.020

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.580

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.600

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.969
 bucket and all this 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.970
 Well, the first thing we do is go 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.160
 a white 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.990
 and darling that you have the description of 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.990
 Video to download the file 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.190
 what would this be 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.469
 and we download it 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.619
 and where you want to draw me 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.619
 I want the desk 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.700
 It's worth this and we can throw it away 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.960
 and then we have the folder that 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.630
 you put airlines kraft 1 point 2.5 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.350
 well you have inside these two files 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.890
 and taiz al crack butt kraft bucket point 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.200
 hard double click and it will load 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.530
 create another series of files here 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.530
 inside 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.230
 through some 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.380
 and good is already 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.830
 now to see now you have to open the 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.780
 machi 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.550
 that's why I told you I had about the other 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.060
 video because we install the hamchi 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.320
 it's good 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.250
 and copies the address that he puts here 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.350
 ipv4 the right button on top and copy 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.399
 open will be file then server property 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.399
 it is this that is here inside 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.569
 and you look for this that puts server and p 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.180
 it is 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.040
 you are going to paste what you had copied from 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.829
 the machi and that's going to be the ip of 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.579
 server then something else here where he puts 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.579
 online mode you put to medium true folk 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.750
 ok that would be all we close save 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.840
 changes yes 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.910
 and to start the server like it is not 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.590
 everything is to minimize to start the 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.470
 server you have to give this album bad 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.200
 lic 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.650
 the server starts creating the map and 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.650
 of everything 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.640
 for a little bit but good 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.780
 good while this is loaded 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.050
 you remember that we had copied the key 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.580
 they are in the ip good because it will do us 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.890
 is missing now to enter the same 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.900
 server 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.030
 when it's over 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.299
 ok you have finished creating the map 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.780
 now we can minimize the server 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.780
 open minecraft 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:32.600
 well and you put it in full screen 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.600
 as you want to enter 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.740
 and we're just going to multiplayer with 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.500
 until you show us anything like that 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.800
 that I'm going to remove it and daisa 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.390
 adserver 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.090
 well up here you can the name that 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.860
 whatever you want 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:55.270

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.480

 and you have it here double click on rise 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.290
 quietly as if it were really 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.900
 it's like it's a normal server 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.870
 but good later I'll do other 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.590

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.200
 useful plugins for 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.450
 so that you have more things in 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.460

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.830
