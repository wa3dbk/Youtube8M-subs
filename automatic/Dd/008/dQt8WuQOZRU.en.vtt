00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 translated and voiced while you sit and watch 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.270
 There are many reasons to envy the birds 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.910
 for example they can fly and if you 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.650
 the male is guaranteed gorgeous in birds 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.060
 even have the ability to healthy 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.250
 long-term relationship 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.560
 but today scientists have finally started 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.620
 find out what the world really looks like 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.239
 the eyes of birds and he is beautiful earlier we 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.790
 discussed what birds can see 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.520
 earth's magnetic field but do you know what 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.100
 they see also ultraviolet we are people 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.690
 equipped with three types of receptors 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.410
 red blue caps 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.730
 and green in birds as their 4 4 species 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.500
 cones allows them to see in 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.360
 ultraviolet spectrum and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.460
 it turns out that most birds are on 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.320
 actually more beautiful than we think about them and 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.629
 can glow no worse than raiders under 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.789
 European color 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.559
 the blue azure is pretty 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.689
 human range of light but under 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.909
 ultraviolet tips and feathers glow 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.920
 like a christmas tree ultraviolet 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.600
 reflect not only the birds we just him 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.970
 do not perceive high content 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.890
 phosphorus in the urine makes it bright 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.479
 glows under ultra violet what can 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.369
 useful for tracking meadow 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.060
 voles if you are a hungry kestrel on 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.100
 hunting 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.080
 but not only due to magnetic fields and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.240
 additional colors of birds such 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.850
 unusual for us birds and there is 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.740
 a special fossa or phobia aveo 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.030
 this . on the retina possessing the most 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.280
 high resolution 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.409
 if you are a man then you have one hole 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.540
 in every eye and that's fine but there is 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.040
 constraint try this look at 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.240
 close one eye and try me 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.729
 read the text on both sides 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.920
 at the same time complicated and all because 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.630
 that your phobia covers only 40 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.250
 degrees midfield a 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.530
 highest concentration of cones 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.149
 covers only 10 degrees so 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.649
 while you looked at me something could not 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.570
 see all the words and could not 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.759
 focus on them let alone 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.329
 tom to read them and birds again 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.430
 Lead and have birds of prey as much as two holes in 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.030
 every eye that allows the eye 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.650
 work 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.380
 cameras simultaneously with macro and 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.520
 zoom lens mi-1 fossa gives focus 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.380
 on remote sites 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.970
 and the other allows you to see in detail 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.250
 objects right in front of them 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.860
 but in seabirds and one big handicap 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.200
 in the form of a strip instead of a point it passes 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.330
 across the entire retina so the horizon in 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.209
 flight time is clearly and clearly visible 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.920
 and here is another proof look 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.620
 through a small hole in paper 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.000
 tubes or just do it like this 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.250
 focus on the light sources behind this 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.480
 but at least on the monitor and just 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.880
 patricia and a little 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.970
 in a couple of seconds you will see 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.370
 eye vessels well or shadow cast 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.800
 them on your retina intensity 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.080
 light flux falling on the retina 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.090
 constantly but there are fast tiny 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.400
 deflection in the direction of this light 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.890
 just like a bird flying through 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.989
 foliage when this happens almost all 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.600
 your field of vision may be in the shadow 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.730
 vessels and if you try to see 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.340
 mouse at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.230
 no entries were released but the birds 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.170
 there is a unique structure in the eye 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.450
 apple eye comb is such outgrowths 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.160
 with many blood vessels therefore 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.600
 eye tissue get all needed 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.250
 nutrients but at the same time 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.110
 reduced the need for vessels 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.390
 the whole eye that does not obscure the retina 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.299
 therefore in such light conditions their 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.459
 vision remains super clear as a result they 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.130
 see more colors than we do these colors 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.320
 brighter and they see electromagnetic fields a 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.019
 their eyes have more lotions than the camera 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.410
 my mobile phone to be a bird is enough 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.410
 cool
