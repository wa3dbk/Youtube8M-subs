maverick<00:00:13.650> metric<00:00:14.340> prototype<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.150> actually

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
maverick metric prototype I actually

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.840 
maverick metric prototype I actually
received<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.900> head<00:00:16.220> from<00:00:17.220> Billy<00:00:17.520> when<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.730> was

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
received this head from Billy when I was

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.550 
received this head from Billy when I was
stringing<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.119> bunch<00:00:18.300> up<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.080> they

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
stringing a bunch up for them and they

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.170 
stringing a bunch up for them and they
never<00:00:19.859> really<00:00:20.070> got<00:00:20.189> around<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.850> string<00:00:21.090> this

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
never really got around to string this

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.609 
never really got around to string this
one<00:00:21.330> up<00:00:21.390> for<00:00:21.510> him<00:00:21.630> he<00:00:21.750> really<00:00:22.170> didn't<00:00:22.410> need<00:00:22.500> it

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
one up for him he really didn't need it

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.840 
one up for him he really didn't need it
because<00:00:22.710> they<00:00:22.949> came<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.699> actual

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
because they came out with the actual

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.640 
because they came out with the actual
production<00:00:24.210> model<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.140> had<00:00:25.260> laying<00:00:25.500> around

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
production model so we had laying around

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.009 
production model so we had laying around
and<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.340> didn't<00:00:26.640> want<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.510> play<00:00:27.960> with

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
and we didn't want to you know play with

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.150 
and we didn't want to you know play with
things<00:00:28.170> like<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.740> really<00:00:28.920> coolest

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
things like that it's really coolest

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.919 
things like that it's really coolest
this<00:00:29.220> prototype<00:00:29.519> across<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.810> know

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
this prototype across it and you know

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.889 
this prototype across it and you know
the<00:00:31.080> prototypes<00:00:31.500> aren't<00:00:31.830> always<00:00:32.070> 100%<00:00:32.940> until

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the prototypes aren't always 100% until

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.970 
the prototypes aren't always 100% until
they<00:00:33.989> get<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> factory<00:00:34.500> one<00:00:34.620> now<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
they get the factory one now that the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
they get the factory one now that the
factory<00:00:35.309> ones<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.670> out<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.239> definitely<00:00:36.450> just

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
factory ones are out I definitely just

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.729 
factory ones are out I definitely just
want<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.989> play<00:00:37.079> with<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.350> cuz<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.500> don't<00:00:37.559> want

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
want to play with that cuz I don't want

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.720 
want to play with that cuz I don't want
to<00:00:37.800> break<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.070> thing<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.399> definitely

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
to break this thing it's definitely

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.580 
to break this thing it's definitely
super<00:00:39.120> cool<00:00:39.420> seeing<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.690> prototype<00:00:40.110> across<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
super cool seeing a prototype across the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.350 
super cool seeing a prototype across the
top<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.430> decided<00:00:41.760> I'm<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.120> know<00:00:42.239> we

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
top and so we decided I'm you know we

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.610 
top and so we decided I'm you know we
really<00:00:42.540> love<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> metric<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.590> just

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
really love the metric here and we just

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.049 
really love the metric here and we just
started<00:00:43.920> carrying<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.340> they're<00:00:44.550> an<00:00:44.640> awesome

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
started carrying it they're an awesome

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.459 
started carrying it they're an awesome

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
thrown leather I'm using you know my

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.039 
thrown leather I'm using you know my
I've<00:01:02.969> strong<00:01:03.239> enough<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.780> as<00:01:03.899> my

I've strong enough so it's just as my
tutorial<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.729> metric<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:06.180> they're

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
tutorial is in a metric because they're

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.940 
tutorial is in a metric because they're
a<00:01:06.390> super<00:01:06.990> awesome<00:01:07.140> head<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.650> they<00:01:07.710> take

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
a super awesome head and they take

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.219 
a super awesome head and they take
traditional<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.790> really<00:01:09.330> well<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.540> it's

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
traditional really really well so it's

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.660 
traditional really really well so it's
an<00:01:10.320> All<00:01:10.470> Whites<00:01:10.680> got<00:01:10.950> thrown<00:01:11.220> leather<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.610> an

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
an All Whites got thrown leather it's an

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
an All Whites got thrown leather it's an
all-white<00:01:12.000> kit<00:01:12.299> same<00:01:13.080> exact<00:01:13.380> thing<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.740> guys
