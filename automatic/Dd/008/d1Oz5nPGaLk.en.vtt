 she revolutionized the autoworld 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.460
 brought technical innovations or 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.280
 the masses moved automobiles 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.020
 milestones

 test driver christoph bauer drives the 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.820
 most important cars of history 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.650
 the time house of the autostadt in wolfsburg 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.810
 christoph bauer is allowed to visit more than one 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.810
 Select 210 milestones 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.550
 Today he chooses one 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.550
 Speed ​​wonders from the 60s 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.960
 the honda s 800 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.559
 Today, honda sells almost four worldwide 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.780
 million vehicles and is considered the largest 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.659
 motorcycle manufacturer in the world to 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.170
 international breakthrough as 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.359
 automobile producer owes the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.710
 Japanese company this pretty 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.809
 sports car 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.729
 in the 60 years since they had with us 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.190
 yes massive prejudices against 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.770
 Japanese car manufacturers the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.050
 rice bowl from the Far East is back 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.430
 technically outdated and qualitative 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.060
 Inferior at that time it was called 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.770
 but then in 1967 the first Japanese 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.190
 automobile officially to germany 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.159
 the honda s 800 was imported there 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.880
 some of the jaws worked very hard 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.080
 downward 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.080
 and that has a reason 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.990
 9000 turns made it 800 and that 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.940
 never 60 ton experience in the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.850
 Motorcycle construction provided the know-how for 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.950
 The high speed engine engineers of the th 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.920
 Brunswick towered the engine in the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.530
 60s supposedly to over 12,000 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.900
 turns per minute then there was one 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.030
 bang the engine stopped but the test bench 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.160
 was broken what the performance per liter 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.260
 Hubraum angeht there could be the honda s 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.800
 800 even with the former formula one 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.450
 take up 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.370
 From 0 to 8 liters , the unbelievable 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.070
 67 ps that's about as if one 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.470
 modern small car with 1 6 liters 135 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.290
 ps and without 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.820
 turbo and without compressor or other 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.890
 tricks there it is not surprising that 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.080
 Honda engines in the formula for 1 year 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.470
 the nose in front had what the speed 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.470
 As for 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.379
 creates up to 160 kilometers per hour 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.569
 the honda s 800 is significantly more than 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:39.080
 comparable european sports works 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.300
 by fiat triumph or mg also acoustically 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.660
 like the little Japanese in its own 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.660
 league 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.870
 the sound is sound unbelievable 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.230
 Swarm hornets in the dive kamikaze 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.230
 different 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.450
 middle ages meets ipad 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.040
 the tuscan fortress monteriggioni in 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.530
 near siena 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.310
 a dream setting for the picture pretty 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.580
 Honda is not a casual companion 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.020
 the honda s 800 a classic 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.360
 sports car in pocket size 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.940
 but the real highlight is sitting 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.130
 here under the hood a four-cylinder 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.630
 with 0.8 liters displacement two 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.820
 overhead camshafts and four 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.410
 so gassing that the engineers of 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.000
 honda managed to get one 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.400
 purebred racing genset 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.020
 to make everyday use that bordered in 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.180
 the sixties already a miracle 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.120
 and allegedly you have yourself in porsche 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.710
 indeed one ordered it to domestic to 800 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.210
 just dissect the engine 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.840
 study purposes as if that were not 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.480
 Knight's knight is the elegant one 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.370
 especially in 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.320
 the also offered convertible 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:57.280
 variation on classic English 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.280
 roadster like triumph tr 4 or mgb 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.629
 The body rests on a massive 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:08.900
 box frame what the live weight on 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:10.580
 lush 7 182 kilograms lives for driving pleasure 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.310
 make the rocker switch in joy stick 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.530
 format the rich instrumentarium 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.420
 and the engine with spherical 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.410
 combustion chambers and needle 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.410
 stored crankshaft 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.730
 Sports car typical leaves the hard 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.220
 Chassis miss any comfort 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.980
 especially the rear star axle bumps 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.550
 and hops over ground waves of the honda s 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.830
 800 it just 3 meters 33 short and 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.930
 from straight forward can not be the 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.170
 be talking one is the whole time on 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.090
 but correct that, which sharpens the 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.250
 Concentration and you need it here 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.990
 also because he likes to do so 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.220
 clock suddenly from understeer and 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.730
 to change oversteer 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:56.210
 and also when braking is great 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.710
 Tiptoe texture issues with dunlop 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.870
 Disc brakes on the front axle 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.940
 delayed honda courageously kicks 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.830
 on the pedal but vehemently the 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.230
 Dosability leaves much to be desired 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.890
 the driving fun diminishes this 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.890
 but hardly 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.379
 So he's really fun but you 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.930
 already has a certain ability to suffer 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.909
 bring along because I do not know yet 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.530
 where to put my feet and 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.720
 had to jump out of the car before 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.639
 which cramp in the calf had the 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.280
 Pedals are incredibly close to each other 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.620
 and here the lower leg scrubs 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.319
 the handbrake and here on the steering wheel 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.690
 So a prejudice will be definite 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:38.080
 confirmed japanese are smaller for 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.180
 europeans for the international market 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.840
 was the bonsai sports car only conditionally 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.810
 suitable 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.610
 the sales figures remained meager with the 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.770
 associated image gain for honda 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.940
 and the entire Japanese 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.599
 automotive industry, however, was 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.599
 priceless 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.310
 Only 11,000 pieces were from the Honda S 800 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.470
 built and thus were of course pure 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.870
 commercially an absolute flop 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.520
 but first officially after 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.889
 Germany imported the Japanese 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.370
 car is definitely a milestone 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.370
 the automotive history 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.940
 and even by today's standards 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.150
 a jaunt in the honda s 800 absolutely 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:22.270
 unique so much driving fun tickle no 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.270
 another car from only 0 8 liters capacity
