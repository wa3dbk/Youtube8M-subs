00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
massive scale versions of them and it's

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.980 
massive scale versions of them and it's
a<00:02:05.610> really<00:02:05.880> cool<00:02:06.000> thing<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.750> doesn't

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
a really cool thing to do and it doesn't

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.419 
a really cool thing to do and it doesn't
even<00:02:07.259> take<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.469> much<00:02:07.710> effort<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.280> can

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429

on the inside and you can't make perfect
blocks<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:17.950> course<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:18.280> doesn't<00:02:18.459> look<00:02:18.610> like

blocks of course this doesn't look like

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.550 
blocks of course this doesn't look like
a<00:02:18.819> perfect<00:02:19.239> dropper<00:02:19.510> but<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:19.959> can<00:02:20.200> do<00:02:20.349> some

a perfect dropper but you can do some

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.479 
a perfect dropper but you can do some
really<00:02:20.680> cool<00:02:20.769> things<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.340> everyone

dropper and if you really want you could
turn<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.450> four<00:02:25.629> cool<00:02:25.810> house<00:02:25.959> by<00:02:25.989> hand<00:02:26.379> like<00:02:26.500> a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
turn in four cool house by hand like a

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.470 
turn in four cool house by hand like a
staircase<00:02:26.890> up<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.519> mouth<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.910> then<00:02:28.360> you

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
staircase up to the mouth and then you

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.580 
staircase up to the mouth and then you
could<00:02:28.629> like<00:02:28.780> have<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.050> mouth<00:02:29.230> be<00:02:29.440> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
could like have the mouth be the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.900 
could like have the mouth be the
entrance<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.069> house<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:30.459> think<00:02:30.730> that's<00:02:30.849> a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
entrance to a house I think that's a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.880 
entrance to a house I think that's a
real<00:02:31.060> possibility<00:02:31.330> personally<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.680> that's

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
real possibility personally and that's

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.320 
real possibility personally and that's
just<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.160> beginning<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:33.879> you<00:02:33.970> can<00:02:34.150> do

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
just the beginning of what you can do

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.479 
just the beginning of what you can do
with<00:02:34.599> a<00:02:34.629> pig<00:02:34.989> slop<00:02:35.230> blocks<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:35.739> yeah<00:02:35.920> take<00:02:36.280> any

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
with a pig slop blocks so yeah take any

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.890 
with a pig slop blocks so yeah take any
block<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:36.910> game<00:02:37.120> like<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.450> said<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.780> could

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
block in the game like I said it could

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.300 
block in the game like I said it could
be<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.049> jungle<00:02:38.440> plank<00:02:38.650> as<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.010> see<00:02:39.160> it's

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
be a jungle plank as you can see it's

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.800 
be a jungle plank as you can see it's
got<00:02:39.430> loads<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.790> different<00:02:39.910> colors<00:02:40.269> just<00:02:40.420> make

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
got loads of different colors just make

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.270 
got loads of different colors just make
each<00:02:40.989> one<00:02:41.019> of<00:02:41.260> those<00:02:41.379> colors<00:02:41.680> mean<00:02:41.860> something

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
each one of those colors mean something

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.890 
each one of those colors mean something
and<00:02:42.430> then<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.760> can<00:02:42.910> make<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.629> should

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
and then you can make it and it should

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.330 
and then you can make it and it should
look<00:02:44.019> pretty<00:02:44.080> good<00:02:44.560> or<00:02:44.769> at<00:02:44.830> least<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:45.099> know<00:02:45.129> it

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
look pretty good or at least you know it

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.100 
look pretty good or at least you know it
should<00:02:45.549> be<00:02:45.580> recognizable<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.930> good

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
should be recognizable and it's a good

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.479 
should be recognizable and it's a good
way<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.290> do<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> whole<00:02:47.890> bunch<00:02:48.069> of<00:02:48.190> different

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
over there you can see over them if I

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.039 
over there you can see over them if I
was<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.700> normally<00:03:00.940> run<00:03:01.120> there<00:03:01.329> each<00:03:01.660> time<00:03:01.930> I'm

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
yourself a minecart

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.210 
yourself a minecart
project<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.290> can<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.650> make<00:03:14.769> a<00:03:14.799> minecart

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
project so you can you make a minecart

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.770 
project so you can you make a minecart
rail<00:03:15.489> between<00:03:15.610> two<00:03:15.849> places<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.299> go<00:03:16.480> between<00:03:16.629> a

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
rail between two places you go between a

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.360 
rail between two places you go between a
lots<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.140> let's<00:03:17.319> say<00:03:17.470> you're<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.650> mind<00:03:18.010> which<00:03:18.220> is

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
lots so let's say you're a mind which is

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.830 
lots so let's say you're a mind which is
really<00:03:18.730> far<00:03:18.910> away<00:03:18.970> from<00:03:19.060> your<00:03:19.209> house<00:03:19.359> let's

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
really far away from your house let's

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.180 
really far away from your house let's
say<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.019> have<00:03:20.139> two<00:03:20.350> houses<00:03:20.530> but<00:03:20.859> they're<00:03:21.010> so

say you have two houses but they're so

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.770 
say you have two houses but they're so
far<00:03:21.459> apart<00:03:21.549> I've<00:03:22.060> done<00:03:22.269> something<00:03:22.450> let's<00:03:22.660> say

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
far apart I've done something let's say

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.449 
far apart I've done something let's say
well<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:23.109> bit<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.440> sky<00:03:23.680> rail<00:03:23.889> you<00:03:24.130> can<00:03:24.250> just

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
well I bit the sky rail you can just

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.129 
well I bit the sky rail you can just
instantly<00:03:24.880> with<00:03:25.239> my<00:03:25.389> carts<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:25.810> as<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.079> can

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
instantly with my carts so as you can

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.720 
instantly with my carts so as you can
see<00:03:26.319> here<00:03:26.500> instead<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.069> a<00:03:27.130> minute<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.549> bit

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
see here instead of a minute and a bit

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.670 
see here instead of a minute and a bit
journey<00:03:28.000> it's<00:03:28.269> 10<00:03:28.569> seconds<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.230> if<00:03:29.500> you

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
journey it's 10 seconds so if you

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.170 
journey it's 10 seconds so if you
imagine<00:03:29.769> I<00:03:30.040> make<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:30.370> journey<00:03:30.639> maybe<00:03:30.940> you

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
imagine I make that journey maybe you

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.970 
imagine I make that journey maybe you
know<00:03:31.299> like<00:03:31.480> 3<00:03:31.750> or<00:03:31.870> 4<00:03:31.930> times<00:03:32.290> an<00:03:32.530> hour<00:03:32.650> that

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
know like 3 or 4 times an hour that

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.440 
know like 3 or 4 times an hour that
really<00:03:33.370> really<00:03:33.549> starts<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:33.940> add<00:03:34.000> up<00:03:34.120> and

levena the project time paste itself and

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.160 
levena the project time paste itself and
it<00:03:36.609> looks<00:03:36.790> kind<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.060> cool<00:03:37.239> like<00:03:37.420> this<00:03:37.989> is<00:03:38.139> a

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
then jungle wood every few blocks but it

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.030 
then jungle wood every few blocks but it
still<00:03:43.870> looks<00:03:43.989> kind<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.319> good<00:03:44.410> my<00:03:44.560> opinion<00:03:44.889> and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040

some reason if you don't want to you

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.940 
some reason if you don't want to you

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
could also do a boat system between two

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.620 
could also do a boat system between two
places<00:03:57.190> they're<00:03:57.519> connected<00:03:57.849> by<00:03:57.970> sea<00:03:58.239> there's

places they're connected by sea there's

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.030 
places they're connected by sea there's
a<00:03:58.690> bunch<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:59.019> cool<00:03:59.139> possibilities<00:03:59.349> and

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
a bunch of cool possibilities and

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
should be probably slightly more obvious

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
definitely recommend it next up you

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.320 
definitely recommend it next up you
might<00:04:54.430> have<00:04:54.520> guessed<00:04:54.640> this<00:04:54.820> already<00:04:54.970> from<00:04:55.180> the

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
might have guessed this already from the

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.060 
might have guessed this already from the
whip<00:04:55.450> skelter<00:04:55.900> but<00:04:56.320> this<00:04:56.470> is<00:04:56.650> one<00:04:56.890> I

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
whip skelter but this is one I

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.830 
whip skelter but this is one I
definitely<00:04:57.400> recommend<00:04:57.790> if<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.330> like<00:04:58.570> the

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
definitely recommend if you like the

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.690 
definitely recommend if you like the
idea<00:04:58.960> of<00:04:59.200> putting<00:04:59.380> in<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.620> lot<00:04:59.800> of<00:04:59.830> work<00:05:00.100> to<00:05:00.550> get

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
idea of putting in a lot of work to get

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.880 
idea of putting in a lot of work to get
some<00:05:00.970> really<00:05:01.390> really<00:05:01.750> big<00:05:02.260> stuff<00:05:02.500> done<00:05:02.710> so

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
some really really big stuff done so

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.650 
some really really big stuff done so
basically<00:05:03.220> every<00:05:04.030> time<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.360> kill<00:05:04.510> with

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
basically every time you kill with

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.180 
basically every time you kill with
skeleton<00:05:05.080> you've<00:05:05.200> got<00:05:05.350> a<00:05:05.380> one<00:05:05.680> in<00:05:05.860> forty

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
skeleton you've got a one in forty

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.380 
skeleton you've got a one in forty
chance<00:05:06.430> of<00:05:06.580> getting<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:06.970> with<00:05:07.120> a<00:05:07.180> skeleton

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
chance of getting a with a skeleton

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.510 
chance of getting a with a skeleton
skull<00:05:07.810> get<00:05:08.320> free<00:05:08.590> of<00:05:08.680> them<00:05:08.830> together<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.400> you

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
skull get free of them together and you

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.130 
skull get free of them together and you
can<00:05:09.700> make<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:09.970> wither<00:05:10.150> boss<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.540> hardest<00:05:10.990> not

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
can make the wither boss the hardest not

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.140 
can make the wither boss the hardest not
to<00:05:11.200> fight<00:05:11.530> in<00:05:11.650> Minecraft<00:05:12.160> so<00:05:12.580> that's<00:05:12.940> not

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
to fight in Minecraft so that's not

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.790 
to fight in Minecraft so that's not
where<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.480> complexity<00:05:13.990> stops<00:05:14.350> like<00:05:14.530> once<00:05:14.710> you

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
where the complexity stops like once you

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.410 
where the complexity stops like once you
kill<00:05:14.980> one<00:05:15.160> you<00:05:15.310> get<00:05:15.430> beacon<00:05:15.820> block<00:05:16.030> so<00:05:16.210> you<00:05:16.300> can

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
kill one you get beacon block so you can

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.090 
kill one you get beacon block so you can
make<00:05:16.540> a<00:05:16.570> beacon<00:05:16.960> which<00:05:17.470> is<00:05:17.620> cool<00:05:17.830> and<00:05:17.860> stuff

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
make a beacon which is cool and stuff

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.380 
make a beacon which is cool and stuff
but<00:05:18.460> that's<00:05:18.610> not<00:05:18.820> where<00:05:18.910> this<00:05:19.090> all<00:05:19.210> ends

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
but that's not where this all ends

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.180 
but that's not where this all ends
because<00:05:19.600> once<00:05:19.930> you<00:05:20.050> kill<00:05:20.260> kill<00:05:20.680> deliver<00:05:20.920> once

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
because once you kill kill deliver once

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.770 
because once you kill kill deliver once
there's<00:05:21.730> kind<00:05:21.970> of<00:05:22.030> more<00:05:22.090> incentive<00:05:22.570> to<00:05:22.600> do<00:05:22.720> it

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
there's kind of more incentive to do it

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.270 
there's kind of more incentive to do it
twice<00:05:22.960> because<00:05:23.290> what<00:05:23.590> if<00:05:23.710> for<00:05:23.860> instance<00:05:23.920> I

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
twice because what if for instance I

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.800 
twice because what if for instance I
don't<00:05:24.310> have<00:05:24.520> a<00:05:24.550> beacon<00:05:24.790> here<00:05:25.060> and<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.510> beacon

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
don't have a beacon here and a beacon

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.940 
don't have a beacon here and a beacon
all<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:25.990> way<00:05:26.080> over<00:05:26.230> there<00:05:26.380> might<00:05:26.710> drop<00:05:26.890> a

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
all the way over there might drop a

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.800 
all the way over there might drop a
house<00:05:27.190> then<00:05:27.820> you<00:05:27.910> need<00:05:28.060> gonna<00:05:28.270> have<00:05:28.420> a<00:05:28.600> unit

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
house then you need gonna have a unit

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.030 
house then you need gonna have a unit
unit<00:05:29.050> you<00:05:29.140> have<00:05:29.170> to<00:05:29.320> kill<00:05:29.440> two<00:05:29.620> with<00:05:29.770> us<00:05:29.860> to<00:05:29.950> do

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
unit you have to kill two with us to do

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.740 
unit you have to kill two with us to do
that<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:30.430> a<00:05:30.610> really<00:05:30.880> fun<00:05:31.030> thing<00:05:31.240> to<00:05:31.270> do<00:05:31.480> if<00:05:31.660> you

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
that and a really fun thing to do if you

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.060 
that and a really fun thing to do if you
just<00:05:31.900> want<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.110> kind<00:05:32.230> of<00:05:32.380> you<00:05:32.500> know<00:05:32.620> bite<00:05:32.860> some

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
just want to kind of you know bite some

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.560 
just want to kind of you know bite some
time<00:05:33.340> you<00:05:33.490> want<00:05:33.640> to<00:05:33.700> kill<00:05:33.880> stuff<00:05:34.120> B<00:05:34.330> don't<00:05:34.450> know

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
time you want to kill stuff B don't know

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.390 
time you want to kill stuff B don't know
what<00:05:34.780> keep<00:05:35.260> killing<00:05:35.560> with<00:05:35.710> us<00:05:35.830> kill<00:05:36.040> with

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
what keep killing with us kill with

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.130 
what keep killing with us kill with
skeletons<00:05:36.880> then<00:05:37.090> with<00:05:37.270> us<00:05:37.390> and<00:05:37.600> basically

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
skeletons then with us and basically

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.390 
skeletons then with us and basically
it's<00:05:38.410> a<00:05:38.500> fun<00:05:38.680> way<00:05:38.770> to<00:05:38.800> have<00:05:38.920> never<00:05:39.160> stars

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
it's a fun way to have never stars

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.710 
it's a fun way to have never stars
around<00:05:39.640> so<00:05:39.880> whatever<00:05:40.090> you<00:05:40.210> want<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:40.570> make<00:05:40.660> a

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
around so whatever you want to make a

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.630 
around so whatever you want to make a
beacon<00:05:41.140> you<00:05:41.290> just<00:05:41.710> can<00:05:41.950> which<00:05:42.190> means<00:05:42.220> instead

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
beacon you just can which means instead

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.460 
beacon you just can which means instead
of<00:05:42.700> having<00:05:42.760> one<00:05:43.150> massive<00:05:43.420> beacon<00:05:43.870> which<00:05:44.080> a

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
of having one massive beacon which a

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.050 
of having one massive beacon which a
full<00:05:44.950> beacon<00:05:45.250> by<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.400> way<00:05:45.490> takes<00:05:45.700> up<00:05:45.820> one<00:05:46.000> and

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
full beacon by the way takes up one and

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.270 
full beacon by the way takes up one and
a<00:05:46.120> half<00:05:46.300> thousand<00:05:47.170> mineral<00:05:47.800> blocks<00:05:48.010> outside

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
a half thousand mineral blocks outside

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.310 
a half thousand mineral blocks outside
mineral<00:05:48.850> minha<00:05:49.120> themselves<00:05:49.540> you<00:05:50.050> could<00:05:50.200> just

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
mineral minha themselves you could just

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.530 
mineral minha themselves you could just
have<00:05:50.470> like<00:05:50.650> slay<00:05:50.980> a<00:05:51.160> t1<00:05:51.670> which<00:05:51.970> is<00:05:52.000> a<00:05:52.150> small<00:05:52.420> one

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
have like slay a t1 which is a small one

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.420 
have like slay a t1 which is a small one
you<00:05:52.750> just<00:05:53.080> have<00:05:53.320> loads<00:05:53.770> of<00:05:53.860> these<00:05:54.040> small<00:05:54.310> ones

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
you just have loads of these small ones

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.010 
you just have loads of these small ones
by<00:05:54.700> having<00:05:54.940> lots<00:05:55.120> of<00:05:55.210> beacon<00:05:55.540> blocks<00:05:55.720> it's<00:05:55.930> a

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
by having lots of beacon blocks it's a

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.540 
by having lots of beacon blocks it's a
cool<00:05:56.230> thing<00:05:56.410> to<00:05:56.530> do<00:05:56.680> and<00:05:56.920> it's<00:05:57.280> definitely

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
cool thing to do and it's definitely

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.190 
cool thing to do and it's definitely
something<00:05:57.850> you<00:05:58.030> should<00:05:58.120> consider<00:05:58.420> if<00:05:58.960> you

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
something you should consider if you

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.700 
something you should consider if you
don't<00:05:59.470> like<00:05:59.680> the<00:05:59.860> idea<00:05:59.890> of<00:06:00.160> going<00:06:00.460> mining<00:06:00.850> for

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
don't like the idea of going mining for

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.050 
don't like the idea of going mining for
1500<00:06:02.710> blocks<00:06:02.920> to<00:06:03.070> make<00:06:03.220> a<00:06:03.250> full-on<00:06:03.580> beacon

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
1500 blocks to make a full-on beacon

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.000 
1500 blocks to make a full-on beacon
which<00:06:04.240> only<00:06:04.480> goes<00:06:04.600> 50<00:06:04.960> blocks<00:06:05.170> even<00:06:05.380> then<00:06:05.680> so

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
which only goes 50 blocks even then so

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.380
