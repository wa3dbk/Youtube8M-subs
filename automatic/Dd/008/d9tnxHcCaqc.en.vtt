for<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.940> go<00:00:48.150> so<00:00:48.810> there's<00:00:48.990> your

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
for you here there we go so there's your

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.260 
for you here there we go so there's your

that where the core steel meets the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.510 
that where the core steel meets the
stainless<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.170> stainless<00:00:55.440> /<00:00:56.010> semi

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520

incredibly long edge retention it is

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.600 
incredibly long edge retention it is
quite<00:01:04.199> rare<00:01:04.439> resistant<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.100> when<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.489> get

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
quite rare resistant so when you do get

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.800

to<00:01:05.670> sharpen<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.299> might<00:01:06.420> take<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> little

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
to sharpen it it might take a little

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.719 
to sharpen it it might take a little
more<00:01:06.960> work<00:01:07.259> and<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.530> might<00:01:08.070> need<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.340> use<00:01:08.370> some

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
more work and you might need to use some

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.780 
more work and you might need to use some
water<00:01:09.540> stones<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.170> good<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.130> aggressive

very nicely done it's pretty comfortable

in the toil area here and also the spine

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.020 
in the toil area here and also the spine
if<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.660> was<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> little<00:02:37.050> more<00:02:37.920> sharp<00:02:38.790> than<00:02:38.940> you

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
if it was a little more sharp than you

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.130 
if it was a little more sharp than you
wanted<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.480> could<00:02:39.600> knock<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> little<00:02:39.960> bit

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
wanted to you could knock a little bit

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.330 
wanted to you could knock a little bit
off<00:02:40.230> with<00:02:40.380> some<00:02:40.530> sandpaper<00:02:40.830> but<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.250> my

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
off with some sandpaper but in my

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.770 
off with some sandpaper but in my
opinion<00:02:41.460> it's<00:02:41.820> ready<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.150> go<00:02:42.270> out<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> box

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
opinion it's ready to go out of the box

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.560 
opinion it's ready to go out of the box
the<00:02:46.100> profile<00:02:47.100> on<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> blade<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.910> blade<00:02:48.270> has

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
the profile on the blade this blade has

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.450 
the profile on the blade this blade has
a<00:02:50.180> quite<00:02:51.180> flat<00:02:51.630> profile<00:02:52.200> near<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.680> heel<00:02:52.980> half

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
a quite flat profile near the heel half

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.120 
a quite flat profile near the heel half
of<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.730> blade<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:55.350> it's<00:02:55.710> kind<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.950> a

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
of the blade and so it's kind of a

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.160 
of the blade and so it's kind of a
pretty<00:02:56.820> much<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> dead<00:02:57.330> stop<00:02:57.600> on<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> cutting

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
pretty much a dead stop on the cutting

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.690 
pretty much a dead stop on the cutting
board<00:02:58.260> at<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.530> heel<00:02:58.710> so<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.100> very<00:02:59.340> flat

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
board at the heel so it's a very flat

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.240 
board at the heel so it's a very flat
profile<00:03:00.420> than<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.720> gentle<00:03:01.530> belly<00:03:01.710> towards<00:03:02.100> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
profile than a gentle belly towards the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.650 
profile than a gentle belly towards the
front<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:03.420> edge<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:04.260> quite<00:03:04.560> thin<00:03:05.300> this<00:03:06.300> blade

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
front the edge is quite thin this blade

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.030 
front the edge is quite thin this blade
and<00:03:08.630> as<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.780> said<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.110> grinds<00:03:10.350> are<00:03:10.530> done<00:03:10.680> quite

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
and as I said the grinds are done quite

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.120 
and as I said the grinds are done quite
nicely<00:03:11.070> on<00:03:11.520> this<00:03:11.760> blade<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.830> balance<00:03:13.830> point

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
nicely on this blade the balance point

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.100 
nicely on this blade the balance point
is<00:03:14.490> just<00:03:15.120> in<00:03:15.270> front<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:18.270> bolster<00:03:18.750> so

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
is just in front of the bolster so

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.720 
is just in front of the bolster so
pretty<00:03:19.530> close<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.040> pinch<00:03:20.280> grip<00:03:20.490> maybe

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
pretty close to a pinch grip maybe

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.520 
pretty close to a pinch grip maybe
slightly<00:03:21.210> after<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.720> pinch<00:03:21.930> script<00:03:22.260> so

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
slightly after the pinch script so

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.590 
slightly after the pinch script so
slight<00:03:23.250> handle<00:03:23.580> heavy<00:03:23.730> bias<00:03:23.970> if<00:03:24.330> you're<00:03:24.450> using

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
slight handle heavy bias if you're using

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.350 
slight handle heavy bias if you're using
a<00:03:24.780> pinch<00:03:24.990> grip<00:03:25.170> I'm<00:03:25.350> using<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.710> racket<00:03:26.040> grip

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
a pinch grip I'm using a racket grip

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.620 
a pinch grip I'm using a racket grip
that's<00:03:27.360> probably<00:03:28.020> right<00:03:28.140> on<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.410> money<00:03:28.560> the

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
that's probably right on the money the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.210 
that's probably right on the money the
edge<00:03:30.630> profile<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.440> little<00:03:31.470> new<00:03:31.710> feature<00:03:31.980> I'm

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
edge profile a little new feature I'm

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.970 
edge profile a little new feature I'm
doing<00:03:32.520> here<00:03:33.260> I'll<00:03:34.260> show<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.560> kind<00:03:34.740> of<00:03:34.770> what<00:03:34.830> it

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
doing here I'll show you kind of what it

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.810 
doing here I'll show you kind of what it
would<00:03:35.070> look<00:03:35.190> like<00:03:35.340> on<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.520> cutting<00:03:35.880> board<00:03:36.470> so

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
would look like on a cutting board so

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.490 
would look like on a cutting board so
you<00:03:38.820> do<00:03:39.000> tend<00:03:39.270> to<00:03:39.360> hit<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.810> heel<00:03:40.080> there<00:03:40.320> so

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
you do tend to hit that heel there so

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.710 
you do tend to hit that heel there so
there's<00:03:40.680> not<00:03:40.800> any<00:03:40.860> kind<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.310> back<00:03:41.520> bevel<00:03:41.940> on

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
there's not any kind of back bevel on

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.190 
there's not any kind of back bevel on
the<00:03:43.050> edge<00:03:43.410> profile<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.960> you<00:03:45.960> can<00:03:46.080> get<00:03:46.170> a

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
the edge profile and you can get a

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.400 
the edge profile and you can get a
fairly<00:03:46.500> tall<00:03:47.220> lift<00:03:47.580> on<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:47.850> as<00:03:48.810> far<00:03:49.020> as<00:03:49.140> before

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
fairly tall lift on it as far as before

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.590 
fairly tall lift on it as far as before
getting<00:03:49.710> into<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.980> tip<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.210> does<00:03:51.360> rock

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
getting into the tip so it does rock

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.360 
getting into the tip so it does rock
pretty<00:03:51.840> well<00:03:52.050> if<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.320> if<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:52.860> that<00:03:53.070> real

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
pretty well if you if you like that real

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.330 
pretty well if you if you like that real
flat<00:03:53.790> heel<00:03:54.480> section<00:03:54.780> area<00:03:55.770> on<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:55.980> blade<00:03:56.190> you

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
flat heel section area on the blade you

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.800 
flat heel section area on the blade you
really<00:03:56.610> like<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:56.970> knife<00:03:57.240> you<00:03:57.390> can<00:03:57.570> kind<00:03:57.750> of

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
really like this knife you can kind of

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.230 
really like this knife you can kind of
hopefully<00:03:58.170> see<00:03:58.350> that<00:03:58.530> there<00:03:58.800> on<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.880> profile

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
hopefully see that there on the profile

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.820 
hopefully see that there on the profile
so<00:04:00.510> that's<00:04:00.690> what<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.930> profile<00:04:01.290> looks<00:04:01.500> like<00:04:01.560> on

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
so that's what the profile looks like on

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.440 
so that's what the profile looks like on
the<00:04:01.950> blade<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:02.310> it's<00:04:02.460> not<00:04:02.550> a<00:04:02.610> continuous<00:04:03.150> curve

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
the blade so it's not a continuous curve

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.410 
the blade so it's not a continuous curve
like<00:04:03.720> some<00:04:03.990> knives<00:04:04.170> are<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:06.030> it's<00:04:06.210> a<00:04:06.270> little

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
like some knives are so it's a little

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.420 
like some knives are so it's a little
bit<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:07.080> heel<00:04:07.290> area<00:04:07.590> is<00:04:07.650> definitely<00:04:07.830> oriented

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
bit the heel area is definitely oriented

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.480 
bit the heel area is definitely oriented
towards<00:04:08.790> chopping<00:04:09.690> push<00:04:09.960> cutting<00:04:10.400> kind<00:04:11.400> of

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
towards chopping push cutting kind of

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.030 
towards chopping push cutting kind of
style<00:04:11.760> so<00:04:12.240> in<00:04:13.200> terms<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.590> out<00:04:13.740> of<00:04:13.770> the<00:04:13.920> box

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
style so in terms of out of the box

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.650 
style so in terms of out of the box
sharpness<00:04:14.520> I'll<00:04:14.640> give<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.970> 6<00:04:15.210> out<00:04:15.330> of<00:04:15.360> 10<00:04:15.540> it

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
sharpness I'll give it a 6 out of 10 it

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.210 
sharpness I'll give it a 6 out of 10 it
was<00:04:15.780> quite<00:04:16.020> sharp<00:04:16.350> head<00:04:16.530> did<00:04:16.739> have<00:04:16.859> some<00:04:17.070> bite

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
was quite sharp head did have some bite

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.920 
was quite sharp head did have some bite
on<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.549> edge<00:04:17.670> I've<00:04:18.180> actually<00:04:18.570> been<00:04:18.870> using

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
on the edge I've actually been using

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.750 
on the edge I've actually been using
this<00:04:19.260> right<00:04:19.440> out<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.710> box<00:04:19.920> and<00:04:20.460> it's

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
this right out of the box and it's

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.830 
this right out of the box and it's
really<00:04:20.880> got<00:04:21.030> quite<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.270> good<00:04:21.450> edge<00:04:21.570> on<00:04:21.750> you

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
really got quite a good edge on you

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.970 
really got quite a good edge on you
could<00:04:21.989> probably<00:04:22.109> get<00:04:22.350> a<00:04:22.380> little<00:04:22.620> bit<00:04:22.710> nicer

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
could probably get a little bit nicer

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.380 
could probably get a little bit nicer
edge<00:04:23.130> on<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.550> make<00:04:23.760> it<00:04:23.880> perform<00:04:24.120> even

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
edge on it and make it perform even

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.030 
edge on it and make it perform even
better<00:04:24.570> but<00:04:24.810> is<00:04:25.110> this<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.530> good<00:04:25.800> all-around

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
better but is this a good all-around

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.930 
better but is this a good all-around
performer<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:26.970> does<00:04:27.210> have<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.230> little<00:04:28.500> bit<00:04:28.650> of

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
performer it does have a little bit of

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.010 
performer it does have a little bit of
stick<00:04:29.940> characteristics<00:04:30.570> because<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:30.960> the

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
stick characteristics because of the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.340 
stick characteristics because of the
type<00:04:31.200> of

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
type of

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.960 
type of
blade<00:04:31.530> it's<00:04:31.710> fairly<00:04:32.010> thin<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.670> doesn't

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
have a lot of texture of the blade but

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.010 
have a lot of texture of the blade but
it<00:04:35.010> doesn't<00:04:35.280> wedge<00:04:35.430> much<00:04:35.670> at<00:04:35.850> all<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.840> tip

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
it doesn't wedge much at all and the tip

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.540 
it doesn't wedge much at all and the tip
is<00:04:37.170> thin<00:04:37.320> enough<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.710> go<00:04:37.860> through<00:04:37.890> ingredients

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
is thin enough to go through ingredients

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.300 
is thin enough to go through ingredients
like<00:04:38.640> onions<00:04:39.000> quite<00:04:39.270> well<00:04:39.680> it's<00:04:40.680> not<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.920> super
