out with the instant the wiring diagram

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.769 
out with the instant the wiring diagram
as<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.430> see<00:00:17.580> whenever<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.970> sell<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.420> control

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
as you see whenever I sell this control

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.420 
as you see whenever I sell this control
that's<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.199> come<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:19.619> my<00:00:19.859> single

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
that's going to come with my single

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.910 
that's going to come with my single
stage<00:00:20.760> wiring<00:00:21.449> board<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.930> know<00:00:22.410> all<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.680> looks

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
stage wiring board I know all this looks

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.099 
stage wiring board I know all this looks
messy<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> test<00:00:23.730> bench<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.359> that's<00:00:24.930> just

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
messy on the test bench but that's just

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.960 
messy on the test bench but that's just
the<00:00:25.230> way<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.670> come<00:00:26.820> with

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the way it is so it's going to come with

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.300 
the way it is so it's going to come with
that<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.240> make<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.510> wiring<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.199> lot<00:00:28.710> easier<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
that to make the wiring a lot easier and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.049 
that to make the wiring a lot easier and
as<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.240> see<00:00:30.449> them<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.140> wire<00:00:31.380> diagram

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
as you see them on the wire diagram

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.299 
as you see them on the wire diagram
pretty<00:00:33.059> simple<00:00:33.570> there's<00:00:33.780> where<00:00:34.110> your<00:00:34.350> 1202

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
pretty simple there's where your 1202

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.459 
pretty simple there's where your 1202
arms<00:00:35.640> which<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.149> which<00:00:36.420> sends<00:00:36.690> power<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
arms which is which sends power to the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.119 
arms which is which sends power to the
controller<00:00:38.239> your<00:00:39.239> throttle<00:00:39.719> switch<00:00:40.129> your

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
controller your throttle switch your

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.520 
controller your throttle switch your
trans<00:00:41.460> brake<00:00:41.820> wire<00:00:42.149> which<00:00:42.719> would<00:00:42.989> connect

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
trans brake wire which would connect

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.680 
trans brake wire which would connect
into<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.250> wire<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.940> goes<00:00:45.090> from<00:00:45.239> your<00:00:45.360> trans

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
into the wire that goes from your trans

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.330 
into the wire that goes from your trans
brake<00:00:45.960> button<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:46.770> trans<00:00:47.070> brake

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
brake button to your trans brake

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.310 
brake button to your trans brake
cylinder<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.210> had<00:00:48.480> splice<00:00:48.840> into<00:00:49.110> that

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
cylinder so you had splice into that

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.930 
cylinder so you had splice into that
somewhere<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:51.079> you<00:00:52.079> see<00:00:52.320> how<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.940> nitrous

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
somewhere and you see how the nitrous

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.060 
somewhere and you see how the nitrous
solenoids<00:00:54.360> are<00:00:54.510> hooked<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.199> single<00:00:55.890> stage

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
solenoids are hooked up the single stage

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.439 
solenoids are hooked up the single stage
board<00:00:56.399> supplies<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.210> 12-volt<00:00:57.809> power<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.559> the

board supplies the 12-volt power to the

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.779 
board supplies the 12-volt power to the
to<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> solenoid<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.789> controller

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
to the solenoid and the controller

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.780 
to the solenoid and the controller
controls<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.809> ground<00:01:04.080> part<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.739> I've<00:01:05.489> got

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
controls the ground part of it I've got

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.210 
controls the ground part of it I've got
a<00:01:05.820> built-in<00:01:06.330> timer<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.500> controller<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
a built-in timer in the controller and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.760 
a built-in timer in the controller and
that's<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> gray<00:01:09.390> wire<00:01:09.689> there<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.439> ground

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that's the gray wire there it's a ground

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.460 
that's the gray wire there it's a ground
output<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.270> handle<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> two<00:01:12.930> amps<00:01:13.320> of

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
output that can handle up to two amps of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.070 
output that can handle up to two amps of
power<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.150> you<00:01:15.150> would<00:01:15.270> hook<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.570> generally

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
power and you would hook this generally

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.890 
power and you would hook this generally
to<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> relay<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.710> trigger<00:01:17.070> something<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.900> in

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
to a relay to trigger something and in

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.660 
to a relay to trigger something and in
these<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> programming<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.549> can

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
these in the programming of it you can

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.620 
these in the programming of it you can
program<00:01:20.880> time<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.290> time<00:01:22.650> off<00:01:23.479> for<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
program time on and time off for that

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.510 
program time on and time off for that
output<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:26.340> see<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:26.880> I've<00:01:27.090> got

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
output and you see on here I've got

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.609 
output and you see on here I've got
going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> retards<00:01:30.299> here<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.380> what<00:01:31.530> this

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
going to the retards here so what this

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.700 
going to the retards here so what this
is<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.159> would<00:01:32.340> send<00:01:32.670> 12<00:01:33.119> volts

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
is going to do this would send 12 volts

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.039 
is going to do this would send 12 volts
anytime<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.759> you<00:01:35.759> went<00:01:35.970> full<00:01:36.240> throttle<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
anytime that you went full throttle and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.679 
anytime that you went full throttle and
it<00:01:37.619> activated<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.430> board<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.030> sent<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.420> 12

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it activated this board and sent the 12

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.160 
it activated this board and sent the 12
volts<00:01:40.079> out<00:01:40.369> now<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:42.060> some<00:01:42.479> reason<00:01:43.049> if

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
volts out now if for some reason if

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.210 
volts out now if for some reason if
you're<00:01:43.320> delaying<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:46.070> progressive<00:01:47.070> from

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you're delaying the progressive from

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.359 
you're delaying the progressive from
turning<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.180> nitrous<00:01:48.540> solenoids<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:50.220> may

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
turning on the nitrous solenoids you may

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.580 
turning on the nitrous solenoids you may
not<00:01:50.579> want<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.880> use<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.420> method<00:01:51.689> because<00:01:52.320> this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
not want to use this method because this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.710 
not want to use this method because this
would<00:01:52.799> pull<00:01:53.340> retard<00:01:53.909> as<00:01:54.149> soon<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.540> went

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
would pull retard as soon as you went

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.030 
would pull retard as soon as you went
wide<00:01:54.899> open<00:01:55.200> throttle<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.710> let<00:01:55.829> off<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
wide open throttle and let off the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.630 
wide open throttle and let off the
transbrake

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
transbrake

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.240 
transbrake
you<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.540> i'm<00:01:57.630> alternative<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.009> would

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
you know i'm alternative to that would

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.840 
you know i'm alternative to that would
be<00:01:59.600> to<00:02:00.600> use<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.229> timer<00:02:01.500> output<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.759> course

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
be to use the timer output of course

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.910 
be to use the timer output of course
you'd<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.390> go<00:02:03.509> through<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.810> relay<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.560> get

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
you'd have to go through a relay to get

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.069 
you'd have to go through a relay to get
your<00:02:05.130> 12<00:02:05.640> volt<00:02:05.759> signal<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.600> would<00:02:06.750> normally

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
your 12 volt signal that would normally

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.169 
your 12 volt signal that would normally
go<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.290> your<00:02:07.680> retard<00:02:08.129> like<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.520> your<00:02:08.700> MSD<00:02:09.149> box

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
go to your retard like on your MSD box

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.320 
go to your retard like on your MSD box
and<00:02:09.720> then<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.709> could<00:02:10.860> actually<00:02:11.039> program<00:02:11.819> this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
and then you could actually program this

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.170 
and then you could actually program this
timer

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
timer

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.679 
timer
put<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:14.290> work<00:02:14.890> your<00:02:15.129> retard<00:02:15.579> so<00:02:16.390> that's<00:02:16.569> just

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
put to work your retard so that's just

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.380 
put to work your retard so that's just
an<00:02:16.870> option<00:02:17.049> there<00:02:17.470> but<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.790> wiring<00:02:19.209> it's

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
an option there but the wiring it's

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.990 
an option there but the wiring it's
about<00:02:19.599> as<00:02:19.780> simple<00:02:20.049> as<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.319> gets<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:21.519> I'm<00:02:21.670> going

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
about as simple as it gets and I'm going

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.630 
about as simple as it gets and I'm going
to<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.209> programming<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.959> box<00:02:23.200> now<00:02:23.640> that's

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
to the programming of the box now that's

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.039 
to the programming of the box now that's
your<00:02:24.790> main<00:02:24.970> screen<00:02:25.299> that's<00:02:25.659> going<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.900> show

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
your main screen that's going to show

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.509 
your main screen that's going to show
your<00:02:26.260> lifetime<00:02:27.030> your<00:02:28.030> either<00:02:28.989> your<00:02:29.079> live

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
your lifetime your either your live

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.890 
your lifetime your either your live
percentage<00:02:30.519> or<00:02:30.819> your<00:02:31.000> start<00:02:31.299> percentage<00:02:31.720> as

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
percentage or your start percentage as

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.690 
percentage or your start percentage as
right<00:02:32.290> now<00:02:32.439> you<00:02:32.500> see<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.069> it's<00:02:33.189> 20<00:02:33.519> percent

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
right now you see that it's 20 percent

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.369 
right now you see that it's 20 percent
and<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.120> see<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.359> bar<00:02:34.540> graph<00:02:34.840> it's<00:02:35.049> actually

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
and you see the bar graph it's actually

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:36.869 
and you see the bar graph it's actually
a<00:02:35.439> live<00:02:35.620> bar<00:02:35.890> graph<00:02:36.159> it'll<00:02:36.430> move

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
a live bar graph it'll move

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.630 
a live bar graph it'll move
so<00:02:37.689> what<00:02:38.349> that's<00:02:38.500> telling<00:02:38.709> me<00:02:38.859> is<00:02:38.980> I've<00:02:39.310> got<00:02:39.489> my

so what that's telling me is I've got my

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.819 
so what that's telling me is I've got my
program<00:02:40.030> set<00:02:40.359> where<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.689> first<00:02:40.930> stage<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.470> 20

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.110 
there 15 seems to be kind of an average
number<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.599> try<00:03:02.489> all<00:03:03.489> right<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.819> got<00:03:03.970> your

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
number to try all right you got your

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.679 
number to try all right you got your
timer<00:03:04.389> own<00:03:04.720> so<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.590> can<00:03:05.829> set<00:03:06.129> it<00:03:06.400> at<00:03:07.299> what<00:03:07.480> time

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
timer own so you can set it at what time

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.660 
timer own so you can set it at what time
you<00:03:07.840> want<00:03:08.049> that<00:03:08.230> time<00:03:08.560> or<00:03:08.739> output<00:03:09.189> to<00:03:09.310> come<00:03:09.459> on

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
you want that time or output to come on

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.640 
you want that time or output to come on
and<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.359> all<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.689> it<00:03:10.870> controls<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.500> that

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
and this is all the it controls is that

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.110 
and this is all the it controls is that
gray<00:03:11.829> wire<00:03:12.099> it<00:03:12.280> doesn't<00:03:12.549> have<00:03:12.639> anything<00:03:12.849> to<00:03:13.000> do

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
gray wire it doesn't have anything to do

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.349 
gray wire it doesn't have anything to do
with<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.389> progressing<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:15.030> then<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.120> time

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
with the progressing and then the time

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.050 
with the progressing and then the time
off<00:03:17.609> you<00:03:18.609> see<00:03:18.849> if<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.030> go<00:03:19.209> below<00:03:19.419> time<00:03:19.870> on

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
off you see if you go below time on

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.289 
off you see if you go below time on
it'll<00:03:22.060> go<00:03:22.349> straight<00:03:23.349> to<00:03:23.680> zero<00:03:24.069> so<00:03:25.060> what<00:03:25.180> that

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
it'll go straight to zero so what that

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.050 
it'll go straight to zero so what that
means<00:03:25.569> if<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.079> sets<00:03:26.349> on<00:03:26.440> zero<00:03:26.980> on<00:03:27.459> time<00:03:27.760> or<00:03:27.910> off

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
means if it sets on zero on time or off

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.970 
means if it sets on zero on time or off
then<00:03:28.329> that<00:03:28.359> means<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:29.470> won't<00:03:29.709> turn<00:03:29.919> off

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
then that means that it won't turn off

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.220 
then that means that it won't turn off
unless<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.459> let<00:03:30.790> off<00:03:30.909> the<00:03:31.060> throttle<00:03:31.230> so

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
unless you let off the throttle so

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.509 
unless you let off the throttle so
that's<00:03:32.379> just<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.590> way<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.739> kind<00:03:32.949> of<00:03:33.099> override

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
that's just a way to kind of override

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.970 
that's just a way to kind of override
that<00:03:36.150> hit<00:03:37.150> enter<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.780> here's<00:03:38.440> where<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:38.709> set

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
that hit enter and here's where you set

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.550 
that hit enter and here's where you set
up<00:03:39.159> the<00:03:39.989> progressive<00:03:40.989> stages

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
up the progressive stages

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.469 
up the progressive stages
you<00:03:42.519> see<00:03:42.669> I've<00:03:42.760> actually<00:03:42.909> got<00:03:43.180> three

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:43.479 
you see I've actually got three

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.300 
you see I've actually got three
different<00:03:43.629> ramps<00:03:44.229> that<00:03:44.319> you<00:03:44.440> can<00:03:44.560> program<00:03:44.979> in

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
different ramps that you can program in

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.210 
different ramps that you can program in
which<00:03:45.909> you<00:03:46.030> don't<00:03:46.180> have<00:03:46.419> to<00:03:46.569> use<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:47.829> second

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
which you don't have to use the second

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.550 
which you don't have to use the second
third<00:03:48.400> one<00:03:48.639> that's<00:03:49.599> just<00:03:49.870> optional<00:03:50.349> if<00:03:50.530> you

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
third one that's just optional if you

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.420 
third one that's just optional if you
want<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.979> really<00:03:51.510> get<00:03:52.510> real<00:03:53.010> technical<00:03:54.010> with

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
want to really get real technical with

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.610 
want to really get real technical with
it<00:03:56.909> and<00:03:57.909> mode<00:03:58.870> would<00:03:59.019> just<00:03:59.169> get<00:03:59.319> you<00:03:59.440> through

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
it and mode would just get you through

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.800 
it and mode would just get you through
everything<00:03:59.909> so<00:04:00.909> right<00:04:01.090> there<00:04:01.239> you<00:04:01.359> can<00:04:01.510> set

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
everything so right there you can set

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.599 
everything so right there you can set
what<00:04:02.019> time<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.500> want<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:02.769> to<00:04:02.919> start<00:04:03.430> which

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
what time you want it to start which

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.699 
what time you want it to start which
most<00:04:03.879> the<00:04:04.000> time<00:04:04.209> you're<00:04:04.510> going<00:04:04.659> to<00:04:04.720> be<00:04:05.199> at<00:04:05.319> zero

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
most the time you're going to be at zero

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:06.569 
most the time you're going to be at zero
because<00:04:05.889> most<00:04:06.099> time<00:04:06.250> you're<00:04:06.370> going<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.519> want

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
because most time you're going to want

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.689 
because most time you're going to want
it<00:04:06.729> to<00:04:06.819> start<00:04:07.090> right<00:04:07.659> on<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.870> starting<00:04:08.199> line

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
it to start right on the starting line

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:12.140 
it to start right on the starting line
that's<00:04:09.699> the<00:04:09.819> percentage<00:04:10.389> it<00:04:10.569> would<00:04:10.690> be<00:04:10.840> on

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
that's the percentage it would be on

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.059 
that's the percentage it would be on
that's<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.389> end<00:04:13.750> time<00:04:13.989> whenever<00:04:14.680> you'd<00:04:14.889> want

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
that's the end time whenever you'd want

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.589 
that's the end time whenever you'd want
it<00:04:15.159> to<00:04:15.250> be<00:04:15.400> at<00:04:15.579> 100<00:04:16.000> or<00:04:16.150> at<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:17.769> end<00:04:17.949> percentage

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
it to be at 100 or at the end percentage

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.029 
it to be at 100 or at the end percentage
so<00:04:19.599> at<00:04:19.690> 2<00:04:19.870> seconds<00:04:20.380> we're<00:04:20.560> going<00:04:20.709> to<00:04:20.799> be<00:04:20.859> at

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
so at 2 seconds we're going to be at

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.180 
so at 2 seconds we're going to be at
100%<00:04:21.849> and<00:04:22.650> when<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.740> get<00:04:23.860> through<00:04:24.039> with<00:04:24.130> your

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
100% and when you get through with your

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.120 
100% and when you get through with your
programming

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
programming

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.750 
programming
get<00:04:26.250> into<00:04:26.430> programming<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:29.460> I'm<00:04:29.580> fishing

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
get into programming and I'm fishing

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.610 
get into programming and I'm fishing
there<00:04:29.970> right<00:04:30.150> through<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.510> cycle<00:04:30.930> here<00:04:31.170> I'm

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
there right through the cycle here I'm

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.190 
there right through the cycle here I'm
gonna<00:04:31.830> push<00:04:32.040> my<00:04:32.190> trans<00:04:32.460> brake<00:04:32.760> button<00:04:33.200> now

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
gonna push my trans brake button now

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.990 
gonna push my trans brake button now
went<00:04:34.500> full<00:04:34.710> throttle<00:04:34.740> so<00:04:35.370> nothing's<00:04:35.670> happened

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
went full throttle so nothing's happened

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.720 
went full throttle so nothing's happened
yet<00:04:36.770> and<00:04:42.830> that's<00:04:43.830> pretty<00:04:44.010> much<00:04:44.130> yet<00:04:44.460> what<00:04:44.610> you

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
yet and that's pretty much yet what you

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.580 
yet and that's pretty much yet what you
notice<00:04:45.030> on<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.600> solenoid<00:04:45.870> once<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:46.410> gets

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
notice on the solenoid once it gets

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.540 
notice on the solenoid once it gets
around<00:04:46.980> 80%<00:04:47.370> it<00:04:48.240> really<00:04:48.660> oh<00:04:49.340> that's<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.430> way

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
around 80% it really oh that's the way

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.310 
around 80% it really oh that's the way
most<00:04:50.730> solenoids<00:04:51.180> do<00:04:51.360> once<00:04:51.600> they<00:04:51.750> get<00:04:51.900> up<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:52.290> a

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
most solenoids do once they get up to a

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.940 
most solenoids do once they get up to a
high<00:04:52.560> percentage<00:04:53.040> like<00:04:53.280> around<00:04:53.670> 80<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.060> above

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
high percentage like around 80 and above

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.290 
high percentage like around 80 and above
Simmons<00:04:55.950> really<00:04:56.160> can't<00:04:56.400> respond<00:04:56.850> real<00:04:57.120> well

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
Simmons really can't respond real well

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.120 
Simmons really can't respond real well
so<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.630> lot<00:04:57.810> of<00:04:57.900> times<00:04:58.110> they'll<00:04:58.410> go<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.650> hundred

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
so a lot of times they'll go a hundred

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.370 
so a lot of times they'll go a hundred
percent<00:04:59.280> so<00:04:59.880> you<00:05:00.720> have<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:00.960> kind<00:05:01.140> of<00:05:01.200> play<00:05:01.350> with

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
percent so you have to kind of play with

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.410 
percent so you have to kind of play with
that<00:05:01.740> see<00:05:01.980> how<00:05:02.160> your<00:05:02.370> solenoids<00:05:02.790> like<00:05:03.090> in<00:05:03.300> this

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
that see how your solenoids like in this

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.030 
that see how your solenoids like in this
same<00:05:03.630> way<00:05:03.660> when<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.080> get<00:05:04.500> down<00:05:04.680> here<00:05:04.710> in<00:05:04.980> the

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
same way when you get down here in the

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.790 
same way when you get down here in the
low<00:05:05.220> percentages<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.270> lot<00:05:07.020> of<00:05:07.140> times<00:05:07.320> solenoids

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
low percentages a lot of times solenoids

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.290 
low percentages a lot of times solenoids
won't<00:05:08.130> respond<00:05:08.760> it's<00:05:08.910> not<00:05:09.030> because<00:05:09.210> the

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
won't respond it's not because the

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.400 
won't respond it's not because the
controller<00:05:09.690> is<00:05:09.840> not<00:05:09.990> doing<00:05:10.260> that<00:05:10.290> the

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
controller is not doing that the

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.660 
controller is not doing that the
controller<00:05:10.740> will<00:05:10.920> be<00:05:11.010> sending<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.490> right

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
controller will be sending the right

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.300 
controller will be sending the right
signal<00:05:12.120> but<00:05:12.300> Cilla<00:05:13.110> nodes<00:05:13.320> can<00:05:13.650> only<00:05:13.800> respond

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
signal but Cilla nodes can only respond

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.920 
signal but Cilla nodes can only respond
through<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.640> certain<00:05:15.410> certain<00:05:17.690> certain<00:05:18.690> amount

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
through a certain certain certain amount

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.020 
through a certain certain certain amount
of<00:05:19.020> percentage<00:05:19.380> if<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.160> start<00:05:20.430> getting<00:05:20.700> below

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
of percentage if you start getting below

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.460 
of percentage if you start getting below
that<00:05:21.240> and<00:05:21.390> get<00:05:21.510> a<00:05:21.540> small<00:05:21.810> pulse<00:05:22.080> we<00:05:22.260> at<00:05:22.380> the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
that and get a small pulse we at the

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.890 
that and get a small pulse we at the
cyllage<00:05:22.860> can't<00:05:23.130> respond<00:05:23.520> quick<00:05:23.790> enough<00:05:24.060> so

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
cyllage can't respond quick enough so

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.200 
cyllage can't respond quick enough so
that's<00:05:25.080> another<00:05:25.320> thing<00:05:25.440> to<00:05:25.590> keep<00:05:25.830> in<00:05:25.980> mind

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
that's another thing to keep in mind

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.810 
that's another thing to keep in mind
it's<00:05:27.210> normally<00:05:27.510> not<00:05:27.540> a<00:05:27.660> good<00:05:27.930> idea<00:05:28.050> to<00:05:28.530> try<00:05:28.770> to

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
it's normally not a good idea to try to

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.400 
it's normally not a good idea to try to
set<00:05:29.820> your<00:05:30.000> start<00:05:30.270> percentage<00:05:30.810> really<00:05:31.200> low<00:05:31.380> I

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
set your start percentage really low I

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.230 
set your start percentage really low I
mean<00:05:31.650> 20<00:05:31.980> to<00:05:32.070> 30<00:05:32.280> percent<00:05:32.700> is<00:05:32.820> generally<00:05:33.210> a

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
mean 20 to 30 percent is generally a

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.880 
mean 20 to 30 percent is generally a
really<00:05:33.450> good<00:05:33.810> level<00:05:34.200> to<00:05:34.230> start<00:05:34.410> you<00:05:34.830> start

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
really good level to start you start

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.350 
really good level to start you start
getting<00:05:35.310> less<00:05:35.490> than<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:35.820> depending<00:05:36.000> on<00:05:36.300> your

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
getting less than that depending on your

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.160 
getting less than that depending on your
solenoids<00:05:36.960> they<00:05:37.800> may<00:05:38.100> not<00:05:38.280> actually<00:05:38.340> come<00:05:38.880> on

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
solenoids they may not actually come on

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.140 
solenoids they may not actually come on
until<00:05:40.170> you<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.680> little<00:05:41.520> bit<00:05:41.610> of<00:05:41.700> time<00:05:41.880> goes<00:05:42.120> by

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
until you a little bit of time goes by

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.840 
until you a little bit of time goes by
says<00:05:42.600> you'll<00:05:42.720> have<00:05:42.870> a<00:05:42.900> delay<00:05:43.290> in<00:05:43.470> it

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
says you'll have a delay in it

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.130 
says you'll have a delay in it
so<00:05:44.850> always<00:05:45.180> look<00:05:45.360> to<00:05:45.390> kind<00:05:45.660> of<00:05:45.690> start<00:05:45.930> your

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
so always look to kind of start your
