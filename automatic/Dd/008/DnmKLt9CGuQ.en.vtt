00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.920
 This song goes to two brave heroes who put themselves in the floodlights 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.400
 Calling to fight to the dead goods ready to face in need 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.140
 Near the middle, they then built a fortress 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.700
 stood up, but certainly did not give up completely 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.600
 a not sure idea, with TNT should open the way if someone stands down 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.440
 With bow and arrow, they stood together with a plan in hand for the war ready 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.899
 and they got involved in a fight with Tobi and Stegi, always on it 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.929
 rigorously full risk, one thing remains And Balui says to Earli, Alter let it pop 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.699
 but this step took your pride and Earli reached for the lighter 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.299
 And the plan goes awry, everything flies in the air 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:16.200
 everything explodes to rubble an easy target, and death comes so unspeakably 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 the blood flies, rest in peace, team unable
