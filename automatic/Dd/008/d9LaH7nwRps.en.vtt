00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.680
 Hi, I'm pick szeged and welcome to 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.450
 this new series called roll the dice 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.150
 where we use a generator 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.530
 automatic classes rather random in 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.210
 which I will use the class that comes out 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.830
 during this video and the purpose is not 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.390
 it's just to see how well I'm doing with 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.490
 this class but see when it can be 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.619
 useful that we can save from this class 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.570
 that we can definitely paint and that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.460
 We can change or modify respect and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.520
 learn from her the class for this 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.920
 week is it was 927 infrared type food 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.199
 of and also extended charger the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.899
 pistol is a m 9 with suppressor 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.480
 team we will use c4 and the skill is 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.130
 the sprint or speed if we start 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.960
 for the main weapon then the weapon 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.969
 secondary school and what the team would be 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.100
 final what would be the chosen skill 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.800
 we can start by saying why the m 27 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.570
 is an excellent weapon of the kind of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.629
 support because because it's like the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.030
 merger of what would be an assault rifle 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.469
 with what would be the kind of support 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.059
 you have a certain precision a certain 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.489
 mobility not so many bullets in the charger 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.140
 in that sense he looks well benefited 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.309
 by the extended charger although the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.710
 loaded loaded removes the possibility 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.300
 use a heavy barrel that would give 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.190
 more accuracy of bullet velocity 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.200
 and a little more recoil 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.940
 the loaded is not so important 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.190
 extended with combinations whatever 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.170
 infrared sheet makes some 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.390
 way infrared sheet lose many 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.950
 bullets you're not used to 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.960
 I 'm not used to it and the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.370
 point is different from controlling the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.680
 recoil from a sight with a 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.300
 overview of only one point and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.820
 certain amount of zoom in which 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.600
 this happened your peripheral vision 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.940
 so what happens is that you have to 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.070
 lose more bullets and lose yourself in how many 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.020
 bullets can keep you that way 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.790
 works perfect extended charger 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.160
 in particular I prefer when 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.960
 you use one more class to give the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.570
 aggressive of what would be the kind of 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.370
 support use the charger I say the spout 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.750
 started or in case you go to 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.340
 play melee combat I prefer 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.960
 the laser sight the stadium charger 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.250
 works perfectly with waste 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.590
 of bullets that says and besides we do not have 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.510
 to worry about recharging so often and 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.979
 do not worry about saying or seeing 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.300
 too many enemies I think I will not be able 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.560
 control them all 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.270
 in this way could suppress us 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.010
 approach was at least accurate and they left 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.750
 more time to eliminate them all the 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.400
 kind of there are not many options in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.050
 the particular I do not prefer the handles 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.570
 front since they make the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.820
 weapon but the vip or somehow is 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.920
 a relationship hate 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.510
 love cost / benefit relationship like you 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.090
 I could call because it 's a hole 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.860
 that is a motionless target if you are at 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.000
 outdoors and you put with a bipod what 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.230
 more sure is that a sniper 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.630
 that red is going to blow your head in 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.250
 any time yes however if 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.990
 you are in a closed situation and you are 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.910
 thrown and waiting for the enemy for 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.550
 example a situation of the games of 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.290
 assault or error is excellent because this 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.540
 way you have the situation controlled 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.740
 practically perfect precision without 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.570
 However, I do not think there is another better 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.090
 option for the weapon more than a bipod 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.620
 because because really between losing 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.810
 precision and have the option of 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.980
 have a lot of pressure suddenly own the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.960
 option to have a lot of pressure in some 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.210
 moment of my disposition find 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.690
 gun to the m9 suppressed I do not like a 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.250
 tonel m 9 I prefer the mp 443 simply 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.930
 because the shooting pattern is different 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.310
 to what would be the m9 unlike 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.840
 bullets is also an important factor 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.390
 although talking about semi-automatic weapons 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.610
 suppressed pistols I find the best 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.700
 option in 1.009 I do not like it so much what 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.380
 that would be the g 17 I do not like what 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.390
 particular even though he is a lover of 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.520
 the block in real life the game like 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.140
 I feel that they are inconsistent and 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.730
 sometimes they get stuck and can not shoot so 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.830
 fast the mp too 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.110
 in how I feel that he loses the damage to 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.670
 faster distance is particularly 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.200
 what will be the placebo effect because 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.810
 all weapons in that sense are very 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.569
 similar but I do not like it more or less 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.370
 how the mpv 443 works with a 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.220
 suppressant so the m 9 is perfectly 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.510
 the perfect semiautomatic mode if 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.920
 I want to use a suppressed weapon in 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.030
 hand-to-hand combat for example the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.069
 that says I can also make a 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.099
 option but for this class in fact 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.560
 of power I do not know how to have a reliable weapon 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.420
 or maybe the opportunity to be in a bit 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.470
 stealthy with the enemy instead of 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.329
 stabbing him shoot with a gun 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.519
 suppressed was a good option for this 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.410
 class the m9 if we talk about what will be 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.359
 the c4 is perfect for this class and it is 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.459
 the strongest the support class because 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.500
 the c4 is very functional has its 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.079
 disposition to fly any vehicle 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.180
 some wall or even enemies and 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.220
 set a trap that works better 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.109
 that what would be a clay moore that does not 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.359
 kill them in a single one in their explosion 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.430
 of clamor I do not like it because it can be 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.430
 easily avoided simply go away 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.530
 squatting or chest ground and what can 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.300
 avoid and the case of c4 you 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.400
 I can just throw it around 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.300
 a corner cover explode it and 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.639
 clean 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.349
 to a room or some very difficult entrance 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.970
 create also steps for your team and 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.039
 is destroying some wall pulling 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.340
 something or maybe they have killed enemies 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.360
 through walls then the c4 is 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.940
 definitely for any class 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.530
 Support is extremely recommended by 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.199
 last the skill of what would be of 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.520
 the speed is very helpful yes although 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.139
 I prefer the support class of the 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.909
 ability to have greater suppression because 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.860
 you have more bullets and 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.360
 somehow funk is more like a class 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.580
 of literal support 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.770
 although the utility of stability in 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.690
 this class was good because it allowed me 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.120
 be more mobile more aggressive and have a 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.710
 behavior more or less similar to what 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.120
 will be the kind of assault and good until 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.560
 here the video I hope you learned something 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.360
 new that you like the series please 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.280
 leave your comments or what you think 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.599
 Some suggestions is also the 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.830
 pilot episode so I hope that you 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.090
 like the idea please leave a 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.800
 qualification to the video and they get 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.419
 subscribe if they are new visit the channel 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.830
 to see the other videos equally 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.150
 can follow social networks twitter 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.440
 and facebook in the description and some 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.139
 videos that you have not seen in the next 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.520
 screen see you in the next 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.060
 all right
