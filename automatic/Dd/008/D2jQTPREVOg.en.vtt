this<00:00:24.390> was<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.170> most<00:00:25.560> expensive<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.460> 25

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
pounds plus 3 pounds delivery so i think

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.430

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
and then inside the box the bottom we've

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.480 
and then inside the box the bottom we've
actually<00:02:59.970> got<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.480> little<00:03:00.660> album<00:03:01.340> which<00:03:02.340> i

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
actually got the little album which i

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.950 
actually got the little album which i
guess<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.270> normal<00:03:03.420> kind<00:03:03.810> of

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
guess is just like the normal kind of

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.860 
guess is just like the normal kind of
wand<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.790> perform<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.850> think<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.420> get<00:03:06.480> extra

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
wand I perform I think I get extra

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.830 
wand I perform I think I get extra
tracks<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.970> yeah<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.300> there's<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.570> trap

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840

listing<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.840> think<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.410> these<00:03:13.560> after<00:03:14.220> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
listing and I think that these after the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.290 
listing and I think that these after the
line<00:03:15.410> could<00:03:16.410> be<00:03:16.550> extras<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.730> there's<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.060> two

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
line could be extras and there's the two

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.160 
line could be extras and there's the two
nite<00:03:19.140> remixes<00:03:19.860> on<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.130> end<00:03:20.280> as<00:03:20.520> well<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:21.170> like

there's<00:05:13.980> the<00:05:14.100> old<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.580> I<00:05:14.640> think<00:05:15.410> again<00:05:16.410> and

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
there's the old and I think again and

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.010 
there's the old and I think again and
that's<00:05:17.850> just<00:05:17.940> slightly<00:05:18.240> inside<00:05:18.570> of<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.810> box

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
that's just slightly inside of the box

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.730 
that's just slightly inside of the box
so<00:05:19.260> it's<00:05:19.410> just<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:20.060> CD<00:05:21.060> bit<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:22.590> there's

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
so it's just the CD bit and there's

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.350 
so it's just the CD bit and there's
nothing<00:05:22.860> on<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:23.190> back<00:05:23.370> it's<00:05:23.550> just<00:05:23.610> plain<00:05:24.000> ugly

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
nothing on the back it's just plain ugly

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.650 
nothing on the back it's just plain ugly
