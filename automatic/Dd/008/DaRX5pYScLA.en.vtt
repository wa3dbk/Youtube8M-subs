as well so we're going to try something
we're<00:01:41.159> going<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> drive<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> southern

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
we're going to drive to the southern

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.420 
we're going to drive to the southern
part<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.780> our<00:01:42.899> viewing<00:01:43.079> area<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:44.009> if

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
part of our viewing area to see if

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.310 
part of our viewing area to see if
you'll<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.850> able<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> digital<00:01:45.630> signal

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
you'll be able to get a digital signal

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.560 
you'll be able to get a digital signal
on<00:01:46.530> one<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.950> these

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.390 

okay<00:01:52.570> so<00:01:52.630> we're<00:01:52.900> on<00:01:52.930> Marco<00:01:53.440> Island<00:01:53.470> now<00:01:54.070> let's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
okay so we're on Marco Island now let's

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.370 
okay so we're on Marco Island now let's
give<00:01:54.580> this<00:01:54.700> thing<00:01:54.910> a<00:01:54.970> try<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:55.960> looks<00:01:56.200> like

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
give this thing a try and it looks like

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.950 
give this thing a try and it looks like
down<00:01:56.620> here<00:01:56.680> we<00:01:57.250> can't<00:01:57.550> get<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.910> digital<00:01:58.270> signal

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
down here we can't get a digital signal

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.320 
down here we can't get a digital signal
for<00:01:59.290> Marco<00:01:59.740> Island<00:02:00.220> more<00:02:00.430> or<00:02:00.520> less<00:02:00.640> they<00:02:00.790> most

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
for Marco Island more or less they most

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.580 
for Marco Island more or less they most
likely<00:02:01.660> going<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.840> need<00:02:01.990> something<00:02:02.170> outside

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
likely going to need something outside

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.740 
likely going to need something outside
park<00:02:03.160> says<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.610> only<00:02:03.970> real<00:02:04.120> option<00:02:04.150> to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
park says the only real option to

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.930 
park says the only real option to
improve<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.350> digital<00:02:05.770> signals<00:02:06.250> down<00:02:06.520> south

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
improve the digital signals down south

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.389 
improve the digital signals down south
is<00:02:07.270> an<00:02:07.720> antenna<00:02:08.170> like<00:02:08.260> this<00:02:08.770> one<00:02:09.010> that<00:02:09.220> you'd

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
is an antenna like this one that you'd

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.450 
is an antenna like this one that you'd
put<00:02:09.700> on<00:02:09.820> your<00:02:10.210> home<00:02:10.420> or<00:02:10.750> in<00:02:11.050> your<00:02:11.080> attic<00:02:11.590> just<00:02:12.370> a

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
put on your home or in your attic just a

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.650 
put on your home or in your attic just a
couple<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.760> bolts<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.120> goes<00:02:13.300> through<00:02:13.510> each

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
couple of bolts that goes through each

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.420 
couple of bolts that goes through each
section<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.620> these<00:02:14.740> work<00:02:14.980> very<00:02:15.340> well

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
section of it and these work very well

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.430 
section of it and these work very well
the<00:02:16.000> only<00:02:16.210> drawbacks<00:02:16.570> they<00:02:16.720> are<00:02:16.810> fairly<00:02:17.140> large

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
the only drawbacks they are fairly large

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.650 
the only drawbacks they are fairly large
but<00:02:17.920> they<00:02:18.100> will<00:02:18.310> draw<00:02:18.700> in<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.970> station<00:02:19.330> up<00:02:19.510> to

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
but they will draw in a station up to

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.570 
but they will draw in a station up to
about<00:02:19.870> 80<00:02:20.170> miles<00:02:20.380> away<00:02:20.530> not<00:02:21.070> everyone<00:02:21.430> would

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
about 80 miles away not everyone would

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.340 
about 80 miles away not everyone would
want<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:22.030> on<00:02:22.210> their<00:02:22.360> house<00:02:22.600> though<00:02:22.990> and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
want this on their house though and

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.350 
want this on their house though and
there's<00:02:23.710> no<00:02:23.890> guarantee<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.610> would<00:02:24.760> stay<00:02:25.120> up

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
there's no guarantee it would stay up

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.590 
there's no guarantee it would stay up
during<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.840> storm<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:27.070> your<00:02:27.340> best<00:02:27.580> bet<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:27.940> buy<00:02:28.570> a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
during a storm so your best bet is buy a

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.080 
during a storm so your best bet is buy a
portable<00:02:29.050> digital<00:02:29.650> TV<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.280> try<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.640> out<00:02:30.820> well

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
portable digital TV and try it out well

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.230 
portable digital TV and try it out well
before<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.630> storm<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.290> coming<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:33.520> way<00:02:33.790> if<00:02:34.030> you

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
before a storm is coming that way if you

before a storm is coming that way if you
