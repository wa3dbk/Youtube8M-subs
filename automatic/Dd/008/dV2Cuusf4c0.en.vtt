00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
I'm gonna do is hold out tightly my

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.340 
I'm gonna do is hold out tightly my
bottle<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.590> start<00:00:38.309> spinning<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:39.110> towards<00:00:40.110> me

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
bottle and start spinning it towards me

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.650 
bottle and start spinning it towards me
like<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:43.309> just<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.390> wearing

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
like that just like that I like wearing

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110 
like that just like that I like wearing
gloves<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:47.039> because<00:00:47.610> it's

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
gloves when I do that because it's

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.860 
gloves when I do that because it's
easier<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.800> bottle<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.789> bottle<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.329> sweeping

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
easier the bottle the bottle is sweeping

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.080 
easier the bottle the bottle is sweeping
so<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.320> easier<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.949> hold<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.370> bottle<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
so it's easier to hold the bottle and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.319 
so it's easier to hold the bottle and
what<00:00:54.780> I'm<00:00:54.899> gonna<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.500> turn<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.460> towards<00:00:57.090> me

heat<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.780> up<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:37.380> we're<00:02:37.620> pretty<00:02:37.800> much<00:02:38.070> using

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
heat it up so we're pretty much using

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.760 
heat it up so we're pretty much using
science<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.540> cut<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.590> bottle

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
all the way around hot water now we're

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.820 
all the way around hot water now we're
gonna<00:02:47.340> use<00:02:47.460> cold<00:02:47.970> water<00:02:48.090> again<00:02:51.290> all<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.650> way

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
gonna use cold water again all the way

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.960 
gonna use cold water again all the way
around<00:02:53.070> he<00:02:53.430> sees<00:02:53.700> about<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.930> funnel<00:02:55.610> all<00:02:56.610> the

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
around he sees about the funnel all the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.410 
around he sees about the funnel all the
way<00:02:57.150> along

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.270 

now<00:03:01.420> hot<00:03:01.720> water<00:03:02.050> again<00:03:04.530> photo<00:03:05.530> next<00:03:06.130> what

be glass now and then I'm gonna start
sending<00:03:33.490> it<00:03:33.880> in<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.150> circular<00:03:34.720> motions<00:03:35.290> just

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
sending it in the circular motions just

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.330 
sending it in the circular motions just
like<00:03:35.830> that<00:03:40.380> if<00:03:41.380> we're<00:03:41.590> going<00:03:41.740> to<00:03:41.860> look<00:03:42.040> at<00:03:42.190> it

in close-up you see we polished side
that<00:03:44.980> here<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.580> darker<00:03:46.240> Luke<00:03:47.050> is<00:03:47.440> not

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
that here and darker Luke is not

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.610 
that here and darker Luke is not
polished<00:03:49.210> yet<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:49.780> want<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.230> make<00:03:50.380> sure

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
polished yet so you want to make sure

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.530 
polished yet so you want to make sure
you<00:03:50.770> polished<00:03:51.250> all<00:03:51.490> the<00:03:51.520> way<00:03:51.820> so<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.270> looks

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
you polished all the way so it looks

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.560 
you polished all the way so it looks
like<00:03:52.660> this<00:03:52.960> gray<00:03:53.320> all<00:03:54.220> around<00:03:54.850> it<00:03:55.180> because

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
like this gray all around it because

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.680 
like this gray all around it because
where<00:03:56.440> it's<00:03:56.620> still<00:03:57.430> like<00:03:57.670> dark<00:03:58.000> lines<00:03:58.390> out

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
where it's still like dark lines out

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.680 
where it's still like dark lines out
here<00:03:58.720> it's<00:03:59.590> non<00:03:59.890> polished<00:04:00.460> glass<00:04:00.760> yet<00:04:01.210> so<00:04:01.570> it

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
here it's non polished glass yet so it

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.890 
here it's non polished glass yet so it
might<00:04:01.900> be<00:04:01.960> sharp<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.240> what<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.660> want
