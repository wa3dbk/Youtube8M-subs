00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.299
 hello whom are we going to do today? 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.889
 a very simple mobility the truth something 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.809
 that I had in a book because a friend 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.730
 mine separador pequeñito de libros 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.360
 how today would be perfect to create 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.670
 floor 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.140
 twitter is so easy to do and then 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.119
 we are going to make it without artist 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.830
 you really need paper glue 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.210
 cardboards things that surely already 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.890
 you have in your house so let's see 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.050
 how do you do the first thing that we're going to 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
 to occupy is white leaves and then leaves 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.439
 of color you see that the colored leaves 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.180
 they are a little thicker and apart 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.160
 we need decorated leaves that are 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.380
 still a little thicker from the leaves 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.200
 of color we need zeebo glue 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.820
 in bar and scissors the first thing you have 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.559
 what to do is draw animals or 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.660
 characters are cartoon dolls 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.450
 the one you like the most, paste all our 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.370
 little pictures on the white sheet and this is going to 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.989
 be our first layer after we 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.969
 let's stick on our colored sheets 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.160
 and this is going to be our second layer 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.690
 to reinforce them and finally we're going to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.399
 paste on the white part of our 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.410
 decorated leaves so that on the part of 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.930
 back our spacers have that 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.789
 design since you have the three layers of 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.320
 protection now yes we are going to cut 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.880
 our drawings by leds 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.950
 be careful because it's going to be a bit difficult 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.600
 because it's going to be pretty hard on our 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.670
 separator once you have them all 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.920
 clipped has the part where it 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.960
 they become separators for example I 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.300
 I drew a puppy and I'm going to cut it 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.580
 lines of his hands just like this 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.800
 so that the paws can hold on to the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.540
 finger sheets just like that and so 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.369
 you just have to see what part the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.750
 you are going to cut your drawings so that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.790
 determine the time for example 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.619
 Kitty also cut the legs and 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.420
 another juice I completely cut the two 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.190
 rooms and the piquito the only thing that you have left 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.520
 to do is give them color and they will be 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.520
 ready 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.030
 you see that the 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.760
 separators and it's a matter of your 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.440
 imagination creativity what animal 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.720
 people that you want to do remember that 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.880
 you just have to put what you think 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.320
 how it's going to brown on the leaves and 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.090
 leave out everything is very very easy 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.740
 so I hope you do and remember 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.210
 that if you are going to put into practice you do not 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.800
 go to take a picture and in vain throw 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.630
