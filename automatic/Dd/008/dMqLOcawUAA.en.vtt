00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.789 
that still feeling like you're in a
pretty<00:04:00.940> good<00:04:01.090> position<00:04:01.440> Jim<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.470> actually

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
pretty good position Jim I actually

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.340 
pretty good position Jim I actually
think<00:04:03.459> that<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:04.180> competition<00:04:04.900> has<00:04:05.140> now

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
think that the competition has now

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.770 
think that the competition has now
recognized<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.970> we<00:04:07.120> have<00:04:07.360> set<00:04:07.630> the

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
recognized that we have set the

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.630 
recognized that we have set the
benchmark<00:04:08.230> at<00:04:08.380> this<00:04:08.560> point<00:04:08.860> and<00:04:09.040> they're<00:04:09.489> now

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
benchmark at this point and they're now

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.340 
benchmark at this point and they're now
responding<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.329> it<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:10.900> think<00:04:10.959> with

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
responding to it and I think with

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.949 
responding to it and I think with
locking<00:04:11.920> this<00:04:12.130> initial<00:04:12.579> round<00:04:12.730> of<00:04:12.910> funding<00:04:13.269> we

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
locking this initial round of funding we

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.960 
locking this initial round of funding we
will<00:04:14.170> go<00:04:14.350> ballistic<00:04:14.680> at<00:04:15.010> this<00:04:15.160> point<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:15.730> good

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
will go ballistic at this point and good

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.449 
will go ballistic at this point and good
luck<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.419> competition<00:04:17.019> I<00:04:17.200> think<00:04:17.680> we<00:04:18.190> fit

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
luck to the competition I think we fit

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.310 
luck to the competition I think we fit
very<00:04:18.790> well<00:04:19.000> there<00:04:19.269> is<00:04:19.390> no<00:04:19.690> one<00:04:19.870> else<00:04:20.019> in<00:04:20.200> the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
very well there is no one else in the

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.500 
very well there is no one else in the
space<00:04:20.560> at<00:04:20.769> this<00:04:20.890> point<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.489> we<00:04:22.030> get<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.330> first

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
space at this point and we get the first

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.050 
space at this point and we get the first
airplane<00:04:22.930> up<00:04:23.169> and<00:04:23.349> flying<00:04:23.620> it<00:04:24.160> will<00:04:24.400> confirm

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
airplane up and flying it will confirm

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.240 
airplane up and flying it will confirm
the<00:04:25.300> benchmark

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
the benchmark

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.510 
the benchmark

tool<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:45.930> think<00:04:46.650> one<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.040> key<00:04:47.280> elements

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
tool I think one of the key elements

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.580 
tool I think one of the key elements
that<00:04:48.060> was<00:04:48.390> pointed<00:04:48.900> out<00:04:48.990> when<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.410> auto

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590

smaller fields with ease but with speed

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.520 
smaller fields with ease but with speed
is<00:05:08.970> what's<00:05:09.330> going<00:05:09.510> to<00:05:09.600> be<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.870> benchmark<00:05:10.080> and

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
is what's going to be the benchmark and

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.010 
is what's going to be the benchmark and
that<00:05:10.890> again<00:05:11.220> just<00:05:11.490> reconfirms<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.480> original
