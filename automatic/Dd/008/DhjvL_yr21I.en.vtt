00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello everybody, I'm a doctor, alexandre lima 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.230
 I am a doctor in love with technology and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.870
 I'm here for another video of 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.030
 our series one moment for your skin 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.470
 I'm going to talk about sleeping tonight. 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.830
 with wet hair 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.330
 This is bad, but evil. Hair is myth. 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.990
 or truth 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.880
 in reality it can be one thing and another 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.699
 if your doubt is sleeping with your hair 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.070
 wet damages the hair strand that is 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.130
 Myth of sleep with wet hair does not 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.200
 damage the hair structure of hair 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.870
 if the question is sleep with the hair 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.969
 can cause some problem 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.780
 the answer is yes sleep with the hair 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.110
 humidity can cause a greater 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.360
 prone to fungal infections to 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.399
 triggering seborrheic dermatitis 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.800
 and appearance of dandruff 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.329
 however the main point is not 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.539
 properly sleeping with wet hair 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.609
 but rather keep your hair moist by far 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.369
 time then those people who stay at the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.070
 long hair with very tight hair 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.619
 with cream can also go through these 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.549
 problems I mentioned earlier 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.200
 The tip I leave for you today is 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.930
 preferably wash your hair daily 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.960
 if you do not let it go there one day, one day 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.840
 it's not reasonable this is good 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.250
 avoid leaving conditioner cream on 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.270
 hair 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.860
 when leaving the bath dry sufficiently if the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.270
 time is short if you are almost at 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.420
 bedtime 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.750
 use the cold dryer that helps dry 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.430
 enough without hitting both the wire 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.040
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.710
 our video and our tip enjoy and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.619
 so now our channel you 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.049
 will receive the next videos as soon as 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.060
 they hugged each other and 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.060
 until the next one stays until the next video
