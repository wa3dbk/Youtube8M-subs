00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.569
 welcome to football environment tv this is 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.950
 express a video in the category of 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.269
 game system 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.790
 all movies and see again on our 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.410
 website under your own youtube channel 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.570
 the battle 11 against 11 I have one 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.790
 1433 formation with black 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.730
 versus a fourth that bread 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.680
 we now deal with defending it 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.160
 putting pressure on the structure of the red 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.540
 party they look at the drawing than me 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.520
 put it so that the number 9 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.040
 position choose between numbers 3 and 4 of 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.989
 red and the numbers 11 and 7 are not with 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.969
 their last opponent 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.140
 if that is the case then it is 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.309
 actually very easy to build 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.170
 The choices also deposit the trainer and 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.449
 of course also the flower you want 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.550
 In this situation you need the tea 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.739
 dangerous not to build on 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.649
 and the probability that the bulb at a time 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.659
 going up stairs is very big 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.710
 for example, do you have a defense 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.390
 your midfield 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.339
 vision strong players who are leaders 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.239
 then it can be a choice to do this 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.979
 to do 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.479
 Willem Counterparty very much like the build-up 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.820
 player from backwards 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.640
 then this can also be a choice of course 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.420
 You can vary this and you could 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.800
 say you 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.570
 we just want someone at the ball 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.580
 I might get a little less well 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.720
 often left in the center is a 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.940
 right-legged play when for example 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.500
 this ball is played isn't it 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.300
 only the number 9 to the close here 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.280
 runs out and the back expires 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.820
 but at the same time with a response from 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.560
 an a4 can put 7 of black print 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.850
 whereby 4 is enclosed by two 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.280
 players other possibility is that 10 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.950
 release his opponent and from this 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.210
 side is going to put pressure on the number 4 then 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.230
 is being forced to be less 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.000
 good left leg 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.920
 yes and then it is almost always a ball 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.040
 the one that shoots out or you lose your ball 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.500
 leading the role of midfield is here 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.060
 important because set the counterparty 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.940
 knows under the pressure of the to 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.580
 and for example through a de 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.140
 boldero two get by then say 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.150
 but from your midfield 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.490
 that the recognize where can you 8 can 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.800
 get off you six can write to 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.349
 the side of the shore your 7 becomes center 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.439
 filled the side of the ball you put everything 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.480
 fix the other side you leave open 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:15.010
 I'm here or in favor of it 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.440
 there are very few teams 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.810
 under pressure from a counter 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.300
 the daring to play football and the right one 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.710
 know how to find a solution under pressure 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.750
 You come on a give your defense 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.620
 then I am in favor of always 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.840
 in the back 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.490
 from zwolle or play an opponent 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.600
 to immediately with two but three out of four 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.630
 pointed plays 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.970
 you can always take your back line from 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.580
 spray the same organization 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.160
 if the ball reaches red 7 then I would like to 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.650
 that covers the five from the depth 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.880
 so that 7 cannot turn 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.050
 as long as they are face to face 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.830
 own goal is not 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.150
 dangerous the number 4 the three 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.520
 but also the two that come in 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.200
 and give the back cover to get the depth 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.030
 look like that when a ball what 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.830
 played back after, for example, eight and 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.480
 is played forward then you already have 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.230
 defenders you have the first meters 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.230
 head Start 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.870
 you have a question about game systems to 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.000
 a very good suggestion 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.920
 respond to our youtube channel of course 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.730

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.730
