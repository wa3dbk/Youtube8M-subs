00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.640
 to avoid blockages the last balance 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.580

 traditional transport damaged and 14 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.459

 15 million pesos transporters 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.430
 they assure that they will maintain unemployment but without 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.680
 However, they remain open to dialogue 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.090

 Northwest of Bogota with Juan Carlos

 villán and what happens there so far 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.780
 Juan Carlos we hear it 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.520
 jorge alfredo viewers good night 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.440
 first we did a tour starting 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.120
 in the upload portal there we could 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.520
 evidence thousands and thousands of Bogota citizens 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.500
 trying to mobilize from his place 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.160
 of work to their homes we could 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.840
 see what they were trying 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.420
 desperately to get some 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.670
 means of transport the stp buses 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.290
 crowded and crowded of users 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.239
 we saw many people also using 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.040
 alternative transports many people 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.850
 riding a bike using the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.610
 bicycle to get to their homes 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.130
 also many people taking the taxi and 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.080
 they told us just that the city 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.180
 according to the users we interviewed 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.730
 I was still prepared for that kind of 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.590
 stoppages because the buses of the s &amp; p seems 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.030
 that are not enough to move around 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.560
 the city that people said that 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.810
 we interview system users 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.540
 of transport from bogota we also made 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.680
 know the opinion of the experts 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.600
 We spoke with them to tell us 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.190
 what's happening in Bogota if that unemployment 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.169
 it is convenient or not if the reasons for 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.970
 unemployment are fair and who are the most 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.250
 harmed 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.200
 for some mobility experts the 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.700
 unemployment reasons are valid even if 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.380
 that is not justified is that the 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.690
 citizens are the most affected in 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.430
 this time they have some demands 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.200
 that are absolutely reasonable and 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.150
 legitimate because they were part of a 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.130
 business and they were behind some 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.990
 promises made to them with the system 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.280
 integrated but others like the dean of 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.170
 the engineering faculty of the 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.850
 University of the Andes considers that 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.500
 the mayor's strategy is adequate 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.450
 this is a demonstration that those of 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.740
 pep has a potential to be solved 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.150
 the flaws but clearly the 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.840
 experiment what is working for 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.370
 all right 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.110
 Bogota can live a transport 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.330
 collective transporters for their 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.670
 part justify their protest we 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.900
 we are not at the peak and plate we are not 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.690
 according to what the 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.490
 Transmilenio mayor who collected more 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.960
 thousand and one thousand cars and they are not 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.430
 complying with the rents 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.750
 for now the transporters 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.550
 confirmed that the continuous strike 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.200
 and here in the locality of rise where we 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.630
 we find there is a relative normality 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.910
 however we see passing the stp buses 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.380
 full of passengers the taxis do not give 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.360
 there is also a presence 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.590
 supposed by the police to 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.420
 provide security but also for 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.010
 avoid some kind of alteration of the 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.970
 public order information from the 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.500
 north-west of bogota
