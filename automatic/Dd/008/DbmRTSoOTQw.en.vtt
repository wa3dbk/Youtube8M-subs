revving<00:00:12.540> out<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:13.049> control<00:00:13.440> I'm<00:00:13.980> going<00:00:14.219> to

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
revving out of control I'm going to

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.860 
revving out of control I'm going to
start<00:00:14.580> up<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.880> engine<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.389> you're<00:00:15.660> going<00:00:15.809> to

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
start up the engine and you're going to

start up the engine and you're going to
notice<00:00:16.020> as<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.529> play<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> throttle<00:00:17.460> lever

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
notice as I play with the throttle lever

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.670 
notice as I play with the throttle lever
control<00:00:18.449> it's<00:00:18.750> not<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.289> make<00:00:19.439> any

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
control it's not going to make any

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:31.630 
control it's not going to make any
difference<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.640> speed<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.449> engine

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.310 

now<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.669> only<00:00:32.880> started<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> engine<00:00:33.870> briefly

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
now I only started the engine briefly

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.020 
now I only started the engine briefly
because<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:35.070> not<00:00:35.190> want<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.670> let<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.910> run

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
because you do not want to let it run

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.729 
because you do not want to let it run
like<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.600> too<00:00:36.780> long<00:00:36.960> because<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.559> could

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
like this for too long because you could

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.889 
like this for too long because you could
end<00:00:37.770> up<00:00:38.040> blowing<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> connecting<00:00:38.910> rod<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.420> just

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899

problem<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.160> engine<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
problem on this engine is that the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.420 
problem on this engine is that the
people<00:00:48.480> left<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.930> outside<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.800> probably<00:00:50.340> over

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
people left it outside for probably over

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.000 
people left it outside for probably over
a<00:00:50.730> year<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.420> even<00:00:52.170> though<00:00:52.350> there's<00:00:52.590> usually<00:00:52.800> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
a year and even though there's usually a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.100 
a year and even though there's usually a
cover<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> carburetor<00:00:54.719> water

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
cover like this on the carburetor water

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.439 
cover like this on the carburetor water
can<00:00:55.410> still<00:00:55.739> get<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.489> carburetor<00:00:56.940> itself

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
can still get on the carburetor itself

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.900 
can still get on the carburetor itself
what's<00:00:58.289> happened<00:00:58.739> here<00:00:59.039> because<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.520> was<00:00:59.609> left

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
what's happened here because it was left

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.060 
what's happened here because it was left
out<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.359> elements<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.469> throttle

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
out in the elements is that the throttle

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.520 
out in the elements is that the throttle
shaft<00:01:02.640> over<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.570> which<00:01:03.870> controls<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
shaft over here which controls the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.649 
shaft over here which controls the
butterfly<00:01:04.979> inside<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> carburetor<00:01:05.659> it's

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
butterfly inside the carburetor it's

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.830 
butterfly inside the carburetor it's
pretty<00:01:07.020> well<00:01:07.200> jammed<00:01:07.500> up<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.299> can<00:01:09.299> move<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.659> now

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
pretty well jammed up I can move it now

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.270 
pretty well jammed up I can move it now
but<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.260> very<00:01:10.350> stiff<00:01:12.860> what<00:01:13.860> I'm<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.130> do

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
but it's very stiff what I'm going to do

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
but it's very stiff what I'm going to do
to<00:01:14.400> fix<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.760> problem<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.450> spray<00:01:15.869> some

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
to fix this problem is spray some

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.679 
to fix this problem is spray some
penetrating<00:01:16.770> oil<00:01:17.180> specifically<00:01:18.180> all<00:01:18.360> over

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
penetrating oil specifically all over

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.420 
penetrating oil specifically all over
here<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.460> do<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.640> liberally<00:01:22.220> it's<00:01:23.220> better

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
here and do this liberally it's better

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.280 
here and do this liberally it's better
to<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> engine<00:01:24.720> cold<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.170> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
to do this with the engine cold then you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.080 
to do this with the engine cold then you
won't<00:01:25.439> burn<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.770> hands<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> muffler<00:01:26.640> now

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
won't burn your hands on the muffler now

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.490 
won't burn your hands on the muffler now
I'm<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> grab<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.810> throttle<00:01:28.259> shaft

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
I'm going to grab the throttle shaft

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.170 
I'm going to grab the throttle shaft
here<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.070> move<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.610> back<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
here and just move it like this back and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.620 
here and just move it like this back and
forth<00:01:31.189> this<00:01:32.189> should<00:01:32.460> eventually<00:01:32.729> loosen<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
forth this should eventually loosen it

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.530 
forth this should eventually loosen it
enough<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.500> work<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.540> also

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540

going<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:55.750> give<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.049> one<00:01:56.080> more<00:01:56.440> start<00:01:56.830> just<00:01:57.159> to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
going to give it one more start just to

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:10.240 
going to give it one more start just to
check<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.700> out<00:01:57.760> at<00:01:57.970> this<00:01:58.119> point

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250

it's a lot better at least it does not

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.960 
it's a lot better at least it does not
over<00:02:12.990> rev<00:02:13.170> at<00:02:13.320> this<00:02:13.530> point<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.400> does<00:02:14.610> move<00:02:14.850> a

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
over rev at this point it does move a

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.820 
over rev at this point it does move a
lot<00:02:15.150> more<00:02:15.390> freely<00:02:15.690> as<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.080> can<00:02:16.230> see<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:16.680> when

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
lot more freely as you can see but when

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.560 
lot more freely as you can see but when
it<00:02:16.920> comes<00:02:17.100> time<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.370> coming<00:02:17.850> right<00:02:18.060> back<00:02:18.240> down

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
it comes time to coming right back down

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.390 
it comes time to coming right back down
it's<00:02:18.930> stiff<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:19.800> going<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.950> work<00:02:20.190> it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
it's stiff so I'm just going to work it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.580 
it's stiff so I'm just going to work it
back<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.670> forth<00:02:23.720> it's<00:02:24.720> already<00:02:25.170> starting<00:02:25.560> to

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
back and forth it's already starting to

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.580 
back and forth it's already starting to
move<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.950> lot<00:02:26.130> more<00:02:26.340> freely<00:02:26.640> now<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:28.290> want<00:02:28.440> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
move a lot more freely now you want the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.560 
move a lot more freely now you want the
back<00:02:28.800> part<00:02:29.160> that's<00:02:29.370> bent<00:02:29.670> down<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.360> the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
back part that's bent down on the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.210 
back part that's bent down on the
throttle<00:02:30.720> shaft<00:02:31.170> here<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.710> actually<00:02:31.860> come

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
throttle shaft here to actually come

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.010 
throttle shaft here to actually come
back<00:02:32.370> against<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.120> screw<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.990> other

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
back against this screw on the other

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.199 
back against this screw on the other
side<00:02:34.410> when<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.250> add<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.550> throttle<00:02:35.760> shaft

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
side when you add the throttle shaft

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.360 
side when you add the throttle shaft
down<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.050> move<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.380> butterfly<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.890> come

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
down and you move the butterfly to come

00:02:38.370 --> 00:03:08.280 
down and you move the butterfly to come
back<00:02:38.520> on<00:02:38.730> its<00:02:38.910> own<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.300> this

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.240 

sometimes<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.470> will<00:03:09.530> be<00:03:09.590> easier<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:09.920> repair

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
sometimes it will be easier to repair

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.370 
sometimes it will be easier to repair
like<00:03:10.460> that<00:03:10.640> sometimes<00:03:11.180> not<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.720> lesson<00:03:12.260> in

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
like that sometimes not the lesson in

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.750 
like that sometimes not the lesson in
today's<00:03:12.650> video<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:13.070> to<00:03:13.190> not<00:03:13.490> leave<00:03:13.610> your

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
equipment outside in the rain and the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.770 
equipment outside in the rain and the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
snow now when your engine over revs like

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.630 
snow now when your engine over revs like
that<00:03:17.990> shut<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.530> off<00:03:18.650> immediately

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
that shut it off immediately

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.790 
that shut it off immediately
the<00:03:19.940> cause<00:03:20.209> of<00:03:20.240> over-revving<00:03:21.170> may<00:03:21.470> be<00:03:21.530> for

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
the cause of over-revving may be for

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.720 
the cause of over-revving may be for
different<00:03:21.980> reasons

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
different reasons

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.699 
different reasons
todays<00:03:23.060> reason<00:03:23.570> ended<00:03:23.870> up<00:03:23.990> being<00:03:24.290> that<00:03:24.530> the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
todays reason ended up being that the

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.670 
todays reason ended up being that the
throttle<00:03:25.100> shaft<00:03:25.280> was<00:03:25.610> seized<00:03:25.970> or<00:03:26.240> tight

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
throttle shaft was seized or tight

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.720 
throttle shaft was seized or tight
