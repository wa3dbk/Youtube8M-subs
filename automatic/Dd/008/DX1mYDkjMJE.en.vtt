00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.700
 galera held chapter 684 of naruto 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.860
 If you have not yet read in the description you 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.440
 link from my great partner naruto 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.660
 provides for you to check arrived and will 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.630
 like and at the beginning of the chapter 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.400
 death asks to sakudir pronar oto a 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.680
 Lean on my body that I'm going to take 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.330
 you to another dimension that means 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.400
 something important was more valuable in 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.859
 hour at the time I saw this was it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.830
 Remember that girl that day 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.350
 luzescrita in barbarous variety I like 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.780
 I really surprised myself with this song. 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.910
 with the other analyzing the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.219
 situation he thought this was 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.649
 surprising and it's time to be a guy who 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.059
 have a dream of yours then more 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.100
 than at the time it starts to have 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.960
 strategic thoughts of perceiving the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.789
 that works and what does not work as 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.399
 doing what they do and I think that is already in 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.960
 time for him to have this mental evolution 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.030
 initially when the people spoke to 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.250
 set the tone i'll leave your dick in 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.980
 boiling point I did in football 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.780
 the good fac is not a sougou that had the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.760
 power of the lava but I remembered that it 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.500
 have the power and the steam and even the ranking 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.750
 he used this to increase his strength 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.970
 physics that the fire did not do 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.700
 increase in physical strength was what 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.200
 made it possible to punch a 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.850
 The ranking was not even true. 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.189
 flying across the back of the head and sending away 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.659
 now in the fight to change 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.460
 head and sent the path away 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.159
 too much in the time of naruto in the team 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.330
 found so many animals are 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.490
 storing a farmhouse for him for a 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.439
 together we at the right time is that 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.210
 he needs the program done on time 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.159
 that he needed the blame in the fight has a 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.170
 come to you here example has already sung 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.509
 Oh man, when I was the kid. 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.880
 making the tazio load emotive joseph 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.649
 Ricardo, what a fuck you remember 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.320
 first time he did this the first 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.509
 chapter and is now very sensational in 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.009
 At first he had no control over the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.250
 technique and now it is in control 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.920
 of the technique and he can know the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.140
 that the other thinks it is sensational to be 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.540
 won the sound with the character has still 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.250
 more with no naruto and yet that 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.740
 It was too last chapter I 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.070
 I wondered if the fact that Naruto wanted to go 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.870
 to another dimension 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.460
 Sunday also want to go to another 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.100
 dimension if this was not going to happen 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.260
 but it was not essential to 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.850
 whom the plan of success obtained in the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.530
 lugo also want to move to another 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.110
 dimension that when he went to another 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.350
 dimension of the fight the sack get over now 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.390
 they arrived there only that the death and sakura 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.459
 I think in the fight was also went to the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.590
 field and when it arrived like this says did 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.750
 the goalie was scored another goal then the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.850
 true naruto was but inside the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.459
 dimension of the load he made another puts 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.560
 he disappeared together with the ear and with 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.510
 the bag in the field and this was legal the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.820
 event using field and within dimension 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.820
 Cacuia of this found it very time I 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.709
 I thought it was ridiculous it was cable and 10 black did not 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.440
 to realize that he did this 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.660
 to make up his presence I found it 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.880
 ridiculous actually but ok and in that 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.100
 chapter finally confirmed one thing 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.660
 everyone already suspected only 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.160
 those two balls that have on the head 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.170
 that I have no idea what 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.820
 I already researched several characters 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.519
 from that business there one bears the name 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.620
 to that form of separation in hair 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.390
 people thought that what to pamper the office was 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.280
 descending cable and has now 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.410
 confirmed when she uses the bone to 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.600
 make the egg in notify the network more in 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.690
 watch a clue will understand why 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.640
 That I saw when the boy had tea. 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.130
 there is a better known chapter that 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.840
 had some action scenes was not 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.549
 very informative the fact is not known 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.590
 than pampering you really decent 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.450
 wedlock was the cool chapter I liked 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.640
 Quite running but I did not like it 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.459
 was that it is in great shape and being 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.530
 still a good boy his gift of oil in 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:43.570
 one chapter only fooled the head two 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:45.400
 times while kakashi but that's it 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.950
 ends this video with an issue 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.170
 Where is the real nan? 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.660
 comments on their opinions on this 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.150
 chapter and we find each other 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.250
