00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
little bit longer growing up driving for

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
little bit longer growing up driving for
my<00:01:02.760> dad<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.180> know<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.719> were<00:01:03.870> under<00:01:04.409> budgeted

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
my dad you know we were under budgeted

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.859 
my dad you know we were under budgeted
and<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.670> always<00:01:05.820> were<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.570> little<00:01:06.689> bit

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
and you know we always were a little bit

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.719 
and you know we always were a little bit
down<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.020> power<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.590> maybe<00:01:08.220> didn't<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
down on power and maybe didn't have the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.340 
down on power and maybe didn't have the
best<00:01:08.850> body<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.360> our<00:01:09.689> strengths<00:01:10.020> were<00:01:10.110> always

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
best body so our strengths were always

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.810 
best body so our strengths were always
to<00:01:10.500> find<00:01:10.740> keep<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> thing<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.520> long<00:01:11.700> as

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
to find keep the thing going as long as

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.310 
to find keep the thing going as long as
we<00:01:11.909> could<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.540> feel<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.049> some<00:01:13.290> ways

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
we could and I feel like in some ways

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.960 
we could and I feel like in some ways
that's<00:01:13.650> helped<00:01:13.950> me<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.700> other<00:01:14.850> ways

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that's helped me but but in other ways

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.039 
that's helped me but but in other ways
that's<00:01:15.210> hurt<00:01:15.330> me<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.689> feel<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:15.869> that's

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that's hurt me but I feel like that's

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.870 
that's hurt me but I feel like that's
that's<00:01:16.380> probably<00:01:16.619> my<00:01:16.740> biggest<00:01:16.890> drink<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.430> think

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that's probably my biggest drink I think

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.749 
that's probably my biggest drink I think
you<00:01:17.970> race<00:01:18.240> extremely<00:01:18.990> hard<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:20.640> know<00:01:20.729> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
you race extremely hard and you know I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.789 
you race extremely hard and you know I
think<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.720> drivers<00:01:22.080> will<00:01:22.320> say<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.619> they<00:01:22.740> do

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
think all drivers will say that they do

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
think all drivers will say that they do
that<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.970> watching<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.869> see

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
that but but in watching you you can see

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.840 
that but but in watching you you can see
that<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.340> attack<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that you really like to attack the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.520 
that you really like to attack the
racetrack<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.509> me<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.659> try<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.259> put<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.439> all

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
racetrack for me I try and put it all

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.010 
racetrack for me I try and put it all
out<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> table<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.479> sometimes<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.750> has

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
out on the table and sometimes that has

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.600 
out on the table and sometimes that has
some<00:01:31.200> penalties<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.340> me<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.490> know

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
some penalties to it but for me you know

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.760 
some penalties to it but for me you know
every<00:01:33.000> spot<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.750> gain<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.740> every

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
every spot that I can gain for every

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.950 
every spot that I can gain for every
every<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:35.850> bit<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.000> time<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.689> gain

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
every little bit of time that I can gain

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.249

I'm<00:02:33.000> gonna<00:02:33.209> be<00:02:33.330> critical<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:33.989> any<00:02:34.200> area<00:02:34.590> of

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
I'm gonna be critical in any area of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.809 
I'm gonna be critical in any area of
what<00:02:34.860> I've<00:02:35.010> seen<00:02:35.190> over<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.459> years<00:02:35.519> it's

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
what I've seen over the years it's

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.600 
what I've seen over the years it's
whenever<00:02:36.150> your<00:02:37.050> car<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.410> not<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.769> best<00:02:37.950> in

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
whenever your car is not the best in

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.430 
whenever your car is not the best in
trying<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.150> make<00:02:39.720> up<00:02:39.930> for<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.200> difference

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
trying to make up for that difference

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.350 
trying to make up for that difference
sometimes<00:02:41.099> instead<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.519> settling<00:02:41.910> for<00:02:42.180> that

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
sometimes instead of settling for that

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.690 
sometimes instead of settling for that
and<00:02:42.780> then<00:02:43.080> communicating<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.129> what<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.459> need

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
and then communicating to what you need

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.910 
and then communicating to what you need
and<00:02:44.970> making<00:02:45.330> changes<00:02:45.360> on<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.959> cars<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.440> that

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
and making changes on the cars and that

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.800 
and making changes on the cars and that
becomes<00:02:47.190> even<00:02:47.849> more<00:02:47.879> important<00:02:48.660> now<00:02:48.780> that

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
becomes even more important now that

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.869 
becomes even more important now that
you're<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.260> Sprint<00:02:49.739> Cup<00:02:50.010> driver<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.550> had<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.760> make

you're a Sprint Cup driver I had to make
a<00:02:50.940> comparison<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:52.190> someone<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.430> thought

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
a comparison of someone that I thought

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.780 
a comparison of someone that I thought
about<00:02:53.959> that<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.650> would<00:02:55.860> compare<00:02:56.129> your<00:02:56.310> talents

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
about that I would compare your talents

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.300 
about that I would compare your talents
to<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.480> came<00:02:57.690> up<00:02:57.720> with<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:58.080> driver<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:58.950> you
