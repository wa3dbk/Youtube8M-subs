00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.670
 Let's start with the first day in Kiel this day 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.239
 once can happen like that 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.329
 she is with this hot spots will be able to happen 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:17.519
 and I'm going to do the following Huml the test times that 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.269
 not only here 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.759
 Percentage of the cash registers changes when we mouse instead of over 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:24.990
 also the percent 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.999
 and the graphic itself changes 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.039
 Percent of the simplest case could have been there simply what we have 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.500
 a bit for this graphic 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.900
 when dimming and the fortune from Thundorf to that one of the fate 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.880
 understand he flew this is not easy to close 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.990
 we have 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.290
 a above here our mark in the middle already set the 4 Halver and the 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.450
 I'm doing this now for the hot spots also actively have the 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.800
 just like that 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.270
 and I'll just say Alpha 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.500
 equal 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.970
 nationwide want about four times that so sometimes so pale 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.380
 visible is not too much with the forehead 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.290
 After convinced with Copy Cats NEEDS in the DAX next it is a Hot 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.330
 Spot club groups 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.039
 and 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:08.910
 that look what it was short 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.650
 as the us-notes looked just a bit faded off 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.900
 that is pretty and very okay yet with a little bit of zeal 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.530
 unobtrusive Sulzer strategy pressed apple button then zooms what the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.550
 of course like 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.350
 and now percent I want that percent 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.470
 that all on the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.460
 around 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.520
 Mouse reacts, that means we need value 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.950
 If there are a lot of events, you can find us here 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.640
 sometimes lead 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.320
 Since this graphic must I just searched and the cheeks Ammon 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.910
 Department County looks very nice as that works well 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.770
 Just by giving as examples percent and action and then you're done 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.740
 back to nature around certain things on a particular corner to posts from you that you 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.920
 this left of pop this 9th 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.990
 Point system on the whole positioning 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.500
 by Kai Pachan notes what her animal with the pleased that you just Ding 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.770
 Defining corners can hang up gaps 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.600
 the quarter between later for the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.479
 Carter still be meaningful because we just go around there 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.039
 Although you do not want to pull Floater's window open then that's not the whole story 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.799
 In the right places you can see it here very nice 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.839
 for the way here 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.259
 The window move so much that he always played the tour in and out of the window 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.059
 Middle is 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.760
 and the place always in the upper right corner and the bathroom always exactly in the center 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.100
 that it is exactly this mechanics behind it 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.619
 here behind these 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.589
 the whole system that it is relatively percent 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:38.230
 Relatively pleasant that it is very easy to configure very easy 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:43.469
 so if Max Mayer Heyer examine and narrow simply the 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.369
 appropriate events I get out of the reminder courtyard on tih 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.939
 Prof Tih Hotz Ports and these hotspots for staying with him 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:58.129
 Sports boat trip already a tradition Bono was not to be confused with Ron Howard 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.079
 Urban is when the mouse 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.419
 that the hotspot PCs is the graphics in the moto2 carry Handke drüberfährt 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.409
 this is absolute nonsense the mouse team 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.540
 then as long as the mouse is tourist Ron Howard i think it's gonna be out in the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.330
 Mouse leaves this team again 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.180
 «There are per member due under press with the mouse and therefore 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.159
 is wants and Kate is a principle up and down a complete click 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.280
 you can still differentiate between out the down what the mouse button 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.649
 Goes down and Bonn when the mouse button Ramos goes 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.769
 that means these are percent Eon Lothar Seipp if the graphics are loaded 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.249
 or not that does not matter now but these are the mouse Iverson Oberhofer out 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.989
 Click Dornap this 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.700
 bad parameters are important for us that, as it were, the fans the 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.529
 Present thinking depends on what must be achieved by this thing 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:46.529
 may require 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:50.819
 and often the ones that trigger the simple changes or functions 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.479
 can the MS do this 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.769
 I go up here Upper-East and say just change 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.339
 and power 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.189
 and I say that now three strikers quite simply 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.449
 Percent and here we just start changing things is Dagmar 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.489
 simply SZ 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.559
 and then I say alpha 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.859
 and then you can specify topics drives here 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.319
 but there are still quotes at the front we are not 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.269
 and now I say Smash Lunow what that four took 1 point means 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.839
 if I mouse over it then it will be here with it 

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:28.279
 Semicolon completed because the food function 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:32.749
 and that just usually means it's just just sorrow 4s than 40% 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.969
 Transparency because I drive over it with the mouse like the transparency 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.249
 fully turned on 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.520
 and then the counterpart to that marble too is equal to it 

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:42.509
 function 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:43.759
 or make removal without 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.539
 then you pull it better 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:46.939
 around 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.059
 Brilon 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:52.240
 and now I'll go over here it is now set at which it is 

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:53.669
 there is not yet 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.210
 now it gets full 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.199
 visible 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.740
 the transparent ponds that is due to the PNG that is not due to the function but you 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.340
 The hand is completely opaque, of course, does not work 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.409
 back again for that it will be empty in the near future 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.189
 front AUD 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:10.650
 right back 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.050
 SZ 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.110
 Halver 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.110
 and thanks always Zappa finds again and again have always thought 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:21.349
 Samir Colon quotes that's easy 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.599
 and 2 that's how it works out Seif 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.099
 new store 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.520
 Ascom at Ochsenzoll will 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.880
 Twice what now but practically such a roller blind at Fekter makes this one 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.229
 Case a bit more important 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.009
 if the whole history of the WTO about Klinsmanns you can see all this here 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.550
 just copy 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.189
 and for the next 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:41.309
 Hot spot just we install 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:45.020
 and I bet that we'll have the third hot spot in the league with us 

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:47.860
 we'll catch it before we catch it 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.529
 these these these knots mean that one is in distress too 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:55.529
 Just miss this node of this virtual tour, they jump SMI like that 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:56.580
 Court this 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.050
 that's what it's made of drinking out 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.050
 and here I just say I have my values 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:07.339
 There is live play here again 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:09.229
 headaches 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:10.229
 Faisst 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.400
 that's it 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.699
 firmly stood Pina house 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.699
 and then I go to the rating to watch CNOOC 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:21.569
 the values ​​at Mattel 266 0 1 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.990
 What many kovats have is not great 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.830
 under normal here two common 0 1 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.750
 that does not have to be more than two decimal places, but Saul degrees 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.119
 Degrees even without decimal places 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:44.300
 is already too inaccurate especially in the panoramas have higher resolution 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.610
 as this very weak attempt we have here now 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.360
 but as I said, that's just one 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.879
 Working models here 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.879
 so to 11 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.909
 and what should be wrong about that and here it is 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:01.939
 Mitfahre that means we now have here practical and interactive 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:04.479
 Effects in the whole 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:07.169
 Thing 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:10.610
 so that's the first part the next part will deal with that 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.120
 For example, we also become even more dangerous tooltip 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.969
 dranhängen 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:15.379
 who simply tells us 

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:19.990
 What we expect to find that this is just a text box almost and Rollo 

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:22.710
 Often that was the next step 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.370
 provide these hotspots with the first interactive features
