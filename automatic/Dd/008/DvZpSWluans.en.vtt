as<00:02:37.580> well<00:02:37.730> like<00:02:38.209> flash<00:02:38.450> uses<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.959> super<00:02:39.170> speed

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
as well like flash uses of super speed

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.470 
as well like flash uses of super speed
almost<00:02:39.830> all<00:02:39.950> special<00:02:40.370> needs<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:41.120> really<00:02:41.330> like

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
almost all special needs it really like

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.660 
almost all special needs it really like
it<00:02:41.600> gives<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.440> DC<00:02:42.709> Comics<00:02:42.830> flavor<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.610> all

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
it gives the the DC Comics flavor to all

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
it gives the the DC Comics flavor to all
the<00:02:43.760> characters<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.150> think<00:02:44.300> they<00:02:44.390> all<00:02:44.510> feel

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
the characters I think they all feel

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.340 
the characters I think they all feel
pretty<00:02:45.170> authentic<00:02:46.930> one<00:02:47.930> other<00:02:48.080> one<00:02:48.170> things

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
pretty authentic one other one things

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
pretty authentic one other one things
are<00:02:48.440> really<00:02:48.530> excited<00:02:48.800> about<00:02:48.950> in<00:02:49.160> mortal

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
are really excited about in mortal

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.250 
are really excited about in mortal
kombat<00:02:49.580> vs<00:02:49.760> DC<00:02:49.790> universe<00:02:50.060> sangsu<00:02:50.900> communities

what<00:02:51.440> we're<00:02:51.560> calling<00:02:51.709> pro<00:02:52.340> moves<00:02:52.580> the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
what we're calling pro moves the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.520 
what we're calling pro moves the
basically<00:02:53.150> there<00:02:53.330> are<00:02:53.360> like<00:02:53.510> extensions<00:02:54.260> of

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
basically there are like extensions of

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.620 
basically there are like extensions of
the<00:02:54.890> normal<00:02:55.310> super<00:02:55.550> moves<00:02:55.760> for<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.420> pro

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
the normal super moves for the pro

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.240 
the normal super moves for the pro
player<00:02:56.900> basically<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.680> inputs<00:02:57.980> form<00:02:58.220> a

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
player basically the inputs form a

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.560 
player basically the inputs form a
little<00:02:58.400> bit<00:02:58.490> more<00:02:58.610> difficult<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.150> timings<00:02:59.510> a

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
little bit more difficult the timings a

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.060 
little bit more difficult the timings a
little<00:02:59.600> bit<00:02:59.840> tighter<00:03:00.050> and<00:03:00.380> not<00:03:00.830> in<00:03:00.920> all<00:03:01.040> cases

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
little bit tighter and not in all cases

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.430 
little bit tighter and not in all cases
some<00:03:01.610> cases<00:03:01.910> like<00:03:02.060> Sonia<00:03:02.420> has<00:03:02.600> her<00:03:03.019> classic

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
some cases like Sonia has her classic

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.350 
some cases like Sonia has her classic
ring<00:03:03.620> shot<00:03:03.890> from<00:03:04.220> all<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.580> past<00:03:04.760> more<00:03:04.910> combats

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
ring shot from all the past more combats

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.699 
ring shot from all the past more combats
and<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:05.720> can<00:03:05.840> actually<00:03:05.959> do<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.410> one<00:03:06.530> twice

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
and you can actually do that one twice

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.860 
and you can actually do that one twice
in<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.040> row<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.220> shoot<00:03:07.580> two<00:03:07.700> fireballs<00:03:08.180> out<00:03:08.420> but

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
in a row to shoot two fireballs out but

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.120 
in a row to shoot two fireballs out but
it's<00:03:08.989> actually<00:03:09.050> probably<00:03:09.500> one<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.860> easier

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
it's actually probably one of the easier

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.190 
it's actually probably one of the easier
ones<00:03:10.160> we've<00:03:10.730> tried<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.390> skew<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:11.959> more

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
ones we've tried to skew the more

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.449 
ones we've tried to skew the more
difficult<00:03:12.380> ones<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.920> wanted<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.220> give<00:03:13.370> you

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
difficult ones to wanted to give you

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.640 
difficult ones to wanted to give you
more<00:03:13.580> reward<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.810> Sonia<00:03:15.320> ring<00:03:15.470> one

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
more reward so the Sonia ring one

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.810 
more reward so the Sonia ring one
doesn't<00:03:16.010> really<00:03:16.130> give<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.340> like<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.459> huge

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
doesn't really give you like a huge

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.100 
doesn't really give you like a huge
reward<00:03:17.239> whereas<00:03:17.600> like<00:03:17.720> some<00:03:17.870> of<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.019> other

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
reward whereas like some of the other

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.870 
reward whereas like some of the other
more<00:03:18.290> difficult<00:03:18.650> ones<00:03:18.739> do<00:03:18.980> sony<00:03:19.459> has<00:03:19.519> got<00:03:19.730> her

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
more difficult ones do sony has got her

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.430 
more difficult ones do sony has got her
normal<00:03:20.330> leg<00:03:20.480> grab<00:03:20.660> where<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:20.959> just<00:03:21.080> grabs<00:03:21.290> a

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
normal leg grab where it just grabs a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.690 
normal leg grab where it just grabs a
guy<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.739> then<00:03:21.830> hits<00:03:22.070> him<00:03:22.160> on<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.280> ground<00:03:22.430> it

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
guy and then hits him on the ground it

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.310 
guy and then hits him on the ground it
does<00:03:22.880> good<00:03:23.300> amount<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.570> life<00:03:23.720> if<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:24.140> player

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
does good amount of life if a player

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.630 
does good amount of life if a player
containment<00:03:24.800> so<00:03:24.890> he<00:03:24.980> hits<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.280> right<00:03:25.370> button

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
containment so he hits the right button

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.100 
containment so he hits the right button
combination<00:03:26.090> when<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.630> other<00:03:26.750> guy<00:03:26.870> hits<00:03:27.050> the

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
combination when the other guy hits the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.360 
combination when the other guy hits the
ground<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.470> can<00:03:27.500> actually<00:03:27.800> get<00:03:27.860> a<00:03:27.920> pop<00:03:28.100> up<00:03:28.130> the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
ground you can actually get a pop up the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.220 
ground you can actually get a pop up the
action<00:03:28.640> from<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.090> allows<00:03:29.480> you<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.750> get<00:03:30.200> a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
action from it that allows you to get a

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.929 
action from it that allows you to get a
combo<00:03:30.560> strength<00:03:30.800> from<00:03:30.920> them

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:32.939 
combo strength from them

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.309 
combo strength from them
it's<00:03:33.939> not<00:03:34.060> all<00:03:34.269> just<00:03:34.299> things<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.200> know

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
it's not all just things that you know

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.140 
it's not all just things that you know
add<00:03:35.560> extra<00:03:35.859> damage<00:03:36.069> some<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.849> stuff<00:03:37.000> also

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
add extra damage some of the stuff also

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.420 
add extra damage some of the stuff also
is<00:03:37.540> like<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.109> can<00:03:38.230> throw<00:03:38.379> a<00:03:38.409> missile<00:03:39.159> with<00:03:39.250> Lex

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
is like you can throw a missile with Lex

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.890 
is like you can throw a missile with Lex
Luthor<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:40.060> can<00:03:40.180> chain<00:03:40.359> that<00:03:40.480> directly

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
Luthor and you can chain that directly

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.990 
Luthor and you can chain that directly
through<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.230> produce<00:03:41.560> system<00:03:41.980> into<00:03:42.609> like<00:03:42.879> his

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
through the produce system into like his

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.520 
through the produce system into like his
escape<00:03:43.359> his<00:03:43.599> boot<00:03:43.780> escape<00:03:44.109> things<00:03:44.349> so

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
escape his boot escape things so

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.479 
escape his boot escape things so
basically<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:44.890> essentially<00:03:45.189> gives<00:03:45.219> you<00:03:45.430> a

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
basically it essentially gives you a

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.649 
basically it essentially gives you a
free<00:03:45.670> fireball<00:03:46.030> if<00:03:46.150> people<00:03:46.329> can't<00:03:46.480> retaliate

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
free fireball if people can't retaliate

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.030 
free fireball if people can't retaliate
against<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:47.349> we<00:03:47.469> really<00:03:47.590> want<00:03:47.769> try<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:47.950> be

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
against so we really want try to be

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.289 
against so we really want try to be
creative<00:03:48.189> with<00:03:48.489> those<00:03:48.579> things<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.090> some<00:03:49.269> of

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
creative with those things and some of

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.479 
creative with those things and some of
them<00:03:49.480> will<00:03:50.170> them<00:03:50.260> just<00:03:50.469> add<00:03:50.680> simple<00:03:50.980> more

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
them will them just add simple more

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:52.800 
them will them just add simple more
damage<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.939> move<00:03:52.060> like<00:03:52.269> zoom<00:03:52.420> that's<00:03:52.599> got<00:03:52.719> is

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
damage to move like zoom that's got is

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.539 
damage to move like zoom that's got is
he<00:03:52.900> taking<00:03:53.079> me<00:03:53.290> but<00:03:53.739> if<00:03:54.189> when<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.370> heat

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
he taking me but if when the heat

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:55.770 
he taking me but if when the heat
couldn't<00:03:54.790> connects<00:03:55.030> you<00:03:55.420> sit<00:03:55.599> there<00:03:55.689> and

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
couldn't connects you sit there and
