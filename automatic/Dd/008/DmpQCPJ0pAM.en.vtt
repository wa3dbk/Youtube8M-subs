a try the next spot we got for you is in

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.240 
a try the next spot we got for you is in
a<00:00:57.300> bush<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.260> pretty<00:00:58.440> good<00:00:58.680> bush<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
a bush it's a pretty good bush this is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.069 
a bush it's a pretty good bush this is
like<00:00:59.430> sort<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.820> tucked<00:01:00.059> away<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> corner

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
like sort of tucked away in the corner

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.410 
like sort of tucked away in the corner
here<00:01:01.410> as<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.910> sort<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.239> lie

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
here as you can see if you sort of lie

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.429 
here as you can see if you sort of lie
down<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.780> can't<00:01:03.960> really<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.199> face-first

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
down you can't really go face-first

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.840 
down you can't really go face-first
you're<00:01:04.799> gonna<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> turn<00:01:05.220> around<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
you're gonna have to turn around and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.179 
you're gonna have to turn around and
sort<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.119> sort<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.390> reverse<00:01:06.900> your<00:01:07.200> way<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.590> but

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
sort of sort of reverse your way in but

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.740 
sort of sort of reverse your way in but
it<00:01:08.520> works<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> decent<00:01:09.210> spot<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.720> you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
it works as a decent spot because you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.260 
it works as a decent spot because you
got<00:01:10.290> pretty<00:01:10.500> much<00:01:10.680> nearly<00:01:11.400> entirely<00:01:11.790> covered

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
got pretty much nearly entirely covered

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.910 
got pretty much nearly entirely covered
by<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> leaves<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.380> works<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> really

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
by the leaves and it works as a really

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.310 
by the leaves and it works as a really
good<00:01:14.159> hiding<00:01:14.400> spot<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.700> infected<00:01:15.450> could<00:01:16.140> also

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
good hiding spot for infected could also

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.499 
good hiding spot for infected could also
work<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> sort<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.189> vantage<00:01:17.790> point<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.270> guess

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
work is a sort of vantage point I guess

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.120 
work is a sort of vantage point I guess
or<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> bad<00:01:19.200> spot<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.830> like<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
or not a bad spot but like a like a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.219 
or not a bad spot but like a like a
camping<00:01:20.549> spot<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.850> guess<00:01:21.119> for<00:01:21.930> Search<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
camping spot I guess for Search and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.929 
camping spot I guess for Search and
Destroy<00:01:22.259> maybe<00:01:22.830> cuz<00:01:23.400> you're<00:01:23.549> pretty<00:01:23.759> hidden

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
Destroy maybe cuz you're pretty hidden

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.850 
Destroy maybe cuz you're pretty hidden
and<00:01:24.240> people<00:01:24.600> are<00:01:24.689> jumping<00:01:24.869> around<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.619> they

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
and people are jumping around so they

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.230 
and people are jumping around so they
wouldn't<00:01:26.100> really<00:01:26.159> look<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.520> these<00:01:26.610> areas<00:01:27.000> it's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
wouldn't really look in these areas it's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.819 
wouldn't really look in these areas it's
a<00:01:27.330> lot<00:01:27.479> harder<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.380> because<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.710> got

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
a lot harder to see you because you got

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.370 
a lot harder to see you because you got
all<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.460> sort<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.729> brush<00:01:30.119> around<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.259> as

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
all this sort of brush around you so as

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
the next spot is right next to the spot

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.460 
the next spot is right next to the spot
I<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.270> showed<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.079> go<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.320> the

I just showed you if you go up the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.620 
I just showed you if you go up the
stairs<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.280> turn<00:01:38.939> right<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.509> can

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
stairs there and turn right then you can

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.390 
stairs there and turn right then you can
sort<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> bunch<00:01:41.250> of

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
sort of see this or that have a bunch of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.670 
sort of see this or that have a bunch of
like<00:01:41.520> leaves<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.479> grass<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.200> floor<00:01:43.470> there

like leaves and grass on the floor there

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.740 
like leaves and grass on the floor there
now<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> good<00:01:44.850> spot<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.149> well<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.659> not

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
now this is a good spot as well it's not

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.749 
now this is a good spot as well it's not
as<00:01:46.049> covered<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> other<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.159> but<00:01:47.369> is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
as covered as the other one but is

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.149 
as covered as the other one but is
somewhat<00:01:48.360> covered<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:49.619> also<00:01:49.740> sort<00:01:50.070> of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
somewhat covered and it's also sort of

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.889 
somewhat covered and it's also sort of
it's<00:01:50.520> tucked<00:01:50.880> away<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.329> sort<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.540> around

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
it's tucked away it's sort of around

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.600 
it's tucked away it's sort of around
this<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.320> soft<00:01:52.530> corner<00:01:52.829> there<00:01:53.009> anomaly<00:01:53.430> group

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
this the soft corner there anomaly group

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.399 
this the soft corner there anomaly group
will<00:01:53.700> go<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.030> area<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.110> said<00:01:55.290> before

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
will go in that area like I said before

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.899 
will go in that area like I said before
people<00:01:55.920> are<00:01:55.979> jumping<00:01:56.130> around<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.759> probably

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
people are jumping around it's probably

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.700 
people are jumping around it's probably
a<00:01:57.090> lot<00:01:57.210> harder<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.570> see<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.960> since<00:01:58.380> everyone's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
a lot harder to see you since everyone's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.469 
a lot harder to see you since everyone's
moving<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.070> fast<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.610> as<00:02:00.210> long<00:02:00.329> as<00:02:00.420> you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
moving really fast and as long as you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.730 
moving really fast and as long as you
stay<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> corner<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.290> like<00:02:01.500> down

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
stay in the corner and you like down

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.859 
stay in the corner and you like down
used<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.310> move<00:02:02.549> then<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.299> spot<00:02:03.479> could<00:02:03.659> work

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
used to move then this spot could work

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.459 
used to move then this spot could work
out<00:02:04.079> for<00:02:04.110> an<00:02:04.320> entire<00:02:04.409> vector<00:02:05.040> game<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
out for an entire vector game and so the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.499 
out for an entire vector game and so the
next<00:02:07.649> spot<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.039> more<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.550> camping<00:02:09.000> spot<00:02:09.149> than

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
next spot is more of a camping spot than

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.960 
next spot is more of a camping spot than
a

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
a

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.000 
a
than<00:02:10.180> a<00:02:10.270> hiding<00:02:10.840> spot<00:02:10.869> for<00:02:11.500> effective<00:02:11.920> because

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
than a hiding spot for effective because

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.100 
than a hiding spot for effective because
it's<00:02:12.220> quite<00:02:12.430> open<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:13.360> can<00:02:13.510> sort<00:02:13.750> of<00:02:13.810> jump

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
it's quite open you can sort of jump

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.500 
it's quite open you can sort of jump
onto<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:14.650> sort<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:14.950> lamp<00:02:15.250> thing<00:02:15.550> here<00:02:15.880> it's<00:02:16.450> a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
onto this sort of lamp thing here it's a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.700 
onto this sort of lamp thing here it's a
jump<00:02:16.750> Crouch<00:02:16.990> so<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.320> have<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.560> basically

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
jump Crouch so you have to basically

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.230 
jump Crouch so you have to basically
like<00:02:17.980> jump<00:02:18.310> up<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.610> then<00:02:18.670> press<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.060> Crouch

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
wire in the air to get up on it it's

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.440 
wire in the air to get up on it it's

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.800 
and it's sort of a weird spot it's like
really<00:02:54.340> awkward<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:54.970> these<00:02:55.060> buildings<00:02:55.540> not

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
really awkward and these buildings not

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.750 
really awkward and these buildings not
many<00:02:55.960> people<00:02:56.080> look<00:02:56.350> in<00:02:56.590> them<00:02:56.830> or<00:02:57.220> they<00:02:57.460> look<00:02:57.640> in

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
many people look in them or they look in

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.980 
many people look in them or they look in
them<00:02:57.940> but<00:02:58.030> they<00:02:58.120> won't<00:02:58.210> look<00:02:58.420> pacifically

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
them but they won't look pacifically

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.810 
them but they won't look pacifically
around<00:02:59.410> them<00:02:59.590> because<00:02:59.680> they're<00:03:00.160> not<00:03:00.280> exactly

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
around them because they're not exactly

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.190 
around them because they're not exactly
where<00:03:01.180> people<00:03:01.420> expect<00:03:01.600> people<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.960> hide

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
where people expect people to hide

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.540 
where people expect people to hide
because<00:03:02.440> it's<00:03:02.740> not<00:03:02.920> actually<00:03:03.070> that<00:03:03.280> good

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
because it's not actually that good

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.460 
because it's not actually that good
hiding<00:03:03.850> spot<00:03:04.030> there<00:03:04.240> but<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:05.050> little<00:03:05.290> spot

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
hiding spot there but this little spot

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.890 
hiding spot there but this little spot
here<00:03:05.700> it's<00:03:06.700> very<00:03:06.910> different<00:03:07.090> you<00:03:07.690> can<00:03:07.780> also

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
here it's very different you can also

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.480 
here it's very different you can also
get<00:03:08.050> on<00:03:08.200> top<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.770> sort<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.130> just<00:03:09.310> hang

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
get on top of it and sort of just hang

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.760 
get on top of it and sort of just hang
around<00:03:09.520> that<00:03:09.970> area<00:03:10.270> on<00:03:10.390> top<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.810> use<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.650> as<00:03:11.740> a

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
around that area on top and use it as a

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.880 
around that area on top and use it as a
vantage<00:03:12.130> point<00:03:12.340> or<00:03:12.520> a<00:03:12.550> hiding<00:03:12.910> spot<00:03:13.770> so<00:03:14.770> this

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
vantage point or a hiding spot so this

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.380 
vantage point or a hiding spot so this
next<00:03:15.100> spot<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.430> right<00:03:15.760> next<00:03:15.910> that's<00:03:16.239> why<00:03:16.360> I

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
next spot is right next that's why I

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.270 
next spot is right next that's why I
just<00:03:16.600> showed<00:03:16.780> you<00:03:16.810> it's<00:03:17.530> not<00:03:17.709> really<00:03:18.250> that

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
just showed you it's not really that

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.680 
just showed you it's not really that
good<00:03:18.459> of<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.640> hiding<00:03:18.910> spot<00:03:18.940> but<00:03:19.300> it's<00:03:19.420> sort<00:03:19.600> of

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
good of a hiding spot but it's sort of

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.660 
good of a hiding spot but it's sort of
it<00:03:19.840> tucked<00:03:20.140> away<00:03:20.320> in<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.530> corner<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:21.430> can<00:03:21.550> still

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
it tucked away in a corner you can still

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.610 
it tucked away in a corner you can still
just<00:03:21.820> lie<00:03:22.000> down<00:03:22.030> here<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:22.989> just<00:03:23.200> sit<00:03:23.410> there

just lie down here and just sit there

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.410 
just lie down here and just sit there

spot to use at the start of an infected
game<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.880> could<00:03:28.030> use<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.330> as<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.450> sort<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:28.810> bit

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
game you could use it as a sort of bit

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.070 
game you could use it as a sort of bit
sort<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.590> an<00:03:29.709> area<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.130> hold<00:03:30.750> against<00:03:31.750> the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
could try and if you do then that's

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.010
