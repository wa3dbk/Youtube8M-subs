but you know who carries it didn't more
six<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:57.229> mean<00:03:58.159> there's<00:03:58.340> not<00:03:58.609> that<00:03:58.669> many<00:03:59.209> exotics

six I mean there's not that many exotics
in<00:04:00.079> the<00:04:00.169> game<00:04:00.349> so<00:04:00.620> more<00:04:00.799> than<00:04:00.859> likely<00:04:00.979> he'll

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:01.699 
in the game so more than likely he'll

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.899
