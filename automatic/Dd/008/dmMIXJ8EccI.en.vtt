00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
plastic squares here what those are for

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.430 
plastic squares here what those are for
you<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.579> unscrew<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.420> little<00:02:09.959> block<00:02:10.410> of

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
you can unscrew that little block of

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.319 
you can unscrew that little block of
plastic<00:02:10.799> that<00:02:11.160> holds<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.549> the<00:02:11.640> stiff<00:02:11.850> gear<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
plastic that holds in the stiff gear and

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.479 
plastic that holds in the stiff gear and
bolt<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.170> retracts<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.010> course<00:02:14.250> we'll

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
bolt in the retracts and of course we'll

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.949 
bolt in the retracts and of course we'll
probably<00:02:14.640> be<00:02:14.820> doing<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.150> because<00:02:15.329> who

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
probably be doing that because who

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.930 
probably be doing that because who
doesn't<00:02:16.140> want<00:02:16.260> retracts<00:02:16.709> right<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.850> have

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
doesn't want retracts right you have

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.670 
doesn't want retracts right you have

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
course you know this and what are these

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.319 
course you know this and what are these
guys<00:02:23.070> here<00:02:25.669> I'm<00:02:26.669> trying<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.970> figure<00:02:27.120> out

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
guys here I'm trying to figure out

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.729 
guys here I'm trying to figure out
what's<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.690> on<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.260> might<00:02:28.440> be<00:02:28.590> all

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
what's going on here I might be all

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.220 
what's going on here I might be all
confused<00:02:29.549> yeah<00:02:30.329> I'll<00:02:30.600> have<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.750> look<00:02:30.930> farther

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
confused yeah I'll have to look farther

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.790 
confused yeah I'll have to look farther
into<00:02:31.560> that

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
into that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.560 
into that
see<00:02:32.040> extra<00:02:32.370> extra<00:02:32.850> leads<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.180> don't<00:02:33.330> think<00:02:33.510> it

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
see extra extra leads I don't think it

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.000 
see extra extra leads I don't think it
came<00:02:33.720> with<00:02:33.900> three<00:02:33.990> tracks<00:02:34.350> but<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:34.770> almost

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
came with three tracks but it's almost

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.220 
came with three tracks but it's almost
looking<00:02:35.250> like<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.700> okay<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:36.750> that's<00:02:37.050> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
looking like it is okay so that's the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.120 
looking like it is okay so that's the
wing<00:02:37.410> anyways<00:02:37.950> onto<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.760> fuselage<00:02:39.830> more<00:02:40.830> tape

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
wing anyways onto the fuselage more tape

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.440 
wing anyways onto the fuselage more tape
to<00:02:41.730> protect<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:45.590> here<00:02:46.590> should<00:02:46.830> be<00:02:47.180> scale<00:02:48.180> nose

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
to protect it here should be scale nose

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.830 
to protect it here should be scale nose
kono<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.080> great<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.440> see<00:02:50.060> scale<00:02:51.060> exhaust<00:02:51.450> vents
