00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.440
 so that the t's is actually an ideal 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.010
 speed course for brain it and is 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.509
 tennis players 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:30.029
 I and 8 times 8 lessons they have one 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:32.369
 broad basis of first contact with the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.110
 stepped technically because 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.450
 linelle rages with your girlfriends and the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.390
 asked and therefore you see 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.350
 purely out of interest because of the nice atmosphere 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.910
 is here also the whole club can stand and 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.890
 thought a cool idea of once 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.050
 beyond how to do something it is not 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:57.420
 same hair fitness or so I do something 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:01:00.000
 different and the tank dress becomes 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.470
 as with the children built up but we 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.720
 just had much quicker about all 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.280
 steps we also start with a red ball 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.710
 we then switch to one very quickly 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.060
 orange ball so that there is a lot of alysane 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.060
 didn't want one 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.000
 because I no longer football I 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.480
 had an ideal sport to do something else 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.740
 to do 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.080
 and that there can be a time together and 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.760
 technically in the holidays or for 4 in the 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.820
 club 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.410
 this pacini for naturally between me 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.420
 it can be made completely wrong with boys 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.600
 how the arrival they have on the very 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.600
 more 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.000
 that the nightly shows how double 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.770
 evening organized the intention is that 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.520
 played dice all evening 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.409
 to become 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.149
 want to combine that with a barbecue and 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.829
 especially try the very nice evening of 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.829
 to make it quite a bit the virus 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.580
 it is nice though and had a drink 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.880
 there indeed for people to learn 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.460
 know it 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.860
 that now learned job at this club 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.570
 he does know can still tone and everyone 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.670
 is talking and learning everyone 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.920
 know each other a little better 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.660
 you drink an objective color and then 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.310
 you play what's eyes are whole 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.310
 relaxing and pleasant 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.170
 actually I think it is pleasant to and 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.880
 competition without the pressure 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.170
 completely on my shoulder, then honor 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.730
 there is also a few to the wim 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.830
 little measure hit in beams wheels 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.050
 So one evening I was doubly nice 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.580
 introduction to some competition 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.320
 lex becomes a technical technical aspect 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.180
 combi so much offer we just let them 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.310
 playing a lot is especially important 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.690
 that they come to game situations that there 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.830
 very many release one 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.400
 and especially that the players very much 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.400
 have fun
