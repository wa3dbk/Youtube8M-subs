00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.980
 talk now about a topic that already 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.840
 mentioned the resultant let's learn 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.580

 sounds clinics peel or imagined that 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.690
 it must be a process by which you 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.310
 they remove some layers of skin while it is 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.920
 true the skin is obviously going

 Longest body's biggest is me

 a parrot paracetamol function that more 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.739
 surprising is that the flat said no 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:50.149
 I knew nothing about the subject 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.219
 Of course it's the treatment you 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.850

 according to the ph that each person has 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.760
 because 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.250
 was just to make this note about the 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.610
 ping what is the true peeling which 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.610
 it is the meaning 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.320
 so let's see this treatment 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.990
 guardian parking that comes to be a 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.759
 peeling to see let's talk now about 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.880
 a chemical peel the chemical peel 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.659
 they come to be a medical treatment 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.299
 dermatological that makes it a 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.819
 specialist in which applies a 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.219
 product a chemical on the 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:43.149
 skin this chemical can be 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.979
 from various origins or also from several 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.259
 chemical types and also different 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.869
 concentrations then what we 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.600
 let's look is to make a 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.420
 skin rejuvenation is to improve 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.700
 some scars of acne is to improve the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.829
 Acne oily skin depends on what the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.429
 Patient is asking us for the peeling 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.619
 as such 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.989
 that exfoliation to understand us a 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.149
 little better is a peeling of the skin but 

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:11.480
 from a medical point of view and with a 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.459
 objective determined and obviously in 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.500
 safe hands because if you do it in 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.150
 places or with people who are not 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.430
 trained so any one can have 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.620
 problems and then we will be a little 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.780
 scared with the result that remains is 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.370
 advisable what circumstances can 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.650
 be advisable to be subtle 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.240
 and chemical here we like 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.220
 specialists we do 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.960
 for example an acne peel that 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.930
 is the green pine or green peeling for the 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.970
 acne this type of procedure 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.190
 dermatological he actually did 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.290
 from 12 to 14 years old when the patient 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.210
 you need it when the patient has 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.000
 injuries second degree injuries 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.340
 what are the grains the granites 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.900
 shots when it comes out if it can be done 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.270
 many patients ask us doctor 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.040
 but I have acne lesions with 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.260
 granites I can do peeling if it 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.880
 can do quietly is more this 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.460
 green pine will help you that 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.470
 Suddenly'll have about 25 or 30 years I 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.750
 I can make a skinfill software where 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.850
 let's get an improvement of the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.550
 skin and so in that way for example the 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.800
 17 year old boy who has scars from 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.360
 Acne can be done for it a little 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.340
 laser or you can also do the 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.290
 chemical peeling treatment called 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.150
 improv scarpin which is a procedure 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.130
 that will help us improve the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.680
 scars what are the risks that 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.990
 was to make a peel on 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.820
 any dermatological treatment 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.410
 laser chemical peeling any 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.570
 aesthetic dermatological treatment is 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.240
 take care of the sun use sunscreen 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.050
 every two hours using a chubby so 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.930
 it's a place where 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.090
 very much sun and good to wash then 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.010
 like some special soaps increase 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.060
 quite the skin and see then that of 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.760
 according to what the doctor tells you 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.980
 how many days your skin will be peeling 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.900
 to a greater or lesser degree depending on what 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.210
 is what they have done to you for how long 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.970
 delay the treatment or only when 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.980
 the skin on the face of the person that 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.480
 will depend a lot on the type of 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.180
 peeling you used was used a 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.000
 Gentle peeling can be three days four 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.190
 days exfoliating peeling skin does not 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.200
 let's forget that first there is a peeling of 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.940
 the skin where we 're going to see our 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.340
 skin that dries and that we have to 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.170
 to understand it the skin becomes dry but then 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.269
 of that we're going to see the results of 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.190
 agreement as our doctor tells us if 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.320
 I'm going to do a chemical peel a 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.600
 little deeper then necessarily 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.180
 I'm going to be 7 to 10 days with a very 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.620
 strong exfoliation then also here 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.560
 you have to see what is the lifestyle 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.030
 patient if I see a patient you 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.950
 I explain you know I want to make you a 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.680
 Strong peeling because you need it or 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.240
 why because you're asking me for 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.370
 a certain problem for example of 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.320
 wrinkles and you are and you charge in the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.780
 bank or in any case you're 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.940
 of what customer service is not you 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.030
 you are going to be able to do then you have to have 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.530
 quite careful then of what kind of 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.150
 peeling I'm going to perform then 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.590
 doctor to finish we can say 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.170
 that you have to know so that once the 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.820
 peeling where to do it and what are the 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.950
 care for when your skin is 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.410
 really rejuvenate and achieve that 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.570
 target that is looking for it that is what 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.430
 first thing we have to do is always 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.650
 know what I want to do a peeling for 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.480
 many times in the food in the forum or in 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.860
 the forum on facebook asks us 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.630
 doctor I want to do a chemical peel 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.430
 but they do not really tell me why 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.740
 things are required to be done when 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.140
 they come here I evaluated them there are times 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.670
 it happens that the patient has acne has 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.770
 acne scars and apart has 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.000
 spots on the face then the 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.470
 patient what he has to do is 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.680
 first define what is my priority 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.420
 I am currently in scars or spots 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.610
 I tell them and I always recommend them 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.130
 first we treat the cause of the effect 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.820
 first the acne then the scars and 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.820
 then the spots 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.210
 the most important thing that when they go to 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:47.309
 perform a peel first know what 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.770
 is what they need to do and do it with 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:50.999
 a professional that obviously is not 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.709
 anyone anyone without 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:54.869
 ask a little if he has done 

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:56.909
 of these same treatments if it is that 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:59.099
 He has experience because in many cases 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.659
 we have seen that there are people who have 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.300
 finished being this fault have put 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.800
 in danger his face is true there 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.879
 people who do that kind of 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.349
 treatments indiscriminately 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.119
 saying that they are professionals without 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.039
 However they do anything to have 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.599
 very careful in who does it but it is 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.399
 a treatment that helps a lot 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:17.309
 feel better yourself with your own 

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:18.959
 old with their appearance as is for 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:21.180
 improve your pileup 

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:23.520
 in the green feeling for acne that 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.680
 they can do it from 12 to 14 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.990
 years when the soft pimples start 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.719
 skinfill and to improve the skin of 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:35.699
 scars and the best double treatment 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:38.350
 or edu who says he was made too 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:41.020
 this redness of the skin 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.310
 it's true there are people who have been told 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.540
 peeling treatment in the study in 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.470
 our type of production and the truth 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.970
 is that the result is quite 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.200
 interesting and I remember about everything 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.750
 next the other mentioned in the 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.480
 interview in the note that you have to 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.160
 take care of the sun to more importance 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.900
 important and sixth all we're going to 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.700
 go a commercial break error and then 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.850
 we come back with much more here in that such 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.850
 morning
