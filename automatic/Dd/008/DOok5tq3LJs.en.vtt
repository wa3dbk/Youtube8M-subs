00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.029
 if you end up being a fairly simple one 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.340
 evening you said well 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.340
 we are well ahead and 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.630
 then a red card not what is really there 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.250
 used to be 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.440
 then you may clear the 208 and house 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.260
 closing very easy everywhere 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.920
 evenings you can do that from the moment that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.300
 they film the red card yes because then it is 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.470
 as almost always never one again 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.550
 real match 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.320
 I usually go home like them 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.240
 can marry spectator you see 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.410
 a team that then falls back en masse and 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.510
 the others against a wall to walk 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.920
 to play football and that team that one 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.340
 on a cold wall you want it 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.750
 play 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.790
 yes so often not fun to watch 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.770
 and I think it was today too 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.840
 from that moment on , just didn't start anymore 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.910
 very strong creation from the beginning 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.750
 to chances he scores at can do doe 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.239
 you don't and yes and then it goes quickly 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.520
 compare a score and red cards 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.670
 some actually done 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.260
 yes then you come to play against 10 men 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.820
 the ball out the sixteen 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 and you thought well that's a ball 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.559
 my year was nice wall was good 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.090
 for my side and I already had such 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.619
 the goalkeeper suspected that way 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.650
 wissink chasing after 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.240
 purely that side and put a beautiful it is 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.710
 the red architect plays in-house 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.180
 it is then actually easier to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.860
 play against eleven men than against 10 men 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.540
 because if you play against someone yes they do 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.240
 all of them actually for the 16 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.680
 Taken after I got the red one already 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.720
 bit d in the beginning then easier 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.020
 is mega I win I after two songs 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.840
 then played so maybe all my 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.009
 and give it a try but it was now 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.329
 from completely finished and I thought we were there 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.490
 started the competition well 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.960
 I thought we were playing at a high pace 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.159
 feel you press on hold i believe that 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.570
 we already had three in 10 minutes 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.110
 may she had had 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.060
 score a great goal but soon with 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.220
 his right leg perfectly on the head 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.780
 lisa gives me at that moment 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.250
 played well from that free 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.090
 stairs where the young red got for 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.439
 the two zero 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.520
 yes then the match was played 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.219
 Experience just talked about it 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.920
 it started with you yes indeed we have 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.780
 I have an appointment with as a group 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.520
 I talk quite a lot with that 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.570
 each do what those balls like 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.000
 want to have 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.170
 coaches incredibly fast that normal 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.370
 say i need that of ordinary space 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.860
 and give way-ie 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.180
 and the that was because they also terms of 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.739
 may lay even though I walk him eat 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.080
 behind or a half play wagon i am 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.030
 anyway and go and happen to be early 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.849
 world on those same two moments and now 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.769
 so again and luckily I understand 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.830
 could be better so god is only my second 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.830
 contest
