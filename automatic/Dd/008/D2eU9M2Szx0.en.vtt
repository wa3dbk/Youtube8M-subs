pretty busy week last week and for a

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.199 
pretty busy week last week and for a
mixture<00:00:12.679> of<00:00:12.769> reasons<00:00:13.219> one<00:00:13.519> I<00:00:13.759> just<00:00:13.789> got<00:00:14.089> back

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:14.209 
mixture of reasons one I just got back

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:15.699 
mixture of reasons one I just got back
from<00:00:14.240> my<00:00:14.389> holiday<00:00:14.839> so<00:00:14.900> my<00:00:15.110> energy<00:00:15.440> levels

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
from my holiday so my energy levels

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.470 
from my holiday so my energy levels
aren't<00:00:15.980> quite<00:00:16.160> back<00:00:16.190> up<00:00:16.520> there<00:00:16.700> yeah<00:00:16.910> I<00:00:17.120> think

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
aren't quite back up there yeah I think

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.120 
aren't quite back up there yeah I think
I<00:00:17.540> relaxed<00:00:17.960> a<00:00:18.020> little<00:00:18.140> too<00:00:18.380> hard<00:00:18.710> but<00:00:18.950> it<00:00:19.070> was

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
I relaxed a little too hard but it was

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.400 
I relaxed a little too hard but it was
very<00:00:19.430> much<00:00:19.640> needed<00:00:19.850> the<00:00:20.660> second<00:00:20.960> reason<00:00:21.110> is

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
very much needed the second reason is

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.750 
very much needed the second reason is
I've<00:00:21.560> been<00:00:21.680> doing<00:00:21.860> more<00:00:22.010> live<00:00:22.250> streams<00:00:22.580> in<00:00:22.700> the

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
I've been doing more live streams in the

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.520 
I've been doing more live streams in the
past<00:00:22.940> week<00:00:23.150> then<00:00:23.330> I<00:00:23.420> have<00:00:23.570> making<00:00:23.780> videos<00:00:24.200> and

past week then I have making videos and

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.290 
past week then I have making videos and
the<00:00:24.830> reason<00:00:25.250> for<00:00:25.280> that<00:00:25.490> is<00:00:25.730> one<00:00:25.940> because<00:00:26.210> I

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
the reason for that is one because I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.870 
the reason for that is one because I
enjoy<00:00:26.570> it<00:00:26.600> and<00:00:26.900> two<00:00:27.170> I<00:00:27.440> got<00:00:28.070> a<00:00:28.100> brand<00:00:28.340> new<00:00:28.370> PC
