00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
over that on an end over here so let's

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.760 
over that on an end over here so let's
go<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.670> walk<00:00:41.420> possibly<00:00:42.420> fly<00:00:42.600> because<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.649> is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
go for a walk possibly fly because it is

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.810 
go for a walk possibly fly because it is
a<00:00:43.800> bit<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:45.559> bit<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> walk<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:49.610> it'll<00:00:50.610> make

and also the other side of the river
past<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:17.920> waterfall<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.740> side<00:01:21.009> is<00:01:21.250> like<00:01:21.759> i

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
past the waterfall this side is like i

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.870 
past the waterfall this side is like i
said<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.270> where<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.659> fellowship<00:01:23.259> first<00:01:23.880> like

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
said is where the fellowship first like

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.380 
said is where the fellowship first like
pulled<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:26.460> pulled<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.610> shore<00:01:27.850> on<00:01:28.180> their

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
pulled and pulled the shore on their

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.789 
pulled and pulled the shore on their
boats<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.520> then<00:01:31.180> i<00:01:31.720> believe<00:01:32.259> it<00:01:32.409> was<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.560> era

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
boats and then i believe it was the era

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.570 
boats and then i believe it was the era
chi<00:01:33.100> or<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.369> orcs<00:01:34.290> kind<00:01:35.290> of<00:01:35.430> found<00:01:36.430> them

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
chi or the orcs kind of found them

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.930 
chi or the orcs kind of found them
eventually<00:01:36.880> which<00:01:37.869> is<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.520> main

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
eventually which is one of the main

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.200 
eventually which is one of the main
things<00:01:43.420> like<00:01:44.380> one<00:01:44.649> of<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.800> main<00:01:44.979> scenes<00:01:45.820> that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
things like one of the main scenes that

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.669 
things like one of the main scenes that

another one up here nope let's just fly
up<00:02:10.959> here<00:02:11.410> just<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.890> speed<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:12.910> up<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.120> little<00:02:13.269> bit

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
up here just to speed it up a little bit

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.580 
up here just to speed it up a little bit
there's<00:02:15.010> kind<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.549> rundown<00:02:16.440> pathway<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:20.560> a

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
there's kind of a rundown pathway to a

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.550 
there's kind of a rundown pathway to a
house<00:02:20.920> or<00:02:22.890> what<00:02:23.890> used<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.220> be<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.400> house<00:02:25.560> another

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
house or what used to be a house another

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.680 
house or what used to be a house another
pathway<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.340> leads<00:02:27.400> up<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.880> bit<00:02:28.060> further<00:02:28.360> a

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
pathway that leads up a bit further a

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:41.100 
pathway that leads up a bit further a
little<00:02:30.480> pillar<00:02:31.480> here

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:03:08.730 

some<00:02:42.110> more<00:02:42.319> little<00:02:42.700> ruins

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.860 

and<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:09.490> is<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:10.030> believe<00:03:10.150> this<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.420> roughly

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
and this is I believe this is roughly

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.160 
and this is I believe this is roughly
where<00:03:11.580> Boromir<00:03:12.580> tries<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.480> take<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.930> ring

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
where Boromir tries to take the ring

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:23.040 
where Boromir tries to take the ring
from<00:03:14.380> Frodo<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.970> this<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.300> where<00:03:22.450> Aragorn

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
from Frodo and this is where Aragorn

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.930 
from Frodo and this is where Aragorn
kind<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:24.630> consoles<00:03:25.630> them<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.990> bit<00:03:26.170> and

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
kind of consoles them a bit and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.660 
kind of consoles them a bit and
questions<00:03:28.110> where<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.290> one<00:03:29.470> ring<00:03:29.710> is<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:32.200> then

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
questions where the one ring is and then

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:40.710 
questions where the one ring is and then
the<00:03:33.670> invasion<00:03:34.200> begins<00:03:38.520> then<00:03:39.570> here's<00:03:40.570> the

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
the invasion begins then here's the

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.520 
the invasion begins then here's the
waterfall<00:03:41.970> which<00:03:42.970> is<00:03:43.320> pretty<00:03:44.320> impressive

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
waterfall which is pretty impressive

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:59.780 
waterfall which is pretty impressive
actually<00:03:45.070> to<00:03:45.550> make<00:03:45.700> it<00:03:45.880> look<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.770> cool

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.500 

and<00:04:01.099> pretty<00:04:02.099> much<00:04:02.189> is<00:04:02.519> where<00:04:02.730> like<00:04:02.909> the<00:04:03.120> the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
and pretty much is where like the the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.709 
and pretty much is where like the the
fellowship<00:04:03.959> splits<00:04:05.150> bore<00:04:06.150> me<00:04:06.329> or<00:04:06.390> ends<00:04:06.599> up

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:06.719 
fellowship splits bore me or ends up

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:10.039 
fellowship splits bore me or ends up

in<00:04:47.190> almond<00:04:48.190> n<00:04:49.320> just<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.470> detail<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:50.890> it's

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
in almond n just the detail and it's

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.990 
in almond n just the detail and it's
like<00:04:51.490> really<00:04:52.060> amazing<00:04:56.850> not<00:04:57.850> one<00:04:57.940> hundred

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
like really amazing not one hundred

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.300 
like really amazing not one hundred
percent<00:04:58.210> sure<00:04:58.570> when<00:04:59.320> they<00:04:59.560> completed<00:05:00.040> this

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
percent sure when they completed this

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.490 
percent sure when they completed this
but<00:05:00.760> i<00:05:01.000> believe<00:05:01.060> it<00:05:01.510> was<00:05:01.630> about<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:02.020> month<00:05:02.260> after

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
but i believe it was about a month after

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.660 
but i believe it was about a month after
a<00:05:03.100> month<00:05:03.460> or<00:05:03.580> so<00:05:03.730> after<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.620> two<00:05:05.620> statues<00:05:06.190> are

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
a month or so after the two statues are

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.930 
a month or so after the two statues are
the<00:05:06.880> two<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:08.680> two<00:05:08.710> statues<00:05:09.370> on<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:09.730> other

the two the two statues on the other

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.300 
the two the two statues on the other
side<00:05:10.180> of<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.360> river<00:05:10.510> bed<00:05:10.750> there<00:05:11.310> were

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
side of the river bed there were

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.340 
side of the river bed there were
completed

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.750
