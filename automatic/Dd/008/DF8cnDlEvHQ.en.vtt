00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.190
 antitussives 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.420
 antitussive or antitussive drugs 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.150
 are those able to reduce 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.560
 frequency and intensity of cough there 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.000
 to keep in mind that the cough is a 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.950
 reflex act that has a function 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.750
 protective in order to avoid 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.730
 blockage of the respiratory system as well 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.650
 as to eliminate pathogenic particles 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.050
 and foreign bodies of the device 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.300
 respiratory an insufficient cough 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.370
 favors lung infection without 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.140
 But there are times when cough 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.030
 it becomes a source of pathology 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.400
 since it exceeds the need to expel 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.650
 particles or secretions leading to 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.870
 discomfort that can range from pain or 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.330
 difficulty falling asleep 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.220
 cardiovascular disorders in these 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.550
 situations it becomes necessary to resort to 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.900
 antitussive drugs the reflection of 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.159
 the cough is activated by stimuli 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.830
 irritants of nerve fibers 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.810
 sensory with terminals in the larynx 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.350
 the trachea and the extra bronchi 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.180
 lungs these afferent stimuli are 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.979
 transported by the nerve or pneumo 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.659
 gastric or vagus although also 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.510
 other nerves intervene like the 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.549
 trigeminal or the glossopharyngeal 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.150
 differences are processed in a center 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.610
 nervous called cough center 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.890
 is located in the medulla oblongata 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.780
 identity is still not well defined but 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.600
 it is believed to be independent of the center 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.610
 respiratory by various nervous 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.740
 referents starts up a 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.080
 complex muscular response that originates 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.030
 the act of coughing which consists of three 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.200
 consecutive phases deep inspiration 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.080
 compression pressure increase 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.540
 intrathoracic and dynamic expulsion with 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.060
 open glottis and high respiratory flow 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.860
 besides this reflex component the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.020
 two has a voluntary component 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.390
 through control by the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.040
 cerebral cortex drugs 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.080
 antitussives can act on 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.980
 any component of the reflex arc of 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.570
 coughs are traditionally classified into 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.890
 antitussives of central action and 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.420
 peripheral action 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.370
 as they act at the center level of the 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.520
 or of the afferent fibers or 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.110
 deferentia that transmit the reflection their 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.660
 mechanism of action in most of the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.160
 cases is not known exactly by 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.470
 other side given the high component 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.270
 subjective cough there are many 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.180
 drugs whose efficacy in trials 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.220
 controlled clinical trials is questionable 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.480
 In addition, the placebo effect is responsible 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.670
 in many cases the effectiveness 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.440
 antitussive drug all this 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.670
 causes that in many cases the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.520
 cough treatment be 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.290
 unsatisfactory before starting a 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.000
 Antitussive treatment is fundamental 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.830
 identify the causative mechanism 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.020
 underlying that could require 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.450
 treatment and whenever possible 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.840
 the cause must be treated and not the symptom 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.310
 cough the main drugs 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.600
 antitussives are opioid drugs 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.600
 and the courtships 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.620
 antitussive opioids have action 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.060
 about the center of the cough but also 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.640
 there is evidence of its effect at the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.890
 peripheral most opioids 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.740
 have antitussive activity but the 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.450
 risks arising from its use 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.680
 exceed their benefits so their 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.270
 use for this purpose is 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.850
 restricted to a few 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.770
 codeine is the antitussive drug 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.530
 most used and serves as a reference for 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.680
 other drugs the most adverse side effects 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.990
 usual are sedation disorders 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.670
 gastrointestinal depression 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.190
 Respiratory dose 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.620
 high is respiratory depression can 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.200
 appear pale in elderly patients 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.940
 asthmatics and patients with epoc for this 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.040
 reason in these circumstances should 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.020
 be used with caution codeine well 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.640
 as in patients with insufficiency 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.340
 Respiratory cardiac, renal or hepatic 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.060
 hypothyroidism multiple sclerosis 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.980
 Ulcerative colitis and combative colitis 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.380
 is considered a drug of 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.180
 category c for use during the 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.610
 pregnancy and its use should be avoided 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.010
 especially at high doses during 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.750
 breastfeeding the consumption of alcohol and others 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.330
 depressants can increase the effects 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.370
 adverse use is not recommended in 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.510
 newborns nor in byn less than 2 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.220
 years 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.109
 the antitussive effect is achieved with 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.490
 lower doses than necessary for 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.490
 achieve the analgesic effect 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.180
 Dextromethorphan is an analogue of 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.340
 codeine whose antitussive efficacy has 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.580
 been demonstrated in different trials 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.980
 clinical being similar to codeine is 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.650
 an antagonist of the nm dea receptors 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.330
 and its analgesic effect does not 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.340
 main advantage over codeine 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.320
 is that it does not cause respiratory depression 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.110
 and that you need very high doses to 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.000
 produce central depression they also have 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.220
 minor intestinal mastro effects the 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.190
 routine however is contraindicated 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.990
 its joint use with antidepressants 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.180
 antiarrhythmics and alcohol is absorbed 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.310
 quickly at the gastrointestinal level and 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.070
 its effects appear at 15 or 30 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.650
 minutes with an approximate duration of 6 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.350
 hours is metabolized in the liver and it 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.330
 eliminated in the urine in children under 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.810
 two years the dose should be individualized 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.940
 and performed under medical supervision 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.110
 Doses should be adjusted in cases of 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.270
 liver failure 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.710
 and other opioid drugs with effect 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.170
 antitussive that have been less 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.930
 studied that the previous ones include 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.580
 the hydro codein that presents 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.340
 similar characteristics codeine 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.760
 but less addictive that of 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.460
 minor funk or similar to dextromethorphan 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.890
 but that requires a folk recipe 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.780
 codin with a similar clinical utility 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.400
 to codeine but with longer half-lives 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.880
 which allows to lengthen the interval 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.190
 between doses flat cabin with bow tub 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.690
 that has no opioid activity and can 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.690
 produce histamine release 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.199
 antitussives there was no efficacy ceos 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.630
 clinical of these drugs is more 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:04.660
 controversial that that of opiates is 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.270
 include within this group the pedal 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.099
 or colfer dian all that acts at the level 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.400
 central over the center of the cough and 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:14.289
 It has a certain anticholinergic action 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.889
 the one that operates is also an action tub 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:20.050
 central and with antihistamine effect the 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:23.410
 ninth fomin that has activity as 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.930
 respiratory stimulant and the other leb 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.699
 pro pool that presents action 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.460
 peripheral although it seems to have also 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.050
 a central action other drugs to the 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.090
 that efficiency has been attributed 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.000
 antitussives are 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.010
 the local anesthetic tane area 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.710
 acts at the peripheral level its effects 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.510
 adverse events include dizziness and dysphagia and 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.699
 have reported cases of seizures and 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:49.030
 cardiac arrest after acute ingestion as well 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:51.220
 as of anaphylaxis the lidocaine also 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.720
 with nestes effect and colo lime or 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.090
 diphenhydramine a drug 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.040
 antihistamine that can be purchased without 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.320
 recipe and is normally used associated with 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.889
 other drugs in anti-flu preparations 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.630
 is its antitussive effect can be 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:06.760
 more related to central depression 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.440
 that with its antihistamine activity 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.880
 also presents activity 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.160
 anticholinergic can induce 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.280
 dryness of mucous membranes and thickening 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.260
 of mucus finally some drugs 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:22.050
 bronchodilators like the ipra proper 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.050
 can have a certain antitussive effect
