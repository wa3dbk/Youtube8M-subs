00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.529 
we've been waiting for so this is the
neogeo<00:02:04.899> x<00:02:06.270> system<00:02:07.270> now<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:09.369> is<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:10.360> cool

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
neogeo x system now this is the cool

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.070 
neogeo x system now this is the cool
part<00:02:10.570> about<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:10.990> so<00:02:11.470> if<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.770> flip<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.190> open

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
inside that there is the neogeo x

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.500 
inside that there is the neogeo x
so<00:02:18.500> it's<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.920> portable<00:02:19.310> gaming<00:02:19.610> system<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.330> I'm

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
so it's a portable gaming system and I'm

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.660 
so it's a portable gaming system and I'm
just<00:02:20.630> going<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.810> pop<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.200> out<00:02:21.260> here<00:02:21.640> for<00:02:22.640> a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
just going to pop it out here for a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.780 
just going to pop it out here for a
second<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.270> can<00:02:23.360> see<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:24.459> so<00:02:25.459> this<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.640> the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
second so you can see it so this is the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.580 
second so you can see it so this is the
neogeo<00:02:26.300> x<00:02:26.360> if<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:26.989> want<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.200> charge<00:02:27.410> the

neogeo x if you want to charge the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.940 
neogeo x if you want to charge the
system<00:02:27.950> actually<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:29.030> here<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.660> the
