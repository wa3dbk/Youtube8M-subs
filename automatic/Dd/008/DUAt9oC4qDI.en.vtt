allows<00:01:40.560> me<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> even<00:01:40.979> play<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.310> lot<00:01:41.490> better<00:01:41.700> with

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
allows me to even play a lot better with

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.460 
allows me to even play a lot better with
it<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.329> when<00:01:42.630> you're<00:01:42.780> shooting<00:01:42.930> kind<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
it because when you're shooting kind of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.230 
it because when you're shooting kind of
shoots<00:01:43.710> up<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> recoil<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> little

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
shoots up so the recoil up is a little

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.510 
shoots up so the recoil up is a little
bit<00:01:45.360> more<00:01:45.659> than<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.320> record<00:01:46.770> down<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.250> recall

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
weapons absolutely amazing so now we

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.930 
weapons absolutely amazing so now we
focus<00:03:22.740> on<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:22.890> lot<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.160> stats<00:03:23.370> pilots<00:03:23.700> but<00:03:23.820> for

my<00:03:24.000> let's<00:03:24.180> talk<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.360> little<00:03:24.450> bit<00:03:24.720> about<00:03:24.810> in-game

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
my let's talk a little bit about in-game

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.260 
my let's talk a little bit about in-game
experience<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.250> with<00:03:26.520> this<00:03:26.580> weapon<00:03:26.760> it's

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
experience and with this weapon it's

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.630 
experience and with this weapon it's
absolutely<00:03:27.540> amazing<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.620> 31<00:03:28.890> bus<00:03:28.980> makes<00:03:29.400> you

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
absolutely amazing the 31 bus makes you

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.890 
absolutely amazing the 31 bus makes you
have<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> little<00:03:29.910> bit<00:03:30.150> more<00:03:30.300> accuracy<00:03:30.690> so

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
have a little bit more accuracy so

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.300 
have a little bit more accuracy so
therefore<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.290> tend<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.590> be<00:03:31.710> more<00:03:31.860> gunfights

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
therefore you tend to be more gunfights

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.790 
therefore you tend to be more gunfights
did<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.820> taking<00:03:33.210> your<00:03:33.360> time<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.600> aim<00:03:33.960> and<00:03:34.440> also

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
did you taking your time to aim and also

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.290 
did you taking your time to aim and also
the<00:03:34.890> fact<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.640> just<00:03:35.820> got<00:03:35.910> so<00:03:36.120> it's

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
the fact that it just got so it's

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
the fact that it just got so it's
damaged<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.630> large<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.990> bring<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.170> lot<00:03:37.290> more

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
damaged a large to bring a lot more
