00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
while but i think there's an independent

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.779 
while but i think there's an independent
one<00:00:42.530> with<00:00:43.040> a<00:00:43.219> monster<00:00:43.610> truck<00:00:43.790> and<00:00:44.149> a<00:00:45.670> bunch<00:00:46.670> of

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
one with a monster truck and a bunch of

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.669 
one with a monster truck and a bunch of

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
guns and clothing and stuff like that

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.750

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
think they had a mindset of Franklin's

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.889 
think they had a mindset of Franklin's
Buffalo<00:00:55.609> which<00:00:56.210> is<00:00:56.329> really<00:00:56.510> cool<00:00:56.749> because

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899

will be coming up tomorrow is a road to
gold<00:01:38.539> that<00:01:39.140> I'm<00:01:39.289> doing<00:01:39.680> with<00:01:39.890> paws

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
gold that I'm doing with paws

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.039 
gold that I'm doing with paws
essentially<00:01:42.680> what<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:42.829> is<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.630> we<00:01:44.630> all<00:01:44.780> use<00:01:45.020> a

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
essentially what that is is we all use a

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.319 
essentially what that is is we all use a
gun<00:01:45.350> like<00:01:46.070> preferably<00:01:46.789> within<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.119> same

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
gun like preferably within the same

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.990 
gun like preferably within the same
class<00:01:47.600> like<00:01:47.930> right<00:01:48.140> now<00:01:48.170> it's<00:01:48.409> assault<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:49.729> I'm

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
class like right now it's assault so I'm

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.550 
class like right now it's assault so I'm
using<00:01:50.180> this<00:01:50.329> for<00:01:50.570> Road<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.930> he's<00:01:51.140> using<00:01:51.350> the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
using this for Road and he's using the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.709 
using this for Road and he's using the
ACR<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:53.259> so<00:01:54.259> what<00:01:54.500> we<00:01:54.619> do<00:01:54.740> is<00:01:55.060> we<00:01:56.060> get<00:01:56.570> a

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
ACR and so what we do is we get a

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.870 
ACR and so what we do is we get a
gameplay<00:01:57.170> once<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.619> week<00:01:57.799> with<00:01:58.159> that<00:01:58.369> gun<00:01:58.609> and

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
gameplay once a week with that gun and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.120 
gameplay once a week with that gun and
once<00:01:59.390> we<00:01:59.479> have<00:01:59.659> it<00:01:59.689> golden<00:02:00.229> we<00:02:00.770> get<00:02:00.950> one

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
once we have it golden we get one

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.889 
once we have it golden we get one
gameplay<00:02:01.340> with<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.880> which<00:02:02.359> is<00:02:02.630> going<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.840> be

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
gameplay with that which is going to be

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.870 
gameplay with that which is going to be
kind<00:02:03.469> of<00:02:03.590> hard<00:02:03.710> on<00:02:03.799> my<00:02:03.920> part<00:02:04.159> because<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.640> have

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
kind of hard on my part because I have

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.650 
kind of hard on my part because I have
not<00:02:05.030> played<00:02:06.219> competitively<00:02:07.219> on<00:02:07.609> call<00:02:08.330> of<00:02:08.360> duty

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
not played competitively on call of duty

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.400 
not played competitively on call of duty
in<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:08.960> while<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:11.390> is<00:02:11.540> going<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.780> be<00:02:11.990> kind

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
in a while so that is going to be kind

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.200 
in a while so that is going to be kind
of<00:02:12.470> where<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.620> lack<00:02:12.890> behind<00:02:13.280> is<00:02:13.550> in<00:02:13.910> gameplay

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
of where I lack behind is in gameplay

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.180 
of where I lack behind is in gameplay
