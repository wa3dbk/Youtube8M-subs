00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
a dual sim phone probably the best else

a dual sim phone probably the best else
I'm<00:00:16.320> gonna<00:00:16.410> get<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.710> market<00:00:16.890> right<00:00:17.220> now

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.929 

I<00:00:23.880> think<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:24.750> resistive<00:00:25.580> now<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.789> makes

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
I think it's resistive now that it makes

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.849 
I think it's resistive now that it makes
a<00:00:27.000> difference<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.330> me<00:00:27.510> personally<00:00:28.109> as<00:00:28.590> long<00:00:28.740> as

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
a difference to me personally as long as

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:37.010 
a difference to me personally as long as
it<00:00:28.949> works<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.550> fine<00:00:30.710> pull<00:00:31.710> itself<00:00:36.020> follows

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
