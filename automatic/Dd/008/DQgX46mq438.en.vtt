00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
it just makes it look cute nice and

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
comfortable and I'm all about comfort

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.240 
comfortable and I'm all about comfort
when<00:03:32.730> I'm<00:03:32.850> traveling<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.690> then<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.680> paired<00:03:35.070> it

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
when I'm traveling and then I paired it

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.350 
when I'm traveling and then I paired it
with<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:35.880> beautiful<00:03:36.630> pop<00:03:37.080> of<00:03:37.110> red<00:03:38.060> scarf

with this beautiful pop of red scarf

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.360 
with this beautiful pop of red scarf
I<00:03:39.740> think<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.860> scarf<00:03:41.250> adds<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.940> lot<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.450> and

I think the scarf adds a lot to it and

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.520 
I think the scarf adds a lot to it and
it<00:03:44.370> just<00:03:44.610> looks<00:03:44.910> very<00:03:45.510> nice<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.020> very

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.560 
Parisian I think because everybody in
Paris<00:03:49.410> wears<00:03:49.800> scarves<00:03:52.970> another<00:03:53.970> way<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.209> wore

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.850 
this dress was to make it look a little
more<00:03:58.490> for<00:03:59.490> an<00:03:59.580> evening<00:03:59.880> out<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.860> although

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.830 
paired it with this beautiful red sash
that<00:05:36.630> I<00:05:37.080> picked<00:05:37.470> up<00:05:37.650> in<00:05:37.830> Mexico<00:05:38.400> City<00:05:38.760> a<00:05:39.030> long

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
that I picked up in Mexico City a long

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.490 
that I picked up in Mexico City a long
long<00:05:40.110> time<00:05:40.410> ago<00:05:40.669> but<00:05:41.669> I've<00:05:41.910> used<00:05:42.389> it<00:05:42.690> so<00:05:43.320> many

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
long time ago but I've used it so many

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.240 
long time ago but I've used it so many
times<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:44.430> it<00:05:45.060> just<00:05:45.389> brings<00:05:45.960> color<00:05:46.710> to<00:05:47.070> the

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
times and it just brings color to the

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.190 
times and it just brings color to the
dress<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:48.500> again<00:05:49.500> I<00:05:50.120> wore<00:05:51.120> just<00:05:51.450> the<00:05:51.930> little

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
dress and again I wore just the little

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.500 
dress and again I wore just the little
black<00:05:52.530> sweater<00:05:53.070> I<00:05:53.370> think<00:05:54.030> it'll<00:05:54.150> come<00:05:54.240> in

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.060 
evenings or if I get a little cold and
chilly<00:06:00.810> because<00:06:00.930> I'm<00:06:01.139> always<00:06:01.350> cold<00:06:01.800> and
