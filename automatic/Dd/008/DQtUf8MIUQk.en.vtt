00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.009
 it used to be very normal who here 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 together when the self is no longer 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.580
 succeeded by old age or others 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.019
 limitations there was the neighbor to the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.849
 angle that occasionally hjoed with it 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.190
 household or neighbor of the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.240
 Other side came in the garden to help with the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.500
 help from neighbor 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.470
 we were able to work independently for as long as possible 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.150
 continue to live and first and social 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.789
 coherence that is no more than 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.580
 taken for granted today 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.320
 this just isn't so obvious anymore 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.130
 society is a lot more anonymous 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.109
 become 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.270
 People are busier next aid 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.270
 was replaced by professional help 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.920
 supplied by major healthcare institutions 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.750
 the costs of that professional help 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.899
 are now completely out of the pan 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.550
 raised from 2015 it is about that much 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.160
 change in long-term care 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.309
 the municipality's compensation obligation 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.690
 disappears in the 2015 region 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.329
 the own responsibility of the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.190
 citizen will be central again 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.020
 we must and therefore want to go back to 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.079
 a society where that social 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.239
 cohesion can be taken for granted again 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.549
 this is not easy 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.390
 that is why alpha bunch comes in with people 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.159
 neighborhood 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.409
 nearby people is a dynamic 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.540
 platform in which people meet their needs 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.430
 be able to make support known and in 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.869
 can search the neighborhood for people who 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.659
 provide the assistance 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.150
 just paid person to person 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.070
 help or commitment from volunteers 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.869
 of course with active mediation behind 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.909
 the screens are required by law 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.590
 general provisions are against 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.630
 extremely low costs at the most 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.340
 created naturally and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.829
 will consist of an offer from 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.350
 exactly those services that people optimally 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.299
 support their self-reliance 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.430
 costs and satisfaction go down 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.439
 up and a balance is created again 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.210
 between the income and expenditure of 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.950
 municipalities 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.600
 people who need help are happy 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.729
 because they can rely on 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.920
 support provided by people where 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.680
 they have a personal contact and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.659
 people look just a little further 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.460
 Delivering help are happy because they are more 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.560
 receive substantive work and for 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.780
 paid help better than they earn 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.520
 have ever been employed 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.290
 the municipalities are happy because all 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.880
 necessary support is 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.619
 arranged within strongly shrinking 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.030
 budgets and while maintaining the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.430
 signaling function 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.209
 so everyone is happy with people in the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.100
 neighborhood 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.140
 people in the neighborhood is an initiative of 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.069
 alpha proud in collaboration with the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.800
 Township 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.800
 quickly look at alpha pride point nl
