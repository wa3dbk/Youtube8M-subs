playing with the crown spinning it like

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.719 
playing with the crown spinning it like
to<00:01:10.530> me<00:01:10.650> that's<00:01:10.799> common<00:01:11.100> sense<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:11.610> when

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
to me that's common sense you know when

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.710 
to me that's common sense you know when
you<00:01:11.820> get<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.270> you're<00:01:12.420> gonna<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.659> able

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you get it that you're gonna be able

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.840 
you get it that you're gonna be able
just<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.080> time<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.890> don't<00:01:14.220> understand<00:01:14.760> that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
just a time so I don't understand that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
just a time so I don't understand that
so<00:01:15.420> again<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.900> think<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.290> very<00:01:16.439> helpful<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
so again I think it's very helpful to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.429 
so again I think it's very helpful to
see<00:01:17.070> side-by-sides<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
see side-by-sides and to see what it

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.230 
see side-by-sides and to see what it
looks<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> wrist<00:01:20.070> I'm<00:01:20.250> about<00:01:20.369> 170

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
looks like on the wrist I'm about 170

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.980 
looks like on the wrist I'm about 170
pounds<00:01:21.689> 165<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.759> 7<00:01:24.060> inch<00:01:24.150> wrist<00:01:24.390> which<00:01:24.840> I

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
pounds 165 I have a 7 inch wrist which I

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.289 
pounds 165 I have a 7 inch wrist which I
believe<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.409> an<00:01:25.530> average<00:01:25.710> wrist<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.340> always

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
believe is an average wrist and always

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.210 
believe is an average wrist and always
watch<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.600> look<00:01:27.689> pretty<00:01:27.900> big<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.259> me<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> so
