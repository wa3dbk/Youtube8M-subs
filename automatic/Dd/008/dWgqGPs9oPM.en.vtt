twenty scheduled 20 which means it's a

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.470 
twenty scheduled 20 which means it's a
thinner<00:00:20.400> wall<00:00:20.750> but<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:22.500> works<00:00:22.710> great<00:00:22.860> for<00:00:23.610> this

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
thinner wall but it works great for this

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.089 
thinner wall but it works great for this
type<00:00:24.929> of<00:00:24.960> things<00:00:25.500> where<00:00:25.679> we're<00:00:25.830> going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.009> be

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
type of things where we're going to be

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.640 
type of things where we're going to be
building<00:00:26.310> stuff<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.410> I'm<00:00:28.410> going<00:00:28.529> to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
building stuff out of it I'm going to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.730 
building stuff out of it I'm going to
cut<00:00:29.330> straight<00:00:30.330> down<00:00:30.470> then<00:00:31.470> we're<00:00:31.560> going<00:00:31.679> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
cut straight down then we're going to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.180 
cut straight down then we're going to
put<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> oven<00:00:32.279> at<00:00:33.150> around<00:00:33.839> 210<00:00:34.320> 220<00:00:34.890> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
put it in the oven at around 210 220 and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.920 
put it in the oven at around 210 220 and
it'll<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.579> basically<00:00:35.910> flatten<00:00:36.420> out<00:00:36.540> for<00:00:36.809> us

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
it'll just basically flatten out for us

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.180 
it'll just basically flatten out for us
and<00:00:37.019> they'll<00:00:37.199> be<00:00:37.350> able<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.500> work<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:37.949> from

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and they'll be able to work with it from

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.250 
and they'll be able to work with it from
there

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
there

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.240

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
our left over oven I've got a piece of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.169 
our left over oven I've got a piece of
countertop<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.920> left<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.340> cutting<00:01:00.030> board

between those two and that'll give us a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.070 
between those two and that'll give us a
nice<00:01:08.399> flat<00:01:08.670> piece<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.179> mark<00:01:09.600> out<00:01:09.750> our<00:01:09.780> pattern

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
nice flat piece to mark out our pattern

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.169 
nice flat piece to mark out our pattern
from<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.679> then<00:01:11.640> we'll<00:01:11.759> be<00:01:11.850> able<00:01:11.910> to<00:01:12.030> start

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:12.179 
from and then we'll be able to start

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.910 
from and then we'll be able to start
cutting<00:01:12.509> and<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:12.690> shaping<00:01:13.050> from<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:15.920> so

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
cutting and then shaping from there so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:29.250 
cutting and then shaping from there so
you<00:01:17.069> can<00:01:17.250> see<00:01:17.459> it<00:01:17.550> start<00:01:17.819> to<00:01:17.880> flatten<00:01:18.300> out

okay I just pulled it out and stuck it

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.200 
okay I just pulled it out and stuck it
in<00:01:33.260> between<00:01:33.410> my<00:01:33.590> pieces<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:36.940> there<00:01:37.940> you<00:01:38.090> have

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
in between my pieces and there you have

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.990 
in between my pieces and there you have
it<00:01:38.390> one<00:01:39.170> nice<00:01:39.530> flat<00:01:41.050> piece<00:01:42.050> of<00:01:42.410> PVC<00:01:43.130> and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.100 

thickness<00:01:47.000> on<00:01:47.180> that<00:01:47.210> is<00:01:47.510> pretty<00:01:47.750> good<00:01:47.930> it's

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
thickness on that is pretty good it's

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.090 
thickness on that is pretty good it's
going<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.290> be<00:01:48.380> nice<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.560> easy<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.980> work<00:01:49.010> with

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
going to be nice and easy to work with

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.270 
going to be nice and easy to work with
so<00:01:49.570> let's<00:01:50.570> go<00:01:50.780> draw<00:01:51.290> out<00:01:51.440> our<00:01:51.560> pattern<00:01:51.710> and

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
so let's go draw out our pattern and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.560 
so let's go draw out our pattern and
we'll<00:01:52.760> get<00:01:52.880> back<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.150> it<00:01:53.270> okay<00:01:55.390> here's<00:01:56.390> my

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
we'll get back to it okay here's my

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.740 
we'll get back to it okay here's my
template<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:58.340> went<00:01:58.490> ahead<00:01:58.580> and<00:01:59.800> marked<00:02:00.800> it

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
template and I went ahead and marked it

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.500 
template and I went ahead and marked it
down<00:02:02.750> on<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.230> the<00:02:03.860> piece<00:02:06.280> going<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.370> be

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
down on to the piece going to be

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.400 
down on to the piece going to be
drilling<00:02:08.510> one<00:02:09.410> inch<00:02:09.560> holes<00:02:09.800> here<00:02:10.270> here<00:02:11.410> here

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
drilling one inch holes here here here

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.440 
drilling one inch holes here here here
here<00:02:14.230> here<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.380> here<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.790> corresponds

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
here here and here and that corresponds

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.340 
here here and here and that corresponds
with<00:02:17.510> my<00:02:17.780> corners<00:02:18.260> here<00:02:18.850> here<00:02:19.930> here<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.290> here

right there and I'm going to actually go
through<00:02:37.850> those<00:02:38.030> without<00:02:38.270> an<00:02:38.480> eighth<00:02:38.720> inch

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
through those without an eighth inch

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.740 
through those without an eighth inch
drill<00:02:40.280> bit<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:41.090> what<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.300> does<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.510> give<00:02:41.660> you

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
drill bit that what it does is give you

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.600 
a nice little landing point for your
cuts<00:02:44.350> coming<00:02:45.350> in<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.739> then<00:02:46.160> these<00:02:46.340> will<00:02:46.489> be

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
cuts coming in and then these will be

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.199 
cuts coming in and then these will be
folding<00:02:46.970> down<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.450> make<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.810> holder<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:50.060> we're

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
folding down to make the holder so we're

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.690 
folding down to make the holder so we're
back<00:02:50.360> I've<00:02:50.810> got<00:02:50.989> my<00:02:51.110> piece<00:02:51.520> cut<00:02:52.520> out<00:02:52.550> now<00:02:54.700> I'm

back I've got my piece cut out now I'm
going<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.880> be<00:02:55.970> heating<00:02:56.300> this<00:02:56.420> up<00:02:56.980> with<00:02:57.980> a<00:03:00.459> heat

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
going to be heating this up with a heat

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.980 
going to be heating this up with a heat
gun<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:01.910> shaping<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.260> my<00:03:03.860> iPad<00:03:04.190> Mini

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
gun and shaping it to my iPad Mini

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:14.180 
gun and shaping it to my iPad Mini
I'm<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:06.890> passing<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.460> over<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.760> heat

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.600 

till<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.910> gets<00:03:15.060> warm<00:03:15.270> enough<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.690> bend<00:03:16.610> then

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
till it gets warm enough to bend then

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.660 
till it gets warm enough to bend then
I'm<00:03:17.760> bending<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.210> into<00:03:18.690> place<00:03:22.070> okay<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:23.370> here

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
I'm bending it into place okay so here

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.190 
I'm bending it into place okay so here
it<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:27.090> can<00:03:27.240> see<00:03:27.450> on<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.750> back<00:03:27.930> side

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
it is and you can see on the back side

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.920 
it is and you can see on the back side
I've<00:03:28.740> got<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.010> t-nut<00:03:29.520> sitting<00:03:30.150> right<00:03:30.510> inside

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
I've got a t-nut sitting right inside

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.080 
I've got a t-nut sitting right inside
there<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.610> had<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:32.700> add<00:03:32.820> another<00:03:33.980> spacer

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
there I had to add another spacer

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.230 
there I had to add another spacer
because<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.300> t-nut<00:03:36.630> was<00:03:36.840> too<00:03:37.140> long<00:03:38.180> so<00:03:39.180> I

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
because the t-nut was too long so I

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.760 
because the t-nut was too long so I
could<00:03:39.390> either<00:03:39.480> grind<00:03:39.780> down<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.140> t-nut<00:03:40.470> or<00:03:40.710> I

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
could either grind down the t-nut or I

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.840 
could either grind down the t-nut or I
could<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.070> put<00:03:41.160> another<00:03:41.280> spacer<00:03:41.730> in<00:03:41.820> there

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
could just put another spacer in there

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.700 
could just put another spacer in there
if<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:42.750> was<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.930> build<00:03:43.080> another<00:03:43.350> one<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.590> would

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
if I was to build another one I would

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.560 
if I was to build another one I would
just<00:03:43.920> have<00:03:44.130> one<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.700> those<00:03:44.760> flaps<00:03:45.120> basically

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
just have one of those flaps basically

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.950 
just have one of those flaps basically
Bend<00:03:45.810> back<00:03:46.020> and<00:03:47.960> take<00:03:48.960> care<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.560> spacing

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
Bend back and take care of that spacing

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.510 
Bend back and take care of that spacing
but<00:03:51.960> I<00:03:51.990> had<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.320> go<00:03:52.410> get<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.590> tea<00:03:52.980> nut<00:03:53.160> which<00:03:53.370> is

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
but I had to go get a tea nut which is

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.880 
but I had to go get a tea nut which is
basically<00:03:53.880> nothing<00:03:54.210> more<00:03:54.630> than<00:03:54.870> one<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.740> these

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
basically nothing more than one of these

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:06.220 
basically nothing more than one of these
here<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:59.220> one<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.490> need<00:03:59.670> is<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.860> 1/4<00:04:01.860> by

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.930 

2020<00:04:07.230> threads<00:04:07.470> per<00:04:07.710> inch

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
2020 threads per inch

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
sitting in back and it connects right to

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.640 
sitting in back and it connects right to
the<00:04:36.840> tripod<00:04:38.660> so<00:04:39.660> I'll<00:04:39.780> show<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:39.930> how<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.200> iPad

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.870 

and<00:04:55.020> sets<00:04:56.020> in<00:04:56.170> there<00:04:56.320> nice<00:04:56.500> and<00:04:56.530> snug<00:04:59.790> show<00:05:00.790> you

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
can see here it's kind of hard to make

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.020 
can see here it's kind of hard to make
out<00:05:11.350> there<00:05:11.770> you<00:05:11.890> go<00:05:12.040> there's<00:05:12.490> where<00:05:13.000> the

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:21.879 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:29.639 

plug-in<00:05:22.539> ports<00:05:24.089> and<00:05:25.089> as<00:05:25.209> you<00:05:25.330> can<00:05:25.419> see<00:05:28.649> it's

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:29.649 
plug-in ports and as you can see it's

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:36.169 
plug-in ports and as you can see it's
not<00:05:29.979> going<00:05:30.520> anywhere

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:36.179
