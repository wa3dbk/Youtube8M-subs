I'm<00:01:46.289> trying<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.530> think<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:46.799> there's<00:01:46.829> an

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
exception to that rule and I really

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.800 
exception to that rule and I really

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.569 
don't think there is so yeah anything

the<00:04:09.699> platform<00:04:10.699> it<00:04:11.569> wasn't<00:04:12.079> no<00:04:12.260> fire<00:04:12.530> but<00:04:12.560> I

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
the platform it wasn't no fire but I

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:13.930 
the platform it wasn't no fire but I
don't<00:04:13.010> think<00:04:13.160> they'd<00:04:13.250> really<00:04:13.280> count<00:04:13.669> the

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
don't think they'd really count the

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:21.039 
don't think they'd really count the
zombies<00:04:17.019> so<00:04:18.019> yeah<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:19.310> think<00:04:19.699> there<00:04:20.690> are<00:04:20.719> some

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.200 
zombies so yeah I think there are some
aspects<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:21.890> the<00:04:22.010> gameplay<00:04:22.219> that<00:04:22.760> kind<00:04:23.150> of

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
aspects to the gameplay that kind of

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
aspects to the gameplay that kind of
freaked<00:04:23.479> me<00:04:23.690> out<00:04:23.719> like<00:04:24.289> there's

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
freaked me out like there's

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.690 
freaked me out like there's
seeing<00:04:25.680> workers<00:04:25.980> is<00:04:26.100> running<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.550> then<00:04:26.610> he

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
seeing workers is running and then he

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.340 
seeing workers is running and then he
runs<00:04:26.850> really<00:04:27.120> fast<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.840> does<00:04:27.990> look<00:04:28.170> kind

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
runs really fast and it does look kind

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.120 
runs really fast and it does look kind
of<00:04:28.410> gears<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.830> war<00:04:28.980> ich<00:04:29.160> lots<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.920> taking<00:04:31.920> cover

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
of gears of war ich lots of taking cover

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.620 
of gears of war ich lots of taking cover
I<00:04:32.460> really<00:04:32.820> hope<00:04:32.940> we<00:04:33.000> don't<00:04:33.270> have<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.420> do<00:04:33.600> that

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
I really hope we don't have to do that

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.750 
I really hope we don't have to do that
too<00:04:33.900> much<00:04:34.080> because<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.740> hated<00:04:35.100> those<00:04:35.370> parts

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
too much because I hated those parts

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.620 
too much because I hated those parts

the movies which I guess is a good in

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.420 
the movies which I guess is a good in
that<00:06:04.380> way<00:06:04.590> where<00:06:04.830> there's<00:06:05.010> actually<00:06:05.280> like<00:06:05.400> a

from Resident Evil 4 which I just makes

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.320 
from Resident Evil 4 which I just makes
sense<00:06:21.720> it's<00:06:21.990> ten<00:06:22.350> years<00:06:22.650> after<00:06:22.970> resin<00:06:23.970> ago<00:06:24.090> for

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
sense it's ten years after resin ago for

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.050 
sense it's ten years after resin ago for
and<00:06:24.540> resin<00:06:24.750> before<00:06:25.020> I<00:06:25.050> think<00:06:25.260> took<00:06:25.380> place<00:06:25.560> in

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
and resin before I think took place in

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.360 
and resin before I think took place in
2003-2004<00:06:27.410> so<00:06:28.410> I<00:06:28.440> guess<00:06:28.890> it<00:06:29.070> could<00:06:29.160> be<00:06:29.190> the

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
2003-2004 so I guess it could be the

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.140 
2003-2004 so I guess it could be the
same<00:06:29.550> president<00:06:30.050> but<00:06:31.050> yeah<00:06:31.620> so<00:06:32.580> yeah<00:06:32.850> those

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
same president but yeah so yeah those

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.670 
same president but yeah so yeah those
