as<00:05:23.610> you<00:05:23.729> can<00:05:23.789> see<00:05:24.000> I'm<00:05:24.060> doing<00:05:24.150> a<00:05:24.380> pretty<00:05:25.380> bad

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
as you can see I'm doing a pretty bad

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:38.220 
as you can see I'm doing a pretty bad
job<00:05:25.889> of<00:05:25.919> that<00:05:26.160> right<00:05:26.400> now

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.380 

he's<00:05:38.740> a<00:05:38.770> lot<00:05:39.010> slower<00:05:39.430> with<00:05:39.640> his<00:05:39.790> attacks<00:05:40.150> and

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
he's a lot slower with his attacks and

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.240 
he's a lot slower with his attacks and
most<00:05:40.600> of<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.780> enemies<00:05:41.050> so<00:05:41.740> it's<00:05:41.920> pretty<00:05:42.130> easy

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
most of the enemies so it's pretty easy

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.180 
most of the enemies so it's pretty easy
to<00:05:42.550> get<00:05:42.670> longer<00:05:43.060> combos<00:05:43.630> off<00:05:43.810> on<00:05:44.020> but<00:05:44.890> still

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
to get longer combos off on but still

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:52.690 
to get longer combos off on but still
don't<00:05:45.400> stay<00:05:45.640> in<00:05:45.670> there<00:05:45.880> for<00:05:46.060> too<00:05:46.270> long

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:59.150 

and<00:05:53.150> rip<00:05:53.660> his<00:05:53.780> head<00:05:53.900> off

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:12.600 

that'll<00:06:00.160> bring<00:06:00.250> back<00:06:00.490> these<00:06:00.810> lists<00:06:01.810> here<00:06:11.610> and

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
that'll bring back these lists here and

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.450 
that'll bring back these lists here and
now<00:06:12.759> we're<00:06:12.819> going<00:06:13.060> to<00:06:13.120> encounter<00:06:13.419> a<00:06:14.310> kind<00:06:15.310> of<00:06:15.340> a
