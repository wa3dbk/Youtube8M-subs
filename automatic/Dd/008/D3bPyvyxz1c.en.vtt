00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello everybody this math author 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.480
 before we start a message 20 the whole 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.790
 math dot com 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.440
 there you find our handouts and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.150
 links to facebook group fan page 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.490
 channel on youtube 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.710
 I am Professor Gustavo Viegas and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.910
 in this class we will system 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.820
 various decimal numbers 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.970
 have created their numbering system as the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:34.980
 Egyptians the Babylonians the Mayans and 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.590
 Romans based on the amount of data 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.329
 we have Indians in the hands 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.180
 invented your system 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.129
 it evolved over time to give 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.120
 origin to the numbers we use 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.320
 currently this system has arisen around 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.559
 of the year 250 years of Christ there in India and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.180
 at least 670 after Christ he 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.449
 arrived in the Middle East 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.460
 we will use the region to use and disseminate 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.739
 enough for what we call 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.990
 Arabic system 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.350
 the arabesque of the system has become 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.869
 used in Europe after 1202 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.830
 when fibonacci write a book in 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.360
 which used these organisms 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.090
 the time of the system is a system 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.490
 positional or in accordance with 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.720
 position of the digit we have numbers 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.049
 many different 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.509
 12 and 21 are formed by the same 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.380
 but because of being in order 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.780
 different are different numbers one 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.659
 important principle here as we 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.400
 in homes means that we 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.780
 we are multiplying by 10 to 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.869
 for example 345 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.500
 three hundred four tens and five 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.399
 units 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:59.640
 that means we have the 3 x 100 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:01.770
 the 4 x 10 and 15 something important in the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.530
 system we use is the use of the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.530
 zero for example this is only the five 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.030
 which are five units but are now 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.040
 five tens and five hundreds to 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.709
 first person who understood the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.610
 meaning of zero and wrote about 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:25.530
 this was the Indian brahma gupta in 628 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.520
 after good christ there are numbers 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.540
 important as a thousand to 1 million billion 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.160
 and 1 trillion 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.379
 note that if I take the number like this 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.420
 that appears to be too big is bad 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.730
 dilello then there is a more 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.260
 economic way of doing 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.269
 let's not discuss the meaning yet 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.569
 but 10 to 0 we will define as a 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.550
 and 10 to 1 is the 10 which is more 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.480
 important at this moment is that they follow 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:01.709
 now 10 squared is the 100 ie the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.269
 1 followed by 12 zeros 10 to the cube is some 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.280
 followed by 30 c 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.739
 then there is its rating more 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.209
 economic it is important to first 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.580
 person who had the idea to write 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.319
 as well as 10 to 2 10 players 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.989
 this format was the redecard eg 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.680
 the ten in the 30 thousand 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.940
 the ten in 6 is one million the 10 9 is the 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.790
 10 to 12 billion is the trillion 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.099
 the high deficit so is google and the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.099
 google number is written so with end 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.860
 gold7 more than as it now is for 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.480
 right about the comma I go 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.170
 dividing by 10 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.560
 so I wanted it to be 4.12 years and 13 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.950
 good we have our whole part 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.840
 we have the part of this evil then from here 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.409
 little we'll see what it means 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.470
 be dividing by 10 the first person 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.360
 who understood the operation of the parties 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.120
 a number of the way we do 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:16.350
 currently and has been able to 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:20.100
 this was the one in 1585, well let's go 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:25.070
 enter the annotation of this minus one is the 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:29.570
 01 of this minus two is 10 01 10 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:34.250
 - 30 001 then with annotation what 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:36.440
 means 4,12 versus 13,144 units 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:41.180
 four months 10 to 0 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:44.210
 2 is two months 10 - 11 11 is 12 and 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.310
 the ten minus 2 and the 3 is three times 10 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:55.610
 gives three less important here 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:05:00.050
 the number 12.05 is greater than the 12.00 99 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.980
 although the 05 is less than 100 99 is 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.520
 not right 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:08.180
 exactly the five he is 15 times 10 -2 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.840
 and that is greater than that 99 o 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.570
 first 9 is nine months 10 -3 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.930
 Of course I bought numbers where the 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.970
 units are the same 12 with 12 but for 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:27.460
 example 13.01 is greater than 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:31.580
 7,999 because the thirteen is greater than the 7 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.980
 good and sometimes appear in calculators 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.500
 Or do you think the numbers on the internet? 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.390
 sometimes inscribed with a comma sometimes 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.760
 with a dot for example a thousand 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:46.670
 three hundred and forty- four or four hundred and forty- four 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.080
 this is a question of how it is used in 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.810
 each country 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.350
 for example in Brazil we use the 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.940
 comma but in the United States the point 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:00.020
 there are regions where they do not use 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:07.880
 organisms Arabic however you going 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:12.230
 can write thus 1,903,135 74.1 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:15.290
 in fact 01 you can use the point or 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.960
 not use the point there is free but this 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:22.330
 for our notation in which the comma that 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.680
 separates the whole part from the part of simon 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.690
 and that's it and I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.590
 much more yours find the whole 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.590
