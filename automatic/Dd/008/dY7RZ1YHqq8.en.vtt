00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.490 
strands of wire but you're going to wrap
them<00:01:47.159> around<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> other<00:01:48.030> direction<00:01:48.540> from

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
them around on the other direction from

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.700 
them around on the other direction from
the<00:01:49.860> other<00:01:50.009> wires<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.840> once<00:01:52.020> your<00:01:52.200> wire<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.560> in

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the other wires so once your wire is in

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.550 
the other wires so once your wire is in
place<00:01:52.920> you're<00:01:53.159> going<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.729> two<00:01:54.630> sets<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
place you're going to have two sets of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.289 
place you're going to have two sets of
wire<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:56.070> either<00:01:56.189> side<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.640> your<00:01:56.880> bead<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
wire on either side of your bead and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.270 
wire on either side of your bead and
you're<00:01:57.780> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> push<00:01:58.380> everything<00:01:58.770> towards

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
you're going to push everything towards

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.469 
you're going to push everything towards
the<00:01:59.549> end<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.659> your<00:02:01.020> ID<00:02:01.939> next<00:02:02.939> I'm<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.329> put

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
the end of your ID next I'm going to put

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.059 
the end of your ID next I'm going to put
a<00:02:03.659> bit<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.049> glue<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:05.369> blob<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.329> wire<00:02:07.069> only

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
a bit of glue on this blob of wire only

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.010 
a bit of glue on this blob of wire only
have<00:02:08.220> hot<00:02:08.580> glue<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:09.000> if<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.330> have<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.690> six

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
have hot glue but if you have a six

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.449 
have hot glue but if you have a six
thousand<00:02:10.410> or<00:02:10.590> something<00:02:10.739> similar<00:02:11.310> it's

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
thousand or something similar it's

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.890 
thousand or something similar it's
perfect<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:12.599> I'm<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.140> glue<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
perfect and then I'm going to glue it

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.400 
perfect and then I'm going to glue it
-<00:02:14.530> I'm<00:02:15.370> going<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.670> put<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:16.209> other<00:02:16.599> bead<00:02:16.900> in<00:02:17.110> and

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
- I'm going to put the other bead in and

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.809 
- I'm going to put the other bead in and
I<00:02:17.530> have<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.680> make<00:02:17.890> sure<00:02:18.099> there<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.430> hole<00:02:18.640> big

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
I have to make sure there is a hole big

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.140 
I have to make sure there is a hole big
enough<00:02:18.879> so<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.330> can<00:02:19.560> hide<00:02:20.560> my<00:02:20.769> wire<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.940> now<00:02:22.060> it

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
enough so I can hide my wire so now it

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.880 
enough so I can hide my wire so now it
should<00:02:22.209> look<00:02:22.510> like<00:02:22.569> this<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.500> hardest

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
should look like this and the hardest

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.930 
should look like this and the hardest
part<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.519> done<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.150> can<00:02:25.769> clip<00:02:26.769> my<00:02:27.040> eye<00:02:27.340> pin<00:02:27.760> to

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
part is done I can clip my eye pin to

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.600 
part is done I can clip my eye pin to
size<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.540> then<00:02:28.930> use<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.560> round<00:02:30.220> nose<00:02:30.700> plier<00:02:31.060> to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
size and then use a round nose plier to

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.190 
size and then use a round nose plier to
make<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.640> loop<00:02:34.209> with<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.930> end<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.379> my<00:02:35.799> head<00:02:36.610> pin

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
make a loop with the end of my head pin

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.119 
make a loop with the end of my head pin
alright<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.349> now<00:02:38.470> we<00:02:38.530> are<00:02:38.650> going<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.890> start

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
alright so now we are going to start

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.860 
alright so now we are going to start
with<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.430> legs<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:39.970> it's<00:02:40.150> just<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.450> succession

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
with the legs and it's just a succession

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.990 
with the legs and it's just a succession
of<00:02:41.170> different<00:02:41.560> size<00:02:41.769> beads<00:02:42.129> you<00:02:42.700> can<00:02:42.849> get

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
of different size beads you can get

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.240 
of different size beads you can get
really<00:02:43.180> creative<00:02:43.420> with<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.049> so<00:02:44.349> I<00:02:44.650> did<00:02:44.950> a

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
really creative with this so I did a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.520 
really creative with this so I did a
long<00:02:45.519> bead<00:02:45.760> followed<00:02:46.239> by<00:02:46.450> three<00:02:46.989> smaller

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
long bead followed by three smaller

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.830 
long bead followed by three smaller
glass<00:02:47.829> beads<00:02:48.099> and<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.790> use<00:02:48.940> white<00:02:49.299> green<00:02:49.810> and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
glass beads and I use white green and

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.110 
glass beads and I use white green and
white<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.860> kept<00:02:51.370> on<00:02:51.549> repeating<00:02:51.730> this

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
white and I kept on repeating this

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.380 
white and I kept on repeating this
pattern<00:02:52.540> until<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.380> had<00:02:53.590> five<00:02:53.980> long<00:02:54.250> beads<00:02:54.489> once

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
pattern until I had five long beads once

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.890 
pattern until I had five long beads once
my<00:02:55.660> fifth<00:02:56.049> long<00:02:56.769> bead<00:02:56.980> is<00:02:57.130> on<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.819> am<00:02:58.150> finishing

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
my fifth long bead is on I am finishing

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.520 
my fifth long bead is on I am finishing
it<00:02:59.140> off<00:02:59.290> with<00:02:59.319> one<00:03:00.069> single<00:03:00.610> white<00:03:01.120> bead<00:03:01.500> now<00:03:02.500> I

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
it off with one single white bead now I

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.520 
it off with one single white bead now I
have<00:03:02.920> all<00:03:03.160> my<00:03:03.190> beads<00:03:03.579> in<00:03:03.940> place<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.870> have<00:03:05.319> a

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
have all my beads in place I have a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.100 
have all my beads in place I have a
single<00:03:06.129> white<00:03:06.670> bead<00:03:06.910> at<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.390> end<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:07.930> I'm

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
single white bead at the end and I'm

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.759 
single white bead at the end and I'm
going<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.670> close<00:03:09.670> my<00:03:09.730> wire<00:03:10.239> so<00:03:10.660> with<00:03:11.349> my<00:03:11.500> plier

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
going to close my wire so with my plier

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.190 
going to close my wire so with my plier
I'm<00:03:11.980> going<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.459> bend<00:03:12.879> my<00:03:13.000> wire<00:03:13.329> around<00:03:13.720> the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
I'm going to bend my wire around the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.830 
I'm going to bend my wire around the
white<00:03:15.190> bead<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.670> then<00:03:15.819> I'm<00:03:15.910> going<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.150> wrap

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
white bead and then I'm going to wrap

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.229 
white bead and then I'm going to wrap
this<00:03:17.079> wire<00:03:17.349> around<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:17.980> bead<00:03:18.340> just<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.120> make

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
this wire around that bead just to make

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.090 
this wire around that bead just to make
it<00:03:19.269> extra<00:03:19.450> secure<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.319> could<00:03:20.470> put<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.680> blob<00:03:21.069> of

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
it extra secure you could put a blob of

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.580 
it extra secure you could put a blob of
glue<00:03:21.549> if<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:21.910> wanted<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.450> wear<00:03:22.959> a<00:03:23.019> kinds<00:03:23.530> of

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
glue if you wanted to wear a kinds of

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.770 
glue if you wanted to wear a kinds of
stand<00:03:23.859> on<00:03:23.980> its<00:03:24.130> own<00:03:24.359> but<00:03:25.359> once<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:25.660> have<00:03:25.720> done

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
stand on its own but once you have done

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.319 
stand on its own but once you have done
all<00:03:26.109> your<00:03:26.380> legs<00:03:26.769> that's<00:03:27.130> how<00:03:27.819> it<00:03:27.940> looks<00:03:28.090> like

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
all your legs that's how it looks like

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.259 
all your legs that's how it looks like
so<00:03:28.569> all<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.810> need<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.049> do<00:03:29.200> is<00:03:29.440> shape<00:03:30.130> your<00:03:30.579> legs

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
so all you need to do is shape your legs

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.539 
so all you need to do is shape your legs
to<00:03:31.630> make<00:03:32.139> it<00:03:32.260> look<00:03:32.470> like<00:03:32.650> how<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:32.980> want<00:03:33.400> it

to make it look like how you want it
there<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:34.569> no<00:03:34.720> wrong<00:03:34.930> or<00:03:35.139> right<00:03:35.200> way<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:36.190> could

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
there is no wrong or right way you could

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.000 
there is no wrong or right way you could
be<00:03:36.459> done<00:03:36.609> there<00:03:36.910> if<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.299> wanted<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.870> but<00:03:38.829> if
