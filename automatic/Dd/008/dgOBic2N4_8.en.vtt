00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.010 

now<00:00:24.370> when<00:00:24.580> you<00:00:24.730> install<00:00:25.180> a<00:00:25.210> SIM<00:00:25.510> card<00:00:25.540> there

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
now when you install a SIM card there

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.770 
now when you install a SIM card there
the<00:00:26.860> iPhone<00:00:27.250> does<00:00:27.460> not<00:00:27.640> recognize<00:00:28.210> it<00:00:28.450> it<00:00:28.570> says

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.780

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.650 
the iPhone does not recognize it it says
no<00:00:28.960> sim<00:00:29.640> okay<00:00:30.640> and<00:00:30.760> sometimes<00:00:31.240> for<00:00:31.540> some

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
no sim okay and sometimes for some

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.860 
no sim okay and sometimes for some
iPhones<00:00:32.140> if<00:00:32.380> you<00:00:32.560> press<00:00:32.920> on<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.840> SIM<00:00:34.840> tray

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.690 
iPhones if you press on the SIM tray
hard<00:00:35.440> enough<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:35.980> put<00:00:36.160> some<00:00:36.280> pressure<00:00:36.490> on

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
hard enough and put some pressure on

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.010 
hard enough and put some pressure on
there<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:39.430> may<00:00:39.610> get<00:00:39.850> signal<00:00:40.270> you<00:00:40.390> may<00:00:40.570> not<00:00:40.780> it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
there you may get signal you may not it

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:59.290 
there you may get signal you may not it
depends

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
okay looks like we have no signal so

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.720 
okay looks like we have no signal so

the screen okay so let's get started

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.850 
the screen okay so let's get started
what<00:01:29.660> we're<00:01:29.810> gonna<00:01:29.900> do<00:01:30.140> is<00:01:30.290> basically<00:01:30.440> we're

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
what we're gonna do is basically we're

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.260 
what we're gonna do is basically we're
going<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.130> take<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.520> two<00:01:31.729> screws<00:01:32.030> on<00:01:32.180> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.250 

then<00:01:46.320> we're<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.650> to<00:01:46.740> use<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:48.020> suction<00:01:49.020> cup

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
then we're going to use the suction cup

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.830 
then we're going to use the suction cup
and<00:01:49.500> carefully<00:01:50.280> pull<00:01:50.910> out<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:52.290> screen<00:01:53.630> okay

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
and carefully pull out the screen okay

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.500 
and carefully pull out the screen okay
be<00:01:55.230> careful<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.190> not<00:01:56.220> pull<00:01:56.910> all<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.300> way<00:01:57.330> out

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
be careful to not pull all the way out

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.900 
be careful to not pull all the way out
because<00:01:57.690> there's<00:01:58.200> three<00:01:58.530> cables<00:01:59.040> that

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
because there's three cables that

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.850 
because there's three cables that
connects<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.450> screen<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> logic<00:02:01.590> board

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
connects the screen to the logic board

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.700 
connects the screen to the logic board
so<00:02:02.070> what<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.340> wanted<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> do<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.530> using<00:02:04.530> your

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
cable one two and three from the iPhone

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.940 
cable one two and three from the iPhone
here<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:14.280> one<00:02:14.550> cable<00:02:15.000> one<00:02:15.690> cable<00:02:15.930> two<00:02:16.380> cable

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.280 
here it's one cable one cable two cable
and<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:18.060> here's<00:02:18.300> your<00:02:18.420> third<00:02:18.690> cable<00:02:19.110> which

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and then here's your third cable which

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.340 
and then here's your third cable which
is<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.620> little<00:02:19.920> tiny<00:02:20.360> cable<00:02:21.360> right<00:02:21.540> here<00:02:24.350> you

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
is that little tiny cable right here you

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.580 
is that little tiny cable right here you
have<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.650> lift<00:02:25.890> up<00:02:26.100> on<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.430> little<00:02:26.580> tap<00:02:27.000> here

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
have to lift up on this little tap here

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.980 
have to lift up on this little tap here
so<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.890> could<00:02:29.100> pull<00:02:29.280> out<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.990> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
so that you could pull out this the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.730 
so that you could pull out this the
cable<00:02:31.410> there<00:02:31.620> there<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.700> see<00:02:32.880> carefully

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
cable there there you see carefully

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.420 
cable there there you see carefully
right<00:02:34.740> now<00:02:34.980> here<00:02:35.220> we<00:02:35.280> got<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.550> screen<00:02:37.430> what

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
right now here we got the screen what

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.300 
right now here we got the screen what
happened<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.450> when<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.380> insert<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.100> SIM

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
happened is that when you insert the SIM

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.050 
happened is that when you insert the SIM
card<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.730> there<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:45.510> little<00:02:45.750> pin<00:02:46.140> right<00:02:46.170> here

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
card in there this little pin right here

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.550 
card in there this little pin right here
needs<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.209> be<00:02:48.330> pushed<00:02:48.600> down<00:02:51.050> so<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.200> tells<00:02:52.410> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
needs to be pushed down so it tells the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.090 
needs to be pushed down so it tells the
logic<00:02:52.890> board<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.340> SIM<00:02:53.640> card<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.120> inserted

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
logic board that a SIM card is inserted

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.040 
logic board that a SIM card is inserted
okay<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.160> if<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.700> pin<00:02:57.390> is<00:02:57.540> sitting<00:02:57.870> way<00:02:57.989> too

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
okay so if this pin is sitting way too

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.190 
okay so if this pin is sitting way too
long<00:02:58.470> when<00:02:58.650> your<00:02:58.800> SIM<00:02:59.070> card<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.810> inserted<00:03:00.810> it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
long when your SIM card is inserted it

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.440 
long when your SIM card is inserted it
doesn't<00:03:01.620> touch<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.489> doesn't<00:03:02.820> push<00:03:03.090> this

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
doesn't touch that it doesn't push this

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.890 
doesn't touch that it doesn't push this
little<00:03:04.440> pin<00:03:05.430> here<00:03:05.670> down<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.269> still<00:03:06.540> connects

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
little pin here down it still connects

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.190 
little pin here down it still connects
to<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.320> other<00:03:07.650> pin<00:03:08.220> here<00:03:08.489> which<00:03:08.519> tells<00:03:09.200> the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
to this other pin here which tells the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.990 
to this other pin here which tells the
logic<00:03:10.530> book<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> SIM<00:03:11.310> card<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.730> not

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
logic book that a SIM card is not

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.970 
logic book that a SIM card is not
installed<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:13.080> that's<00:03:13.290> why<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.560> get<00:03:13.830> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
installed and that's why you get the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.699 
installed and that's why you get the
error<00:03:14.220> earlier<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.959> logic<00:03:16.320> board<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.560> not

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
error earlier so the logic board is not

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.650 
error earlier so the logic board is not
going<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.950> read<00:03:17.130> your<00:03:17.280> SIM<00:03:17.489> card<00:03:17.570> what<00:03:18.570> we

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
going to read your SIM card what we

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.000 
going to read your SIM card what we
could<00:03:18.810> do<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.049> we<00:03:19.200> could<00:03:19.320> use<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.530> flathead

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
could do is we could use a flathead

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.740 
could do is we could use a flathead
scoop<00:03:20.430> Phillips<00:03:23.060> screwdriver<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.420> what<00:03:24.660> we

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
scoop Phillips screwdriver and what we

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.360 
scoop Phillips screwdriver and what we
need<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:24.989> do<00:03:25.140> is<00:03:25.320> basically<00:03:25.470> we<00:03:25.920> just<00:03:26.100> need<00:03:26.250> to

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
need to do is basically we just need to

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.120 
need to do is basically we just need to
push<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.790> on<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.060> little<00:03:27.299> pin<00:03:27.660> head<00:03:28.130> be

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
push it on this little pin head be

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:38.720 
push it on this little pin head be
careful<00:03:29.160> not<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.700> break<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.030> off

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.880 

we<00:03:39.270> need<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.599> push<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.020> high<00:03:40.230> enough<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.770> it

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
we need to push it high enough so it

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.510 
we need to push it high enough so it
sits<00:03:41.310> up<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.300> little<00:03:42.569> bit<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:42.989> when<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.520> insert

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
sits up a little bit so when you insert

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.870 
sits up a little bit so when you insert
the<00:03:44.700> SIM<00:03:45.030> card<00:03:45.060> in<00:03:45.599> it<00:03:49.099> will<00:03:50.099> push<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.520> little

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
the SIM card in it will push this little

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:02.210 
the SIM card in it will push this little
pin<00:03:51.090> down

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:12.089 

just<00:04:02.910> like<00:04:03.090> that

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.180 

okay<00:04:13.099> hopefully<00:04:14.319> that<00:04:15.319> did<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.680> trick

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
okay hopefully that did the trick

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.050 
okay hopefully that did the trick
um<00:04:16.459> so<00:04:16.760> I'm<00:04:16.820> gonna<00:04:16.910> just<00:04:17.209> see<00:04:17.389> if<00:04:17.510> that's<00:04:17.750> gonna

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
um so I'm gonna just see if that's gonna

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.750 
um so I'm gonna just see if that's gonna
push<00:04:20.060> down<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.389> pit<00:04:20.600> or<00:04:20.750> not<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:22.550> looks

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
push down the pit or not and it looks

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.830 
push down the pit or not and it looks
like<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:24.320> will<00:04:24.820> if<00:04:25.820> you<00:04:25.970> can<00:04:26.150> see<00:04:26.330> here<00:04:26.600> right

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
like it will if you can see here right

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.860 
like it will if you can see here right
here<00:04:27.669> then<00:04:28.669> when<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:29.030> push<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.419> sim<00:04:29.840> card

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
here then when you push the sim card

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.920 
here then when you push the sim card
down<00:04:30.290> there<00:04:31.280> is<00:04:31.520> a<00:04:31.550> little<00:04:31.820> gap<00:04:32.150> between<00:04:32.419> this

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
down there is a little gap between this

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.980 
down there is a little gap between this
pin<00:04:33.290> here<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.949> other<00:04:34.190> one<00:04:34.520> okay<00:04:35.090> so<00:04:35.810> when

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
pin here and the other one okay so when

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.230 
pin here and the other one okay so when
you<00:04:36.110> pit<00:04:36.350> you<00:04:36.860> say<00:04:37.070> syringe<00:04:37.400> kart<00:04:37.669> race<00:04:37.940> comes

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
you pit you say syringe kart race comes

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.879 
you pit you say syringe kart race comes
down<00:04:38.510> if<00:04:38.810> you<00:04:38.930> can<00:04:39.110> see<00:04:39.260> a<00:04:39.290> little<00:04:39.500> gap<00:04:39.860> in

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
down if you can see a little gap in

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.980 
down if you can see a little gap in
between<00:04:40.460> this<00:04:40.610> one<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:40.940> that<00:04:41.120> pin<00:04:41.540> that<00:04:41.840> it

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
between this one and that pin that it

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.469 
between this one and that pin that it
won't<00:04:42.169> work<00:04:43.030> if<00:04:44.030> you<00:04:44.300> still<00:04:46.030> see<00:04:47.030> that<00:04:47.210> when

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
won't work if you still see that when

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.480 
won't work if you still see that when
you<00:04:47.750> insert<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.169> pin<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:48.620> SIM<00:04:48.889> card<00:04:48.919> in<00:04:49.310> there

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
you insert the pin a SIM card in there

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.060 
you insert the pin a SIM card in there
these<00:04:50.419> pin<00:04:50.870> are<00:04:51.080> still<00:04:51.260> touching<00:04:51.800> that<00:04:51.949> it

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
these pin are still touching that it

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.760 
these pin are still touching that it
does<00:04:52.220> not<00:04:52.460> work<00:04:52.870> okay<00:04:53.870> so<00:04:53.930> when<00:04:54.229> the<00:04:54.530> one<00:04:54.650> the

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
does not work okay so when the one the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.969 
does not work okay so when the one the
sim<00:04:55.039> is<00:04:55.280> pushed<00:04:55.760> down<00:04:56.120> it<00:04:56.960> needs<00:04:57.169> to<00:04:57.350> push<00:04:57.740> on

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
sim is pushed down it needs to push on

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.740 
sim is pushed down it needs to push on
this<00:04:58.130> little<00:04:58.340> thing<00:04:58.669> so<00:04:59.120> that<00:04:59.270> you<00:04:59.300> disconnect

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
this little thing so that you disconnect

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.529 
this little thing so that you disconnect
from<00:04:59.990> the<00:05:00.260> other<00:05:00.500> one<00:05:01.120> which<00:05:02.120> we<00:05:02.330> taught<00:05:02.510> a

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
from the other one which we taught a

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.210 
from the other one which we taught a
logic<00:05:02.930> board<00:05:03.139> that<00:05:03.320> the<00:05:03.500> sim<00:05:03.770> card<00:05:03.800> is

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
logic board that the sim card is

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.700 
logic board that the sim card is
inserted<00:05:04.760> in<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.830> trade<00:05:06.830> okay<00:05:08.320> all<00:05:09.320> right<00:05:09.470> so

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
inserted in the trade okay all right so

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.650 
inserted in the trade okay all right so
let's<00:05:09.860> see<00:05:10.010> if<00:05:10.070> that's<00:05:10.280> gonna<00:05:10.520> do<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.330> trick

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
let's see if that's gonna do the trick

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.850 
let's see if that's gonna do the trick
for<00:05:11.690> us<00:05:12.789> so<00:05:13.789> what<00:05:14.000> we're<00:05:14.120> gonna<00:05:14.180> do<00:05:14.479> is<00:05:14.860> we're

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
for us so what we're gonna do is we're

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.830 
for us so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:05:15.950> insert<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.849> screen<00:05:17.150> back<00:05:17.330> on<00:05:17.599> there

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
gonna insert the screen back on there

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.839 
gonna insert the screen back on there
the<00:05:18.229> first<00:05:18.470> thing<00:05:18.650> is<00:05:18.800> there's<00:05:19.070> these<00:05:19.580> three

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
the first thing is there's these three

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.230 
the first thing is there's these three
cable<00:05:20.889> alright<00:05:21.889> there's<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.340> smaller<00:05:22.970> one

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
cable alright there's the smaller one

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.800 
cable alright there's the smaller one
here<00:05:23.570> which<00:05:23.900> is<00:05:24.050> number<00:05:24.320> one<00:05:25.190> two<00:05:25.460> and<00:05:25.789> one<00:05:26.750> two

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
here which is number one two and one two

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.279 
here which is number one two and one two
one<00:05:27.710> one<00:05:28.190> two<00:05:28.460> and<00:05:29.240> three<00:05:29.690> all<00:05:29.870> right<00:05:29.930> so<00:05:30.169> we're

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
one one two and three all right so we're

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.250 
one one two and three all right so we're
gonna<00:05:30.349> put<00:05:30.650> this<00:05:30.800> little<00:05:31.130> one<00:05:31.400> here<00:05:31.610> first

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
gonna put this little one here first

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.620 
gonna put this little one here first
into<00:05:33.260> this<00:05:33.440> slot<00:05:33.919> right<00:05:34.160> there<00:05:34.330> and<00:05:35.330> then<00:05:35.510> the

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
into this slot right there and then the

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.480 
into this slot right there and then the
second<00:05:36.080> one<00:05:36.260> into<00:05:36.530> this<00:05:36.710> one<00:05:37.039> and<00:05:37.280> then<00:05:37.370> the

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
second one into this one and then the

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.580 
second one into this one and then the
third<00:05:38.110> into<00:05:39.110> that<00:05:39.320> other<00:05:40.180> slot<00:05:41.180> there<00:05:41.449> okay<00:05:41.810> so

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
third into that other slot there okay so
