00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Welcome to the test review 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.790
 and my god are cool this time 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.770
 play at the start 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.360
 There is guaranteed something for everyone 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.000
 for city planners for hunters for fans 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.650
 Wacky in the games for players 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.410
 who like to be in a beautiful 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.180
 lose the world and for all those at 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:31.410
 Assassin's always creed the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:33.239
 wanted to change sides in assassin's 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.340
 creed rock you're going to the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.140
 templar about a big difference 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.120
 But does not the rock takes place 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.800
 almost like Assassin's creed black 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.629
 flag this is not necessarily 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.579
 negative to understand because that 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.739
 pirate adventure is true for many 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.200
 all because of the cool sea battles as 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.969
 one of the best serial parts a few 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.070
 We would still have more innovations 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.270
 you also wanted to have the technology 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.730
 make light cuts 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.760
 rock is already in november 2014 for the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.199
 ps3 and the xbox 360 appeared and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.809
 based on the same engine as 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.430
 black flag assassin's creed unity looks 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.770
 because in comparison so much prettier 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.290
 but also has more technical problems 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.290
 Under the dash are 83 evaluation points 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.160
 Well, mexes is the right city 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.180
 skylines is a near perfect 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.680
 become urban development simulation 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.390
 This is not tricked but that 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.730
 live our city residents really 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.350
 nevertheless, the game remains very simulated 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.030
 accessible to a normal city 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.010
 pulling up is not really 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.350
 So everything is too easy 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.970
 no, because there is always something to do 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.710
 optimize to improve 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.780
 a really big city needs too 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.650
 care so much what should you do 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.160
 still say big 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:51.290
 awesome game has 88 points 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.000
 anyone out there over 18 years old 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.400
 the first hotline miami still not part 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.260
 played then catch up immediately 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.420
 First, because it's a great game 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.610
 and secondly, the second part was in 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.710
 things story and difficulty there 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.600
 continue where the first one left off 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.850
 unfortunately miami has reached two 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.860
 not quite the quality of the predecessor 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.050
 and that although it is significantly more profound 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.730
 And complexity is precisely why 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.860
 is also something of the flow 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.870
 lost one in the first part so 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.640
 this has now driven him to drive 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.769
 Vishivashi was the best one to read 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.989
 test by colleague Dimitri who explains 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.920
 detailed and awards in the end just 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.920
 80 points 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.390
 since the first trailer I almost went to 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.370
 I was curious if 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.720
 oriental one in case this quality 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.840
 can really hold 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.730
 the short answer yes it can with his 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.410
 beautiful graphic style manages that 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.690
 jump'n'run an incredible amount of emotions 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.550
 to bring over that is really great 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.470
 but that too is the real game 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.630
 fully convinced the mixture 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.180
 Exploring puzzles and jumping fast 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.070
 lay is wonderful on surprised 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.810
 us the high degree of difficulty of the but 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.770
 good by the fair storage system 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.200
 is caught 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:09.900
 audi has his 88 points 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:11.670
 well deserved fell asleep now comes 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.350
 stark break from the emotional 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.110
 platformer we come to the simple 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.330
 zombie slaughter in zombie army trilogy 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.370
 we are fighting surprise against one 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.020
 Zombie Army With The Hitler The Turn In The 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.120
 wants to bring about a second world war 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.160
 the gameplay is as simple as the gameplay 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.020
 story we fight through linear 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.130
 level and shoot waves of undead 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.630
 back to the grave 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.190
 the relationship to sniper elite 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.770
 we recognize the brutal 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.470
 X-ray camera the good hits bloody in 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.720
 scene sets zombie army contains trilogy 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.490
 for pc players but only five new levels 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.440
 the others come from two already 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.850
 appeared to the predecessors individually 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.890
 Buy there are new sections 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.690
 Unfortunately that is not annoying for 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.790
 some time and especially in co- op mode 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.420
 You can be good at zombie hunting 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.070
 amuse 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.070
 we allocate 70 points
