00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
playing to rebuild and it works like

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.530

for<00:00:15.780> materials<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.560> then<00:00:16.680> use<00:00:17.070> those

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
for materials and then use those

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.340 
for materials and then use those
materials<00:00:18.199> to<00:00:19.199> build<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.770> way<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:19.980> want<00:00:20.369> and

for these people you will need to you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.340 
for these people you will need to you
can<00:01:13.880> plant<00:01:14.120> food<00:01:14.420> water<00:01:15.260> and<00:01:16.240> even<00:01:17.350> power

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
can plant food water and even power

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.359 
can plant food water and even power
generators<00:01:20.140> alright<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.680> generators

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
generators alright so the generators

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.790 
generators alright so the generators
will<00:01:22.760> power<00:01:23.000> things<00:01:23.660> through<00:01:23.990> switches<00:01:24.530> that

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
will power things through switches that

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.219 
will power things through switches that
require<00:01:25.160> power<00:01:25.400> lights<00:01:26.119> and<00:01:26.390> other<00:01:26.510> items<00:01:26.780> and

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
require power lights and other items and

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.740 
require power lights and other items and
then<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:27.830> run<00:01:28.070> wires<00:01:28.369> that<00:01:29.060> connect<00:01:29.450> them<00:01:29.600> all

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
then you run wires that connect them all

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.270 
then you run wires that connect them all
and<00:01:29.990> again<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:30.920> just<00:01:31.430> works<00:01:33.010> you<00:01:34.010> can<00:01:34.130> also

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
and again it just works you can also

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.609 
and again it just works you can also
build<00:01:34.550> your<00:01:34.760> own<00:01:34.790> terminals<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:36.050> hook<00:01:36.380> to

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
build your own terminals that hook to

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.760 
build your own terminals that hook to
this<00:01:36.800> power<00:01:37.280> grid<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:37.940> then<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.119> can<00:01:38.270> control

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
this power grid and then you can control

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.980 
this power grid and then you can control
the<00:01:39.770> various<00:01:40.220> things<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.670> tweak<00:01:40.970> them<00:01:41.240> all

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
the various things and tweak them all

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.670 
the various things and tweak them all
that<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.040> power<00:01:43.250> lines<00:01:43.610> are<00:01:43.729> connected<00:01:44.180> to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:59.820 

this<00:01:48.460> includes<00:01:48.850> things<00:01:49.090> like<00:01:49.240> turrets

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.820 

because<00:02:00.830> you<00:02:00.950> do<00:02:01.100> want<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.400> build<00:02:01.580> defenses

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
because you do want to build defenses

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.109 
because you do want to build defenses
because<00:02:03.830> your<00:02:04.010> settlements<00:02:04.520> can<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.000> will

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
because your settlements can and will

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:20.290 
because your settlements can and will
get<00:02:05.300> attacked<00:02:05.570> by<00:02:06.470> Raiders

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.880 

so<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.540> fun<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.050> build<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.500> something

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
so it's fun to build up something

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.500 
so it's fun to build up something
yourself<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.610> game<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.819> usually<00:02:24.360> you'll
