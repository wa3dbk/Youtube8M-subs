00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.540
 my attitude to batman has always been 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.400
 uneasy being suckers like everything 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.650
 the rest of the post-Soviet children adored 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.510
 spiderman and ninja turtles pro 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.580
 human bat though I knew but 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.500
 for some reason I don't take it seriously 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.570
 could i even had a cassette with 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.020
 cartoon batman vs riza or like 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.030
 so 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.280
 I really liked the cartoon but not even 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.810
 because of batman because of the cutter itself is very 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.730
 he seemed to me an unusual character 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.400
 who loved to roam in public with 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.320
 polar bears 40 plus to everything on 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.300
 dandy I had the strength of a favorite game 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.430
 by batman in which I ditched none 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.980
 day of my life but on this somehow everything 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.930
 stopped batman me absolutely not 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.500
 interested until I met 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.450
 comics 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.070
 batman there was very serious 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.990
 dramatic character with a difficult 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.640
 fate problems happily and just 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.829
 was at that age when I could have it all 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.900
 ok perceive and batman hit 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.310
 my mind as one of the best and 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.239
 charismatic characters in the story 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.829
 of humanity 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.720
 this honorary title was reinforced 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.730
 more or less fresh full length toons 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.710
 in which there was noir and drama and other 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.540
 things that I love very much and of course 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.550
 I was delighted when the first game came out 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.979
 arch mask series arkham sl 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.659
 she was grim serious with great 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.640
 plot and characters that lay in 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.340
 counterbalance those games about batman who 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.140
 went out to arkham especially wait who 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.700
 once bought for 70 rubles in which 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.290
 it was necessary not to save the world like me 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.720
 counted avkeriev umbrellas 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.640
 it was the biggest on my yoga 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.650
 short life and all the same as 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.049
 no matter how good and a variety commissar with 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.210
 bacon I play it was quite difficult 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.860
 the gameplay was too split 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.840
 whether we are separate 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.880
 jumped then expensive then decided 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.710
 the puzzle then fought again 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.119
 jumped again decided for me this 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.740
 looked through chur zonal 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.080
 consistently therefore every 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.850
 half an hour of the game did not get terribly boring 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.400
 I had even the threat of arkham asylum 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.140
 more than a month to pass it of course 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.640
 did you leave is not entirely positive 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.530
 imprint which remained in arkham 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.390
 city where it was absolutely the same 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.009
 only on a large scale I want 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.540
 say that these two games are not for me 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.610
 did not like but they were for me 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.200
 too tedious though if viewed 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.810
 in general, I understand that such games were 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.489
 they are very good to me at least not once 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.680
 pity and not allowed to ask extra 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.810
 questions but arkham origin annoying 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.400
 just as if I was tearing a burr then 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.900
 while sitting next to Mizulina 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.300
 scribble both on foam with nails 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.069
 although I expected this origin days did 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.870
 inclined Orthodox Rocks and some 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.610
 left developers whose names i 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.470
 already forgot origin judging from the title 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.269
 will tell us about the cancellation which 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.780
 just got on the path of justice 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.000
 hairs 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.650
 very few people know about him or consider it ridiculous 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.519
 urban legend and here here 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.800
 first puncture 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.900
 what batman and sarcoma whole what batman from 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.760
 origin he equally distributes to all people 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.950
 use the same gadgets some 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.959
 of which work even better and kills 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.220
 information from criminals verified and 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.110
 safe methods 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.120
 no mistakes no wrong decisions 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.220
 for which you can suffer for a long time 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.970
 we don't have everything under control because 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.010
 we are padma 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.660
 Do you know why I find fault with this ? 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.970
 because there is a wonderful cartoon 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.769
 batman year 1 where batman is also only 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.019
 begins to be the enemy of criminal gotham 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.849
 at the same time look like everything is shown 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.290
 we were told how he decided to fight 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.849
 crime showed how he first 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.799
 prevented thugs like 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.690
 met commissioner gordon and how 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.010
 makes mistake after mistake constantly 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.470
 drawing conclusions from the consequences 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.420
 if it's in the game as I said no 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.739
 it feels like the blues warrior invented 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.230
 time machine is back in time 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.209
 seriously no change therefore 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.980
 mechanics remained the same and new 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.840
 developers not only did not get rid of 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.519
 stupid flaws but also added new ones 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.040
 for example batman is still helpless 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.840
 in front of the plywood wall we were shown 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.440
 it breaks down the guy strong bits 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.269
 and chairs 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.760
 he raises criminals with one hand for 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.829
 throat about imprints enemies texture 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.200
 him eventually super strong suit 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.420
 but he can't break the plywood wall 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.950
 only blow it up with spray it annoyed and 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.109
 past games but here for some reason 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.120
 seems particularly wild spray why have 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.769
 batman that inferiority complex and 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.600
 so he should take any step to the wall 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.010
 which was on the spectrum of keinan chewing gum 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.380
 draw a bat and blast and and 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.269
 Apparently therefore not an estimated artist here 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.459
 now takes out the evil on plywood or 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.650
 for example hook-cat why for one piece 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.260
 the roof can cling to another the same 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.609
 but where is the cache can not I understand 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.620
 what the developers didn't want to create 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.180
 easy ways for the player forcing the class 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.040
 by sewer instead of just 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.230
 cling to the roof but not the same 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.120
 silly ways oh well cersei with 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.739
 the cat here completely spoiled bosses 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.109
 know how to fight them 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.920
 through an endless series of repetitive 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.440
 quicktime avi 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.120
 some stretch for 10 15 minutes 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.670
 while the complexity of bosses boss jump 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.710
 just incredible jumping if croca 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.150
 the killer to shower with barrels was easy then 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.100
 against destro accounted for 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.810
 for 20 minutes be attentive 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.880
 to fend off his next blow at 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.680
 this you can stand still hair 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.150
 yourself coming to you and starts to beat and 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.130
 you just need to press a couple of buttons 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.470
 then to push them another hundred times only 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.250
 in beautiful angles and so with almost all 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.870
 opponents 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.700
 they only look different on 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.520
 killed is always the same click on 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.260
 button and get about the movie and gotem us 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.930
 promised an open city which is somewhat 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.760
 times the arkham city and what I see is 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.680
 and there are areas of arkham city which 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.450
 sprinkled with snow and added a couple of hundred 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.520
 square meters of territory with about 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.500
 most arkham city where ozone live 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.360
 only criminals have no hint 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.890
 nobody created walls nobody 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.270
 dumped all criminals in one place 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.520
 but at the same time walking around the city 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.560
 no bandits only 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.390
 commoners even homeless people there is no such 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.980
 the feeling that all criminals are already 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.330
 were together initially nobody them in 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.860
 separate reservations with walls not 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.960
 drove at this city constantly 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.940
 there are some crimes but 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.040
 nobody steals purses nobody kills 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.560
 and do not rape nobody rob banks no 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.480
 hold hostage children no crime 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.760
 is that a dozen gangsters 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.260
 stand on the site to discuss the weather and you 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.400
 need to brazenly interrupt civilized 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.800
 conversation because it can break 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.140
 calm gotham developers you 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.730
 seriously in and gave us so much territory 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.140
 but did not come up with anything better than 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.330
 by on arrange gangsters from the past 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.520
 parts it is illogical clear thing that 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.170
 to explore the city there is no desire even 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.820
 Christmas atmosphere which time 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.100
 the action of the game does not save 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.650
 the truth is in the game and pluses more precisely he 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.850
 one this is a plot 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.860
 as simple as it seems at first glance 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.690
 and it has a couple of good 3 becoming in 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.700
 Christmas night black mask started 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.560
 something ominous to there all sorts of batman 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.000
 he did not interfere he hires 8 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.740
 high-class mercenaries to those 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.750
 eliminated the horror of flying on the wings of the night 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.950
 for this fighter not only accounted for 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.840
 one night deal with all this 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.790
 criminal katavasii but just 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.980
 try to survive plus everything else 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.900
 in the game appeared multiplayer yes yes I 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.000
 now I shove anywhere 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.920
 quite cheerfully you can play for a hero 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.270
 type batman and robin all things and cut down 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.490
 other players who take over 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.840
 criminal roles or play for the same 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.850
 criminals form a shooter from the third 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.540
 face grab points kill 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.890
 criminals from other gangs from 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.300
 woman so that you do not hang for 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.520
 counters for the next gargoyle 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.990
 multiplayer may be good but the problem is
