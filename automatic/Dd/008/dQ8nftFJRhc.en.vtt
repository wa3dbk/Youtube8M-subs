hi you guys so I'm here and I decided to
make<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.889> new<00:00:08.130> video<00:00:08.340> it's<00:00:09.269> been<00:00:09.389> quite<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.660> while

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
make a new video it's been quite a while

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.720 
make a new video it's been quite a while
since<00:00:09.870> I've<00:00:10.200> made<00:00:10.230> one<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.219> won't<00:00:11.429> even<00:00:11.580> go

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
since I've made one and I won't even go

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.680 
since I've made one and I won't even go
into<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:13.200> reasons<00:00:13.940> why<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:14.969> haven't<00:00:15.360> well

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
into the reasons why I haven't well

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.120 
into the reasons why I haven't well
actually<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.080> will<00:00:16.320> because<00:00:16.680> one<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
actually I will because one of the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.269 
actually I will because one of the
reasons<00:00:17.520> was<00:00:18.270> because<00:00:18.440> my<00:00:19.440> last<00:00:19.679> and<00:00:20.010> thought

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
reasons was because my last and thought

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.800 
reasons was because my last and thought
I<00:00:20.519> really<00:00:20.699> didn't<00:00:21.000> like<00:00:21.179> I<00:00:21.390> had<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> lot<00:00:21.750> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
I really didn't like I had a lot of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.910 
I really didn't like I had a lot of
issues<00:00:22.019> with<00:00:22.650> it

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
issues with it

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.460 
issues with it
it<00:00:23.099> wasn't<00:00:23.460> sewn<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.849> very<00:00:24.119> well<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.199> didn't

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
it wasn't sewn in very well so I didn't

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.189 
it wasn't sewn in very well so I didn't
really<00:00:25.650> want<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.160> bash<00:00:28.640> in<00:00:29.640> dear<00:00:29.910> Emmys<00:00:30.240> as<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
really want to bash in dear Emmys as a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.720 
really want to bash in dear Emmys as a
company<00:00:31.679> because<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.099> think<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.580> could

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
company because I think that it could

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.190 
company because I think that it could
have<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:32.850> been<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.330> bad<00:00:33.450> batch<00:00:33.750> because<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.050> had

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
have just been a bad batch because I had

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.979 
have just been a bad batch because I had
a<00:00:34.230> lot<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.410> shedding<00:00:35.420> but<00:00:36.420> I've<00:00:36.539> never<00:00:36.750> had

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
a lot of shedding but I've never had

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.680 
a lot of shedding but I've never had
really<00:00:37.500> too<00:00:37.739> much<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.160> an<00:00:38.280> issue<00:00:38.399> before<00:00:41.660> yeah

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
deep ocean wave so it doesn't really

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.070
