00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
really simple just kind of

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.770 
really simple just kind of
purpose-driven<00:00:58.410> yeah<00:00:59.239> called<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> ripcord

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
purpose-driven yeah called the ripcord

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.590 
purpose-driven yeah called the ripcord
and<00:01:01.020> basically<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> way<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.770> works<00:01:01.949> is

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
and basically the way it works is

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.370 
and basically the way it works is
tethered<00:01:03.600> into<00:01:04.229> your<00:01:04.949> belt<00:01:05.909> line<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.420> stand<00:01:07.200> up

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and so I'm gonna sit down basically so

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.420 
and so I'm gonna sit down basically so
basically<00:01:11.659> we're<00:01:12.659> inside<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> waistband<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
basically we're inside the waistband and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.630 
basically we're inside the waistband and
what's<00:01:14.700> cool<00:01:14.880> about<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.869> draw

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
what's cool about this is as you draw

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.940 
what's cool about this is as you draw
the<00:01:17.640> knife<00:01:17.850> clears<00:01:18.360> Madhi<00:01:19.020> before<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> clears

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the knife clears Madhi before it clears

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.210 
the knife clears Madhi before it clears
the<00:01:20.130> sheet<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> deal<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.320> inside

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the sheet so when you deal with inside

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.310 
the sheet so when you deal with inside
the<00:01:23.369> waistband<00:01:23.790> stuff<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> lot<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.360> times<00:01:24.600> we

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the waistband stuff a lot of times we

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.600 
the waistband stuff a lot of times we
sheathing<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> an<00:01:26.009> issue<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.369> you're

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
sheathing is an issue because you're

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.130 
sheathing is an issue because you're
digging<00:01:26.880> around<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.540> inside<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:27.990> belt

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
line with this it's more like a Japanese

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.810 
line with this it's more like a Japanese
saya<00:01:30.630> you're<00:01:31.500> able<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:31.920> easily

saya you're able to really easily

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.149 
saya you're able to really easily
another<00:01:33.420> cool<00:01:33.720> aspect<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:35.070> you

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
another cool aspect of it is if you

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.999 
another cool aspect of it is if you

design ideas found a problem so like
this<00:03:32.650> night<00:03:32.859> specifically<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:33.519> actually

that<00:03:37.989> I've<00:03:38.079> trained<00:03:38.409> in<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.980> way<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.519> I<00:03:39.579> look

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
that I've trained in the way that I look

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.640 
that I've trained in the way that I look
at<00:03:39.849> knives<00:03:40.030> is<00:03:40.239> is<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:41.379> know<00:03:41.470> it's<00:03:41.590> the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
at knives is is you know it's the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.199 
at knives is is you know it's the
nightly<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.129> wanyan<00:03:42.549> it's<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.790> nice<00:03:42.970> and

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
nightly that wanyan it's a nice and

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.569 
nightly that wanyan it's a nice and
really<00:03:44.079> we<00:03:44.230> use<00:03:44.349> are<00:03:44.439> not<00:03:44.470> an<00:03:44.829> orphan<00:03:44.980> utility

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
really we use are not an orphan utility

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.430 
really we use are not an orphan utility
than<00:03:45.730> anything<00:03:45.940> else<00:03:46.180> about<00:03:46.540> finally<00:03:47.109> it

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
than anything else about finally it

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.140 
than anything else about finally it
again<00:03:47.829> it's<00:03:48.010> an<00:03:48.099> application<00:03:48.280> that<00:03:48.879> hook<00:03:49.030> the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
again it's an application that hook the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.699 
again it's an application that hook the
tool<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.780> way<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.049> it's<00:03:50.200> carried<00:03:50.530> it's

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
tool and the way that it's carried it's

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.339 
tool and the way that it's carried it's
been<00:03:50.829> through<00:03:51.010> system<00:03:51.459> right<00:03:51.879> so<00:03:52.690> I've<00:03:53.049> always

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349

been through system right so I've always
liked<00:03:53.470> Japanese<00:03:53.920> design<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:54.970> really<00:03:55.690> what

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
liked Japanese design and really what

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.140 
liked Japanese design and really what
they've<00:03:56.200> made<00:03:56.409> over<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.739> years<00:03:56.769> works<00:03:57.159> so<00:03:57.790> you
