00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello to all youtube friends 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.189
 so talk about dario Mantovani and in this 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:14.880
 video I will show you the de profile 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:16.890
 denunciation infernos show you book 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 we file a laudable fortune tern 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.710
 maso card of the deck we say triple 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.560
 necromante the well-known patron patron 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.119
 very strong mirage like never two or not 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.399
 three 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.079
 because two are three are too heavy 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.210
 there are heavy ok double avenger 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.110
 you will have to work hard from the bunch we approach 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.770
 in the glass because it can search for you 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.809
 sell it 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.610
 then a guardian when you no longer have one 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.950
 nothing and just party equal with this is 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:58.450
 much more expensive usually especially 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:01.990
 perfect or and spells counting time is 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.449
 fundamental because they are many cards that 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.270
 catch the balls at the bat then double po 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.320
 thesis usually the use of me almost comes 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.120
 always first hand and when you have 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.390
 well so why do heroes because 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.060
 is right then unfortunately I will not leave 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.060
 otherwise they would be 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.860
 and fortissimo then we see this card 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.439
 athens then this one makes you then 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.659
 all the monsters that with all very damon 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.619
 and above all it makes him earn 500 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:43.700
 five hundred then makes you not to show us 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:45.530
 damon and then and then and then you do 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.060
 play show us diamone with the same 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.700
 level of the target monster 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.119
 and therefore he himself at the end of 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.459
 land 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.950
 I'll let you take a break in 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:59.959
 the strongest one right then in my opinion 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.959
 a formal one that you make you do especially 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:09.739
 by way of radius that brings zeromax of 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:12.049
 usually there is typhoid core special monster 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.390
 for example necromante if you don't have it 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:17.360
 but it is not made to mention a 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:23.570
 example eh oh well from the fundamental neck 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:26.150
 and mouth then bayern triple traps if 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.829
 does not comment that is, it fails does you 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.769
 to do second tivano then there were just 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:34.220
 made the triple hell leap that makes you 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.660
 starting ie discarding two intents and ti 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.940
 find the combination of the cemetery 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.900
 I have to make a fracture because in my opinion 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.240
 3 there is not enough discount is a type 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:52.310
 of the arcs weak poles 500 lp special da 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:55.680
 cd with compulsory a solemn mirror to the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:01.590
 212 traps are used for which the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:06.770
 combination I'm doing a plant then 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.420
 extras will remember the 108 very strong 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.540
 doubt damn dragon eternal damon a 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.680
 rock en stardust can have any 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.990
 they were weak 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.600
 this thing making a return and team 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.670
 battle the effect and exchange the 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.580
 table of wounded most of all show e 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.610
 neglect them then black trays 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.790
 against some decks that certainly do 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.700
 damage will continually go through the vote 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.610
 very good because it is a magic one 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.370
 trap to beirut son greider fortissimo 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.760
 the fog boom as sapwood does 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.520
 with two embankments I sometimes fly 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.910
 happen to arch in the piers and avenger 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.070
 there and bounces 30 then ok, sergeant 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.270
 stephen who holds the place of the master 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:04:00.250
 however provide for wrapped armory weapons e 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:02.050
 then Monday air is a note and will never have 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.760
 the goal that cheers to look for example at 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.170
 chile moment the mind at the beginning so 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.170
 there's the next round 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.480
 expulsion is a moment later this bag 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.380
 file the channel of you close a nice one 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.530
 so much so that once seven teams 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.170
 belfiore and davide much more from file 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.710
 of the real is on vacation to the beautiful
