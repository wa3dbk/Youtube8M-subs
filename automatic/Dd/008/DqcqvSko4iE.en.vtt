00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:11.790
 I did it this time too 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.920
 Clicker diy special feature this time 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:22.380
 It is tire exchange edition Tire space is basic ki so everyone 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:26.220
 Please watch this video with Yoko who shakes me and you will learn too 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.780
 Well then first I would like to check the size of the tire 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:37.120
 It's more and more people to buy a tire in the communications sales recently and would mistake this size 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:42.520
 Please note that you will not get in the car, so first check the size of the tire 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 I think that seal on the inside of the driver's seat are stuck 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:53.140
 The tire size is written here, but it is here 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.670
 It is marked as 18 inches of 21545 and 17 inches of No. 215, but this is a car 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.820
 By new blade 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.829
 By car grade 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:06.360
 Please check the current car in this case because the size may be different 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.360
 Let's check the current car 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.150
 Yes of this Daan 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:22.100
 There is madness outside this, but this is 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:26.710
 Please be careful to buy a tire of this size because it is 18 of 21545 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.710
 Then, indication of the first change time of the tire 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.920
 I would like to explain 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.140
 On the tire 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.970
 Always outside 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:44.909
 I think that the arrow mark or triangle mark is attached 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:51.300
 This car has a so- called slip sign in the place where this arrow mark is attached 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:57.480
 Do you understand the burden and the groove of Masuko that this Chitchi baggage has been pot 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:01.800
 There is this, but this is a slip sign This groove as to what this is 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 Well, I think the current condition is visible I think that there is a groove and a slip sign is visible 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:11.319
 However, when I 'm out of here, I 'm approaching this slip 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:17.450
 Will sign Tteyuu'm soon dangerous When is there is no individual step 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:22.890
 Please be sure to always check here regularly because it is 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:28.569
 Recently, there is also a handy thing called this tire wear system 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:31.959
 I sell it and say what kind of thing is this groove of this tire 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:36.240
 You can measure how much you have 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.660
 I'm going to scale, but in this case together 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:45.150
 You're moving money, so it's in line 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.590
 In this place where this zero is shown You can always see here or there is an arrow 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.730
 Is now 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:57.150
 There are approximately 4 mm to 5 mm, so this 0-1 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:59.650
 This is like this safety warning danger, but in the blue safe place 0 is 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:06.909
 This tire is safe because it is coming 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.989
 The air pressure is written next to the size of the tire just before it can be confirmed. 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:14.680
 There is 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:19.670
 Please be sure to check here because the notation may differ in this way between Zenrin and the rear wheel 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.960
 Let's measure the air pressure actually using this air gauge 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:28.680
 I would like 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.680
 Remove the air valve attached to the inside of this wheel 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.210
 Together 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.100
 And this 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.100
 It fits in the the air gauge 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:46.020
 There is no air leak and there is an arrow here 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:49.660
 8 Can you see it 210 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:56.250
 I think it is about 220 or so 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.250
 As this car Foley was 220, it becomes the standard value of safety
