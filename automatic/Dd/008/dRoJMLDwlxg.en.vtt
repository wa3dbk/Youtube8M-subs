then<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.910> hook<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.180> ground<00:02:36.450> wire<00:02:36.720> into<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
then you hook the ground wire into the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:48.229 
then you hook the ground wire into the
back<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.610> new<00:02:44.819> one<00:02:47.030> circle<00:02:48.030> side

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
back and this is the new one circle side

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.830 
back and this is the new one circle side
down<00:02:48.709> first<00:02:53.030> I'm<00:02:54.030> going<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.239> go<00:02:54.390> ahead<00:02:54.510> and

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
down first I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.800 
down first I'm going to go ahead and
take<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:56.510> spacer<00:02:57.510> put<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.019> down<00:02:59.420> so<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.540> sits

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
take this spacer put it down so it sits

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.430 
take this spacer put it down so it sits
in<00:03:00.989> between<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.950> coil<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:03.440> actual

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
in between the coil and the actual

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.890 
in between the coil and the actual
distributor<00:03:05.239> after<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.330> get<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.540> spacer

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.479 

right<00:03:27.329> these<00:03:27.799> about<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.859> bullet<00:03:29.190> should<00:03:29.310> look

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
right these about the bullet should look

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.840 
right these about the bullet should look
like<00:03:29.670> there's<00:03:30.359> just<00:03:30.510> four<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.810> them<00:03:30.989> and

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
like there's just four of them and

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.080 
like there's just four of them and
you're<00:03:32.850> going<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.030> want<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.269> screw<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.720> in

socket it works fine you just want to
get<00:03:40.920> an<00:03:41.209> extension<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.739> can<00:03:43.980> get<00:03:44.459> down<00:03:44.640> to

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
get an extension so you can get down to

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.600 
get an extension so you can get down to
the<00:03:44.910> drill<00:03:45.750> holes<00:03:45.930> in<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.079> back

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610

okay and once you get it bolted back on
to<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.310> distributor<00:03:52.960> you're<00:03:53.960> going<00:03:54.110> to<00:03:54.170> want

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
to the distributor you're going to want

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.940 
to the distributor you're going to want
to<00:03:54.380> take<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:55.460> red<00:03:55.670> wire<00:03:55.850> first<00:03:56.240> and<00:03:56.710> just<00:03:57.710> push

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
to take the red wire first and just push

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.790 
to take the red wire first and just push
it<00:03:58.130> back<00:03:58.370> down<00:03:58.930> into<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.380> hole<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.560> you

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
it back down into the hole that you

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.180 
it back down into the hole that you
originally<00:04:01.010> got<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.550> out<00:04:01.670> of<00:04:01.700> and<00:04:02.860> it<00:04:03.860> should

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
originally got it out of and it should

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.000 
originally got it out of and it should
easily<00:04:04.580> push<00:04:05.090> back<00:04:05.570> into<00:04:06.170> these<00:04:06.320> wires

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
easily push back into these wires

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.500 
easily push back into these wires
that's<00:04:07.820> what's<00:04:08.120> connecting<00:04:08.630> it<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:11.240> take

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
that's what's connecting it so you take

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.190 
that's what's connecting it so you take
the<00:04:11.630> red<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.560> far<00:04:12.770> right<00:04:14.020> you're<00:04:15.020> going<00:04:15.110> to

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
the red to the far right you're going to

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.320 
the red to the far right you're going to
want<00:04:15.350> to<00:04:15.380> unbolt<00:04:15.860> one<00:04:16.400> of<00:04:16.520> the<00:04:16.670> back<00:04:16.880> screws

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
want to unbolt one of the back screws

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.070 
want to unbolt one of the back screws
and<00:04:19.870> ground

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080

the far left and once that step is done
you're<00:04:32.960> going<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.140> take<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:34.400> ground<00:04:34.700> wire<00:04:35.060> and

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
you're going to take the ground wire and

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.730 
you're going to take the ground wire and
one<00:04:37.040> end<00:04:37.810> is<00:04:38.810> going<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.110> connect<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.530> this

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
one end is going to connect to this

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.810 
one end is going to connect to this
screw<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.870> other<00:04:42.140> end<00:04:42.580> is<00:04:43.580> going<00:04:43.760> to

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
screw and the other end is going to

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.450 
screw and the other end is going to
slide<00:04:44.090> into<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.480> middle<00:04:44.720> now<00:04:44.990> this<00:04:45.950> normally

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
slide into the middle now this normally

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:54.310 
slide into the middle now this normally
doesn't<00:04:46.670> come<00:04:47.770> with<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:50.920> pot<00:04:52.960> what<00:04:53.960> normally
