00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:08.379
 fuck please please 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:11.379
 stern 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.650
 3 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.290
 at last 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.250
 acz 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.560
 the reason 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.460
 min 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.630
 First 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.140
 min 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 First 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.890
 the region 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.730
 min 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.890
 1st 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.410
 min 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.410
 prob 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.939
 the first consideration that we must take into account 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.649
 is that the one registered by the scale is not certain the person 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:19.429
 if not the norm that is the force exerted between the scale on the person due to 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.219
 the reaction legation 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:28.299
 the first reading we got was 54 kilograms which is 529 minutes 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.109
 in the initial conditions of rest 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.109
 the norm and the weight will have the same magnitude 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.829
 once the elevator starts to climb 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.269
 there was a generation that will go in the same election of the norm 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:55.369
 causing that magnitude to be greater than before obtaining a reading of 57 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:59.099
 kilograms that are 558 together six grandchildren 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.559
 later the speed stabilizes and we return to the conditions 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:04.969
 initials of rest 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.059
 where was normal and the weight are equal 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.719
 when the elevator brake 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.959
 we have that the acceleration was going in the opposite direction to the norm 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.539
 today we will have a reading of 50 kilograms that are 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:23.299
 four hundred and ninety minutes 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.189
 making the standard less than the weight on this occasion 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.019
 now we will consider the considerations of when the sculptor of 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.219
 g 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.179
 we have that in principle affects the same situations 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:46.849
 the driver where he dealt and the rules are of the same magnitude 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:50.779
 when the attack begins to descend 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.779
 we have a generation that are heading the same address 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.989
 making the normal is less than the fish 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.449
 later the speed stabilizes and we return to the 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.849
 initial conditions 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.699
 when the desire surprises 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:12.649
 we have that the federation are now heading direction of the standard doing 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:14.359
 that it has more than the weight
