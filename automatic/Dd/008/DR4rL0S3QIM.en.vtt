00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.060 

um<00:01:19.180> these<00:01:20.180> had<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.660> little<00:01:21.080> more<00:01:21.290> beads<00:01:21.650> they

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
um these had a little more beads they

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.880 
um these had a little more beads they
were<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.400> about<00:01:22.640> right<00:01:22.850> here<00:01:23.120> or<00:01:23.690> so<00:01:23.930> but<00:01:24.680> they

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
were to about right here or so but they

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.490 
were to about right here or so but they
really<00:01:25.160> pulled<00:01:25.520> my<00:01:25.760> ear<00:01:26.000> because<00:01:26.290> since<00:01:27.290> these

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
really pulled my ear because since these

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.990 
really pulled my ear because since these
are<00:01:27.850> larger<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:28.880> mesh<00:01:29.480> beads<00:01:29.840> they<00:01:30.230> kind<00:01:30.560> of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
are larger and mesh beads they kind of

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.860 
are larger and mesh beads they kind of
are<00:01:32.000> heavier<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.200> I<00:01:33.530> only<00:01:33.980> took<00:01:34.220> about<00:01:34.330> two<00:01:35.330> off

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
are heavier so I only took about two off

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.960 
are heavier so I only took about two off
of<00:01:36.350> each<00:01:36.560> earring<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:38.590> these<00:01:39.590> look<00:01:39.950> great<00:01:40.280> even

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
of each earring so these look great even

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.900 
of each earring so these look great even
just<00:01:41.180> taking<00:01:41.720> two<00:01:41.990> off<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:42.670> these<00:01:43.670> are<00:01:43.880> the

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
just taking two off so these are the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.480 
just taking two off so these are the
gold<00:01:44.180> Jennifer<00:01:44.720> meshes<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:48.170> she<00:01:48.560> also<00:01:48.860> sent

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
gold Jennifer meshes and she also sent

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.400 
gold Jennifer meshes and she also sent
me<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:51.050> silver<00:01:51.380> mesh<00:01:52.540> now<00:01:53.540> these<00:01:53.840> were

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
me the silver mesh now these were

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.760 
me the silver mesh now these were
smaller<00:01:54.830> hopes<00:01:55.220> so<00:01:56.210> I<00:01:56.240> left<00:01:56.900> all<00:01:57.260> of<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.560> beads

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
smaller hopes so I left all of the beads

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.360 
smaller hopes so I left all of the beads
on<00:01:58.100> since<00:01:58.880> these<00:01:59.090> are<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.360> larger<00:01:59.870> hope<00:02:00.370> they

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
on since these are a larger hope they

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.930 
on since these are a larger hope they
pull<00:02:02.240> more<00:02:02.630> easily<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:04.190> these<00:02:04.460> are<00:02:04.520> smaller

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
pull more easily so these are smaller

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.920 
pull more easily so these are smaller
hoops<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:05.780> these<00:02:06.229> are<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.910> silver<00:02:07.910> mesh<00:02:08.149> ones
