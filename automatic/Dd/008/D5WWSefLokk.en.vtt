00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you're really just better off finding

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.799 
you're really just better off finding
what<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> important<00:00:59.489> notes<00:00:59.730> are<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.600> your

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
what the important notes are in your

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.739 
what the important notes are in your
line<00:01:01.019> and<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.589> sticking<00:01:02.339> them<00:01:02.569> right<00:01:03.569> where

line and just sticking them right where
they<00:01:03.780> need<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.729> it's<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.880> lot<00:01:06.090> harder<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.630> do

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
they need to go it's a lot harder to do

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.740 
they need to go it's a lot harder to do
than<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.710> looks<00:01:07.979> there's<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.970> lot<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> players

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
than it looks there's a lot of players

than it looks there's a lot of players
that<00:01:10.350> play<00:01:10.890> really<00:01:11.159> fairly<00:01:11.759> simple<00:01:12.210> lines<00:01:12.450> but

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that play really fairly simple lines but

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.020 
that play really fairly simple lines but
they're<00:01:12.899> very<00:01:12.930> difficult<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.369> groove<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.880> way

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
they're very difficult to groove the way

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.569 
they're very difficult to groove the way
that<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.299> do<00:01:15.680> you<00:01:16.680> might<00:01:16.920> laugh<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.490> you

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
that they do you might laugh but you

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
is really tough to groove the way that

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.039 
is really tough to groove the way that
that<00:01:30.270> guy<00:01:30.450> does<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:32.179> number<00:01:33.179> one<00:01:33.469> slow<00:01:34.469> down<00:01:34.679> I

that guy does so number one slow down I

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.630 
that guy does so number one slow down I
done<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.259> much<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.679> I'll<00:01:38.189> show<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
done so much of that I'll show you a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.219 
done so much of that I'll show you a
little<00:01:38.789> riff<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.240> did<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.659> long<00:01:39.990> time<00:01:40.020> ago

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
little riff that I did a long time ago

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.499 
little riff that I did a long time ago
that<00:01:40.649> I<00:01:41.250> used<00:01:41.789> to<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.030> play<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> hundred

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
that I used to just play a hundred

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.700 
that I used to just play a hundred
million<00:01:42.659> miles<00:01:42.899> an<00:01:43.079> hour<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.350> no<00:01:43.470> good<00:01:43.649> reason

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
million miles an hour for no good reason

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.529 
million miles an hour for no good reason
and<00:01:44.220> then<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> slowed<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> down<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.149> figured

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
and then I slowed it down and figured

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.149 
and then I slowed it down and figured
out<00:01:45.600> wow<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.960> actually<00:01:46.079> sounds<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.829> lot<00:01:47.100> cooler

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
out wow it actually sounds a lot cooler

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.559 
out wow it actually sounds a lot cooler
than<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.729> would<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:47.939> thought<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:48.539> I

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
than I would have thought when I

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:49.999 
than I would have thought when I
actually<00:01:48.840> got<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> chance<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.500> listen<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.799> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
actually got a chance to listen to it

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.469 
actually got a chance to listen to it
and<00:01:50.219> especially<00:01:50.429> because<00:01:50.789> that<00:01:51.090> test<00:01:51.360> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and especially because that test I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.569 
and especially because that test I
really<00:01:51.719> couldn't<00:01:51.899> play<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.229> any<00:01:52.409> way<00:01:52.579> here

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
really couldn't play in any way here

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:15.500 
really couldn't play in any way here
it's<00:01:54.060> an<00:01:54.149> F<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:14.280> he<00:02:14.430> played<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.849> real<00:02:15.150> speed

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
it's an F so he played in a real speed

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:37.040 
it's an F so he played in a real speed
sounds<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.349> this

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.809 

so<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.260> know<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.590> think<00:02:38.980> it's<00:02:39.130> cooler<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.610> way

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
so I know I think it's cooler that way

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.740 
so I know I think it's cooler that way
it's<00:02:40.690> also<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.170> little<00:02:41.560> easier<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.010> play<00:02:42.750> so

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
it's also a little easier to play so

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.479 
it's also a little easier to play so
anyway<00:02:44.230> see<00:02:44.440> it's<00:02:44.800> been<00:02:44.950> working<00:02:45.160> really<00:02:45.280> hard

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
anyway see it's been working really hard

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:58.620 
anyway see it's been working really hard
you<00:02:45.849> get<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.150> riff<00:02:46.450> down<00:02:57.330> I'm<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.599> the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
you get this riff down I'm of the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.089 
you get this riff down I'm of the
opinion<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:59.230> should<00:02:59.260> really<00:02:59.650> ask<00:02:59.890> yourself

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
opinion you should really ask yourself

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.220 
opinion you should really ask yourself
seriously<00:03:00.700> why<00:03:01.480> you're<00:03:01.720> not<00:03:01.900> doing<00:03:02.200> something

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
seriously why you're not doing something

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:17.280 
seriously why you're not doing something
like<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:15.510> mean<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.959> know<00:03:17.080> if<00:03:17.170> you're

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
like this I mean you know if you're

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.539 
like this I mean you know if you're
playing<00:03:17.410> by<00:03:17.620> yourself<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:18.040> yeah<00:03:18.190> do<00:03:18.370> whatever

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
playing by yourself and yeah do whatever

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:29.910 
playing by yourself and yeah do whatever
you<00:03:18.670> want

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.200 

but<00:03:30.920> you're<00:03:31.400> never<00:03:31.520> going<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.790> hear<00:03:32.030> all<00:03:32.180> that

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
but you're never going to hear all that

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.450 
but you're never going to hear all that
little<00:03:32.660> stuff<00:03:32.930> in<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.140> middle<00:03:33.410> let<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.160> group

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
little stuff in the middle let the group

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:47.770 
little stuff in the middle let the group
just<00:03:34.610> play<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.240> bass<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:46.790> really<00:03:47.450> think<00:03:47.600> you'd

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
just play the bass I really think you'd

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.010 
just play the bass I really think you'd
be<00:03:47.900> happier<00:03:48.230> I<00:03:48.440> know<00:03:48.770> it's<00:03:49.010> no<00:03:49.190> fun<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.780> bass

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
be happier I know it's no fun the bass

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.040 
be happier I know it's no fun the bass
player<00:03:51.200> may<00:03:51.920> often<00:03:52.370> times<00:03:52.970> be<00:03:53.120> invisible<00:03:53.570> but

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
player may often times be invisible but

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.000 
player may often times be invisible but
a<00:03:54.620> good<00:03:54.920> one<00:03:55.100> is<00:03:55.370> never<00:03:56.300> forgettable<00:03:57.140> so

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
a good one is never forgettable so

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.500 
a good one is never forgettable so
that's<00:03:58.190> what<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:58.370> ought<00:03:58.610> to<00:03:58.730> really<00:03:58.850> work

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
that's what you ought to really work

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.530
