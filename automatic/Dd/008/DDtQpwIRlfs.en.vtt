done<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:52.890> most<00:03:53.040> restaurants<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.900> it's

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
done in most restaurants is it's

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.740 
done in most restaurants is it's
actually<00:03:55.079> grilled<00:03:56.030> up<00:03:57.030> over<00:03:57.269> an<00:03:57.359> open<00:03:57.450> flame

actually grilled up over an open flame

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.300 
actually grilled up over an open flame
so<00:03:58.049> I<00:03:58.109> took<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.379> liberty<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:58.739> grilling<00:03:59.159> these

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
so I took the liberty of grilling these

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.309 
so I took the liberty of grilling these
pieces<00:03:59.609> of<00:03:59.849> bread<00:04:00.030> beforehand<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:01.099> they<00:04:02.099> are

you<00:04:04.319> can<00:04:04.500> see<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:05.489> outer<00:04:05.639> edge<00:04:05.909> is<00:04:05.939> a

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
you can see that the outer edge is a

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.399 
you can see that the outer edge is a
little<00:04:06.450> chart<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:08.629> adds<00:04:09.629> to<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.900> flavor<00:04:10.169> of
