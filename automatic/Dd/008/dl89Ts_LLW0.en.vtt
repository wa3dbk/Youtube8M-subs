00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
see I've got the same problem I've got

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.600 
see I've got the same problem I've got
with<00:01:38.040> gerard<00:01:38.520> very<00:01:39.210> tiny<00:01:40.340> forehead<00:01:41.340> space

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
with gerard very tiny forehead space

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.010 
with gerard very tiny forehead space
which<00:01:42.270> means<00:01:42.680> you<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.670> hard<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:45.899> it

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
which means you know it's hard to get it

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.310 
which means you know it's hard to get it
to<00:01:46.200> look<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.540> short<00:01:48.840> path<00:01:49.110> what

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
to look like that so the short path what

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.649 
to look like that so the short path what
the<00:01:49.409> short<00:01:49.619> puff<00:01:49.860> does<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.850> reduces<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the short puff does is it reduces the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.600 
the short puff does is it reduces the
side<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.930> his<00:01:52.200> size<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> foreheads<00:01:53.460> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
side of his size of the foreheads that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.880 
side of his size of the foreheads that
you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.909> see<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:55.320> that's<00:01:55.530> why<00:01:55.710> i<00:01:55.740> went

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
you can see and so that's why i went

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.950 
you can see and so that's why i went
with<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.640> obviously<00:01:56.850> there<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.630> another

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
with that but obviously there is another

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.679 
with that but obviously there is another
