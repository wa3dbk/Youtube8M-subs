00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.950
 well it's everyone is 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.470
 first I hope you are well 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.320
 today we find ourselves for a small 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.890
 match between used on pokemon showdown 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.970
 with a Roman cudgel that I like but 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.020
 from ouch i love roman mattrick 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.559
 responsible also decides on you the 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.390
 present 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.670
 so basically I wanted to play say 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.760
 also that I wanted to test in indoor 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.100
 used and finally I left on a 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.589
 Roman cudgel with jiangxi symbios 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.750
 precisely witness policy that once 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.449
 placed can wreak havoc on the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.220
 team opponent and will perish 2 who is the 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.170
 best game distortion setter 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.629
 so I wanted not presented but 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.239
 distortion it's an attack that allows 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.489
 to the pokemon the clans of attacked in 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.830
 first for five rounds excluding 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.119
 of course the priority attacks 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.310
 so that's it for the three poser of 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.070
 distortion behind one at same bligh 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.290
 dr tank stories in media that fast spin 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.000
 and that puts a good offensive pressure 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.619
 and he has enough speed 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.340
 correct to be able to play it in 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.880
 distortion 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.590
 we have a masonry with notch that surprises 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.930
 usually the opponent when the one 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.070
 it is burned and hits a lot more 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.539
 strong 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.210
 not that we easily guess his talent to 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.070
 that moment but it's too late and we 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.100
 in said Ms. claisse demo class that is 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.109
 really a big heart and I'll you 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.539
 to make a card very soon on 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.590
 him because I dore which in this 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.359
 match it seems to me that they rather 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.100
 discreet but it is not necessarily 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.899
 serious because there will be others 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.570
 swell it's just huge 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.070
 finally, it's about the opposing team 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.770
 we have a team that but me really 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.929
 the impression when the distortion is 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.840
 not there with required trioxide and garlic 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.119
 form to the white casa that is played 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.579
 with fullness croco ricky is surely 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.109
 jazz band need at the queen enamelling 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.380
 form 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:10.149
 so all that is pretty powerful and if 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.170
 I do not have the distortion I can 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.790
 take the water quickly so here you go 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.140
 that's all said I think we're going 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.970
 go to what interests us most 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.340
 ie the match so it's 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.800
 artix then I will send my slugger 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.630
 and he sent his croco bible so I 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.130
 will suffer a drop in attack but I 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.600
 will stay anyway and type a close 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.360
 fight but he plays it very well shot and 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.490
 sends nido queen so he does not take 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.230
 absolutely nothing about the close fight 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.900
 by the way, at that moment he may have 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.190
 had to guess that I had cran and I see 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.020
 little rigorous that cash very well 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.660
 the queen bus attacks but he in 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.520
 promo he took the opportunity to lay the rock 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.050
 so here I thought he was not going 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.660
 not stay so I typed the 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.280
 Roman tribe anticipating the coming of 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.880
 giraschi and there either I will not 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.830
 stay and I'm going to absorb the point of 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.490
 fire suffer the burn but it's not 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.459
 really embarrassing 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.410
 thanks to the talent of saint-claude and there I 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.420
 does not foresee the coming of horrible crunches 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.820
 I'm doing shadow bowl but it's not 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.440
 too serious since behind thanks to the 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.530
 distortion I am always faster 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.910
 and I finish it with explo force so the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.090
 distortion but really a huge 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.430
 pressure on satine when it is 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.770
 there and he has to sacrifice 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.750
 potters to be able to continue so there 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.380
 I did not want to lose rnic leash 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.769
 right now so i see korrigans 2 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.230
 and whose whose soul in the shade does not 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.910
 does absolutely nothing and there I am on 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.230
 blaye style blinds to cash a 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.640
 dallas box attacks are even at +1 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.320
 and there behind I do bergholtz 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.060
 it's mostly why I look 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.390
 sent to extremely hurt his 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.420
 team 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.480
 even though behind I lose my mega so 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.370
 there I see demo class I was two 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.900
 fingers to make crowned of ford but 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.870
 finally I made a choice of smic 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.190
 I did not have the courage to do it and 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.930
 I may be sorry because 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.730
 very western now there is more 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.130
 round hattrick he's going to put a big 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.130
 pressure on my tin because of the haye 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.120
 do better to do a lot worse 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.000
 compared to forecasts 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.709
 so suddenly I will not leave little 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.230
 rigorous and I sacrifice them my anger 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.870
 I wanted to keep in the fridge even if 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.040
 this one is already well started we do not 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.900
 never know he might have been able 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.729
 replace the chrome sort and behind 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.040
 put pressure on the 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.160
 opposing team so adding father 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.410
 masonry so there he read to drops 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.110
 everywhere and I take this opportunity to send 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.090
 say here 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.380
 and put the chrome sort on the switch 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.770
 because I knew he was not going 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.690
 stay 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.460
 so here I put the red cudgel and 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.710
 I anticipate the coming of his idea to the queen 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.080
 for precisely sent skin rigondeaux 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.670
 so who will take a boost in attack 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.800
 I would have preferred in special attack 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.890
 do not try too much 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.170
 so here I do care story of 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.540
 recover from life but I see that air 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.460
 for me does a lot of damage and I 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.320
 so decide to finally type because 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.010
 than this little game there at the end of 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.350
 Africa Room 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.390
 he would have done earth hour once 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.800
 and behind them was faster and 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.560
 completed murray so I preferred in 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.800
 enjoy for the attacked so the agent 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.200
 see rni more and I'm going to type a good 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.050
 big shadow flight that put ko nido 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.790
 queen and they could do big 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.190
 damage to jirachi so that was all good at 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.490
 that moment and there the dimensions 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.320
 come back to normal so given 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.090
 that I knew that I cash and at least 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.670
 a giraschi attack I took advantage 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.220
 to stay and relocate the Roma cudgel and 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.410
 there I type a good group skyrock who to 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.740
 do big damage to mega little pharand 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.330
 like 50% of his life before dying so 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.460
 symbiosis that was really cool 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.280
 in this match it's good it's very cool 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.220
 basic is the worthy girl who gets in 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.850
 in the square he will finish neither the queens 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:53.100
 with mines blast is 1 to say here 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.730
 behind they send giraschi and grace 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.790
 at apc fire he finishes geraghty and 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.280
 two for diane so john so kim who have 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.500
 that we stop more finally and three 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.230
 to say here with a joke that is going 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.300
 finally finished my daughter all her team 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.740
 louis so the chrome sort is no longer there 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.500
 but I have enough to operate for 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.510
 able to put it back after the thunder 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.150
 so again I place the 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.010
 room and 4 for john so we 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.500
 stop more crowds is crazy this 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.120
 nice he and he is everywhere and there finally 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.210
 one last of a critical ice-cream 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.230
 because it is good of his hearing and 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.670
 so I win the match 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.710
 it was a match that took me 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.540
 especially pleased I hope you 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.220
 so I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.680
 lenses unfortunately did not see the 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.039
 8 police passes are activated and see the 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.669
 fury to say even as she drew herself 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:43.930
 do not hesitate to tell you what you 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.449
 have thought of the match in space 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.699
 comments and share it 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.839
 it was the sycamore we find ourselves for
