00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109 
aghh I'm glad it's just a quick one but

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.500 
aghh I'm glad it's just a quick one but
few<00:00:06.350> people<00:00:06.620> asked<00:00:06.979> to<00:00:07.639> show<00:00:07.880> him<00:00:08.179> the

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
few people asked to show him the

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.140 
few people asked to show him the
difference<00:00:08.720> in<00:00:09.320> sound<00:00:09.679> quality<00:00:10.580> compared<00:00:11.120> to

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
difference in sound quality compared to

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.299 
difference in sound quality compared to
the<00:00:11.330> TBS<00:00:11.719> mini<00:00:12.530> from<00:00:13.160> Ben<00:00:13.339> adeney<00:00:13.929> and

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
the TBS mini from Ben adeney and

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.359 
the TBS mini from Ben adeney and
compared<00:00:16.309> to<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.520> clock<00:00:17.240> TK<00:00:17.660> 22<00:00:18.140> both<00:00:19.099> sound

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
compared to the clock TK 22 both sound

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.990 
compared to the clock TK 22 both sound
great<00:00:20.740> to<00:00:21.740> me<00:00:21.920> but<00:00:22.340> I'll<00:00:22.699> show<00:00:22.910> you<00:00:22.939> a

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
great to me but I'll show you a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.279 
great to me but I'll show you a
difference<00:00:23.330> so<00:00:23.660> I've<00:00:23.750> got<00:00:23.900> it<00:00:23.960> powered<00:00:24.170> up

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
difference so I've got it powered up

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.240 
difference so I've got it powered up
I'll<00:00:24.500> show<00:00:24.679> you<00:00:24.740> the<00:00:25.089> start<00:00:26.089> sequence<00:00:26.509> for<00:00:26.720> the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
I'll show you the start sequence for the

00:00:27.250 --> 00:01:08.820 
I'll show you the start sequence for the
clock

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.040 

so<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:09.950> sounds<00:01:10.190> great<00:01:10.630> as<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:11.720> can<00:01:11.840> see<00:01:11.960> it

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
so that sounds great as you can see it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.960 
so that sounds great as you can see it
takes<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.320> little<00:01:12.410> while<00:01:12.620> to<00:01:12.680> do<00:01:13.670> it<00:01:13.760> up<00:01:13.850> to

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
takes a little while to do it up to

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.220 
takes a little while to do it up to
speed<00:01:14.090> when<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.480> accelerate<00:01:14.950> but<00:01:17.170> for<00:01:18.170> the

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
speed when you accelerate but for the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.300 
speed when you accelerate but for the
price<00:01:18.440> of<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.920> unit

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
price of the unit

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.790 
price of the unit
you<00:01:19.880> can't<00:01:20.090> complain<00:01:20.390> especially<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:21.470> turret

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
you can't complain especially the turret

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.370 
you can't complain especially the turret
noise<00:01:22.010> and<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.310> machine<00:01:22.640> gun<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.090> in<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.200> can

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
noise and the machine gun and in the can

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.600 
noise and the machine gun and in the can
and<00:01:24.500> whatnot<00:01:24.830> sounds<00:01:25.160> great

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
and whatnot sounds great

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.570 
and whatnot sounds great
now<00:01:26.090> plug<00:01:26.330> up<00:01:26.510> the<00:01:26.810> Ben<00:01:26.990> adeney<00:01:27.410> I<00:01:27.560> show<00:01:28.460> the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
now plug up the Ben adeney I show the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:40.420 
now plug up the Ben adeney I show the
difference<00:01:38.560> it's<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.619> bit<00:01:39.770> hard<00:01:39.979> to<00:01:40.040> do<00:01:40.220> it<00:01:40.340> off

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
difference it's a bit hard to do it off

00:01:40.430 --> 00:02:32.910 
difference it's a bit hard to do it off
camera

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.250 

and<00:02:33.920> -<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.459> quickly<00:02:34.700> turn<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.450> how<00:02:36.200> it

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
and - I quickly turn it on and how it

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.170 
and - I quickly turn it on and how it
starts<00:02:36.590> up<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:36.890> turns<00:02:37.220> off<00:02:37.370> again<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:37.970> here<00:02:38.120> we

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
starts up and turns off again so here we

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:53.220 
starts up and turns off again so here we
go

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.479
