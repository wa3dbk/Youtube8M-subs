00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.630 
make sure you take an extra step while
you're<00:01:46.229> transferring<00:01:46.740> little<00:01:47.430> stuff<00:01:47.549> like

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
you're transferring little stuff like

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.899 
you're transferring little stuff like
that<00:01:47.970> yeah<00:01:48.360> first<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.079> always<00:01:49.549> wait<00:01:50.549> into<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
that yeah first I always wait into a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.510 
that yeah first I always wait into a
perfect<00:01:51.390> pitch<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.590> when<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> see<00:01:53.399> my

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
perfect pitch and then when I see my

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.039 
perfect pitch and then when I see my
pretty<00:01:53.729> pitch<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:55.229> at<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> swing<00:01:57.049> hit

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
pretty pitch I go at it and swing hit

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.260 
pretty pitch I go at it and swing hit
the<00:01:58.170> ball<00:01:58.320> far<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.579> all<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.880> his<00:02:00.000> timing

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the ball far as it's all in his timing

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.690 
the ball far as it's all in his timing
you<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.540> because<00:02:00.810> he<00:02:00.899> can't<00:02:01.829> stop<00:02:02.130> when<00:02:02.640> he

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
you know because he can't stop when he

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.389 
you know because he can't stop when he
swings<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.630> his<00:02:03.990> approach<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.710> ball<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.159> is

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
swings so his approach to the ball is is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.059 
swings so his approach to the ball is is
his<00:02:05.729> own<00:02:05.939> creation<00:02:06.719> there<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:07.799> then

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
his own creation there you know then

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.400 
his own creation there you know then
just<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.369> swing<00:02:08.879> with<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.509> would<00:02:10.140> say<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
just to swing with I would say the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.920 
just to swing with I would say the
backhand<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.580> lot<00:02:11.700> more<00:02:11.849> difficult<00:02:12.390> as<00:02:12.510> we

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
backhand it's a lot more difficult as we

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.770 
backhand it's a lot more difficult as we
try<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.080> work<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.440> lash

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
try to work on a lash

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.410 
try to work on a lash
trade<00:02:14.170> change<00:02:14.740> sides<00:02:15.040> because<00:02:15.670> you'll<00:02:16.240> have<00:02:16.360> a

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
trade change sides because you'll have a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.170 
trade change sides because you'll have a
little<00:02:16.600> more<00:02:16.780> control<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:18.010> batting<00:02:18.730> from<00:02:19.090> the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
little more control the batting from the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.850 
little more control the batting from the
left<00:02:19.270> side<00:02:19.600> but<00:02:20.110> he<00:02:20.200> wants<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.590> continue

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
left side but he wants to continue

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.040 
left side but he wants to continue
batting<00:02:21.280> his<00:02:21.459> way<00:02:21.670> that's<00:02:22.270> fine<00:02:22.480> now<00:02:22.720> he's

batting his way that's fine now he's

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.449 
batting his way that's fine now he's
making<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.319> lot<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.560> contact<00:02:23.980> with<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.280> ball

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
making a lot of contact with the ball

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.780
