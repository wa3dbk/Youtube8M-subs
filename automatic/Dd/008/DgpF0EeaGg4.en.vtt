00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.609
 anyone could have done it 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.529
 here caught 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.990
 I do not know the most obvious things that go 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.789
 appear in e3 made in word and published 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.019
 and someone is believing everyone in the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.300
 Truth is believing it will be 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.029
 This, everyone, every year, has these 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.890
 Yes, but almost always 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.050
 Nothing here that comes out 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.340

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.380

 boring again in females should have a 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.890
 lot of thing plays out 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.710
 It's a stop and that's when you look. 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.940
 here on the list of nintendo everybody is 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.850
 he got his head sucked when he saw it 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.379
 little fighters a lot but probably 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.850
 must be a pokémons battle game 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.059
 are talking shit you say that 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.330
 half and a zelda dodo game 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.150
 Only when I went to look here I lived 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.210
 shopping for 82 thousand and then have either 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.070
 silvano a cimpor benatti 2 3 of s 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.080
 Fucking face like nobody else is. 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.020
 commenting on this old everybody 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.720
 talking about red bull's zeal wants silvana 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.000
 silva benatti 2 I'm like, who knows? 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.470
 that accompanies me on twitter facebook or 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.090
 knows the channel a lot of time knows that I 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.770
 I'm very fan of the franchise that this urban 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.299
 mainly that silvana silva by 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.579
 more than after it shocked the sega world 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.369
 saturn so and from time to time I saw that 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.280
 My god is going to give shit is going to give shit 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.930
 because old konami is only doing 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.030
 fuck is this is what's best 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.650
 saving military is vital that it lacked 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.350
 Iceland 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.320
 but it is not of the conam but at least of 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.910
 seek to launch the 3ds type 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.650
 if this is true I'll stick with 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.060
 The necklace I'm going to give very real in this 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.790
 old game 10 do not quit the game, let's go 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.490
 hope it's good but it 's a thing 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.250
 it has everything to go wrong is know 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.110
 that pick-up thing picks up the game and does 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.000
 a movie of them is already sure to go 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.600
 give shit because it's going to suck 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.520
 because the merger game has with an old 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.920
 they are picking on something that was 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.020
 is the staff is expected to arrive and do 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.420
 continuation of crohn a track the chance 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.820
 to go wrong is too big because 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.980
 because they accepted a lot when creating 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.630
 a game the first time I say to 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.780
 they can do the same thing again 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.440
 process the same as I can speak 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.050
 for you it's the same formula for success 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.940
 It's too big of shit and kind of you 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.120
 knowledge of nothing I do not know that they 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.580
 can make deputy the dracula goes 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.440
 resurface again the sugar will appear 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.260
 there and kill the Dracula again and what goes 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.570
 It happens time I always say 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.489
 richard know if his name is not 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.470
 Richard , I'll remember his name there. 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.180
 not because I've always talked about Richard and 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:05.150
 speak in full of everyone corrected me 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:07.550
 It's too fucking hard to follow up. 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.390
 direct is very likely that will pay 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.920
 this jerk 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.380
 I do not know, you do not know if you 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.239
 liked this list that leaked like me 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.790
 I'm shitting and walking to other games 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.560
 because the other games is the medium that 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.989
 Obviously I throw it at others. 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.150
 consoles that will be announced at times 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.760
 nor is it sometimes announced that it is 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.709
 all lies sometimes this stop than 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.840
 the only lady was cheating same type is 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.090
 one thing that no one really expects 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.720
 It is not something that nobody expects and 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.459
 you 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.080
 I 'll ask you a comment on the 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.880
 comments what do you think about what 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.590
 It's human being and your happy night 2 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.870
 You think you 're going to give shit just like 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.730
 I think because the chance is too great. 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.650

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.019
