00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
the future of this texture pack review

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.230 
the future of this texture pack review
that<00:00:14.309> means<00:00:14.490> like<00:00:14.670> two<00:00:14.880> minutes<00:00:15.030> from<00:00:15.150> now

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
that means like two minutes from now

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.630 
that means like two minutes from now
I'll<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.770> randomly<00:00:17.130> generated<00:00:17.160> world

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
I'll be in a randomly generated world

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.950 
I'll be in a randomly generated world
show<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.910> guys<00:00:18.090> what<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.390> all<00:00:18.480> looks<00:00:18.510> like<00:00:18.810> in

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
show you guys what it all looks like in

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.500 
show you guys what it all looks like in
its<00:00:19.080> natural<00:00:19.350> habitat<00:00:20.090> that<00:00:21.090> sounds<00:00:21.390> weird

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
its natural habitat that sounds weird

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.300 
its natural habitat that sounds weird
anyways<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:22.740> go<00:00:22.859> through<00:00:22.890> here<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
anyways so we can go through here and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.740 
anyways so we can go through here and
see<00:00:23.430> obviously<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> grass<00:00:24.300> looks<00:00:24.570> like

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
see obviously with the grass looks like

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.790 
see obviously with the grass looks like
in<00:00:24.930> Col<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.320> should<00:00:25.500> give<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.769> good

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
in Col that should give you a good

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.500 
in Col that should give you a good
example<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.430> what<00:00:26.609> most<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> texture<00:00:27.359> pack

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
example of what most of the texture pack

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.300 
example of what most of the texture pack
will<00:00:27.779> look<00:00:27.960> like<00:00:28.140> as<00:00:28.349> that's<00:00:28.830> going<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
will look like as that's going to be the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.679 
will look like as that's going to be the
main<00:00:29.550> blocks<00:00:29.820> you're<00:00:30.000> seeing<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> game

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
main blocks you're seeing in the game

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.720

well they kind of pop out at you and the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.490 
well they kind of pop out at you and the
crafting<00:00:48.300> bench<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.600> also<00:00:48.930> pretty<00:00:49.079> cool<00:00:49.350> out

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
crafting bench is also pretty cool out

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.810 
crafting bench is also pretty cool out
they<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> tools<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> side

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
they just have the tools on the side

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.510 
they just have the tools on the side
here<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.329> furnace<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.260> pretty<00:00:52.739> sweet<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
here the furnace is pretty sweet and the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.160 
here the furnace is pretty sweet and the
shading<00:00:53.940> which<00:00:54.120> matches<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> lot<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
shading which matches a lot of the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.290 
shading which matches a lot of the
blocks<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.770> most<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.430> them<00:00:56.550> seem<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.850> stay<00:00:57.090> in

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
blocks and most of them seem to stay in

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.810 
blocks and most of them seem to stay in
the<00:00:57.390> same<00:00:57.570> style<00:00:57.960> which<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:59.340> admit<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the same style which I will admit that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060 
the same style which I will admit that
is<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> very<00:01:00.600> hard<00:01:00.930> thing<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.230> texture<00:01:01.920> pack

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
is a very hard thing for texture pack

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.889 
is a very hard thing for texture pack
creators<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> do<00:01:02.699> especially<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.690> create

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
creators to do especially if you create

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.210 
creators to do especially if you create
a<00:01:03.930> texture<00:01:04.170> pack<00:01:04.350> over<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> long<00:01:04.860> period<00:01:04.890> of

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
a texture pack over a long period of

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.340 
a texture pack over a long period of
time<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:06.090> may<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> idea<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> change

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
time you may get the idea to change

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.399 
time you may get the idea to change
style<00:01:07.860> over<00:01:08.189> time<00:01:08.630> making<00:01:09.630> newer<00:01:09.810> blocks<00:01:10.200> look

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
style over time making newer blocks look

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.810 
style over time making newer blocks look
a<00:01:10.500> lot<00:01:10.619> different<00:01:10.680> from<00:01:11.040> older<00:01:11.340> blocks<00:01:11.549> this

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
a lot different from older blocks this

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.250 
a lot different from older blocks this
texture<00:01:12.150> pack<00:01:12.299> craters<00:01:12.630> seem<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> really

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
texture pack craters seem to do a really

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
texture pack craters seem to do a really
good<00:01:13.409> job<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.830> keeping<00:01:14.280> all<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.700> blocks<00:01:14.939> one

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
good job in keeping all the blocks one

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.270 
good job in keeping all the blocks one
style<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.350> did<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> really

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
style that they did so it was a really

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.640 
style that they did so it was a really
good<00:01:17.460> job<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.700> props<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.390> them<00:01:18.509> anyways<00:01:19.409> in

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
good job in props to them anyways in

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.170 
good job in props to them anyways in
here<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.189> check<00:01:20.340> out<00:01:20.460> some<00:01:20.640> other<00:01:20.700> armor

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
here we can check out some other armor

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.410 
here we can check out some other armor
etc<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.640> basically

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
etc and you can all see it basically

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.530 
etc and you can all see it basically
follows<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> same<00:01:25.680> style<00:01:26.150> one<00:01:27.150> thing<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.450> will

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
follows the same style one thing I will

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
styles of texture pack creator which

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.240 
styles of texture pack creator which
means<00:01:43.049> he<00:01:43.170> actually<00:01:43.200> changed<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.829> textures

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
means he actually changed the textures
