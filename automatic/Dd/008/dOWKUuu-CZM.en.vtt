00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
personally I don't think the brakeless

run<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> straight<00:00:49.829> cable<00:00:50.100> rather<00:00:50.489> than<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> cable

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
run a straight cable rather than a cable

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.729 
run a straight cable rather than a cable
detangler<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.170> little<00:00:52.410> bit<00:00:52.530> lighter

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
detangler it's a little bit lighter

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.680 
detangler it's a little bit lighter
easier<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.489> set<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:53.850> at<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> same<00:00:54.300> time<00:00:54.539> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
easier to set up at the same time it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.660 
easier to set up at the same time it
also<00:00:54.719> wears<00:00:55.410> out<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> little<00:00:55.890> bit<00:00:56.070> faster<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.640> I

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
also wears out a little bit faster so I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.400 
also wears out a little bit faster so I
have<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.059> replace<00:00:57.329> my<00:00:57.510> cables<00:00:57.899> more<00:00:58.079> often

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
of simple systems here working together

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.560 
of simple systems here working together
to<00:01:33.780> give<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.409> good<00:01:34.710> set<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.100> brakes

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
to give you a really good set of brakes

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.789 
to give you a really good set of brakes
another<00:01:36.570> final<00:01:36.990> issue<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
another final issue is that you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.200 
another final issue is that you
generally<00:01:38.130> want<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.520> leave<00:01:38.640> your<00:01:38.820> brake<00:01:39.030> pads

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
generally want to leave your brake pads

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
generally want to leave your brake pads
towed<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.079> little<00:01:40.290> bit<00:01:40.439> which<00:01:41.040> basically

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
towed in a little bit which basically

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.069 
towed in a little bit which basically
means<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.240> as<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.570> wheel<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.899> rolling

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
means that as your wheel is rolling

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.340 
means that as your wheel is rolling
forward<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.920> want<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.520> bottom<00:01:44.880> side<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.450> your

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
forward you want the bottom side of your

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.469 
forward you want the bottom side of your
brake<00:01:46.560> pad<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.340> contacting<00:01:48.000> before<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
brake pad to be contacting before the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.889 
brake pad to be contacting before the
top<00:01:48.659> side<00:01:48.899> okay<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.890> basically<00:01:50.450> if<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.630> grab<00:01:51.869> my

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
top side okay so basically if I grab my

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.200 
top side okay so basically if I grab my
brake<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.890> portion<00:01:53.369> down<00:01:53.549> here<00:01:53.850> actually

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
brake this portion down here actually

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.060 
brake this portion down here actually
touches<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> rim<00:01:54.899> before<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.560> portion<00:01:55.950> up

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
touches the rim before this portion up

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.580 
touches the rim before this portion up
here<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.460> what<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.909> does<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.590> keeps

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
here and what that does is that keeps

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.359 
here and what that does is that keeps
that<00:01:59.579> keeps<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> brake<00:02:00.450> pad<00:02:00.630> from<00:02:00.840> shattering

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
that keeps the brake pad from shattering

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.280 
that keeps the brake pad from shattering
basically<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.520> won't<00:02:02.969> get<00:02:03.689> these<00:02:03.780> very<00:02:04.049> high

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
basically it won't get these very high

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.230 
basically it won't get these very high
speed<00:02:04.590> vibrations<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.369> happen<00:02:05.670> when<00:02:05.850> when

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
speed vibrations that happen when when

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.309 
speed vibrations that happen when when
this<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:07.069> this<00:02:08.069> part<00:02:08.670> right<00:02:09.420> here<00:02:09.479> touches

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
this on this part right here touches

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.140 
this on this part right here touches
down<00:02:10.410> first<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.190> brake<00:02:11.430> pad<00:02:11.640> actually<00:02:11.849> will

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
down first the brake pad actually will

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.490 
down first the brake pad actually will
flex<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
flex in and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.830 
flex in and
bounce<00:02:13.770> out<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.340> grab<00:02:14.670> again<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.270> it

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
bounce out and grab again and it

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.690 
bounce out and grab again and it
basically<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.590> shatters<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.190> happens<00:02:17.550> very

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
basically it shatters this happens very

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.070 
basically it shatters this happens very
fast<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.240> creates<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.570> pretty<00:02:18.780> horrible

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
fast and creates a pretty horrible

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.230 
fast and creates a pretty horrible
squeaking<00:02:19.680> noise<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.130> actually<00:02:20.820> can<00:02:20.970> make<00:02:21.120> it

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
squeaking noise and actually can make it

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.610 
squeaking noise and actually can make it
seem<00:02:21.510> as<00:02:21.810> though<00:02:21.840> you're<00:02:22.140> running<00:02:22.380> over<00:02:22.500> a

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
seem as though you're running over a

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.530 
seem as though you're running over a
flock<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:22.980> ducks<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.150> point<00:02:24.330> where<00:02:24.450> you

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
flock of ducks to the point where you

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.090 
flock of ducks to the point where you
have<00:02:24.600> horrible<00:02:25.140> noise<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.620> all<00:02:25.710> sorts<00:02:26.040> of

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
have horrible noise and all sorts of

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.890 
have horrible noise and all sorts of
very<00:02:26.310> disconcerting<00:02:26.910> vibrations<00:02:27.570> with<00:02:27.780> your

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
very disconcerting vibrations with your

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.260 
very disconcerting vibrations with your
bike<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.950> basically<00:02:29.400> take<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.820> couple<00:02:30.090> minutes

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
bike so basically take a couple minutes

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.240 
bike so basically take a couple minutes
to<00:02:30.630> dial<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:31.080> your<00:02:31.200> brakes<00:02:31.440> make<00:02:31.890> sure<00:02:32.100> that

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
to dial in your brakes make sure that

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.040 
to dial in your brakes make sure that
all<00:02:32.370> your<00:02:32.400> cables<00:02:32.910> are<00:02:33.060> properly<00:02:33.420> lubricated

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
all your cables are properly lubricated

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.540 
all your cables are properly lubricated
make<00:02:34.500> sure<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.800> you're<00:02:34.950> running<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.280> chrome

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
make sure that you're running a chrome

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.580 
make sure that you're running a chrome
rim<00:02:35.820> good<00:02:36.150> brake<00:02:36.360> pads<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.930> you'll<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.380> very

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
rim good brake pads and you'll be very

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.580 
rim good brake pads and you'll be very
happy<00:02:37.830> with<00:02:38.040> your<00:02:38.190> brake<00:02:38.340> setup
