higher court higher than average players
and<00:03:10.319> obviously<00:03:10.950> because<00:03:11.129> it's<00:03:11.280> ten<00:03:11.489> divisions

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
and obviously because it's ten divisions

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.599 
and obviously because it's ten divisions
it<00:03:11.969> may<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.150> kind<00:03:12.299> of<00:03:12.359> makes<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:13.159> the<00:03:14.159> jump<00:03:14.400> up

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
it may it kind of makes the the jump up

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.459 
it may it kind of makes the the jump up
from<00:03:14.639> each<00:03:15.000> division<00:03:15.150> seems<00:03:15.959> small<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.439> i

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.469 
from each division seems small like i

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.050 
from each division seems small like i
was<00:03:16.620> either<00:03:16.709> it's<00:03:16.889> only<00:03:17.040> five<00:03:17.280> there's<00:03:17.849> quite

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
a huge jump from each one I mean there

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.780 
a huge jump from each one I mean there
is<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.799> don't<00:03:19.949> really<00:03:20.040> think<00:03:20.129> there<00:03:20.370> is<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.729> be

this video the reason i've done that is

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.540 
this video the reason i've done that is
because<00:05:09.960> I<00:05:09.990> could<00:05:10.530> literally<00:05:10.770> waffle<00:05:11.190> on<00:05:11.280> for

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
because I could literally waffle on for

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.920 
because I could literally waffle on for
about<00:05:11.610> 30-40<00:05:12.300> minutes<00:05:12.510> of<00:05:12.570> all<00:05:12.780> the

information I've got so far I wanna

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.430 
information I've got so far I wanna
split<00:05:15.090> up<00:05:15.180> into<00:05:15.300> categories<00:05:15.510> or<00:05:15.930> so<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.229> don't

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
split up into categories or so I don't

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.659

quite<00:05:17.910> important<00:05:18.419> and<00:05:18.570> I<00:05:19.229> don't<00:05:19.440> end<00:05:19.620> up

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
quite important and I don't end up
