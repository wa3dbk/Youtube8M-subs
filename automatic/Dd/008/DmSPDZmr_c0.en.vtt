like<00:00:18.240> ascensions<00:00:18.900> release<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.619> hope<00:00:20.609> that

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
like ascensions release I hope that

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.660 
like ascensions release I hope that
George<00:00:21.240> will<00:00:22.020> be<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.619> map<00:00:22.890> like<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
George will be in this map like on the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.420 
George will be in this map like on the
consoles<00:00:24.210> because<00:00:25.140> without<00:00:25.320> him<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.220> map

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
consoles because without him the map

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.210 
consoles because without him the map
just<00:00:26.460> wouldn't<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.119> same<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.840> am<00:00:28.830> led<00:00:29.189> to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
just wouldn't be the same I am led to

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.550 
just wouldn't be the same I am led to
believe<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.880> Deadshot<00:00:30.539> will<00:00:30.810> be<00:00:30.929> added<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
believe that Deadshot will be added and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.040 
believe that Deadshot will be added and
a<00:00:32.189> slight<00:00:32.460> chance<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.940> mule<00:00:33.270> kick<00:00:33.630> will<00:00:33.899> be

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
a slight chance that mule kick will be

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.880 
a slight chance that mule kick will be
also<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:35.270> consoles<00:00:36.270> mule<00:00:36.690> kick<00:00:36.989> wasn't<00:00:37.530> added

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
also on consoles mule kick wasn't added

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.549 
also on consoles mule kick wasn't added
until<00:00:38.219> moon<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.329> creators<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.899> black<00:00:40.379> ops

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
until moon but the creators of black ops

zombies for iOS have stated that it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.470 
zombies for iOS have stated that it
would<00:00:43.649> take<00:00:43.890> them<00:00:44.100> over<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.550> year<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.090> recreate

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
would take them over a year to recreate

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.069 
would take them over a year to recreate
I<00:00:46.430> really<00:00:47.430> hope<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.879> they<00:00:48.180> incorporate<00:00:48.809> at

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
I really hope that they incorporate at

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.779 
I really hope that they incorporate at
least<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> wonder<00:00:50.100> weapons<00:00:50.489> from

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
least one of the wonder weapons from

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.930 
least one of the wonder weapons from
this<00:00:51.000> map<00:00:51.270> whether<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> VR<00:00:52.920> 11<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this map whether it be the VR 11 or the

this map whether it be the VR 11 or the
scavenger<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.410> Wunderwaffe<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.300> if<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
scavenger or the Wunderwaffe and if the

scavengers<00:00:58.020> site<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.070> an<00:00:59.219> issue<00:00:59.370> they<00:01:00.180> could

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
scavengers site is an issue they could

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.630 
scavengers site is an issue they could
easily<00:01:00.899> make<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> thundergun<00:01:02.309> where

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
easily make it like the thundergun where

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.179 
easily make it like the thundergun where
it<00:01:02.760> can't<00:01:03.000> aim<00:01:03.239> down<00:01:03.480> sights<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.890> iron

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
it can't aim down sights or have iron

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.050 
it can't aim down sights or have iron
sights<00:01:05.580> like<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.030> ptrs<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:07.080> world<00:01:07.260> at<00:01:07.439> war

guys<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.460> too<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.770> largest

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
guys are too because this is the largest

Wunderwaffe which hopefully will

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.290 
Wunderwaffe which hopefully will
be<00:02:13.980> added<00:02:14.340> or<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.880> could<00:02:15.090> be<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.680> hit<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.920> miss

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300
