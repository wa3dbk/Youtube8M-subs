of the subject could we build a story

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.129 
of the subject could we build a story
that<00:02:45.480> had<00:02:45.659> characters<00:02:46.409> of<00:02:46.909> strong<00:02:47.909> women<00:02:48.209> can

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.690 
we look at the theatrical world that
might<00:02:51.540> give<00:02:51.810> us<00:02:51.930> an<00:02:52.079> idea<00:02:52.469> of<00:02:52.669> what<00:02:53.669> a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
might give us an idea of what a

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.390 
might give us an idea of what a
matriarchal<00:02:54.359> society<00:02:54.989> would<00:02:55.169> look<00:02:55.319> like<00:02:55.500> so

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
matriarchal society would look like so

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.399 
matriarchal society would look like so
for<00:02:56.609> me<00:02:56.730> because<00:02:57.000> my<00:02:57.030> interest<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.689> classics<00:02:58.290> I

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
for me because my interest of classics I

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.530 
for me because my interest of classics I
thought<00:02:58.650> about<00:02:58.949> Shakespeare<00:02:59.639> I<00:02:59.849> thought

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
thought about Shakespeare I thought

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.939 
thought about Shakespeare I thought
about<00:03:00.840> Mozart<00:03:01.590> operas<00:03:02.189> I<00:03:02.459> thought<00:03:03.060> about

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:03.949 
about Mozart operas I thought about

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.530 
about Mozart operas I thought about
ancient<00:03:04.949> sources<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.549> theater<00:03:05.939> in<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.359> Greek

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
ancient sources of theater in the Greek

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.080 
ancient sources of theater in the Greek
mythology<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:07.349> started<00:03:08.340> pulling<00:03:08.699> different

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
mythology and started pulling different

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.140 
mythology and started pulling different
ideas<00:03:09.719> together<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.379> build<00:03:10.669> what<00:03:11.669> we<00:03:11.699> have<00:03:12.120> I

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
ideas together to build what we have I

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.620 
ideas together to build what we have I
think<00:03:12.299> a<00:03:12.599> unique<00:03:12.989> story<00:03:13.319> for<00:03:13.650> our<00:03:13.969> 2012<00:03:14.969> show

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.030 

so<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.830> story<00:03:20.190> for<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.520> show<00:03:21.890> introduces<00:03:22.890> the
