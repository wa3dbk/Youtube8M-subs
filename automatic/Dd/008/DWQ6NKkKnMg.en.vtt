00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.629
 Sweaty wet hands a shaky voice 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.580
 a flabby belly feeling 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.860
 Almost everyone knows the unpleasant 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.139
 accompaniments in presentations 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.179
 how to have more presence and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.820
 broadcasting on the stage 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.119
 explains body language expert monika 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.060
 the golden rule is it 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.769
 passion is what i do 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.019
 that has to be completely convinced time 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.240
 because if I believe in something if 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.369
 because I beam it automatically after 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.640
 outside and therefore everyone should 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.020
 really think about it really 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.020
 that's what he does 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.690
 So what should you really do 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.879
 refrain from presentations 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.460
 that starts with the attitude when I 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.350
 really in a s form of audience 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.570
 stand with such a sunken and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.640
 then I can not on the breast 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.469
 go stage and say I'm glad 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.660
 very much that I speak to them today 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.350
 he can not because the spark jumps under 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.080
 because another logo would be then that eg 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.659
 you look does not move you 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.090
 is absolutely paralyzed on the stage 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.729
 and perfect stiff and one speaks 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 with the stares to the audience too 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.040
 People will not be in this form 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.860
 winning is not another no 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.409
 go is that you used sharp gestures 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.259
 what are called peak peaks guest 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.390
 that means a professional shoots with 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.409
 other people's finger up 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.630
 other people 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.270
 when I'm constantly listening to the listener 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.820
 shoot then I have to live with it 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.790
 If the listener suddenly like 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.750
 no longer heard or negative 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.909
 to react to me 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.729
 then another no-go would be natural 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.369
 Also that I have the downward movements 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.299
 do that permanently with mine 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.240
 poor from top to bottom work that way 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.009
 i never transfer the energy 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.590
 more negative gestures while he 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.320
 Maybe we just do this 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.630
 Use loose wrists because if 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.180
 I am wearing a very loose wrist 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.950
 really insecure and very weak and 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.410
 the one most like a skin 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.130
 of course on people who are very weak 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.350
 Act 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.570
 you just have to look at it 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.900
 Pay attention how do I think mine 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.930
 a no-go would be if I had the head 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.270
 wear my head too high when I am so with the 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.430
 audience spokesman then I can do so 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.070
 I often say that is very 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.310
 sympathetic but radiant in reality 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.370
 I'm from na so you do not care about me and 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.050
 I seem arrogantly a no-go but 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.860
 also that from the bottom up 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.260
 look 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:55.380
 because if I do that then I work 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:57.810
 very insecure that is not synonymous if 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.910
 I go to a stage then I should 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.980
 to take the optimal position 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.900
 that means I try with me 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.110
 both legs firmly on the ground 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.390
 I have my breast on let my 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.060
 fall shoulder area and I sit down 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.000
 a virtual crown on his head 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.520
 in this attitude I stand upright 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.950
 I feel stronger and I work too 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.810
 much more sovereign 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.210
 then what should I still respect me 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.920
 should take care that I am from time to time 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.380
 with the poor from top to bottom 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.450
 work because when I do that and 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.340
 then make these upward movements 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.760
 It looks like I'm human 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.510
 I should point out something else 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.510
 pay attention that I steer with firm arm 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.380
 work because when I steer tight arm 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.880
 with my gestures then use 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.959
 i transfer the energy to mine 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.740
 across from 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.030
 and of course you should be on too 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.690
 pay attention to the face like that 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.060
 facial expression with an angry mine 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.030
 you do not arrive at the audience 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.520
 that's why the golden rule is 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.640
 At the beginning you just listen to the listeners 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.650
 small smile a gentle smile 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.240
 because the smile that sends out that 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.240
 come back to me too
