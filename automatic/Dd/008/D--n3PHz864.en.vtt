 hello people you see the channel of teck 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.540
 I am the carlo and today goes 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.939
 it's about this fancy phone that's that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.640
 galaxy 2 or even y or even young 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.949
 called and how I root on it 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.410
 When should we get access 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.969
 also at the same time 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.610
 First and foremost, you have to file 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.980
 download the link you will find below 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.730
 the video that is an update zip and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.620
 you do not need to unpack them or in 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.350
 to pull any subfolder but 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 just on the internal memory 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.750
 over copy 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.890
 about usb so i have this cellphone now 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.899
 not flooded yet 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:02.210
 that means everything is live and now 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:04.439
 Although you only have to pay attention that the mobile phone 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.880
 if possible more than half loaded 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.180
 even if the process itself is not 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.650
 I will take this for so long 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.540
 maybe that should turn off normally 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.460
 I'm shortening everything here now 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.820
 a bit you have to be louder then 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.900
 key the home button and the button 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 Press the button at the same time 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:32.479
 and that until the screen 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.479
 comes on the internet daily 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.290
 so important is that they really all 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.290
 holds three together 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.950
 and here you are already in the boot menu 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.230
 you must then with the louder and quieter 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.030
 set aside here as always behind 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.640
 you can see 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:59.340
 then go to eppler update from sd 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.440

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.230

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:12.690

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.150

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.440

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.790
