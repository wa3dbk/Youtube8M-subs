00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.860 
small symptoms of hlb or citrus greening
have<00:02:26.100> been<00:02:26.250> observed<00:02:26.670> during<00:02:27.060> field<00:02:27.300> surveys

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
have been observed during field surveys

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.320 
have been observed during field surveys
and<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:28.710> provided<00:02:29.040> on-site<00:02:29.370> training<00:02:30.120> for

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
and have provided on-site training for

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.810 
and have provided on-site training for

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.090 

then<00:02:35.820> modeled<00:02:36.300> fruit<00:02:37.130> it's<00:02:38.130> also<00:02:38.310> lopsided<00:02:40.100> so

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
then modeled fruit it's also lopsided so

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.410 
then modeled fruit it's also lopsided so
you<00:02:41.190> might<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.610> tree<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.060> might<00:02:42.240> not

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
you might have a tree that might not

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.090 
you might have a tree that might not
show<00:02:42.690> all<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.080> symptoms<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.650> might<00:02:43.800> show<00:02:44.070> a

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
show all the symptoms it might show a

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.740 
show all the symptoms it might show a
couple<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.640> them<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.030> might<00:02:45.210> be<00:02:45.330> variable

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
couple of them and it might be variable

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.900 
couple of them and it might be variable
is<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.380> might<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.590> variable<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.640> tree

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
is that it might be variable this tree

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.090 
is that it might be variable this tree
seems<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.390> have<00:02:48.570> more<00:02:48.840> fruit<00:02:49.290> symptoms<00:02:49.770> then

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
seems to have more fruit symptoms then

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.460 
seems to have more fruit symptoms then
foliar<00:02:51.090> symptoms<00:02:51.600> although<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.080> foliar

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
foliar symptoms although the foliar

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.560 
foliar symptoms although the foliar
symptoms<00:02:52.950> are<00:02:53.160> there<00:02:56.060> yeah<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.090> don't<00:02:57.180> see<00:02:57.360> very

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
symptoms are there yeah I don't see very

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.820 
symptoms are there yeah I don't see very
much<00:02:57.690> model<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.620> particular<00:03:00.440> scene<00:03:01.440> here

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
much model on this particular scene here

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.030 
much model on this particular scene here
a<00:03:02.040> little<00:03:02.760> bit<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.360> could<00:03:03.540> pass<00:03:03.750> for

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
a little bit but that could pass for

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.910 
a little bit but that could pass for
Romanies<00:03:05.040> deficiency<00:03:05.880> yeah<00:03:06.740> yeah<00:03:07.740> if<00:03:07.830> you

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
Romanies deficiency yeah yeah if you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.949 
Romanies deficiency yeah yeah if you
just<00:03:08.160> had<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.610> you'd<00:03:09.150> say<00:03:09.360> oh<00:03:09.390> we<00:03:09.780> have<00:03:09.930> a

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
just had that you'd say oh we have a

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.160 
just had that you'd say oh we have a
manganese<00:03:10.440> problem<00:03:11.450> but<00:03:12.450> that's<00:03:12.750> why<00:03:12.959> it's

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
manganese problem but that's why it's

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.830 
manganese problem but that's why it's
important<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.830> take<00:03:14.070> good<00:03:14.100> notes<00:03:14.780> about<00:03:15.780> your

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
important to take good notes about your

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.650 
important to take good notes about your
tree<00:03:16.530> when<00:03:17.489> you're<00:03:17.730> sampling<00:03:19.970> this<00:03:20.970> mile<00:03:21.300> here

maybe a leaf liner no no this might be

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.710 
maybe a leaf liner no no this might be
greening<00:03:25.739> model<00:03:26.190> as<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.180> can<00:03:27.330> see<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.600> from

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
greening model as you can see it from

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.720 
greening model as you can see it from
the<00:03:27.870> back<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.380> there's<00:03:28.560> no<00:03:28.769> leaf<00:03:29.070> miner<00:03:29.370> to

the back and there's no leaf miner to

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.630 
the back and there's no leaf miner to
account<00:03:30.120> for<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.890> Susan<00:03:31.890> if<00:03:32.070> they're<00:03:32.220> psyllids

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
account for it Susan if they're psyllids

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.009 
account for it Susan if they're psyllids
would<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.850> be<00:03:32.970> worthwhile<00:03:33.180> collecting

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
would it be worthwhile collecting

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:34.580 
would it be worthwhile collecting
psyllids

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
psyllids

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.070 
psyllids
I<00:03:36.739> think<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.860> would<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.480> think<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.810> would<00:03:39.959> be

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
I think it would I think it would be

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.840 
I think it would I think it would be
worthwhile<00:03:40.320> because<00:03:40.890> sometimes<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.640> can't

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
worthwhile because sometimes you can't

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.730 
worthwhile because sometimes you can't
find<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:43.200> bacteria<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.310> psyllids

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
find the bacteria and the psyllids

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.110 
find the bacteria and the psyllids
easily<00:03:46.220> as<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.370> can<00:03:46.640> find<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.330> leaves

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
easily as you can find it in leaves

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.300 
easily as you can find it in leaves
we've<00:03:50.120> done<00:03:50.330> quite<00:03:50.570> a<00:03:50.660> few<00:03:51.070> surveys<00:03:52.070> in

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
we've done quite a few surveys in

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.280 
we've done quite a few surveys in
Florida<00:03:52.730> for<00:03:52.970> such<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.510> screening<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.110> one

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
Florida for such a screening and one

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.240 
Florida for such a screening and one
symptom<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:54.800> we<00:03:55.300> often<00:03:56.300> record<00:03:56.810> as<00:03:57.250> dieback

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
symptom that we often record as dieback

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.780 
symptom that we often record as dieback
symptom<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.510> it's<00:03:59.870> basically<00:04:00.550> when<00:04:01.550> the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
symptom and it's basically when the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.910 
symptom and it's basically when the
branch<00:04:02.330> starts<00:04:02.780> dying<00:04:03.020> back<00:04:03.320> from<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.710> tip

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
branch starts dying back from the tip

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.050 
branch starts dying back from the tip
and<00:04:04.610> in<00:04:05.390> general<00:04:05.780> we<00:04:05.930> try<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.850> estimate<00:04:07.850> the

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
and in general we try to estimate the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.140 
and in general we try to estimate the
percentage<00:04:08.540> dive<00:04:08.870> back<00:04:09.110> on<00:04:09.800> a<00:04:09.890> given<00:04:10.310> tree<00:04:10.550> and

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
percentage dive back on a given tree and

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.920 
percentage dive back on a given tree and
then<00:04:11.870> over<00:04:12.830> time<00:04:13.100> we<00:04:13.670> we<00:04:14.060> try<00:04:14.270> to<00:04:14.330> see<00:04:14.570> if<00:04:14.750> that

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
then over time we we try to see if that

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.590 
then over time we we try to see if that
dive<00:04:15.200> back<00:04:15.470> increases<00:04:16.250> or<00:04:16.400> decreases<00:04:16.600> and

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
dive back increases or decreases and

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.620 
dive back increases or decreases and
this<00:04:18.110> is<00:04:18.290> for<00:04:18.500> trees<00:04:18.709> that<00:04:19.150> may<00:04:20.150> be<00:04:20.209> in<00:04:20.540> the

leaf miner you turn it over and there's

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.290 
leaf miner you turn it over and there's
the<00:04:30.320> mine<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:34.490> this<00:04:35.480> one<00:04:35.690> is<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.170> fungus<00:04:36.650> you
