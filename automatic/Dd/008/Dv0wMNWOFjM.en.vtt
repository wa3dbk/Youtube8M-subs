 and one of the most popular 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.360
 Winter sports of the German 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.250
 Figure skating how hard it is 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.589
 to move elegantly over the ice 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:44.260
 This can be found out today for you and 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.449

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.390
 this year will be the Olympic 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.190
 winter games in sochi instead of hypo shows 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.710
 you now where that they are on the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.320
 there is in the world 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.129
 West Russia directly on the Black Sea 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.600
 For the approximately 2200 kilometers of airline 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.189
 you need about six with the plane 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.590
 hours, the motto of this year's 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:09.939
 games is hot cool 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.890
 to be cool in German means to be the motto 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.020
 Among other things, the landscape should 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.939
 describe the diversity of Russia in the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.439
 south of the country is the climate was 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.750
 while in the north and in the 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.460
 mountainous areas with ice and winter 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.840
 snow gives 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.479
 It should also winter games for 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.920
 to become anyone 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.990
 yes I would say it was already 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.429
 not bad yes yes I am myself 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.170
 also curious as I get bored 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.210
 Mostly because I have never been cut off 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.280
 has already confessed my premiere 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.079
 Let's see what comes out when 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.469
 you come to a two coaches there 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.859
 yes, yes 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:44.999
 hello I have my skates on 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.999
 from me you can start 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.180
 I think it needs a bit more 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.160
 until you have to be sure on the skids 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.720
 until then we will look at each other like that 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.760
 Figure skating actually originated 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.790
 the origin of the professional 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.760
 Figure skating It is located in the UK 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.060
 There was the first skating club in 1742 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.170
 founded in 1814 and the first 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.910
 Competition in figure skating 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.580
 the first historical records 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.069
 but go to the year 1134 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.000
 Back then, the denmark spoke 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.400
 people even from there skating much later 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.510
 a distinction is made between figure skating 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.670
 and speed skating in 1908 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.370
 the sport of figure skating olympic and 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.379
 is thus the oldest Olympic winter 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:02.680
 Discipline divided into single run 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:05.549
 Couple running as dancing and in sync 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.549
 figure skating 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.070
 especially women had it for a long time 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.570
 hovering as a trickle of art they have to 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.450
 to the victorian dress code 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.950
 Keep up with long heavy back and forth 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.180
 little freedom of movement 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.090
 From 1924 the skirts were finally shorter 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.160
 be good that I do not wear a skirt 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.080
 I must go on with a few more 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.990
 Exercises now shown as I strike 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.040
 Me as your beginner I have to 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.830
 say that you are from 1 to 6 from the note 2 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.120
 I am glad what do you mean 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.420
 actually quite good because all children 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.420
 fall right behind the cry then 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.110
 they are no longer equal to it is 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.870
 yes , everything pretty much 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.570
 Professional for how long since 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:56.970
 one has been standing up for five and a half 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:59.150
 the skate and me already one 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.320
 Whole way, what excites you 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.120
 just if you have the music then 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.160
 you can just dance to it and on 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.930
 a simple no and the jump 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.120
 when you jump up there you feel like 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.320
 the air around you is flying, so to speak 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.360
 and what you particularly like that they 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.580
 then always explain topics to us 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.900
 We are the then learn it's done 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.970
 always so great exercise so 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.919
 pirouettes and so masterfully we can 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.450
 also something to show it off 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.780
 are many things you still show 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.030
 can 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.110
 I would then try to say s of times 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.110
 and see what comes out 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.629
 beautiful 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.039
 while the number continues with manuel 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.199
 I am working hard with this 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.780
 Verena Thibault trainer skating 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.250
 club in nuremberg 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.560
 Figure skating always looks so easy and 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.370
 It really is elegant 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.050
 no, it's not just hard work 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.810
 also on dry ice during dry training 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.900
 also in the ballet room so that's what it's like 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.270
 playful looks in the end is quite 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.430
 a lot of work until a pumping right 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.229
 You can say it is half past time 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.330
 year passes, there is somehow 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.699
 certain tip when you skate 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.199
 wants to start 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.539
 yes you have to have fun first 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.930
 bring along fun 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:33.060
 Discipline but also and what do you think 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.620
 What are the chances for the Germans? 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.349
 figure skaters now at olympia in 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.990
 sochi so the german couple has good 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.490
 Chances on the Olympic victory as it were 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.770
 Now always take turns with the Russians 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.580
 first or second I think it was the 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.580
 decide daily form 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:58.819
 what they mean because as reflected 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.580
 our manuel for the first 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.409
 tried that well and well 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.419
 is also brave enough and has everything 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.419
 did what the girls showed 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:13.369
 hjs really exhausting and on tv 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:15.019
 It all looks a lot easier though 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:25.789
 I think I'm fine 

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:27.800
 struck or my conclusion of the day is 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.360
 I look at skating yet 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.559
 rather on television and pushes 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.300
 at olympia in germany live the 

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:34.579
 thumb, I think so I will too
