inspired<00:01:37.020> by<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.229> Holy<00:01:37.350> copter<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.009> followed

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
inspired by the Holy copter I followed

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.490 
inspired by the Holy copter I followed
her<00:01:38.700> tutorial<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.140> think<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
her tutorial on this and I think it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.710 
her tutorial on this and I think it
turned<00:01:40.710> out<00:01:40.770> okay<00:01:41.100> actually<00:01:41.570> however<00:01:42.570> it's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
turned out okay actually however it's

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.480 
turned out okay actually however it's
nowhere<00:01:43.110> near<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.470> good<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.740> hers<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.250> mean<00:01:44.460> I

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
nowhere near as good as hers I mean I

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.069 
nowhere near as good as hers I mean I
didn't<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> cross<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.420> mall<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> had<00:01:46.049> to

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
didn't have a cross and mall so I had to

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.230 
didn't have a cross and mall so I had to
hand<00:01:46.380> sculpted<00:01:46.619> cross<00:01:47.009> font<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> face

hand sculpted cross font and the face

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.999 
hand sculpted cross font and the face
looks<00:01:48.509> nowhere<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.110> near<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.409> good<00:01:49.590> as<00:01:49.799> hers

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
looks nowhere as near as good as hers

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950

so the last thing I'm going to show you
is<00:02:16.620> something<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.129> spent<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.579> lot<00:02:17.819> of<00:02:17.849> time

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
is something that I spent a lot of time

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.800 
is something that I spent a lot of time
on<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.810> made<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.680> llama<00:02:20.040> cookie<00:02:20.489> key<00:02:20.730> cap<00:02:21.000> so

on I made this llama cookie key cap so

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.780 
on I made this llama cookie key cap so
it<00:02:22.019> does<00:02:22.230> work<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:22.769> fits<00:02:22.980> perfectly<00:02:23.069> on<00:02:23.640> my

it does work and it fits perfectly on my
key<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:24.989> basically<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.860> frosted

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
key so it's basically just this frosted

and shaded the cookie part and it turned

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.089 
and shaded the cookie part and it turned
out<00:02:39.150> pretty<00:02:39.359> good<00:02:39.690> there<00:02:40.409> are<00:02:40.620> some<00:02:40.859> air

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
bubbles which can be seen on the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.839 
bubbles which can be seen on the
frosting<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.379> I<00:02:43.650> don't<00:02:44.310> really<00:02:44.400> mind<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.760> be

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
frosting but I don't really mind to be

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.729 
frosting but I don't really mind to be
honest<00:02:45.090> because<00:02:45.209> I'm<00:02:45.390> really<00:02:45.629> happy<00:02:45.810> with<00:02:46.319> how

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
honest because I'm really happy with how

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.220 
honest because I'm really happy with how
this<00:02:47.220> turned<00:02:47.280> out<00:02:47.609> has<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.269> bow<00:02:48.569> right<00:02:48.900> here

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230

this turned out has this bow right here
and<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.769> think<00:02:49.829> this<00:02:50.010> adds<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.310> really<00:02:50.430> nice

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
and I think this adds a really nice

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.430 
and I think this adds a really nice
touch<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.359> then<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.629> course<00:02:51.659> i<00:02:51.989> added<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.230> ball

took a lot of time and effort took a lot
of<00:03:00.120> planning<00:03:00.389> and<00:03:00.659> thinking<00:03:00.720> about<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:01.650> if
