00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.560
 in this video we are going to show you how 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.650
 make a broth 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.960
 of beef thigh with vegetables or soup 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.770
 re thigh comments some 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.370
 details of this recipe for example is 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.760
 what 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.140
 the meat will cook for 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.450
 about an hour and a half to two hours 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.570
 depending on how much meat you use and 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.660
 If you have a clear pressure cooker 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.360
 can reduce these drastically but 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.579
 otherwise the meat if you plan to cook 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.409
 for a long time 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.219
 as you see the meat is going to be added 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:44.440
 directly to a pot where there is 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.679
 approximately I would say about 6 cups of 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.949
 water was used a one cup complete the rate 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:54.480
 these are from a complete blender for 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:58.030
 is to put this meat 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.559
 here you see the meat in the pot ok 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.360
 and here we are going to simply add 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.580
 garlic onion 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.980
 this is all one a tablespoon one 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.010
 generous spoonful of salt 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.920
 and it's going to be covered and it's going to be cooked 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.140
 about an hour and a half 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.330
 and we are already seeing this is already after 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.900
 of the hour and a half we are seeing the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.170
 cooked meat 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.850
 we are going to add chopped tomato and 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.009
 Serrano chiles if you prefer 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.150
 We here put chili until the 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.910
 eggs at breakfast 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.300
 here we are adding the potato the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.570
 carrot and the chayote these the 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.480
 we cook for about 10 to 15 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.650
 minutes depending how crispy to 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.320
 you likes these vegetables 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.260
 we are also adding our sheet 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.000
 of mint or mint as it is known 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:02.180
 in many places of about 10 hours or more 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.170
 We are adding a seasoning envelope with 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:10.070
 saffron and the last thing we're going to add 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.709
 at the end is broccoli and pumpkin 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.020
 we are using a pumpkin that 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.910
 it's not the common pumpkin is like a 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.130
 zucchini 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.230
 It seems as if it were a zucchini 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.599
 but it is not subtle 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.140
 this is added at the end and only 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:30.830
 we cook them for 5 to 10 minutes maximum 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.930
 to really preserve it well 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.739
 crispy us here we like the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.040
 crispy vegetables not enough that 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.530
 they preserve in certain freshness 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.349
 that's all they need for this 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.019
 very simple tasty recipe 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.950
 we hope you prepare it and that you have 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.950
 very good
