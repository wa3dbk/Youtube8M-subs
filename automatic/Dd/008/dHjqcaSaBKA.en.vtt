and as you can see that we've got a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.520 
and as you can see that we've got a
little<00:01:59.610> bit<00:01:59.760> of<00:01:59.790> smoke<00:02:00.090> coming<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
little bit of smoke coming out of the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.630 
little bit of smoke coming out of the
hole<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:03.030> that's<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.220> gases<00:02:05.220> cooking

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
hole and that's just the gases cooking

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.210 
hole and that's just the gases cooking
off<00:02:05.790> from<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.790> cotton<00:02:08.790> material<00:02:08.940> as<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.770> a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
off from the cotton material as the as a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.770 
off from the cotton material as the as a
smoke<00:02:11.670> level<00:02:11.970> increases<00:02:12.390> will<00:02:12.480> actually<00:02:12.720> be

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
smoke level increases will actually be

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.940 
smoke level increases will actually be
able<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.960> like<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.380> because<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:13.680> mostly

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
able to like that because it's mostly

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.440 
able to like that because it's mostly
carbon<00:02:14.220> monoxide<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.000> that's<00:02:15.210> flammable

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
carbon monoxide and that's flammable

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.800 
carbon monoxide and that's flammable
which<00:02:16.380> also<00:02:16.560> said<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.070> great<00:02:17.280> timer<00:02:17.810> and

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
which also said is a great timer and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.220 
which also said is a great timer and

to do this indoors if not for the
obvious<00:02:26.310> fire<00:02:26.790> risk<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.720> because<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.800> smoke

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
obvious fire risk but because this smoke

00:02:29.070 --> 00:03:13.400 
obvious fire risk but because this smoke
really<00:02:29.370> doesn't<00:02:29.970> smell<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.180> real<00:02:30.390> flash

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
now as soon as that stops I just kill

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.120 
now as soon as that stops I just kill
the<00:03:22.020> gas<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.380> then<00:03:22.470> all<00:03:22.590> we<00:03:22.680> need<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.860> do<00:03:23.010> is

the gas and then all we need to do is

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.020 
the gas and then all we need to do is
just<00:03:23.160> let<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.880> ten<00:03:24.090> cool<00:03:24.300> down<00:03:24.650> obviously

just let the ten cool down obviously

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.330 
just let the ten cool down obviously
before<00:03:27.030> we<00:03:27.240> can<00:03:27.390> get<00:03:27.510> our<00:03:27.980> chocolate<00:03:28.980> out<00:03:29.160> and

before we can get our chocolate out and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:57.170 
before we can get our chocolate out and
check<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.850> out

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.940

that's it there are no more combustible

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.069 
that's it there are no more combustible

bit dodgy here so it's sort of

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.439 
bit dodgy here so it's sort of
one-handed<00:04:25.669> there<00:04:26.669> we<00:04:26.759> have<00:04:26.910> all<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.210> child

cloth<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:28.610> when<00:04:29.610> you're<00:04:29.729> making<00:04:30.000> is<00:04:30.120> but<00:04:30.360> you

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
cloth and when you're making is but you

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.129 
cloth and when you're making is but you
best<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.050> use<00:04:31.169> a<00:04:31.259> light<00:04:31.500> colored<00:04:31.889> cloth<00:04:33.139> just

so<00:04:34.229> that<00:04:34.349> you<00:04:34.410> can<00:04:34.520> really<00:04:35.520> tell<00:04:35.759> the

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
so that you can really tell the

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:36.830 
so that you can really tell the
difference<00:04:35.880> between<00:04:36.150> when<00:04:36.449> it's<00:04:36.599> ready<00:04:36.780> and

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
difference between when it's ready and

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.990 
difference between when it's ready and
when<00:04:36.990> it's<00:04:37.110> not<00:04:38.330> now<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.389> advantage<00:04:39.690> of<00:04:40.080> the

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
when it's not now the advantage of the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.980 
when it's not now the advantage of the
light<00:04:42.000> sheet<00:04:42.389> like<00:04:42.570> this<00:04:42.599> you<00:04:42.840> know<00:04:42.960> that

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
light sheet like this you know that

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.150 
light sheet like this you know that
you're<00:04:43.349> dealing<00:04:43.500> with<00:04:43.650> something<00:04:43.830> like<00:04:43.919> that

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
you're dealing with something like that

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.790 
you're dealing with something like that
this<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.210> also<00:04:45.419> very<00:04:45.720> easy<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.139> tear<00:04:46.380> how<00:04:46.620> much

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
this is also very easy to tear how much

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.180 
this is also very easy to tear how much
just<00:04:47.009> use<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.370> smaller<00:04:47.729> piece<00:04:48.889> especially<00:04:49.889> if

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
just use a smaller piece especially if

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.350 
just use a smaller piece especially if
you<00:04:50.250> want<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.430> pack<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.729> into<00:04:50.849> the<00:04:51.000> end<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.240> your

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
you want to pack it into the end of your

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.469 
you want to pack it into the end of your
fire<00:04:52.169> pit<00:04:52.199> as<00:04:52.590> i<00:04:52.620> shared<00:04:52.830> last<00:04:53.039> night<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.820> this

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
fire pit as i shared last night and this

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:05.230 
fire pit as i shared last night and this
will<00:04:54.690> take<00:04:54.840> a<00:04:54.900> spark<00:04:57.110> really<00:04:58.110> well

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.550 

and<00:05:06.240> we're<00:05:06.390> playing<00:05:06.540> fairly<00:05:06.870> slightly<00:05:07.290> and

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
and we're playing fairly slightly and

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.240 
and we're playing fairly slightly and
that's<00:05:07.800> it<00:05:07.980> all<00:05:08.190> is<00:05:08.730> very<00:05:08.940> simple
