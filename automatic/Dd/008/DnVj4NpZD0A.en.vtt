00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
analog stick i will explain a bit more

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.500 
analog stick i will explain a bit more
in<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.739> second<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.940> jump<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.390> the

hit this barrel you have to keep pushing

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.880 
hit this barrel you have to keep pushing
forward<00:01:02.340> when<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.480> turn<00:01:03.719> around<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.710> left

forward when you turn around on the left
analog<00:01:05.100> stick<00:01:05.280> hold<00:01:05.790> back<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.600> pretty<00:01:06.780> much

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
analog stick hold back you pretty much

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.810 
analog stick hold back you pretty much
like<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.439> holding<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> stay

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
like have to be holding so that you stay

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.100 
like have to be holding so that you stay
on<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.119> barrier<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.869> don't

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110

up there what we're holding the left

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.570 
up there what we're holding the left
analog<00:01:18.869> stick<00:01:19.110> backwards<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.860> forwards<00:01:20.159> etc

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
analog stick backwards and forwards etc

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.760 
analog stick backwards and forwards etc
etc<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:21.869> really<00:01:22.020> easy<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.590> as
