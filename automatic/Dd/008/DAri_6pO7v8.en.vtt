which<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> actually<00:02:02.610> read<00:02:03.360> some

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
which is that I actually read some

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.450 
which is that I actually read some
reviews<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.229> product<00:02:04.409> before<00:02:04.649> testing<00:02:05.399> it

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
reviews of the product before testing it

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.600 
reviews of the product before testing it
out<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:05.729> myself<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.420> what<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.399> discovered<00:02:08.399> was

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
out for myself and what I discovered was

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.339 
out for myself and what I discovered was
a<00:02:08.879> lot<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.360> comments<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.899> are<00:02:10.020> really<00:02:10.229> kind

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
a lot of comments that are really kind

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.699 
a lot of comments that are really kind
of<00:02:10.530> negative<00:02:10.920> about

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
of negative about

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.800 
of negative about
headphones<00:02:12.129> and<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:13.180> really<00:02:13.420> do<00:02:13.569> think<00:02:13.719> that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
headphones and I really do think that

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.660 
headphones and I really do think that
that<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.290> result<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.709> people<00:02:14.769> not<00:02:15.040> taking

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
that is the result of people not taking

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.910 
that is the result of people not taking
the<00:02:15.790> time<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.569> get<00:02:16.659> the<00:02:16.840> right<00:02:17.049> insert<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.769> the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
the time to get the right insert and the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.530 
the time to get the right insert and the
right<00:02:18.239> earpiece<00:02:19.469> for<00:02:20.469> their<00:02:20.859> particular<00:02:21.540> head

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
right earpiece for their particular head

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.559 
right earpiece for their particular head
once<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.439> got<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.769> right<00:02:23.950> ear<00:02:24.670> cut<00:02:24.969> piece<00:02:25.269> and

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
once I got the right ear cut piece and

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.569 
once I got the right ear cut piece and
the<00:02:25.780> right<00:02:25.959> ear<00:02:26.140> insert<00:02:26.590> piece<00:02:26.799> they<00:02:27.189> actually

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
the right ear insert piece they actually

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.520 
the right ear insert piece they actually
hold<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.269> very<00:02:28.299> very<00:02:28.659> well<00:02:28.959> they<00:02:29.170> seal<00:02:29.349> out<00:02:29.500> the

comfortable<00:02:32.489> they<00:02:33.489> are<00:02:33.689> certainly<00:02:34.689> more<00:02:35.139> of

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
comfortable they are certainly more of

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.979
