00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 hello dear to brisk today there is this 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.820
 small round treats we 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.140
 kickboxing there are many many 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.029
 recipes and there are also two 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.800
 fundamentally different preparation 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.899
 two years, it's cold 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.230
 cooked only the hot cake 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.710
 pops 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.450
 we start today hot variant with 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.770
 a very simple recipe and become 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.030
 us in the next few weeks then one 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.489
 increase a bit 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.589
 we need more for today's recipe 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.429
 baking powder salt butter sugar 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:46.649
 vanilla sugar eggs and milk and later 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.179
 on various ingredients to decorate yet 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.690
 We'll adapt to that when the time comes 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.699
 is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.260
 So we need to bake ourselves 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.929
 either the corresponding baking sheets 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.519
 or such machines here and there 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.170
 the price not too far apart 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.579
 So I have here for the cache 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.429
 pop maker decided 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.589
 with that on a swing twelve of these 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.930
 can bake delicious little things 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.620
 the dough will be ready for 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.690
 About 50 to 60 kickbox in a bowl 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:18.600
 we give 120 g soft butter and 225 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.210
 all that sugar will be around now 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.730
 nice bright and grim with the mixer 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:30.020
 now stir the vanilla sugar 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.020
 and the eggs added 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.600
 just a pinch of salt teaspoon 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.870
 baking powder and it brings nothing for 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.230
 to want to be generous 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.940
 otherwise likes to go 190 camel was still 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.620
 add and speak freely, I decide 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.710
 even have the recipe with helmet 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.510
 wheat flour with wheat perfectly and with 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.770
 Dinkel perfect test everything has 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.330
 works wonderfully 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.950
 and now two 125 milliliters of milk 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:07.520
 and everything will be nice again 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.440
 shaky dough shorts yes so looks 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.910
 great 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.980
 After the device has been ordered 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.530
 preheated we now fill the dough 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.870
 a so conwert with a 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.610
 make a pouch or with one 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.050
 spoon I decide for the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.030
 spoon largest part for each time 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:33.040
 is relatively large teaspoon and it will 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:35.270
 So filled almost to the top edge 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.120
 Baking time is then between three 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.010
 and five minutes so I have the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.530
 experience is really about 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.269
 four minutes is optimal to do so 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.989
 time has gone by as fast as four 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.470
 minutes are over we open 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:57.130
 will do the test and it will stay 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.100
 no time to hang 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.950
 so now you can say so 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.110
 Here's a small bell-a 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.090
 take another virtual in these 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.660
 out and set them up 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.459
 then cool it down later 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.680
 to be able to decorate and if the times 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.959
 a bit darker then let us 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.830
 a little bit in there so finder again 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:26.540
 Next charge and repeat the whole 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.400
 play until the dough is all we have 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.500
 So the preliminary result and after 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.959
 the cake pops are cool they will 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.880
 still integrate with cake for example 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.030
 Clerk dark or man 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.460
 with hazelnut known with food color 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.730
 and perhaps one or the other so 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.640
 thinks the dark look have klausur 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.820
 I made myself liquid in the microwave 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.730
 and now the cake pops become so 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.570
 is coated whether in the decoration 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.610
 done cake 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.050
 on a flat plate or as here 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:05.870
 in such a hurts does that 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:08.450
 legally so completely and so on 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.950
 part of it comes now almondkow 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.760
 can it, I have the only klausur 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.260
 packagings 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.530
 We are now looking after them 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.420
 other half of the kickbox i like this one 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.180
 klausur much he tastes a 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.770
 a bit after marzipan and here too 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.380
 let's go back to the po can hit 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.720
 less and now the glaze off 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.620
 dry in the west 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.480
 so now we come to one 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.170
 Creative part and still do all 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.170
 would have to be around 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.189
 like that and maybe always transforms 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.189
 a little more money 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.900
 maybe make a little one 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.900
 color combination 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.170
 But creativity should not be limited 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.170
 set 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.540
 they look pretty delicious too 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.540
 and gas cake pops would then have to be natural 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.610
 still on the mirror 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.770
 In the case is a colorful delicious ostrich 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.960
 cake pops ob birthday valentine's day 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.330
 or just come in between 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.460
 always good at decorating this year 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.590
 Imagine a lot of fun after that 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.830
 do it and see you next time 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.830
 bye
