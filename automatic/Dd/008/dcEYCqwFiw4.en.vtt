00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.799
 I welcome you all 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.000
 Welcome to our press conference 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.759
 the bundesliga match borussia dortmund 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.220
 against harmony frankfurt may him 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.280
 before that, give it away 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.170
 kevin bublitz from the performance group 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.960
 the huawei s &amp; p 2 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.149
 won in our sweepstakes 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.789
 congratulations both 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.350
 coach armin veh jürgen klop and please 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.350
 Armin veh for his comment on the game 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:37.970
 thinks the victory is also in the height in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:41.039
 order to get the score too soon 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.619
 but then hold on can hold on 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.990
 we can hold it for a long 0 0 but it 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.119
 but managed and then just only 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.850
 standard situation for the second time 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.890
 within the ride then carry the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.909
 2 0 and there was the game yes 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.590
 almost decided 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.299
 Football always was when it was you 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.740
 make a connection will be shortly before 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.590
 the break so situation with a 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.700
 Bullet hole comes and make up to 1 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.350
 then you would have a chance in the end 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.259
 of course, go out there from the mid-term 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.739
 and then again in the first minute 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.660
 make mistakes and there punished colorful 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.829
 old, the game is also the situation with us 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.930
 it's already there we already have to 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.090
 really be complete and have to 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.640
 have a really good day and off and 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.109
 maybe even tired are excessive 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.549
 Underestimate that we have a chance 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:28.680
 have I say it just goes too far 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:33.660
 apart as the gap in the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.070
 bundesliga between top clubs and the 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.720
 Teams fighting for it are too 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.920
 stay 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.109
 that's why i wish for the thermics 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:49.200
 of course, all the best with the first 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:50.519
 Space alone can do that for us 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.410
 the important games are coming to you now 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.760
 Home was I say no if you have to 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.620
 The games will stay at home 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.370
 win and now we have 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.690
 first motto but then comes bremen and 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.109
 that will be our very important game 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.620
 thank you very much thank you et jürgen how hast 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.620
 you saw the game 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:13.739
 yes that was strong from the first customer 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.459
 we were as strong as we were 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.479
 imagined 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.780
 october indicated that given names of 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:24.690
 mickey mickey and windows can be front of 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.620
 great and a bit of that 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.389
 shown ways 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.560
 the passways shows where the one German 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.290
 The same play will be done 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.109
 it is a relatively large amount of conquests 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.850
 not so easy then the balls too 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.370
 when we come out of a compact one 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.229
 Formation then defend out 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.430
 can 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.329
 used diagonal balls of the andra much 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.199
 better defended 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:51.660
 ben matlock or soot or whoever 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:53.519
 which then beats in on the young or that 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.290
 is still a bit in frankfurt 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.699
 unpleasant that he sometimes clear 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.259
 better done by this is the opponent 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:00.670
 the option has also been taken 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:02.650
 Gates made at the right time 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.610
 A great football game has been easy 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.520
 from my team with great super 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.069
 mentality and completely 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.470
 important that there not every day 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.780
 so all gates actually the perfect 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.329
 time did not make single early 2 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.840
 much later and 30 right after the 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.900
 half 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.500
 and 40 directly after the replacement 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.190
 Do not wish Frankfurt better 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.400
 Also, everything is good eur but also 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.690
 of course for the community I have 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.180
 especially such a good feeling 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.919
 that will work fine because the 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.990
 quality is simply high when passerby 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.310
 Rode missing then does that everyone 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.169
 team a bit more no question 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.200
 but still a lot 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.810
 quality all the best thank you nice 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.070
 if you ask from your round to the 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.229
 I'll hand over both coaches 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.340
 a short hand signal how fast we are 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.340
 go to the camera pedestal to 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.669
 I want you again, maybe 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.159
 a few words to the milos you are judith 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.889
 to say that was a change 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.990
 is 17 seconds and 16 frames it 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:25.990
 lasted until his first goal for 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:27.580
 the 16 17 seconds and 16 25 good ones 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.139
 Fortunately, football is the goal 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.669
 of course a happy circumstance kevin 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.159
 has started his 12 trial on 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.509
 today's day in the financial statements in the 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.370
 made world class game 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:40.870
 he has the left side right 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.539
 made operative and had him can I 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.849
 we keep our superspiel made 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.240
 and yet 4 that also said so 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.740
 little bit about our game today 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.939
 then there is power in and otherwise there 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.439
 I do not have much to say 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:56.199
 already said I do not like that so much 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:58.149
 if you introduce the boys again 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.469
 has to shoot for the winning goal so 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.119
 who does not know it all of them 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:02.830
 I have the recordings of me watching 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:05.229
 everything is not worse 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:12.339
 have become ten places in my last 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:15.159
 informative, there are other they ask 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:17.550
 scared heiko niedderer picture in the 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.550
 last row 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.370
 Today you have this big record of 

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:26.349
 ottmar hitzfeld what means 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.349
 this is a nice one to you personally 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:34.569
 number or a little bit more 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:35.860
 no, that's a nice number and me 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.870
 I'm surprised about the ones 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.699
 the high number of victories is 111 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.959
 great in the context falls to me 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.860
 but then only one example we 

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:45.550
 have lost and how are themselves 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.199
 have felt and somehow in the first 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.759
 I've already measured but 15 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.659
 undecided I believe I have been forever 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.059
 we have to wait again 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.649
 have as really say so it is 

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:55.449
 come because that's a great club 

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:56.800
 i am a fantastic coaching team at the 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:59.169
 off and on 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.639
 borussia dortmund also in the course of 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.250
 years about relatively good 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.330
 football teams has so 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.530
 accordingly was at that time 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.639
 probably not much different me 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:10.389
 Do not believe things yourself 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:11.919
 shot in 100 but okay 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.360
 if I imagine for a long time too 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:16.060
 home win can not yet 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:20.110
 be at 114 or something and that 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:22.780
 we see now time not more 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.159
 I do not think that's the case 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.110
 Thank you for your interest 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:27.400
 the entry is a good return journey 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.580
 good against postage and for the rest of the 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.580
 season
