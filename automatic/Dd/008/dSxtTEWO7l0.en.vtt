00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
have this old monitor see this is why I

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.790 
have this old monitor see this is why I
haven't<00:04:29.810> done<00:04:29.870> set<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.169> videos<00:04:30.259> because<00:04:30.710> I

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
haven't done set of videos because I

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.950 
haven't done set of videos because I
need<00:04:30.979> to<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.520> need<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.330> put<00:04:32.479> something<00:04:32.660> in<00:04:32.870> this

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
need to I need to put something in this

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.740 
need to I need to put something in this
room<00:04:33.199> but<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.650> had<00:04:33.830> this<00:04:33.979> old<00:04:34.160> monitor<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.849> think

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
room but I had this old monitor I think

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.570 
room but I had this old monitor I think
was<00:04:35.840> like<00:04:35.960> 120<00:04:36.740> bucks<00:04:36.949> and<00:04:37.250> it<00:04:37.340> works<00:04:37.490> just

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
was like 120 bucks and it works just

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.990 
was like 120 bucks and it works just
fine<00:04:37.849> it's<00:04:38.090> an<00:04:38.150> age<00:04:38.270> from<00:04:38.449> monitor<00:04:39.130> 60<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.610> think

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
fine it's an age from monitor 60 I think

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.760 
fine it's an age from monitor 60 I think
it's<00:04:41.120> 60<00:04:41.479> Hertz<00:04:41.720> or<00:04:41.930> something<00:04:42.259> like<00:04:42.590> the

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
it's 60 Hertz or something like the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.640 
it's 60 Hertz or something like the
refresh<00:04:43.069> rate<00:04:43.190> or<00:04:43.430> whatever<00:04:44.349> but<00:04:45.349> that<00:04:45.410> works

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
refresh rate or whatever but that works

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.820 
refresh rate or whatever but that works
