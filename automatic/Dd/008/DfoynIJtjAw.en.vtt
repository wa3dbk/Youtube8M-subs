00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.140
 I do what that was the other expected you to lower to new series that I 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.810
 wants to do that want to buy every Saturday and Tuesday from the klÃ¶den and 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.909
 unique cia non-dire food 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:14.359
 I can't do it, I actually got a lot out of it 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:18.029
 of course everyone wants nothing full of weapons but a bit the German I would 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.689
 also do together I did not want to anticipate 8 but not everyone the 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.779
 has an almost new law and so I think so a bit 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.159
 more original his or her where I for a new weapon 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:32.970
 the transmitting equipment v that would suit better 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.420
 but yes there we now have a number of other things that certainly applied now that I am 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.969
 name 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.109
 I understand of course with shower and kristel system at the top below 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:43.170
 I believe the eshop cards 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.940
 I am absolutely sure but first emmen sint settings list put peter 2000 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.730
 between 30 and I had I got on with it 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.170
 that is only that there is no external brand name on it 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.980
 that leaves a little more 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.750
 to i can hope i will learn very much on the map 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.220
 pretty much everyone yes it is that i ameland a bit and after the evening he is 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.340
 the only one who did something like that with mud disappeared alone or with 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.040
 plums mertens 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.300
 I know the dycker I have a little bit different to the newspaper that you learn and 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.660
 understand and 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.080
 that was that it always lost to the 2010 astrid world cup with time 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.710
 specifications about the ship with on 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.830
 twelve shots per second has a warehouse of twenty bullets and on 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.450
 then you have 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.400
 the pieces are the former international for less than two seconds 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.430
 and then 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.930
 in the worst case, then name is sometimes an old problem and after 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.160
 a tia de plus that is without them wanting Sunday but this does nothing 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.340
 to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.450
 after a 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.740
 I just had to go to the fire itself from March 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.909
 i think i would teach whole wolf release hours on this and that sick 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.270
 he stopped 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.890
 but there he has come from the elderly 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.940
 old game two with new content is that artists morgan dr 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.280
 and after a year i don't know if you are learning his movies too 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.970
 or this protein 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.069
 whether you are familiar with that but to 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.200
 the un second 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.280
 yes I got them say movies but mainly because that zuma was like incoming food 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.370
 yes if your teacher okay if you also like him from the mast masting ether 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.549
 name 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.949
 then just a program ries mar hd and after one 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.949
 in addition, just new comments entered and 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.799
 sled and maybe makes no sense 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.929
 more is not nice to me sometime just because you then because he 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:45.049
 what is a game play at or itself denies spd a bit for so anp 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.759
 Someone distinguishes itself by being a part of 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:51.149
 to have stayed present 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.709
 requests to agree 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.670
 what you can expect from my pedal sand and out in zaandam 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:00.629
 I hope after 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.179
 not for my kno but whether we have the poland polo projects channel 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:08.319
 probably comes to it and that role is coming and others just don't know much anymore 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.329
 to put on 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.029
 but out of the way on his channel and on 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:13.739
 I am very poor here 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.379
 from my own first volunteers that night and three-quarters of my CV 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.029
 He comes to cancel 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:23.329
 I say to me by quarter of an hour 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.549
 first was and 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.019
 jani on 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.499
 who goes and part comes again killing innocence etc 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.399
 yes probably but we just can't do it anymore because 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.039
 there we have what I wanted the dessert 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.139
 it is good that it comes and goes 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.069
 earlier on 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.310
 the pieces that the guest put on was one of the meise and moments of this game play 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.769
 and 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.229
 then comes and you 18 then the 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.959
 how surprising 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.859
 for many 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:58.719
 yes i am a little bit 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.989
 I have the human being as my yes it was my punishment 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.339
 and for all that to all 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:07.759
 both of them I have the place for the pnp to say nothing 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:12.209
 later mainly a comment with an arm that came the esm a ticket must 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.869
 I am not going to say that I have to use a doctor with this 

00:04:16.869 --> 00:04:20.150
 is one of the last circulation of paul and witteman that just doesn't just run from it 

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.460
 the time that what never used he makes yes 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.040
 what I think is the nicer story of contacts with this one too 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.490
 interest per year 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.099
 to use and 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:35.400
 that will be very nice and of course there is more 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.400
 in goal free especially on the cbs 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.599
 the Randstad so no killstreaks have appeared that wondered where 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.120
 but that 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.550
 think angry and with it 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.580
 but there I became myself through it again 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.450
 because and yes I can 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.949
 so she only has to come once and took after a hope that one 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.999
 decent game play 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:02.219
 to e 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.729
 further yes and 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:05.719
 I know 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:10.319
 I get I have the 39th stated smear and I get you every day 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.580
 iran party 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.580
 so that is really going to choke him I want you there 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.820
 yes i think that whatever you think oh well write that leaves him cold 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.139
 You know it didn't matter much 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.860
 I am really so happy that there are so many dust free we are now in my movies 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.839
 of liking and 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.470
 and that I am just happy with that and 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.479
 I now have a few problems with 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.240
 next to a few trouble 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.759
 i've always dragged some trouble 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.249
 najaf now I just have trouble with the last throat you go it 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:44.870
 stood very still for me 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.020
 I am so crazy about the game 2 of course 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.900
 three could put an end to ashtiani 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.010
 if you are more into healing aol from a health insurance fund i will make something happen again 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:55.740
 can 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.059
 then subscribe name 

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:02.779
 Lets come back with the pnp giving their thumbs up may they liked 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:06.659
 the favorite they already are always appreciated and the icse the last 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:07.210
