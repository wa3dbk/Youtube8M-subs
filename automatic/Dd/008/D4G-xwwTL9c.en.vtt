are some of the biggest challenges of
ebook<00:00:09.980> conversions<00:00:10.519> well<00:00:11.150> I<00:00:11.180> think<00:00:11.320> there's<00:00:12.320> a

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
ebook conversions well I think there's a

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.650 
ebook conversions well I think there's a
couple<00:00:12.920> of<00:00:13.070> major<00:00:13.250> ones<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:13.820> first<00:00:14.240> one<00:00:14.450> has

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
couple of major ones the first one has

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.209 
couple of major ones the first one has
to<00:00:14.690> do<00:00:14.990> with<00:00:15.139> the<00:00:15.230> fact<00:00:15.410> that<00:00:15.530> almost<00:00:15.950> all

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
to do with the fact that almost all

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.849 
to do with the fact that almost all
print<00:00:17.029> work<00:00:17.269> that<00:00:17.630> is<00:00:17.810> has<00:00:18.109> been<00:00:18.140> digitalised

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
print work that is has been digitalised

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.529 
print work that is has been digitalised
over<00:00:19.159> the<00:00:19.249> last<00:00:19.429> number<00:00:19.640> of<00:00:19.820> years<00:00:19.909> has<00:00:20.359> been

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.700 
put into PDF format now PDF format is
very<00:00:23.509> very<00:00:23.630> useful<00:00:23.900> when<00:00:24.169> it<00:00:24.409> comes<00:00:24.589> to

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
very very useful when it comes to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.259 
very very useful when it comes to
actually<00:00:25.009> producing<00:00:25.429> a<00:00:25.519> print<00:00:25.730> product<00:00:26.119> or

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
actually producing a print product or

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.120 
actually producing a print product or
replicating<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.140> actual<00:00:27.499> look<00:00:27.649> of<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:27.919> book

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
replicating the actual look of the book

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.859 
replicating the actual look of the book
but<00:00:28.579> it's<00:00:28.640> not<00:00:28.849> quite<00:00:28.999> so<00:00:29.269> useful<00:00:29.659> when<00:00:29.779> it

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
but it's not quite so useful when it

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.569 
but it's not quite so useful when it
actually<00:00:30.050> comes<00:00:30.259> to<00:00:30.619> producing<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:31.159> digital

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
actually comes to producing a digital

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.050 
actually comes to producing a digital
output<00:00:32.380> and<00:00:33.380> because<00:00:34.280> of<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.489> fact<00:00:34.670> that<00:00:34.820> it's

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
output and because of the fact that it's

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.120 
output and because of the fact that it's
essentially<00:00:35.660> an<00:00:35.900> unstructured<00:00:36.320> file<00:00:36.770> it's

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
essentially an unstructured file it's

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.250 
essentially an unstructured file it's
very<00:00:37.520> very<00:00:37.700> difficult<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:38.120> move<00:00:38.360> into<00:00:38.600> epub

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
very very difficult to move into epub

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.670 
very very difficult to move into epub
without<00:00:39.560> a<00:00:39.590> great<00:00:39.830> deal<00:00:39.890> of<00:00:41.020> involvement<00:00:42.020> one

without a great deal of involvement one

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
ourselves to at newgen is coming up with

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.720 
ourselves to at newgen is coming up with
a<00:00:46.610> solution<00:00:47.450> that<00:00:47.840> basically<00:00:48.410> takes<00:00:48.710> PDF<00:00:49.520> and

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
a solution that basically takes PDF and

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.820 
a solution that basically takes PDF and
moves<00:00:49.970> it<00:00:50.180> into<00:00:50.240> epub<00:00:50.810> quickly<00:00:51.530> accurately

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
moves it into epub quickly accurately

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.390 
moves it into epub quickly accurately
and<00:00:52.610> seamlessly<00:00:53.180> but<00:00:54.020> because<00:00:54.950> of<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.190> nature

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
and seamlessly but because of the nature

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.950 
and seamlessly but because of the nature
of<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.880> file<00:00:56.060> itself<00:00:56.240> you<00:00:56.690> can<00:00:56.720> never

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
of the file itself you can never

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.460 
of the file itself you can never
entirely<00:00:57.500> mechanize<00:00:58.190> that<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:58.670> we<00:00:58.790> also<00:00:58.970> still

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
entirely mechanize that so we also still

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.550 
entirely mechanize that so we also still
have<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:01.820> ability<00:01:02.210> for<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.989> operator<00:01:03.470> to

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
have the ability for the operator to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.069 
have the ability for the operator to
maintain<00:01:04.070> quality<00:01:04.220> control<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:05.079> consistency

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079 
maintain quality control and consistency

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.080 
maintain quality control and consistency
for<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.409> final<00:01:06.740> output<00:01:06.890> we<00:01:07.490> call<00:01:07.850> our<00:01:07.969> new

sure that the file that you're taking

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:33.969 
sure that the file that you're taking
can<00:01:28.639> be<00:01:28.880> moved<00:01:29.329> into<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:31.299> final<00:01:32.299> file<00:01:32.539> that<00:01:33.109> sort

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
mistakes that occurs within PDF but

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.690 
mistakes that occurs within PDF but

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
see where all those changes were made so

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.109 
see where all those changes were made so
that<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:42.530> operator<00:01:42.920> can<00:01:43.009> decide<00:01:43.459> whether<00:01:43.999> or

that the operator can decide whether or

that the operator can decide whether or
not<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:44.539> soft<00:01:44.780> hyphen<00:01:45.259> has<00:01:45.469> been<00:01:45.740> in<00:01:45.859> fact
