is and I'll explain that later because I

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.210 
is and I'll explain that later because I
think<00:00:47.410> it's<00:00:47.500> gonna<00:00:47.620> kind<00:00:47.740> of<00:00:47.829> like<00:00:47.890> this<00:00:48.070> have

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
think it's gonna kind of like this have

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.280 
think it's gonna kind of like this have
two<00:00:48.400> very<00:00:48.610> small<00:00:48.700> ones<00:00:49.180> but<00:00:49.390> Kyle<00:00:49.960> I<00:00:50.020> got<00:00:50.140> time

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
two very small ones but Kyle I got time

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.750 
two very small ones but Kyle I got time
to<00:00:50.350> make<00:00:50.470> up<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.710> concept<00:00:51.100> of<00:00:51.250> my<00:00:51.310> mind<00:00:51.520> but<00:00:51.700> I

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
to make up a concept of my mind but I

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.880 
to make up a concept of my mind but I
ended<00:00:51.940> up<00:00:52.030> keeping<00:00:52.270> it<00:00:52.600> because<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.440> me<00:00:53.620> I

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
ended up keeping it because to me I

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.140 
ended up keeping it because to me I
think<00:00:54.340> it<00:00:54.400> could<00:00:54.520> be<00:00:54.579> like<00:00:54.670> one<00:00:54.820> of<00:00:54.880> the<00:00:54.970> sort

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
think it could be like one of the sort

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.580 
think it could be like one of the sort
of<00:00:55.210> game<00:00:55.420> breaker<00:00:55.750> is<00:00:55.989> it<00:00:56.170> like<00:00:56.320> if<00:00:56.410> it's<00:00:56.530> a

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
of game breaker is it like if it's a

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.020 
of game breaker is it like if it's a
really<00:00:56.800> big<00:00:56.980> tie<00:00:57.190> you<00:00:57.250> sort<00:00:57.730> of<00:00:57.760> do<00:00:57.910> these

two<00:01:32.170> ways<00:01:32.380> out<00:01:32.649> basically<00:01:33.369> when<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.549> fall<00:01:33.759> in

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
two ways out basically when you fall in

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
the lava if you find the hole you'll

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.139 
the lava if you find the hole you'll
survive<00:01:35.920> you'll<00:01:36.520> be<00:01:36.639> able<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.819> get<00:01:36.969> out<00:01:37.119> of

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
survive you'll be able to get out of

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.179 
survive you'll be able to get out of
there<00:01:37.420> as<00:01:37.600> you<00:01:37.749> can<00:01:37.869> see<00:01:38.049> there<00:01:38.229> are<00:01:38.259> these

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.800 
there as you can see there are these
cobblestones<00:01:39.670> little<00:01:40.090> blocks<00:01:40.299> that's<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:40.689> you

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
cobblestones little blocks that's so you

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.539 
cobblestones little blocks that's so you
pop<00:01:40.990> out<00:01:41.109> of<00:01:41.409> so<00:01:41.889> don't<00:01:42.069> worry<00:01:42.130> about<00:01:42.249> that

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
killed so it's gonna be interesting to

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.200

see<00:03:18.140> who<00:03:18.710> can<00:03:18.920> get<00:03:19.040> through<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.340> fastest<00:03:19.850> who

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
see who can get through the fastest who

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.850 
see who can get through the fastest who
can<00:03:20.420> haul<00:03:20.570> their<00:03:20.750> ass<00:03:20.870> who<00:03:21.350> doesn't<00:03:21.800> get

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
can haul their ass who doesn't get

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.890 
can haul their ass who doesn't get
tricked<00:03:22.190> out<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.640> who<00:03:22.970> keeps<00:03:23.270> thinking<00:03:23.690> what

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
tricked out and who keeps thinking what

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.120 
tricked out and who keeps thinking what
they<00:03:24.020> think<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:24.320> right<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.530> they<00:03:24.740> go<00:03:24.920> that

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
they think is right and they go that

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.280 
they think is right and they go that
path<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.550> that's<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.210> so<00:03:26.300> it's<00:03:26.420> gonna<00:03:26.510> be<00:03:26.600> no

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
path and that's it so it's gonna be no

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.050 
path and that's it so it's gonna be no
longer<00:03:27.710> than<00:03:27.860> maybe<00:03:28.010> 10<00:03:28.400> minutes<00:03:28.610> this<00:03:28.850> maze

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
longer than maybe 10 minutes this maze

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.700 
longer than maybe 10 minutes this maze
the<00:03:29.270> last<00:03:29.420> one<00:03:29.600> was<00:03:29.720> really<00:03:30.050> really<00:03:30.260> long<00:03:30.500> I

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
the last one was really really long I

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.010 
the last one was really really long I
mean<00:03:30.830> terribly<00:03:31.820> long<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.450> really<00:03:32.630> was<00:03:32.810> those

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
mean terribly long it really was those

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.180 
mean terribly long it really was those
names<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.320> be<00:03:33.380> like<00:03:33.530> five<00:03:33.740> minutes<00:03:33.950> actually

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
names to be like five minutes actually

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.160 
names to be like five minutes actually
and<00:03:34.640> that<00:03:35.180> was<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.360> problem<00:03:35.690> with<00:03:35.960> it<00:03:36.080> the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
and that was the problem with it the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.630 
and that was the problem with it the
maize<00:03:36.350> itself<00:03:36.380> was<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:36.920> lot<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.130> fun<00:03:37.310> it's<00:03:37.460> kind

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
maize itself was a lot of fun it's kind

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.160 
maize itself was a lot of fun it's kind
of<00:03:37.760> mixed<00:03:38.030> with<00:03:38.150> more<00:03:38.390> leaning<00:03:38.600> towards<00:03:38.930> no

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
of mixed with more leaning towards no

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.740 
of mixed with more leaning towards no
and<00:03:39.470> I<00:03:39.860> took<00:03:40.130> that<00:03:40.430> into<00:03:40.550> account<00:03:40.640> made<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.390> much

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
and I took that into account made a much

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.930 
and I took that into account made a much
much<00:03:42.080> smaller<00:03:42.500> maze<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:43.400> this<00:03:43.610> time<00:03:43.760> it's

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
much smaller maze but this time it's

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.850 
much smaller maze but this time it's
full<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.330> traps<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.960> you're<00:03:45.260> probably<00:03:45.560> gonna

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
full of traps and you're probably gonna

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.200 
full of traps and you're probably gonna
die<00:03:45.920> in<00:03:46.100> there<00:03:46.250> that's<00:03:46.400> why<00:03:46.490> one<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.670> only<00:03:46.970> one

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
die in there that's why one of only one

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.760 
die in there that's why one of only one
of<00:03:47.330> you<00:03:47.450> will<00:03:47.480> make<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:47.720> out<00:03:47.990> so<00:03:48.620> I'm<00:03:48.710> very
