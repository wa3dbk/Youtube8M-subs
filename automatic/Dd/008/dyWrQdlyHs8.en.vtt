00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.300 
just need to make sure because these are
a<00:02:47.330> little<00:02:47.510> tougher<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.959> steer<00:02:48.230> without<00:02:48.920> power

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
a little tougher to steer without power

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.530 
a little tougher to steer without power
steering<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.670> little<00:02:49.850> tougher<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.150> stop

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
steering is a little tougher to stop

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.280 
steering is a little tougher to stop
with<00:02:50.840> drum<00:02:51.260> brakes<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.800> no<00:02:52.790> power<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.450> we've

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
with drum brakes and no power so we've

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.070 
with drum brakes and no power so we've
got<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.709> they're<00:02:55.120> also<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.510> correct

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
got that they're also the correct

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.870 
got that they're also the correct

the car and it comes with it
this<00:03:04.400> one<00:03:04.580> here<00:03:04.790> wanted<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.150> little<00:03:05.270> more

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
this one here wanted a little more

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.610 
this one here wanted a little more
performance<00:03:05.780> or<00:03:06.080> they<00:03:06.170> upgraded<00:03:06.500> the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
performance or they upgraded the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.960 
performance or they upgraded the
carburetor<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.190> manifold<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:07.700> that's<00:03:07.850> in

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
carburetor the manifold and that's in

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.759 
carburetor the manifold and that's in
the<00:03:08.060> trunk<00:03:08.300> of<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.510> car<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:09.230> old<00:03:09.440> one<00:03:09.650> that

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
the trunk of the car the old one that

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.949 
the trunk of the car the old one that
came<00:03:09.920> with<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.190> car<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.730> here<00:03:11.720> we<00:03:11.810> got<00:03:11.930> a

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
came with the car so here we got a

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.090 
came with the car so here we got a
little<00:03:12.170> more<00:03:12.290> performance<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:12.860> matter<00:03:13.070> of

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
little more performance and matter of

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.940 
little more performance and matter of
fact<00:03:13.160> when<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.459> start<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.820> car<00:03:13.850> this<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.959> 396

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
fact when I start the car this is a 396

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.259 
fact when I start the car this is a 396
and<00:03:16.040> it's<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.310> right<00:03:16.489> motor<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.030> all<00:03:17.090> that

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
and it's the right motor and all that

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.240 
and it's the right motor and all that
but<00:03:17.510> it's<00:03:17.630> definitely<00:03:17.720> making<00:03:18.170> more<00:03:18.440> than<00:03:18.470> 350

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
but it's definitely making more than 350

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.160 
but it's definitely making more than 350
horsepower<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:20.239> is<00:03:20.390> calling<00:03:20.750> out<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.870> be

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
horsepower that is calling out to be

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.380 
horsepower that is calling out to be
it's<00:03:21.769> had<00:03:21.890> an<00:03:21.980> upgraded<00:03:22.250> camshaft<00:03:22.790> that's<00:03:23.269> the

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
it's had an upgraded camshaft that's the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.630 
it's had an upgraded camshaft that's the
head<00:03:23.570> work<00:03:23.780> done<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.350> it's<00:03:25.220> going<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.400> size

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
head work done to it it's going to size

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.920 
head work done to it it's going to size
a<00:03:25.670> little<00:03:25.970> bit<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.330> sounds<00:03:26.570> really<00:03:26.780> really

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
a little bit it sounds really really

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.900 
a little bit it sounds really really
nice<00:03:27.320> not<00:03:27.620> too<00:03:27.769> radical<00:03:28.250> but<00:03:28.400> just<00:03:28.640> enough<00:03:28.880> to

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
nice not too radical but just enough to

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.759 
nice not too radical but just enough to
to<00:03:29.720> motivate<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.230> car<00:03:30.380> down<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.620> road<00:03:30.650> a

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
to motivate the car down the road a

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.770 
to motivate the car down the road a
little<00:03:30.890> bit<00:03:31.010> more<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.610> little<00:03:32.420> stuff<00:03:32.600> like

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
little bit more so little stuff like

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.420 
little bit more so little stuff like
this<00:03:32.959> they<00:03:33.440> went<00:03:33.620> as<00:03:33.680> far<00:03:33.860> as<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.100> put<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.340> the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
this they went as far as to put in the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.800 
this they went as far as to put in the
sound<00:03:34.670> insulation<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.450> mean<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.690> hood

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
sound insulation I mean the hood

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.360 
sound insulation I mean the hood
insulation<00:03:36.290> for<00:03:36.530> for<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.160> engine

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
insulation for for the engine

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.009 
insulation for for the engine
compartment<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:38.090> that's<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.600> little<00:03:38.780> stuff

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
compartment and that's the little stuff

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.690 
compartment and that's the little stuff
that<00:03:39.049> a<00:03:39.170> lot<00:03:39.320> of<00:03:39.380> people<00:03:39.709> skip<00:03:39.950> when<00:03:40.549> they're

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
that a lot of people skip when they're

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.130 
that a lot of people skip when they're

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
money spent we can put a cheap battery

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.810 
money spent we can put a cheap battery
in<00:03:53.510> here<00:03:53.750> we<00:03:54.230> could<00:03:54.380> put<00:03:54.530> cooper<00:03:54.950> Cobra<00:03:55.400> radios

around the details I think you'll see

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.220 
around the details I think you'll see
it's<00:04:03.440> pretty<00:04:03.620> nice<00:04:04.660> stainless<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:05.840> chrome<00:04:06.019> we

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
it's pretty nice stainless and chrome we

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.229 
it's pretty nice stainless and chrome we
talked<00:04:06.440> about<00:04:06.590> looks<00:04:06.860> great<00:04:07.160> parking<00:04:08.000> lights

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239
