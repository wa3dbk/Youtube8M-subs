really<00:02:50.489> really<00:02:50.700> wants<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.480> flow<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:52.830> it

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
really really wants to flow and so it

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.630 
really really wants to flow and so it
goes<00:02:53.130> right<00:02:53.220> across<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.120> page<00:02:54.769> no<00:02:55.769> problem<00:02:56.489> at

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
even though this is a tiny ballpoint pen

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.280 
even though this is a tiny ballpoint pen
tip<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.799> fills<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.310> large<00:03:05.700> space<00:03:06.290> surprisingly

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
tip it fills a large space surprisingly

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.500

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
know I'm a lazy crafter so then the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.610 
know I'm a lazy crafter so then the
other<00:03:12.330> thing<00:03:12.599> you<00:03:12.690> can<00:03:12.810> use<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.470> can

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
other thing you can use is you can

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.170 
other thing you can use is you can
actually<00:03:13.799> use<00:03:14.160> you'll<00:03:14.430> notice<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.910> these

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
actually use you'll notice that these

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.810 
actually use you'll notice that these
pens<00:03:15.810> have<00:03:16.049> matte<00:03:16.410> caps<00:03:16.830> where<00:03:17.190> these<00:03:17.459> pens

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
pens have matte caps where these pens

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.460 
pens have matte caps where these pens
have<00:03:18.090> glossy<00:03:18.570> caps<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:18.989> that's<00:03:19.109> because<00:03:19.350> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
have glossy caps and that's because the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.280 
have glossy caps and that's because the
ink<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:19.829> these<00:03:19.980> pens<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.459> gonna<00:03:20.700> dry<00:03:21.060> matte<00:03:21.930> as

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
ink in these pens is gonna dry matte as

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.620 
ink in these pens is gonna dry matte as
opposed<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.890> glossy<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.880> that's<00:03:24.030> an<00:03:24.120> easy<00:03:24.420> way

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
opposed to glossy so that's an easy way

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.060 
opposed to glossy so that's an easy way
to<00:03:24.690> tell<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.019> difference<00:03:25.049> again<00:03:25.799> I'm<00:03:25.950> gonna

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
to tell the difference again I'm gonna

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.620 
to tell the difference again I'm gonna
remove<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.459> little<00:03:26.790> dot<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.359> don't<00:03:27.450> ever

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
remove that little dot you don't ever

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.000 
remove that little dot you don't ever
have<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.930> put<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.140> back<00:03:28.260> that's<00:03:28.590> just<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.890> way

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
have to put it back that's just the way

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.890 
have to put it back that's just the way
it<00:03:29.130> comes<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.700> I'm<00:03:30.239> gonna<00:03:30.359> go<00:03:30.569> ahead<00:03:30.690> and

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
it comes and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.930 
it comes and I'm gonna go ahead and
scratch<00:03:31.410> scratch<00:03:31.739> here<00:03:32.010> now<00:03:32.340> one<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.850> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
scratch scratch here now one of the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.849 
scratch scratch here now one of the
things<00:03:33.209> about<00:03:33.540> these<00:03:33.810> pens<00:03:34.109> is<00:03:34.319> people<00:03:34.650> think

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
things about these pens is people think

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.740 
things about these pens is people think
at<00:03:34.980> first<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.519> pen<00:03:35.790> isn't<00:03:36.120> working

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
at first that the pen isn't working

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.170 
at first that the pen isn't working
because<00:03:37.170> they<00:03:37.410> say<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.980> doesn't<00:03:38.489> seem<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.940> be

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
because they say it doesn't seem to be

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.110 
because they say it doesn't seem to be
the<00:03:39.630> flat<00:03:40.019> color<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:40.799> was<00:03:41.010> promised<00:03:41.489> these

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
the flat color that I was promised these

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.840 
the flat color that I was promised these
pens<00:03:42.389> take<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.690> little<00:03:43.049> bit<00:03:43.230> longer<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:44.069> dry<00:03:44.280> and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
pens take a little bit longer to dry and

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.000 
pens take a little bit longer to dry and
I<00:03:45.450> would<00:03:45.720> say<00:03:45.870> always<00:03:46.139> tell<00:03:46.319> people<00:03:46.410> don't<00:03:46.590> dry

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
I would say always tell people don't dry

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.319 
I would say always tell people don't dry
them<00:03:47.190> with<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.310> heat<00:03:47.519> gun<00:03:47.549> because<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.090> does

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
them with a heat gun because it does

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.390 
them with a heat gun because it does
something<00:03:48.630> chemically<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.500> heat<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:50.310> you

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
something chemically the heat that you

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.830 
something chemically the heat that you
won't<00:03:50.579> like<00:03:50.850> so<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.150> want<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.389> just<00:03:51.540> let<00:03:51.660> them

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
won't like so you want to just let them

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.259 
won't like so you want to just let them
air<00:03:52.109> dry<00:03:52.139> give<00:03:52.799> them<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.130> time<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.090> space

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
air dry give them the time and the space

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.360 
air dry give them the time and the space
and<00:03:54.930> they'll<00:03:55.650> be<00:03:55.769> fine

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
and they'll be fine

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.360 
and they'll be fine
so<00:03:57.060> again<00:03:57.329> what<00:03:58.019> are<00:03:58.139> rules<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.680> colors<00:03:59.100> in

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
so again what are rules of colors in

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.770 
so again what are rules of colors in
terms<00:03:59.579> of<00:03:59.730> adding<00:04:00.209> if<00:04:00.299> you<00:04:00.389> just<00:04:00.510> are<00:04:00.630> gonna

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
terms of adding if you just are gonna

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.390 
terms of adding if you just are gonna
keep<00:04:00.959> adding<00:04:01.380> colors<00:04:01.739> well<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.100> know<00:04:02.220> what<00:04:02.370> I

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
keep adding colors well you know what I

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.090 
keep adding colors well you know what I
say<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:03.030> think<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> rainbow<00:04:04.290> has<00:04:04.470> tons<00:04:04.829> and

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
say I think that a rainbow has tons and

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.590 
say I think that a rainbow has tons and
tons<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.400> colors<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:05.910> nobody<00:04:06.180> ever<00:04:06.299> says<00:04:06.569> hey

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
tons of colors and nobody ever says hey

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.500 
tons of colors and nobody ever says hey
that<00:04:07.109> rainbow<00:04:07.440> clashes<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:08.519> keep<00:04:08.910> adding<00:04:09.389> the

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
that rainbow clashes so keep adding the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.840 
that rainbow clashes so keep adding the
colors<00:04:09.840> just<00:04:10.410> heading<00:04:10.829> your<00:04:10.950> way<00:04:11.010> right

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
colors just heading your way right

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.400 
colors just heading your way right
through<00:04:12.000> there<00:04:12.180> if<00:04:12.329> you're<00:04:12.510> nervous<00:04:12.870> about<00:04:13.139> it

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
through there if you're nervous about it

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.740 
through there if you're nervous about it
all<00:04:13.530> all<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:14.220> would<00:04:14.489> say<00:04:14.700> pick<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.090> couple<00:04:15.359> really

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
all all I would say pick a couple really

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.080 
all all I would say pick a couple really
basic<00:04:16.440> colors<00:04:16.829> that<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.459> like<00:04:17.669> or<00:04:17.910> look

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
basic colors that you like or look

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.879 
basic colors that you like or look
around<00:04:18.389> your<00:04:18.539> room<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.109> see<00:04:19.470> what's<00:04:19.680> already

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
around your room and see what's already

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.850 
around your room and see what's already
there<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.549> just<00:04:21.150> find<00:04:21.450> out<00:04:21.690> what<00:04:22.289> you<00:04:22.530> think

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
there and just find out what you think

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.930 
there and just find out what you think
would<00:04:23.099> be<00:04:23.280> a

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
would be a

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.540 
would be a
good<00:04:24.030> match<00:04:24.510> okay<00:04:25.260> so<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:25.890> would<00:04:26.190> continue

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
good match okay so I would continue

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.450 
good match okay so I would continue
coloring<00:04:27.330> all<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:28.140> this<00:04:28.290> in<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.920> creating

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
coloring all of this in and creating

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.400 
coloring all of this in and creating
some<00:04:29.670> more<00:04:29.880> circles<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.570> when<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:30.900> finished

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
some more circles and when I finished

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.600 
some more circles and when I finished
and<00:04:31.770> it's<00:04:32.070> dried<00:04:32.490> ooh<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:35.160> should<00:04:35.520> be

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
and it's dried ooh it should be

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.490 
and it's dried ooh it should be
something<00:04:35.940> like<00:04:36.120> this<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:36.750> can<00:04:36.930> see<00:04:37.260> how

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
something like this and you can see how

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.800 
something like this and you can see how
nice<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.130> dimensional<00:04:38.880> this<00:04:39.120> is<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.690> it

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
nice and dimensional this is and it

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.320 
nice and dimensional this is and it
feels<00:04:40.080> it's<00:04:40.320> both<00:04:40.590> glossy<00:04:41.130> and<00:04:41.340> matte<00:04:41.400> but

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
feels it's both glossy and matte but

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.780 
feels it's both glossy and matte but
we're<00:04:42.540> not<00:04:42.720> done<00:04:43.020> because<00:04:43.530> now<00:04:43.950> we're<00:04:44.670> gonna

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
we're not done because now we're gonna

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.110 
we're not done because now we're gonna
add<00:04:45.060> all<00:04:45.420> sorts<00:04:45.660> of<00:04:45.810> cool<00:04:46.230> little<00:04:46.620> extras<00:04:47.280> so

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
I'm gonna go ahead and again start my

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160 
I'm gonna go ahead and again start my
pen<00:04:50.430> on<00:04:50.460> here<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.210> then<00:04:51.690> I'm<00:04:51.780> gonna<00:04:51.900> add

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
pen on here and then I'm gonna add

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.700 
pen on here and then I'm gonna add
little<00:04:52.920> things<00:04:53.190> like<00:04:53.460> dots<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.380> you'll<00:04:55.380> see

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
little things like dots and you'll see

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.680 
little things like dots and you'll see
it<00:04:55.950> just<00:04:56.160> makes<00:04:56.520> such<00:04:56.880> a<00:04:56.910> difference<00:04:57.120> it

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
it just makes such a difference it

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.840 
it just makes such a difference it
really<00:04:57.720> makes<00:04:58.200> it<00:04:58.320> pop<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:59.100> makes<00:04:59.550> it<00:04:59.700> just

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
this is an opaque ink so while it may

see that you can't see through here when
it<00:05:29.640> dries<00:05:30.060> it's<00:05:30.630> gonna<00:05:30.870> be<00:05:31.140> an<00:05:31.350> entirely

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
it dries it's gonna be an entirely

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.610 
it dries it's gonna be an entirely
opaque<00:05:32.820> line<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:33.480> you<00:05:33.630> will<00:05:33.780> never<00:05:34.140> see<00:05:34.470> that

opaque line and you will never see that
orange<00:05:34.830> through<00:05:35.130> there<00:05:35.310> so<00:05:35.760> that's<00:05:35.910> also<00:05:36.060> a

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
orange through there so that's also a

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.690 
orange through there so that's also a
great<00:05:36.510> place<00:05:36.720> to<00:05:36.780> fix<00:05:37.260> up<00:05:37.470> any<00:05:37.620> mistakes<00:05:38.340> or
