00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:11.679
 we are currently working hard on our new school 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.809
 the school has grown considerably in recent years, our building is now too small 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.420
 we have already had to put into use an emergency building and the third classes havo and 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.789
 VMBO are taught in the annex at the table of the way began 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.330
 moreover we would like to 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.480
 our education will suit the students and society today 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.540
 that is why we are happy with the new building that it has 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.640
 this greatly improves the learning environment of the students 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.069
 the new school will be very beautiful 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:41.280
 with many windows 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.330
 and therefore a lot of light 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.380
 the combination of the materials and colors used is fresh and 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.730
 attractive 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.730
 much attention has been paid to the indoor climate 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 the beautiful reception area is very inviting 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.560
 the plaice and has a large number of practice space 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.129
 for drawing among other things 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.510
 for skill 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.400
 engineering physics chemistry 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.400
 four out of ten the drama and music 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.679
 these spaces all have modern technical gadgets 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.950
 there is a wireless network throughout the building 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.970
 and there is a separate multimedia room 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.770
 After all, education must keep up with the times 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.180
 finally get a new school 2 actually finds them 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.990
 you will wonder how in our new buildings that learning environment of a child 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.750
 further improve 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.770
 we do this by dividing the school into 8 so-called teachers 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.490
 the teacher is a small school within a large school 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.020
 Work in apprenticeship one has the advantages of a small school 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.380
 and the benefits of a large school 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.499
 every time he has 25 people from the oba 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.950
 the learning house consists of a table instruction classrooms and one 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.020
 common room 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.259
 a teacher is home to a small team of six to ten teachers 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.100
 to do 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.580
 resident assistant 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.050
 they are jointly responsible for the education of a limited person 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.009
 number of classes 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.070
 usually there are two years in a mansion 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.059
 so for example class 1 and 2 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:24.349
 The classroom in the apprenticeship belongs to the same department so the VMBO hair fall 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.519
 at the VMBO 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.019
 this is how small-scale units with a fixed group of students and teachers are created 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.259
 who know each other well and are strongly drawn together 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.760
 a safe learning environment 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.329
 for a child 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.139
 in the leather house concept link the traditional learning method to the modern 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.949
 perception of children 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:47.389
 today's students live in a different world than we used to 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.699
 Many children have access to a computer, their cell phone and the iPod 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.879
 many students have seen much of the world it is the right it 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.419
 his fourth television on the internet 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.419
 those houses fit in well with the environment of the students 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:08.689
 students can use new media such as the internet and in one 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.879
 follow their lessons in a digital learning environment 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.959
 through the different spaces such as instruction room and the 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.439
 common room 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.439
 different learning method can be applied 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.389
 A lot of research has been done in recent years into the development of the 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.529
 adolescents brains 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.579
 It turns out that children are in the good of the brain 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.839
 that lasts until about a 22nd year 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:37.519
 in particular, they must be encouraged and stimulated in many different ways 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.689
 the students the dam the best 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.159
 Research has shown that we learn much more by talking about the 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.899
 subject matter 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:47.479
 to experience it yourself 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:51.459
 and to explain it to others than just by reading the material or 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.869
 to listen to explanations 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:56.909
 Some students think they have different tasks at the same time 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.060
 able to perform 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.630
 for example, doing homework with the TV on 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.769
 9 and at the same time the us 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.179
 that seems to be only partially true 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:10.249
 Then they need to help to focus on tasks as well 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.459
 possible return 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.459
 here too the white house is a good environment 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.389
 teacher education can be tailor-made and students can participate 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.319
 gain knowledge at their own pace 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.170
 what is striking is that children today 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.170
 increasingly have to make their own choice possible 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.520
 they choose their own television program from the clothes 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.520
 their own sports club and their own school 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.979
 it is stimulated at primary school 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.020
 children often get hit by day or week 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.020
 which they can work on independently or in groups 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.639
 the lyre early on to choose on which subjects they want to make assignments 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.559
 or want to hold speaking engagements 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:54.180
 this way of working 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.529
 in line with the working method in our teacher houses 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.949
 working independently and the new plan are encouraged here 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:05.839
 also planning a homely home and spending their free time 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.870
 attention is paid 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.029
 this is important for the students of 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.029
 who often already have a busy social life 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.639
 the exam results of our people have been very good for years 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.229
 good results and knowledge of all subjects and in particular of language and arithmetic 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.710
 being a person is very important for the future of telekids 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.360
 when our students leave school with a diploma 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.010
 they go to the planning office 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.379
 with radio or university education 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.300
 to this end, students are required to have a thorough knowledge 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.789
 show a lot of own initiative to be able to work independently 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.740
 and be able to plan work properly 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.460
 we encourage the teacher to study in this way 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.070
 which will make the transition to further training smooth 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.789
 in addition to the many positive innovations 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.109
 we can always build on our own values ​​rather continue to propagate 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:00.669
 in the report 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.669
 respect full of challenging and promising 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:08.680
 our teacher is the time for the winning point to reach small school 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.680
 but they know everyone and where they are being explored 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.150
 another important point is that the teacher team knows every child well 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.810
 giving children the personal guidance they deserve 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:25.090
 every child can always ask for help in a mansion 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.639
 and get it 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.639
 we set clear limits on what is and what is not allowed 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.680
 within those limits 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.160
 hereby students the space to develop safely partly because of that 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.160
 they achieve good learning results 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.020
 our students were injured 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.369
 they know how to stand up for themselves 

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:49.129
 fortunately our students are open and direct but by a good one 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.990
 build a relationship with them 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.199
 in short, the reve system is a modern school full of neighborhood children at 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:58.710
 most expensive and environment 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.339
 every student comes into its own with us 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:03.719
 it has is offers its students the space 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:08.490
 to develop close to home and in a safer challenging a caring 

00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:09.960
 surroundings 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.490
 personal attention 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.490
 helps students to develop self-consciously 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:17.360
 racing is an expensive neighborhood 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.120
 the school on the move
