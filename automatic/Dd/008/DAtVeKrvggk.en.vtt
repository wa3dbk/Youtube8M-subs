somewhat metallic doesn't really seem to
be<00:02:41.710> if<00:02:42.710> it's<00:02:42.980> painted<00:02:43.460> it's<00:02:44.060> just<00:02:44.360> got<00:02:44.510> a

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
be if it's painted it's just got a

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.270 
be if it's painted it's just got a
really<00:02:44.780> light<00:02:45.110> coat<00:02:45.380> of<00:02:45.410> paint<00:02:45.680> cuz<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.130> can

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
really light coat of paint cuz you can

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.660 
really light coat of paint cuz you can
see<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.530> swirls<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.710> the<00:02:48.800> plastic<00:02:49.280> on<00:02:49.460> mine

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
see the swirls in the plastic on mine

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.980 
see the swirls in the plastic on mine
where<00:02:49.880> they<00:02:50.000> didn't<00:02:50.240> mix<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.570> paint<00:02:50.780> very

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
where they didn't mix the paint very

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.260 
where they didn't mix the paint very
well<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:54.440> if<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.770> painted<00:02:55.190> it's<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:55.910> not<00:02:56.210> a

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
well so if it is painted it's it's not a

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.120 
well so if it is painted it's it's not a
thick<00:02:57.080> layer<00:02:57.320> but<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.650> think<00:02:57.890> it's<00:02:58.040> just

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
thick layer but I think it's just

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.400 
thick layer but I think it's just
plastic<00:02:58.640> it's<00:02:58.820> just<00:02:59.000> got<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.300> kind<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.200> green

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
plastic it's just got this kind of green

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.810 
plastic it's just got this kind of green
metallic<00:03:00.740> plastic<00:03:02.710> but<00:03:03.710> all<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.100> colors<00:03:04.490> seem

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
metallic plastic but all the colors seem

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.030 
metallic plastic but all the colors seem
to<00:03:04.910> match<00:03:05.060> up<00:03:05.240> pretty<00:03:05.360> well<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:06.350> Greens<00:03:06.680> match

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
to match up pretty well the Greens match

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.890 
to match up pretty well the Greens match
up<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.610> yellow<00:03:07.790> matches<00:03:08.210> up<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:08.450> they<00:03:08.750> did

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
up and the yellow matches up so they did

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.140 
up and the yellow matches up so they did
a<00:03:08.960> good<00:03:09.080> job<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.440> that<00:03:09.940> it's<00:03:10.940> got<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.090> really

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
a good job on that it's got a really

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.790 
a good job on that it's got a really
cool-looking<00:03:11.570> red<00:03:12.050> face<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:15.560> course

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
cool-looking red face and of course

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.020 
cool-looking red face and of course
there's<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.010> little<00:03:16.070> gold<00:03:16.340> dime<00:03:16.580> in<00:03:16.760> there<00:03:16.880> and

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
there's a little gold dime in there and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.570 
there's a little gold dime in there and
that's<00:03:17.180> just<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.890> don't<00:03:18.890> really<00:03:19.040> know<00:03:19.310> what<00:03:19.490> the

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
that's just I don't really know what the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.160 
that's just I don't really know what the
lines<00:03:19.820> on<00:03:20.060> his<00:03:20.120> stomach<00:03:20.420> are<00:03:20.690> supposed<00:03:20.960> to<00:03:21.020> be

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
lines on his stomach are supposed to be

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.970 
lines on his stomach are supposed to be
supposed<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.650> give<00:03:21.770> him<00:03:21.920> depth<00:03:22.190> or<00:03:22.430> something

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
supposed to give him depth or something

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.320 
supposed to give him depth or something
