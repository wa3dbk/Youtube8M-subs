has barely begun however the fact that

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.869 
has barely begun however the fact that
Ubisoft<00:02:06.509> issued<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.049> 2014<00:02:07.860> release<00:02:08.039> date<00:02:08.489> seems

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
Ubisoft issued a 2014 release date seems

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.080 
Ubisoft issued a 2014 release date seems
laughable<00:02:09.360> if<00:02:09.920> I'll<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:10.950> completely<00:02:11.670> honest

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
laughable if I'll be completely honest

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.880 
laughable if I'll be completely honest
we<00:02:12.390> will<00:02:12.540> never<00:02:12.840> have<00:02:13.110> time<00:02:13.379> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
the division this year this is a big

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.130 
the division this year this is a big
project<00:02:16.310> we<00:02:17.310> have<00:02:17.430> very<00:02:17.819> far<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.180> go<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:19.110> I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
project we have very far to go so I

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.960 
project we have very far to go so I
don't<00:02:19.440> really<00:02:19.709> know<00:02:19.980> how<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.250> take<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:20.730> guy's

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
don't really know how to take this guy's

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.750 
don't really know how to take this guy's
obviously<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.050> rumor<00:02:22.470> when<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.310> comes<00:02:23.550> to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
obviously it's a rumor when it comes to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.840 
obviously it's a rumor when it comes to
anonymous<00:02:24.420> sources<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.400> stuff<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.790> that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
anonymous sources and stuff like that

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.540 
anonymous sources and stuff like that
you<00:02:27.240> really<00:02:27.600> can't<00:02:27.930> take<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.830> as<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> definite

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
you really can't take it as a definite

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.120 
you really can't take it as a definite
but<00:02:30.270> we<00:02:30.540> do<00:02:30.750> know<00:02:30.930> they<00:02:31.110> delayed<00:02:31.470> watch<00:02:31.709> dogs

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
but we do know they delayed watch dogs

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.070 
but we do know they delayed watch dogs
which<00:02:32.490> was<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> big<00:02:33.000> disappointment<00:02:33.209> for<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.900> lot

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
which was a big disappointment for a lot

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.050 
which was a big disappointment for a lot
of<00:02:34.110> people<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:34.770> we'll<00:02:35.310> probably<00:02:35.670> get<00:02:36.000> a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
of people but we'll probably get a

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.570 
of people but we'll probably get a
better<00:02:36.300> game<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.410> end<00:02:37.620> for<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.459> it

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
better game in the end for it but it

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.100 
better game in the end for it but it
would<00:02:38.730> be<00:02:38.880> really<00:02:39.060> disappointing<00:02:39.870> I'm<00:02:40.080> not

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
would be really disappointing I'm not

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.550
