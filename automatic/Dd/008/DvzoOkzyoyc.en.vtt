00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.569 
month or two of this DLC drop him but
the<00:02:17.599> really<00:02:17.930> really<00:02:18.349> cool<00:02:18.859> thing<00:02:19.159> about<00:02:19.310> this

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
the really really cool thing about this

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.809

playing public games it's gonna be even

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.789

harder<00:03:55.729> to<00:03:55.909> find<00:03:56.120> match<00:03:56.479> which<00:03:57.019> brings<00:03:57.379> me<00:03:57.470> to

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
harder to find match which brings me to

just hope that they continue to support
the<00:04:42.500> game<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:43.069> way<00:04:43.220> they<00:04:43.430> have<00:04:43.669> and<00:04:44.000> hopefully

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
the game the way they have and hopefully

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.170 
the game the way they have and hopefully
we'll<00:04:44.960> see<00:04:45.139> the<00:04:45.289> Pirates<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:45.770> steampunks<00:04:46.460> as

one<00:04:47.720> full<00:04:48.050> DLC<00:04:48.740> that<00:04:49.009> might<00:04:49.250> actually<00:04:49.460> be<00:04:50.000> paid

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
gonna be a paid DLC and would you guys

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.899 
gonna be a paid DLC and would you guys
pay<00:05:02.900> for<00:05:03.229> a<00:05:03.259> lot<00:05:03.650> of<00:05:03.710> people<00:05:03.830> have<00:05:04.220> said<00:05:04.460> yeah

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
pay for a lot of people have said yeah

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.059 
pay for a lot of people have said yeah
they<00:05:05.150> would<00:05:05.389> maybe<00:05:05.780> know<00:05:06.139> depends<00:05:06.680> how<00:05:06.800> much

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069 
they would maybe know depends how much

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.850 
they would maybe know depends how much
and<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.940> think<00:05:08.330> five<00:05:08.630> dollars<00:05:09.169> would<00:05:09.680> be<00:05:09.830> a

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
and I think five dollars would be a
