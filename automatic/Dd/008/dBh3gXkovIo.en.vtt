the system gets really interesting if

the Queen uses the stored sperm to

the Queen uses the stored sperm to
fertilize<00:02:29.820> an<00:02:30.450> egg<00:02:30.570> then<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.320> egg<00:02:31.500> will<00:02:31.710> grow

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
fertilize an egg then that egg will grow

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
an egg without fertilizing it then that

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.080 
an egg without fertilizing it then that

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
it will always be a male so you see it's

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.990 
remember that when it comes to painted
turtles<00:03:58.019> they<00:03:58.470> are<00:03:58.530> all<00:03:58.769> hot<00:03:59.160> chicks<00:03:59.489> and<00:03:59.820> cool

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
open sea floor then it will become a

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.220 
open sea floor then it will become a
female<00:04:50.400> but<00:04:51.000> if<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.210> lands<00:04:51.540> on<00:04:51.630> top<00:04:51.900> of<00:04:52.170> a

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
female then it will become a male so for

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.770 
female then it will become a male so for
