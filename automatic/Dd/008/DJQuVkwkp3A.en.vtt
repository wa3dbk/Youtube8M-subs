00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.140
 We're on the subject of money and notice the fuel and diesel prices are rising and falling 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.170
 rise in questionable always have a way to give cars 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.680
 to refuel something else without the same 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.739
 Oil companies to push the money in the throat 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.990
 hor it comes just that there is 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.400
 The raw materials these for example do not always have to be like yours 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.779
 would it be with 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.749
 diesel 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.749
 from garbage 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.279
 in Ettendorf in the Erzgebirge screwdrivers one 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.160
 future technology 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.890
 here in the quiet almost in secret Christian Kau has 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.400
 Buttenheim near Bamberg 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.220
 his 2 2 types stand 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.860
 and for those interested from around the world 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.350
 Today, the Swedes watch Norwegian Finns and visitors from Hong Kong 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.160
 not bad 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.690
 Here decided from garbage 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 On this day he feeds the plant with Crap Cantus 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.330
 an energetic plant but the plant can swallow various types of 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.320
 Plastik stews up to the old song 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
 or oily plants 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.740
 AbrÃ«ll GI possible 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.520
 who is coated with aluminum 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.800
 but the story is so skinny that we are ours 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.980
 Percent as we of course does not harm 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.450
 these are failed tracks swells before slumbering is what is 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.030
 Contains hydrocarbons 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.050
 Of course that is a big part of the mineral substances new 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.620
 super-combi 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.860
 Billen and in plastics 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.530
 and that, of course, is a bit lower in the biological 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.320
 Toppen because there is still a certain amount of co2 contained so we can 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.590
 from one kilo of raw material 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.590
 to get almost three times as much as a kilo of wood 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.130
 the mixture is given in a special tour like never before 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.970
 the centerpiece is for our comradeship Mio 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.560
 company secret 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.189
 at about 300 degrees with their hydrogen split off in liquid form 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.689
 The whole thing comes out in the end as a diesel 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.830
 this works only when a special powder is added 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.280
 as a catalyst 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.870
 on all sides reaction accelerator 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.870
 System select referee does not fit just the same 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.789
 Mr. Water will be in the pit 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:13.050
 present was Rome 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.569
 they will form this 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.819
 and we just have that 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:17.889
 Billion ago 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.039
 made again and again 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.299
 by building the molecular 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.179
 and also his very own 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:28.029
 Molecular Crystalline Bulgur made which is able to fast the 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:29.049
 To make implementation 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.879
 that we can do it in three minutes 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.099
 do not need a long time 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.600
 his own product 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.600
 the fifth for a long time in self-experiment 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.209
 it turns out to be pathetic 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.209
 but a lucid of my own diesel 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.929
 Nassau there about 600 April 16 thousand kilometers 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:54.059
 I buy at least half of those were driving 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.469
 the trouble the solar system is beyond the experimental stage 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.699
 in the Ore Mountains, they produce the equipment for use worldwide 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:08.409
 In Mexico and Canada, she gets 500 liters of diesel from waste or waste oil 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.899
 hour 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:14.009
 they were busy in Spain and Bulgaria 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.079
 the delivery times 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.839
 will double easily 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:19.659
 the production capacity 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.409
 for the plant 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.139
 built up 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.139
 it will be soon 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.139
 People will queue up 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.389
 The facilities of Christian Koch are increasingly becoming an export hit 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.329
 even if only three to four million euros are invested 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.980
 but it's worth it all the faster 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.459
 anyone who climbs this price at the gas stations
