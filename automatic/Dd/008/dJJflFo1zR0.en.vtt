00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:24.529
 we make many car enthusiasts especially 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.949
 those who are peugeot expert cars 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.470
 especially if they are converted from 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:35.010
 passenger freight and more especially 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.480
 if they are converted from right 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.239
 0 0 left-sided they know one 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.430
 a problem that often occurs with 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.890
 clutch so every such 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.649
 motorist in stock 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.559
 in the glove compartment somewhere in the car always 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:00.500
 lying around or spare cable or 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.500
 spare clutch cable complete conflict 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.570
 due to the fact that 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.640
 redesigned the clutch itself 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:19.770
 often there is such a problem that 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.240
 breaks the cable itself here in the video we 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.810
 see two cables 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.050
 one traffic was previously cut off later 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.130
 bought another worth it a lot 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:37.560
 50 dollars and after that when broke 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.440
 2 cable had to find some other 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.979
 decision than to buy every three months 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.970
 new clutch cables peugeot expert 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:51.090
 and here is the process of creative technical 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.750
 The quest was found very good 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.440
 Deciding how to buy new rabbits 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.890
 and how to do so more than this 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.090
 cable 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:08.209
 did not break and here is the result created 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:16.250
 Here is such an uncomplicated construction 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:20.550
 which will allow us to do the following 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:25.320
 we replace this tattered 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:28.410
 part of the cable on here is so simple 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.720
 a device that is eliminate the 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.989
 the place where this mouth is constantly 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.430
 transferred to eliminate that is or 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.150
 rework like this 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:51.410
 we create we make such a clamping bolt 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:51.410
 this bolt in him stretch the cable and 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.800
 so here we screw it 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.540
 Soviet times mopeds and remember there have 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.030
 they were clutch cables something 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.160
 similar music design 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.970
 which ended 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:14.540
 and here in general we see the general 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:17.240
 the construction of this structure on the ring 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.640
 worn metal plate with 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:27.320
 made a hole this way 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:31.370
 we get a very reliable such 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.200
 coupling now I'll show where this one is 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.090
 foot 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:40.030
 in general, it is a clutch foot 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.750
 It is designed exactly for 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.460
 hydraulic clutch 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:49.790
 but in the process of reworking very 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:56.540
 talented Latvian guys this 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:58.430
 car gained mechanical release 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.910
 we will burn out but also such coupling without 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.280
 hydraulics and he has constantly one 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:09.770
 and the same problem that this cable 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:12.040
 constantly breaks well and now we see already 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.030
 assembled 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.750
 repaired glade now we 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.989
 let's see how it will be how it works 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.250
 but unfortunately there is completely impossible there 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.600
 so here to live 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:31.450
 Well, so we try to see how 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:34.820
 running itself tension place 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.590
 the previous break has been eliminated in this 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.040
 scepter rings and plates here 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.770
 What is happening here 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.340
 and there is a very reliable design that is 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.990
 even more can not happen but only 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:52.520
 see if the cable itself is bending 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:56.280
 sort of how much I see by the very 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:02.870
 the place where the cable is fixed many fold 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:04.680
 no therefore we can conclude that 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:11.390
 repaired how 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.390
 The clutch will work long and 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:32.220
 that's how it works no in my place 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.470
 bending 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:39.870
 the ocean itself . he goes straight on 5 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:44.880
 most likely we can say that 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:48.170
 he shouldn't break anymore 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.170
 problem will be fixed 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.480
 Now in this way it was
