00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:57.149 
over and I thought that that was kind of

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:58.429 
over and I thought that that was kind of
cool<00:05:57.300> so<00:05:57.539> thought<00:05:57.659> it<00:05:57.719> was<00:05:57.810> like<00:05:57.930> surprisingly

00:05:58.429 --> 00:05:58.439 
cool so thought it was like surprisingly

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.649 
cool so thought it was like surprisingly
timely<00:05:58.830> considering<00:05:59.389> what<00:06:00.389> was<00:06:00.479> going<00:06:00.599> on

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
timely considering what was going on

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:01.999 
timely considering what was going on
with<00:06:00.779> Occupy<00:06:01.050> Wall<00:06:01.199> Street<00:06:01.259> I<00:06:01.529> was<00:06:01.620> a<00:06:01.680> clear

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
with Occupy Wall Street I was a clear

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:03.709 
with Occupy Wall Street I was a clear
parallel<00:06:02.430> between<00:06:02.490> the<00:06:02.909> movie<00:06:03.120> and<00:06:03.240> I<00:06:03.360> Wall

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719 
parallel between the movie and I Wall

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.209 
parallel between the movie and I Wall
Street<00:06:03.870> so<00:06:04.080> and<00:06:04.649> I'm<00:06:04.770> not<00:06:04.860> sure<00:06:05.009> if<00:06:05.069> that<00:06:05.099> was

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:05.219 
Street so and I'm not sure if that was

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:06.320 
Street so and I'm not sure if that was
intentional<00:06:05.370> or<00:06:05.759> not<00:06:05.879> because<00:06:06.060> the<00:06:06.120> movie<00:06:06.300> was

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
intentional or not because the movie was

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.670 
intentional or not because the movie was
probably<00:06:06.689> in<00:06:06.779> production<00:06:07.139> or<00:06:07.169> written<00:06:07.469> by<00:06:07.620> the

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
probably in production or written by the

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.740 
probably in production or written by the
time<00:06:07.919> that<00:06:08.310> they<00:06:08.430> were<00:06:08.490> yeah<00:06:09.180> I<00:06:09.210> what<00:06:09.599> should

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
time that they were yeah I what should

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.659
