00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:54.659 
thing for salty kind of if somebody's
binging<00:01:52.389> how<00:01:52.569> can<00:01:52.779> they<00:01:52.899> control<00:01:53.259> that<00:01:53.669> so

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:54.669 
binging how can they control that so

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:57.460 
binging how can they control that so
binging<00:01:55.389> it<00:01:55.840> happens<00:01:56.439> for<00:01:56.649> two<00:01:56.829> reasons

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
binging it happens for two reasons

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.100 
binging it happens for two reasons
one<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:58.100> emotional<00:01:58.760> you<00:01:59.360> really<00:01:59.660> need<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.840> sit

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
one the emotional you really need to sit

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.810 
one the emotional you really need to sit
down<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.410> figure<00:02:00.620> out<00:02:00.770> why<00:02:01.130> you're<00:02:01.370> binging

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
down and figure out why you're binging

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.750 
down and figure out why you're binging
so<00:02:02.120> I<00:02:02.360> suggest<00:02:03.080> keeping<00:02:03.230> a<00:02:03.500> log<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.100> when<00:02:04.670> you

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.390 
so I suggest keeping a log and when you
feel<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.060> binge<00:02:05.420> coming<00:02:05.870> on<00:02:06.020> writing<00:02:06.950> down<00:02:07.160> in

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
feel a binge coming on writing down in

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.790 
feel a binge coming on writing down in

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
your journal or log of what time of day

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.670 
your journal or log of what time of day
is<00:02:10.100> that<00:02:10.310> where<00:02:10.940> are<00:02:11.270> you<00:02:11.570> what<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.500> your

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
is that where are you what is your

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.350 
is that where are you what is your
emotion<00:02:13.160> what<00:02:13.490> is<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:13.940> you're<00:02:14.060> craving

emotion what is it that you're craving

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.630 
emotion what is it that you're craving
and<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:15.260> can<00:02:15.410> start<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.740> kind<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.980> track<00:02:16.400> your

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
and you can start to kind of track your

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.580 
and you can start to kind of track your
emotions<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.240> little<00:02:17.270> bit<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:17.810> way<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.200> if

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
emotions a little bit that way and if

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.740 
emotions a little bit that way and if
you<00:02:18.740> do<00:02:18.980> end<00:02:19.250> up<00:02:19.460> bin<00:02:19.730> jeena<00:02:20.000> another<00:02:20.420> thing<00:02:20.660> I

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
you do end up bin jeena another thing I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.140 
you do end up bin jeena another thing I
suggest<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.380> keeping<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.250> journal<00:02:22.550> for<00:02:22.730> after

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
suggest is keeping the journal for after

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.790 
suggest is keeping the journal for after
that<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.510> writing<00:02:23.870> exactly<00:02:24.140> how<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.500> feel

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
after the binge and then write

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.860 
after the binge and then write
alternatives<00:02:28.490> for<00:02:28.760> next<00:02:29.030> time<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.360> what<00:02:29.690> you

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
alternatives for next time of what you

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.449 
alternatives for next time of what you
could<00:02:30.080> do<00:02:30.200> instead<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.860> let's<00:02:31.070> say<00:02:31.190> you're<00:02:31.370> at

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
could do instead so let's say you're at

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.580 
could do instead so let's say you're at
home<00:02:31.700> well<00:02:32.510> what<00:02:32.720> can<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:32.959> do<00:02:33.020> instead<00:02:33.530> of

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
home well what can I do instead of

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.310 
home well what can I do instead of
binging<00:02:34.100> at<00:02:34.250> home<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.700> can<00:02:35.330> go<00:02:35.450> for<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.750> walk<00:02:36.050> and

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
binging at home I can go for a walk and

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.140 
binging at home I can go for a walk and
typically<00:02:37.100> that's<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.700> really<00:02:37.910> good<00:02:38.030> way

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
typically that's a really good way

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.120 
typically that's a really good way
another<00:02:38.510> thing<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.900> always<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.530> drink<00:02:39.830> water
