00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.430
 Personal speech here is the beque holds 12 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.680
 another video and today I'll talk about 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.279
 a lot that I thought was very 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.879
 The problem is that it's for the greater 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.700
 craft 1.225 in hour magÃ© 

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:35.489
 and you already know what it is that leaves me 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.899
 take just to put my clothes on 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.710
 astronaut 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.710
 cool huh 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:51.629
 I am I came too teach to do as 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:57.690
 makes the portal is very easy to come back is 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:01.589
 that bastard will teach you how to do that 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.610
 wonderful portal losing to have 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:09.210
 even a cave remembering is broken 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.000
 Largest craft 1.285 is that right 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.130
 but I'll look for more for more 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.250
 updates lets you get a lighter 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:25.640
 to find the object in this location 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.640
 around here 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:43.990
 Reads audited shower tac not for a mash 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:46.299
 nothing here catch fire soon walk 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.330
 so you do not even have the portal 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:52.020
 kawasaki that is easier here I prefer 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.020
 shut up 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.749
 kiss 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.429
 I can not remember with almost 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:10.729
 killed the singer 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:14.900
 I think I'm sure to make water like 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.349
 is this just fast to be watched with 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.690
 You're well and ready to beat the 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.769
 background will pick up because I prefer the background 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.430
 rather than that we took is also 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:32.959
 I thought I was supposed to think it was 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:40.340
 a cool space a spaceship 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:41.599
 But it's not that you rule, for good I'll 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.209
 need 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.209
 stay there for the space 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.030
 the tram cough 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:02.980
 I arrived in space 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.980

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.730

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.730
 The river has a bubble. 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:29.810
