other subjects in school I spent two
years<00:01:44.180> drawing<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> figure<00:01:45.509> 2<00:01:46.229> years<00:01:46.619> doing

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
years drawing the figure 2 years doing

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.850 
years drawing the figure 2 years doing
anatomical<00:01:48.450> drawing<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.290> found<00:01:49.710> that

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
anatomical drawing because I found that

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.460 
anatomical drawing because I found that
fascinating<00:01:50.540> but<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.600> never<00:01:51.869> fell<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.290> love

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
fascinating but I never fell in love

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
fascinating but I never fell in love
with<00:01:52.680> drawing<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.130> figure<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.670> always<00:01:54.090> always

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
with drawing the figure I always always

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.389 
with drawing the figure I always always
went<00:01:54.990> back<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> landscape<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.189> last

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
went back to the landscape but this last

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670 
went back to the landscape but this last
year<00:01:56.820> I've<00:01:57.420> been<00:01:57.479> afraid<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.020> might<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.409> getting

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
year I've been afraid I might be getting

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.560 
year I've been afraid I might be getting
in<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.860> rut<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.610> certainly<00:02:00.000> don't<00:02:00.270> want<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
in a rut and I certainly don't want to

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.200 
in a rut and I certainly don't want to
do<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.229> I've<00:02:01.469> been<00:02:01.680> exploring<00:02:02.210> figure

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
do that so I've been exploring figure

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.719 
do that so I've been exploring figure

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
particularly fascinated with how light

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.229

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
my subject and here's my focal point I

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.100 
my subject and here's my focal point I
think<00:03:21.459> it's<00:03:21.970> important<00:03:22.420> at<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.570> point<00:03:22.930> to

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
think it's important at that point to

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.500 
think it's important at that point to
just<00:03:23.290> take<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.500> minute<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:24.360> remind<00:03:25.360> yourself

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
just take a minute and remind yourself

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.490 
just take a minute and remind yourself
to<00:03:25.959> consider<00:03:26.970> what's<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.690> angle<00:03:29.080> of<00:03:29.260> light

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
to consider what's the angle of light

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.650 
to consider what's the angle of light
what's<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.070> position<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.820> Sun<00:03:31.090> what<00:03:31.450> time

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
what's the position of the Sun what time
