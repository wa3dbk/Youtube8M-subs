 they put aside their housework and 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.750
 of work to protest before the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.360
 Tijuana City Council and is that since 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.910
 early this is what they see in the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.269
 television the 'analog blackout' them 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.730
 I remove the TV signal the television and the 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.590
 child wants to see the cartoons as 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.570
 but you have children and you also call them 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.860
 attention the technique if we do not look for 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.060
 without anything 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.040
 and here they are not part of the inhabitants of 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.770
 at least 100 colonies where households 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.630
 they do not have digital televisions and 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.970
 where the decoders did not arrive 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.340
 that they should receive for free 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.440
 part of the coffeel so that his old 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.190
 televisions received the signal 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.190
 they passed by my house 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.000
 since this guy 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.920
 so that it's even, it's not worth the truth 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.079
 it is not worth that they have done to us is that 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.730
 you're federal they're not going to tell us anything 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.710
 but how is it possible that when 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.240
 they were giving to me I did not 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.979
 they gave me I have no cable or anything 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.750
 they took the protest to the 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.450
 town hall because it was his second 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.820
 option on the free phone arranged 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.159
 by the cofetel they never answered and the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.899
 mayor had to respond according to this 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.270
 notice that appeared since Monday on the 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.310

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.800
 municipal nor did they warn him or even 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.490
 they were able to advise in the morning 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 We speak with a Mr. engineer Fernando 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.860

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.210
 that he did not know what bothers the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.790
 affected is that they have been left without 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.160

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.619
