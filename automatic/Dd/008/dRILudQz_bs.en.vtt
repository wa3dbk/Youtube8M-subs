00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.820
 I looked into the people at once and saw that 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.450
 he serves omon people for thousands of years 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.870
 tried to resurrect his lord 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.359
 everything converges endless conflict between 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.760
 protoss zerg hybrids 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.340
 all of this part of the resurrection plan 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:30.330
 cupid 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:34.110
 unless we stop his hybrids 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:40.430
 they have strong esencia 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:43.530
 but I canâ€™t collect it 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.250
 do you think you will get more sentsa if 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:53.309
 stand on his side he serves that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:58.140
 who can devour the whole essence of the world you 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.950
 talking about me i think he's dead and i 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.400
 make sure that he is not resurrected 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:08.690
 if he comes to life and the heart is consumed 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.880
 development becomes 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.880
 I will not allow it 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.190
 people are hiding in the lab 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.580
 he tries to shut himself off me but i 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.770
 still feel his power tell me 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.110
 showers 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.680
 I have never encountered anything 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.420
 like 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.390
 but you destroyed the ancient soaked all 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.660
 tier strength 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:42.490
 he is a creature of emptiness 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:45.490
 cold and soulless but its power 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.490
 prohibitively 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.659
 we sense the presence of strange creatures 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.500
 in the laboratory besides the ancient ministers 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:02.009
 evil and hybrids is protas and my queen 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.190
 many protoss yes now I feel them 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.390
 taldarims 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.450
 they voluntarily serve well 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:15.900
 worship him they worship the dead 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.900
 god and that makes them even more dangerous 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.860
 I wonder how people are planning to resurrect 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.620
 such a powerful being to whom i am 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.320
 I think with the help of the hybrid of they take 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.120
 all one energy but can they 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.570
 save enough to resurrect 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.330
 dead god you said you were again 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.090
 turned into a man by the ancient 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.730
 green artifact 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.420
 but where did all the energy go after that 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.519
 who possessed the queen of blades 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.290
 you think that hybrid and at that moment 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:56.880
 swallowed up my power 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:59.890
 and then used her so he no 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.739
 if people used for this 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.650
 Zela-Naga artifact could accumulate 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.650
 enough energy to resurrect uno 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.730
 dream dream
