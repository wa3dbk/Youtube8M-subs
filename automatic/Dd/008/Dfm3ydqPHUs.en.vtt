the other one of the first layer and
when<00:02:33.410> we<00:02:33.530> apply<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.920> third<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.730> will<00:02:35.450> leave<00:02:35.600> a

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.060 

well<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.540> summed<00:02:42.810> up<00:02:42.930> max<00:02:43.230> on<00:02:43.470> neuro<00:02:43.680> usually

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
well you summed up max on neuro usually

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.430 
well you summed up max on neuro usually
I<00:02:44.100> make<00:02:44.370> 3<00:02:44.700> because<00:02:45.090> 3<00:02:45.270> gives<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.260> nice

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440
