00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.410
 as strong as the elephants and so convulsive to those who do not want 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.839
 be like that 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.799
 thanks to the high speed plans of obama these ideals are ours a lot 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.400
 easier to reach than until now 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.380
 I have many examples of people marrying the same system 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.720
 on the same ship that is trying to eat healthy and lose weight 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.819
 it is therefore not surprising that you should maintain that 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:32.079
 this in the last century in the mountains done research and healthy food every 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.610
 other villages are in berlin switzerland 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.370
 He said that all his food can be eaten 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.930
 were very important for human health 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.380
 and this is an american operating company rack cabinets 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.610
 dental surgery has also done research 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.880
 that people much better place a squatter 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.120
 number of food topics 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.420
 to absorb 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.429
 on the whole day this is not just that convenient 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:02.689
 I also have all kinds of tests not to get fast enough but especially the 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:04.809
 available at the rear right 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.100
 the most important obstacle for a big and good question 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.900
 could not record well 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.090
 but it can certainly make a few happy but that is now possible again 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.920
 and it appears that as people to a large extent 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.730
 this kind of food that our souls are also heading in the right direction 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:22.370
 others 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.470
 think, for example, that it will make work and each other have a good chance of that 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.470
 right now the interest rates are those 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.320
 You can be very sorry that it turns out to be much fitter and healthier and stronger 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.960
 to become 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.850
 as part of us he made the state television as made by 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.549
 bucket and just as an example 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.380
 I get hold if they have a patent case and 25 years why I would certainly 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.429
 also 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.240
 this can be many m in his room 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.149
 and I did a lot of fun myself
