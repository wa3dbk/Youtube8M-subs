program that's coming around having so
we<00:02:49.580> realized<00:02:50.000> as<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.180> touch<00:02:50.450> device<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.140> we're

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
we realized as a touch device and we're

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.110 
we realized as a touch device and we're
on<00:02:51.500> could<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.100> your<00:02:52.190> keyboard<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.580> do
