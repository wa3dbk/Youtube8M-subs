the<00:00:10.260> triceps<00:00:10.710> consists<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.190> three<00:00:11.429> muscles

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
the triceps consists of three muscles

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.820 
the triceps consists of three muscles
and<00:00:12.000> its<00:00:12.120> primary<00:00:12.389> function<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.139> extend

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
and its primary function is to extend

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.180 
and its primary function is to extend
the<00:00:14.160> arm<00:00:14.340> as<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.389> stands<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.929> lot<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.650> people<00:00:16.949> are

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.990 
in terms of muscle stimulation in fact
it<00:00:31.380> would<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.619> better<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.700> bring<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
it would be better for you to bring the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.630 
it would be better for you to bring the
arms<00:00:33.270> well<00:00:33.570> past<00:00:33.899> 90<00:00:34.200> degrees<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.739> extend

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
arms well past 90 degrees and extend

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.549 
arms well past 90 degrees and extend
them<00:00:35.790> stopping<00:00:36.300> short<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.719> lockout<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.469> it

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
them stopping short of lockout then it

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.319 
them stopping short of lockout then it
would<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.010> come<00:00:38.640> up<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.850> 90<00:00:39.030> degrees<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
would be to come up to 90 degrees and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.660 
would be to come up to 90 degrees and
extend<00:00:39.780> down<00:00:39.960> take<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> triceps<00:00:41.280> dip<00:00:41.489> for

extend down take the triceps dip for

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.090 
extend down take the triceps dip for
example<00:00:42.200> it's<00:00:43.200> very<00:00:43.230> common<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.829> people<00:00:43.860> to

complete opposite when it comes to
positioning<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> seat<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.879> don't<00:01:00.030> want<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
positioning the seat you don't want to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.939

put<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> seat<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.960> way<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.859> if

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
put the seat all the way up because if

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.979 
put the seat all the way up because if
you<00:01:02.010> put<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> seat<00:01:02.520> too<00:01:02.699> high<00:01:02.969> what's<00:01:03.870> gonna

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
you put the seat too high what's gonna

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.359 
you put the seat too high what's gonna
happen<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> weights<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.129> hit<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
happen is the weights going to hit the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.609 
happen is the weights going to hit the
stack<00:01:05.670> before<00:01:06.119> your<00:01:06.570> arms<00:01:06.810> break<00:01:07.020> 90<00:01:07.200> degrees

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
stack before your arms break 90 degrees

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.649 
stack before your arms break 90 degrees
the<00:01:08.100> objective<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.729> place<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> seat<00:01:09.450> low

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the objective is to place the seat low

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
the objective is to place the seat low
enough<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.500> allow<00:01:10.710> your<00:01:10.860> arms<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.220> break<00:01:11.520> 90

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
enough to allow your arms to break 90

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
enough to allow your arms to break 90
degrees<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.630> way<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.990> before<00:01:13.619> extending

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
degrees on the way up before extending

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.920 
degrees on the way up before extending
downward<00:01:14.340> another<00:01:15.180> common<00:01:15.659> error<00:01:15.869> that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
downward another common error that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.179 
downward another common error that
people<00:01:16.229> make<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.530> trying<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> keep<00:01:17.009> their<00:01:17.159> body

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
people make is trying to keep their body

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.950 
people make is trying to keep their body
upright<00:01:17.610> because<00:01:18.210> sometimes<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.720> read<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
upright because sometimes you read the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.240 
upright because sometimes you read the
magazines<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> sit<00:01:19.950> totally

upright when you're training with

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
upright when you're training with
triceps<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.380> try<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> maintain<00:01:22.799> an

triceps see if you try to maintain an
upright<00:01:23.610> posture<00:01:23.850> when<00:01:24.150> performing<00:01:24.540> dips<00:01:24.810> not

break past 90 degrees on the way up but

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.469 
break past 90 degrees on the way up but
you're<00:01:29.250> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> place<00:01:29.610> an<00:01:29.820> enormous<00:01:30.299> amount

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you're going to place an enormous amount

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.179 
you're going to place an enormous amount
of<00:01:30.600> stress<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.079> both<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> shoulder<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.979> elbow
