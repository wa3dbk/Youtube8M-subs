i am going in to a darker ones to give a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
i am going in to a darker ones to give a
little<00:01:38.009> bit<00:01:38.189> more<00:01:38.369> steps<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.540> one<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
little bit more steps I for that one I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.460 
little bit more steps I for that one I
used<00:01:40.320> gumdrop<00:01:41.009> green<00:01:41.520> ink<00:01:41.880> pad<00:01:42.259> for<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
used gumdrop green ink pad for the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.740 
used gumdrop green ink pad for the
flower<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.640> flower<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.450> pretty

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
flower I think this flower is so pretty

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.420 
flower I think this flower is so pretty
and<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.740> sits<00:01:47.130> right<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:49.079> leaf<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and it sits right on to the leaf and the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.330 
and it sits right on to the leaf and the
stamp<00:01:51.030> stamp<00:01:51.810> set<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.409> if<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.070> really

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
stamp stamp set and if it's really

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.450 
stamp stamp set and if it's really
nicely<00:01:53.579> easy<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.210> build<00:01:54.360> together<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:56.009> even<00:01:56.340> if

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
nicely easy to build together so even if

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.580 
nicely easy to build together so even if
you<00:01:56.579> don't<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:56.969> misty<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.960> easily<00:01:58.320> put

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
you don't have misty you can easily put

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
you don't have misty you can easily put
it<00:01:58.680> together<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:59.399> that's<00:02:00.090> another

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
it together because that's another

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.350 
it together because that's another
advantage<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:01.170> clear<00:02:01.860> stamp<00:02:02.159> set<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.180> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
advantage of clear stamp set so I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.160 
advantage of clear stamp set so I
stamped<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.439> red<00:02:05.070> hot<00:02:05.399> pink<00:02:05.899> this<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
stamped it with red hot pink this is a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.219 
stamped it with red hot pink this is a

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
sentiment with some foam tape the one

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.610 
sentiment with some foam tape the one
particular<00:04:22.840> thing<00:04:22.870> that<00:04:23.140> I<00:04:23.169> really<00:04:23.380> like

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
particular thing that I really like

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.190 
particular thing that I really like
about<00:04:23.650> this<00:04:24.039> ink<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:25.030> hybrid<00:04:25.479> ink<00:04:25.780> so<00:04:25.900> they

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
about this ink the hybrid ink so they

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.040 
about this ink the hybrid ink so they
drive<00:04:26.380> really<00:04:26.620> fast<00:04:26.770> and<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:28.270> has<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.600> nice

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
drive really fast and it has a nice

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.700 
drive really fast and it has a nice
property<00:04:29.890> of<00:04:30.100> both<00:04:30.460> dye<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:31.330> pigment<00:04:31.660> ink<00:04:32.110> so

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
property of both dye and pigment ink so

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.190 
property of both dye and pigment ink so
you<00:04:32.800> get<00:04:33.010> that<00:04:33.220> rich<00:04:33.460> color<00:04:33.940> but<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.930> dries

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
you get that rich color but it dries

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.280 
you get that rich color but it dries
fast<00:04:35.740> so<00:04:36.160> you<00:04:36.250> can<00:04:36.610> actually<00:04:37.030> add<00:04:37.300> some

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
fast so you can actually add some

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.900 
fast so you can actually add some
shimmer<00:04:38.620> on<00:04:38.680> top<00:04:39.070> of<00:04:39.250> it<00:04:39.340> right<00:04:39.580> away<00:04:39.610> you

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
shimmer on top of it right away you

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.480 
shimmer on top of it right away you
don't<00:04:40.180> have<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.480> wait<00:04:40.660> too<00:04:40.930> long<00:04:41.170> for<00:04:41.530> regular

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
don't have to wait too long for regular

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.880 
don't have to wait too long for regular
pigment<00:04:42.970> like<00:04:43.150> regular<00:04:43.660> pigments<00:04:44.230> dry<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:44.860> I

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
pigment like regular pigments dry so I

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.850 
pigment like regular pigments dry so I
