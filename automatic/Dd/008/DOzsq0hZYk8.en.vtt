00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.750
 in two motorized wheels the helmet is the 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.070
 only mandatory equipment but before 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.779
 to let you dream to yours before 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.000
 windows zÃ©rotracas pointed va 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.770
 asked a specialist to remove his 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.540
 to talk to us about the helmets 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.860
 Marc Bertrand's advice 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.329
 road safety mission to 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.970
 French federation of bikers in 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.800
 anger a cheap helmet of the world who 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.750
 turns him the guide offers the same the 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.320
 same guarantee of safety as a helmet 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.550
 top of the line 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.870
 the price difference is the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.300
 difference in quality the difference of 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.800
 comfort to then after there is the look 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.170
 there are some who buy themselves 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.020
 replica helmets like helmets 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.950
 low pilots at a price the helmet 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.900
 is mandatory but then which one 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.590
 choose which one offers the 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.410
 better protection 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.450
 a priori the best protection is 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.870
 the integral to it protects the face in case 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.590
 of fall 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.670
 and the backside then drinking 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.440
 the integral offers the best 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.120
 protection throws it from a worse 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.250
 protection 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.229
 in any case in shock resistance 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.380
 by cons the jet he still has a 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.390
 interest is that when we have a throw on 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.079
 the head one is much more aware 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.670
 wind noises finally 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.079
 maybe a little slower with a jet 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.740
 and we may be a little more attentive 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.380
 with a jet 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.719
 in this sense the jet can also participate 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.840
 to motorcycle safety then 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:28.030
 between the two the solution maybe of 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.459
 to say that we will take a helmet 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.520
 modular that will offer protection 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:35.170
 equivalent to the integral and then a 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.429
 relationship with external events 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.920
 equal to the jets 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.499
 yes but be careful when you wear allain 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.380
 modular with the chinrest open 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:46.179
 this is the worst of all because at the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.579
 time we even had the protection that can 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.090
 offer the screen a jet and in addition to 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.999
 fall case 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.969
 the chin strap can create a sitting 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:57.579
 during a slip make that head 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.499
 can all of a sudden be tipped over a 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.939
 very violent movement what can be 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.889
 extremely detrimental to 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.349
 cervical with all the consequences 

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.670
 that he receives so there is no helmet 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.310
 ideal 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.200
 there is the case in which the user is 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.930
 feel good and above all a good helmet 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.560
 tied then again the throw he keeps 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.720
 all his favors 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.330
 we have no choice we are obliged therefore 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.390
 only in the attached but of the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.620
 squeeze because with the wind if not 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.420
 not tight the djia who will put himself 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.600
 to move that to say very uncomfortable 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.800
 which is not the case with an integral 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.350
 I can leave with an integral 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.480
 forgetting data jugular diagram and I 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.310
 can ride like this up to 50 km / h 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.319
 the case which will of course be the head 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.640
 only in case of fall or in case 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.630
 of accident even if it happens a 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.519
 very low speed even 20 km 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.500
 the gas that is likely to leave and in this 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.790
 case my head is not protected anymore 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.650
 it is to explain that there is no 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.450
 ideal solution there are there are 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.430
 tailored solutions and solutions 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.190
 adapted to the used to the experience of 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.470
 the user and and the compromise that goes 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.569
 find to be the most comfortable the 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.190
 more in comfort and the more secure 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.890
 and in case of shock 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.269
 at each shock then either the shock is 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.860
 occurred while we had the helmet on 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.019
 the head and that we have unfortunately not 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.280
 been hurt either the helmet fell 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.380
 a fairly important height 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.840
 it needs to be changed that needs to be 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.090
 replaced because what they get damaged 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.079
 this is the cap here the cap is 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.660
 seven years is under coke or can 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.900
 estimate in general under the effect of shock 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.030
 she cups herself once she's pretty 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.709
 she does not come back so a helmet 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.290
 used never we will buy a 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.720
 new helmet we try it we attach them 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.940
 we look at how we are with we turn 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.380
 the head we go down we will put ourselves on 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.620
 the motorcycle eventually if it is parked 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.239
 in front of the in the helmet store 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.799
 must feel good and leave happy 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.210
 to have bought his angry helmet 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.210
 unhappy 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.210
 Oh
