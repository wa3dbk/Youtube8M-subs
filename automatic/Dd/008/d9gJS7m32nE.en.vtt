you<00:00:21.320> know<00:00:21.500> mini<00:00:21.770> is<00:00:22.040> always<00:00:22.430> on<00:00:22.579> the<00:00:22.700> move<00:00:22.880> and

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
you know mini is always on the move and

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.490 
you know mini is always on the move and
now<00:00:24.349> a<00:00:24.680> mini<00:00:25.399> is<00:00:26.059> looking<00:00:26.480> into<00:00:26.689> moving<00:00:27.200> into<00:00:27.470> a

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
now a mini is looking into moving into a

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.850 
now a mini is looking into moving into a
very<00:00:27.770> new<00:00:27.950> territory<00:00:28.579> and<00:00:28.849> that<00:00:29.329> might<00:00:29.570> be<00:00:29.869> fun

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
very new territory and that might be fun

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:40.849 
very new territory and that might be fun
on<00:00:31.070> two<00:00:31.279> wheels<00:00:31.520> I<00:00:31.880> would<00:00:32.090> almost<00:00:32.239> say

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.529 

well<00:00:41.859> the<00:00:41.980> scooters<00:00:42.430> are<00:00:42.640> powered<00:00:43.269> by<00:00:43.300> an

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
well the scooters are powered by an

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.180 
well the scooters are powered by an
electric<00:00:43.989> drivetrain<00:00:44.590> and<00:00:44.829> that<00:00:45.010> would

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
electric drivetrain and that would

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.970 
electric drivetrain and that would
result<00:00:45.550> in<00:00:45.820> in<00:00:46.120> zero<00:00:46.690> emission<00:00:47.230> when<00:00:47.649> we<00:00:47.829> are

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
result in in zero emission when we are

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.130 
result in in zero emission when we are
looking<00:00:48.129> into<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.670> future<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:49.239> thinking

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
looking into the future and thinking

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.619 
looking into the future and thinking
about<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.469> new<00:00:50.860> type<00:00:51.100> of<00:00:51.339> vehicle<00:00:51.789> we<00:00:52.089> felt<00:00:52.359> it

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
about a new type of vehicle we felt it

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.869 
about a new type of vehicle we felt it
would<00:00:52.750> only<00:00:52.930> be<00:00:53.199> right<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.469> make<00:00:54.070> this<00:00:54.309> the

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
would only be right to make this the

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.330 
would only be right to make this the
zero<00:00:55.149> emission<00:00:55.300> right<00:00:55.809> from<00:00:56.109> the<00:00:56.199> start

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
zero emission right from the start

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.549 
zero emission right from the start
the<00:00:59.030> design<00:00:59.360> team<00:00:59.390> had<00:00:59.960> a<00:00:59.989> lot<00:01:00.110> of<00:01:00.350> fun

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
the design team had a lot of fun

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.960 
the design team had a lot of fun
creating<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.940> mini<00:01:02.170> electric<00:01:03.170> scooter<00:01:03.710> and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
creating the mini electric scooter and

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.550 
creating the mini electric scooter and
they're<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.299> much<00:01:05.510> fun<00:01:05.780> in<00:01:05.960> fact<00:01:06.229> that<00:01:06.409> we

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
they're so much fun in fact that we

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.350 
they're so much fun in fact that we
decided<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.159> build<00:01:07.340> three<00:01:07.640> of<00:01:07.759> them<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:11.150> white

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
decided to build three of them the white

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.560 
decided to build three of them the white
one<00:01:11.659> is<00:01:11.930> something<00:01:12.590> that<00:01:13.130> was<00:01:13.520> actually<00:01:13.759> for

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
one is something that was actually for

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.260 
one is something that was actually for
us<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:14.960> design<00:01:15.350> an<00:01:15.740> opportunity<00:01:16.520> that<00:01:16.759> was<00:01:16.970> too

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
us in design an opportunity that was too

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.649 
us in design an opportunity that was too
good<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:18.259> miss<00:01:18.470> mini<00:01:19.399> does<00:01:19.700> not<00:01:19.909> have<00:01:20.149> scooter

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
good to miss mini does not have scooter

good to miss mini does not have scooter
heritage<00:01:21.140> but<00:01:21.770> England<00:01:22.159> does<00:01:22.399> and<00:01:23.330> this

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
heritage but England does and this

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.660 
heritage but England does and this
happens<00:01:23.960> in<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.290> sixties<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.009> was<00:01:25.130> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
happens in the sixties and it was the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.270 
happens in the sixties and it was the
motor<00:01:25.909> movement<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:27.049> was<00:01:27.259> a<00:01:27.320> mixture<00:01:28.009> between

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
motor movement it was a mixture between

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.080 
motor movement it was a mixture between
scooters<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.240> fashion<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.960> in<00:01:30.410> a<00:01:30.560> certain

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
scooters and fashion and in a certain

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.600 
scooters and fashion and in a certain
free-thinking<00:01:32.090> attitude<00:01:32.810> we<00:01:33.590> built<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:34.399> grey

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
free-thinking attitude we built the grey

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.469 
free-thinking attitude we built the grey
and<00:01:34.789> yellow<00:01:34.970> one

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
and yellow one

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.960 
and yellow one
because<00:01:36.380> this<00:01:36.860> culture<00:01:37.280> makes<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.640> connection

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
because this culture makes a connection

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.609 
because this culture makes a connection
to<00:01:38.509> a<00:01:38.539> mini<00:01:38.990> electric<00:01:39.560> car

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.399 

the<00:01:47.619> dark<00:01:47.890> green<00:01:48.130> one<00:01:48.460> is<00:01:48.789> actually<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.810> model

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
the dark green one is actually a model

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.800 
the dark green one is actually a model
that<00:01:50.439> shows<00:01:50.590> luxury<00:01:51.460> that<00:01:51.759> shows<00:01:52.000> premium

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
that shows luxury that shows premium

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.859 
that shows luxury that shows premium

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
shows and that actually such a scooter

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:03.300 
shows and that actually such a scooter
can<00:01:56.350> be<00:01:56.500> very<00:01:56.740> elegant<00:02:00.689> every<00:02:01.689> surface<00:02:02.020> is<00:02:02.979> I

for<00:02:06.789> a<00:02:06.819> minute<00:02:07.479> we<00:02:07.990> made<00:02:08.200> sure<00:02:08.229> that

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
for a minute we made sure that

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.979 
for a minute we made sure that
especially<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.729> headlamp<00:02:10.119> for<00:02:10.179> example<00:02:10.869> of

especially the headlamp for example of
the<00:02:11.140> scooter<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:12.400> looks<00:02:12.610> like<00:02:12.819> it's<00:02:13.030> part<00:02:13.269> of

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the scooter it looks like it's part of

carry over headlamp of the car if you
then<00:02:21.220> look<00:02:21.250> at<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.790> saddle<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.360> the

handlebar at the back of the settle this
looks<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.260> little<00:02:26.380> bit<00:02:26.650> like<00:02:26.829> a<00:02:26.890> mini<00:02:27.190> roof
