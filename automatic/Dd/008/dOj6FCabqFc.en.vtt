through our one-way valve and you can
soon<00:02:11.099> see<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.550> bubbling<00:02:12.060> up<00:02:12.239> here

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
soon see it bubbling up here

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.059 
soon see it bubbling up here
it's<00:02:13.690> going<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.900> bubble<00:02:14.200> up<00:02:14.319> here<00:02:14.590> build<00:02:14.860> up<00:02:14.980> a

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
it's going to bubble up here build up a

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.860 
it's going to bubble up here build up a
little<00:02:15.310> pressure<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.970> start<00:02:16.360> coming<00:02:16.720> out<00:02:16.840> of

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
little pressure and start coming out of

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.170 
little pressure and start coming out of
our<00:02:17.110> gauge<00:02:17.380> but<00:02:17.830> remember<00:02:18.220> our<00:02:18.400> gauge<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:19.000> not

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
our gauge but remember our gauge is not

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.590 
our gauge but remember our gauge is not
accurate<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:20.020> meant<00:02:20.319> for<00:02:20.440> air<00:02:21.100> not<00:02:22.060> hydrogen

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
accurate it's meant for air not hydrogen

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.780 
accurate it's meant for air not hydrogen
gas<00:02:22.990> so<00:02:23.440> it's<00:02:23.980> not<00:02:24.130> going<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.370> be<00:02:24.430> terribly

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
gas so it's not going to be terribly

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.290 
gas so it's not going to be terribly
accurate<00:02:25.440> roughly<00:02:26.440> we're<00:02:26.680> putting<00:02:27.069> out<00:02:27.300> maybe

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
accurate roughly we're putting out maybe

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.199 
accurate roughly we're putting out maybe
a<00:02:28.480> half<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.959> liter<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.670> hydrogen<00:02:30.670> per<00:02:30.850> minute

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
a half a liter of hydrogen per minute

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.320 
a half a liter of hydrogen per minute
now<00:02:31.989> that's<00:02:32.200> not<00:02:32.410> terribly<00:02:32.920> efficient<00:02:33.520> but<00:02:34.209> at

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
now that's not terribly efficient but at

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.090 
now that's not terribly efficient but at
least<00:02:34.569> we've<00:02:34.959> proved<00:02:35.319> that<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:35.830> be<00:02:36.069> done

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
least we've proved that it can be done

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.880 
least we've proved that it can be done
on<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.640> small<00:02:37.000> scale<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.170> scale<00:02:38.560> this<00:02:38.739> up

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
on a small scale you can scale this up

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.830 
on a small scale you can scale this up
and<00:02:39.040> make<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.220> lot<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.489> hydrogen<00:02:40.120> enough<00:02:40.690> to

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
and make a lot of hydrogen enough to

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.960 
and make a lot of hydrogen enough to
power<00:02:41.020> your<00:02:41.260> car<00:02:41.530> your<00:02:41.860> house<00:02:42.100> whatever<00:02:42.760> you

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
power your car your house whatever you

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.480 
power your car your house whatever you
want<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.330> do
