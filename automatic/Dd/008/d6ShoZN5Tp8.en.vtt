from<00:02:04.330> it<00:02:04.539> and<00:02:04.720> luckily<00:02:05.619> it's<00:02:06.069> living<00:02:06.929> because

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
from it and luckily it's living because

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.830 
from it and luckily it's living because
that<00:02:08.590> one<00:02:08.770> was<00:02:08.890> really<00:02:09.160> cool<00:02:09.459> looking<00:02:09.759> but<00:02:10.119> the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
that one was really cool looking but the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.180 
that one was really cool looking but the
leaves<00:02:11.050> were<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.200> lot<00:02:11.319> bigger<00:02:11.560> but<00:02:11.770> this<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.069> all

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
leaves were a lot bigger but this is all

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.040 
leaves were a lot bigger but this is all
that<00:02:12.340> survived<00:02:12.730> but<00:02:12.970> I'm<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:13.690> happy<00:02:13.900> that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
that survived but I'm just happy that

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.680 
that survived but I'm just happy that
surviving<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:15.129> is<00:02:15.280> my<00:02:15.430> dwarf<00:02:15.760> coleus<00:02:16.390> a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
surviving this is my dwarf coleus a

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.260 
surviving this is my dwarf coleus a
little<00:02:17.590> baby

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
little baby

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.780 
little baby
this<00:02:19.270> one<00:02:19.510> was<00:02:20.080> grown<00:02:20.379> was<00:02:21.310> planted<00:02:21.670> at<00:02:21.760> the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
this one was grown was planted at the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.300 
this one was grown was planted at the
exact<00:02:22.209> same<00:02:22.420> time<00:02:22.720> as<00:02:22.900> all<00:02:23.050> these<00:02:23.260> where<00:02:24.190> as

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
exact same time as all these where as

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.530 
exact same time as all these where as
though<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.610> was<00:02:24.700> actually<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.209> bigger<00:02:25.390> ones

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
though it was actually the bigger ones

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.280 
though it was actually the bigger ones
I<00:02:26.599> don't<00:02:27.170> know<00:02:27.230> maybe<00:02:27.409> the<00:02:27.650> smaller<00:02:27.920> ones<00:02:28.159> but

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
I don't know maybe the smaller ones but

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.520 
I don't know maybe the smaller ones but
it<00:02:30.290> won't<00:02:30.560> grow<00:02:30.680> big

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.350 

and<00:02:33.860> it's<00:02:34.220> maturing<00:02:34.730> but<00:02:34.760> it's<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.090> really

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
and it's maturing but it's just really

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.080 
and it's maturing but it's just really
small<00:02:36.790> where's<00:02:37.790> these

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.930 

okay<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:43.470> had<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.890> bunch<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.280> seedlings<00:02:44.819> that

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
okay so I had a bunch of seedlings that

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.610 
okay so I had a bunch of seedlings that
I<00:02:45.090> wasn't<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.630> wasn't<00:02:45.900> planning<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.380> letting

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
I wasn't I wasn't planning on letting

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.240 
I wasn't I wasn't planning on letting
live<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.340> sprayed<00:02:47.849> them<00:02:48.890> every<00:02:49.890> once<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.160> a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
live but I sprayed them every once in a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.350 
live but I sprayed them every once in a
while<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.550> they<00:02:50.610> stayed<00:02:50.849> alive<00:02:51.090> and

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
while and they stayed alive and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.470 
while and they stayed alive and
eventually<00:02:51.870> some<00:02:52.080> became<00:02:52.380> cool-looking

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
eventually some became cool-looking

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.850 
eventually some became cool-looking
that's<00:02:54.480> one<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.750> home<00:02:54.900> depot<00:02:55.110> once<00:02:55.440> this

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
that's one of the home depot once this

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.110 
that's one of the home depot once this
one<00:02:56.069> used<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.400> be<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.959> prettiest<00:02:57.959> one<00:02:58.880> but<00:02:59.880> I

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
one used to be the prettiest one but I

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.270 
one used to be the prettiest one but I
cut<00:03:00.599> off<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.840> tip<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:01.080> I'm<00:03:01.590> making<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.980> routing

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
cut off the tip and I'm making a routing

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.790 
cut off the tip and I'm making a routing
inside<00:03:02.580> but<00:03:03.540> it's<00:03:03.660> still<00:03:03.810> alive<00:03:04.080> before<00:03:04.560> going

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
inside but it's still alive before going

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.690 
inside but it's still alive before going
to<00:03:04.860> pop<00:03:05.069> up<00:03:06.769> it<00:03:07.769> was<00:03:07.920> just<00:03:08.069> really<00:03:08.220> weak<00:03:08.489> but

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
to pop up it was just really weak but

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.180 
to pop up it was just really weak but
now<00:03:08.819> it's<00:03:09.030> going<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.180> be<00:03:09.300> strong<00:03:09.569> now<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.230> all

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
now it's going to be strong now and all

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.259 
now it's going to be strong now and all
these<00:03:11.430> are<00:03:11.489> green<00:03:12.030> with<00:03:12.510> yellow<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:14.060> as<00:03:15.060> you

these are green with yellow and as you

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.880 
these are green with yellow and as you
can<00:03:15.420> see<00:03:15.630> green<00:03:15.989> with<00:03:16.170> yellow<00:03:16.319> makes<00:03:16.680> some

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890

were like ugly plain looking the
majority<00:03:37.410> are<00:03:37.860> gone<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.459> just<00:03:38.670> like

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
majority are gone this is just like

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.440 
majority are gone this is just like
a<00:03:40.050> few<00:03:40.830> /<00:03:41.010> small<00:03:41.280> percentage<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.880> what<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.150> had

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
a few / small percentage of what I had

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.860 
a few / small percentage of what I had
for<00:03:43.320> with<00:03:43.470> these<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:44.100> really<00:03:44.370> pretty<00:03:44.550> ones

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
for with these the really pretty ones

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
for with these the really pretty ones
once<00:03:45.870> they<00:03:45.990> get<00:03:46.110> in<00:03:46.230> because<00:03:46.380> once<00:03:46.770> they

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
once they get in because once they

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.560 
once they get in because once they
become<00:03:47.160> big<00:03:47.340> bushes<00:03:47.760> which<00:03:48.240> I'm<00:03:48.390> going<00:03:48.510> to

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
become big bushes which I'm going to

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.810 
become big bushes which I'm going to
make<00:03:48.690> them<00:03:48.810> big<00:03:48.990> bushes<00:03:49.350> live<00:03:50.070> in<00:03:50.220> South<00:03:50.610> Texas

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
make them big bushes live in South Texas

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.200 
make them big bushes live in South Texas
so<00:03:51.180> all<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.200> right<00:03:52.320> climate<00:03:52.560> for<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.210> I'm

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
so all the right climate for it I'm

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.410 
so all the right climate for it I'm
going<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.390> take<00:03:54.540> cuttings<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:56.090> make<00:03:57.090> entire

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
going to take cuttings and make entire

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.470 
going to take cuttings and make entire
you<00:03:58.350> know<00:03:58.380> I'm<00:03:58.680> they<00:03:58.770> using<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.130> put<00:03:59.310> not<00:04:00.240> here

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
you know I'm they using to put not here

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.670 
you know I'm they using to put not here
but<00:04:00.660> somewhere<00:04:00.690> else<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.350> my<00:04:01.440> house<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.830> stuff

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
but somewhere else to my house and stuff

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.910 
but somewhere else to my house and stuff
and<00:04:03.909> yeah<00:04:04.909> so<00:04:05.239> maybe<00:04:06.230> I<00:04:06.349> can<00:04:06.470> figure<00:04:06.739> out<00:04:06.830> how
