00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.500
 hello again all then forgot my name 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.860
 max today as we always say 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.189
 about gopro cameras and and analogs and today i 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.710
 I will continue the topic of useful accessories for 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.960
 gopro cameras and show you one more 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.610
 interesting accessory which I constantly 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160
 I use more precisely two accessories for 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.949
 gopro cameras are very often rented 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.900
 various events of our life we take 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.269
 camera take it off a few seconds 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.100
 then forced her somewhere away again 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.670
 get shot again a few seconds 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.610
 so many, many times because 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.890
 the lens on the gopro cameras is pretty 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.350
 scratch sensitive we have to 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.710
 tidy up the camera in boxing or god collect 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.730
 somewhere else safe place and then 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.579
 pretty awkward 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.039
 again get and clean the camera so 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.500
 extremely convenient for such cases 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.350
 use here such an accessory which 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.970
 worth it really just pennies you can 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.649
 and in our store you can buy 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.110
 most other Chinese sites and here 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.770
 this cap just fits 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.990
 lenses and closes and that is, we got 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.580
 the camera 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.500
 took a little shot on there filmed yourself 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.929
 said something to the camera all super 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.310
 cool put on the cover took the cameras pocket 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.530
 and actually all of our lenses are absolutely 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.330
 protected from dirt dust and other 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.580
 many unpleasant moments in such 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.750
 situations are a little different 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.959
 the method is simply removed the protective camera 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.959
 boxing 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.590
 and then when you need to take off again 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.549
 some small fragment gets 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.200
 atbox camera 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.920
 the disadvantage of this method of protection 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.819
 is the need constantly 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.299
 open close box 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:00.520
 among other things, the protective part of the lens 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.469
 on the box itself is also subject 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.060
 any mechanical damage 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.069
 scratches which can later 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.319
 affect the quality of your video 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.940
 so for this situation I advise 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.370
 use another one like this 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.019
 the cap which is also 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.000
 quite inexpensive but it is 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.130
 just an indispensable accessory i 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.049
 almost constantly using it we 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.140
 also we dress him on that part 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:27.129
 boxing which settles our lenses 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.920
 cameras are all now the lens of boxing itself 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.620
 also protected from any damage 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.690
 and your images will always be 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.000
 continue to please you in general extremely 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.160

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.680
