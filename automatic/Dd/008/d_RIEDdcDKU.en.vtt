00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.899
 here you have a new chevrolet aveo 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.600
 five doors this time with the 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:10.900
 95 horsepower diesel engine and level 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.519
 of ltz equipment that is the highest 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.510
 it costs as you are seeing it here 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.880
 13 thousand 250 euros I think it is not 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.720
 not bad, so let's give it a 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.869
 glance 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.300
 the trunk has 290 liters what is 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.060
 very well and places you at the same level as 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.680
 a party ford or a skoda fabia the floor 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.480
 It can be placed in two heights 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.050
 different and there are different elements 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.850
 Useful as hoops elastic tapes and 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.309
 Rubber strips to hold the load 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.379
 lacks spare wheel and the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.949
 backing the rear seats is 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.949
 folding 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.770
 the aveo is very broad for the small 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.670
 which is outside measures 40 4 meters of 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.670
 long and fix 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.230
 because here 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.239
 two adults can be accommodated 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.150
 very well there is room for 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.430
 legs and lots of head room and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.200
 in front of more of the same lot of space 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.990
 In addition, the driver can regulate 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.090
 height your seat not so lumbar support 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.520
 of the backrest the address column 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.070
 It is adjusted in height and in 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.810
 depth and there is also a small 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.950
 armrest that most of the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.700
 annoying time but how can you 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.440
 check out is not a problem either is africa 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.020
 what it is seen as very modern all 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.180
 well arranged well placed very clearly 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.950
 what is most striking is the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.420
 instrumentation that reminds of some 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.039
 mode that motorcycles use 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.630
 but in any case it's fine because 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.899
 the numbers are very large and it's 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.850
 Easy reading very important hollows 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.429
 many holes on all sides to 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.550
 leave the glasses the wallet the bottle of 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.770
 water the keys very well very well in 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.750
 this aspect in terms of materials 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.850
 they are all hard plastics but good 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.700
 they are treated in such a way that they are 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.440
 pleasant to the touch and the adjustments are what 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.550
 what to expect from a car this 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.550
 category and we deserved 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.540
 I see it is a comfortable car partly 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.150
 for the seats but mainly for 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.340
 the suspension is true that this is something 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.890
 soft yes but fits perfectly with 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.110
 the spirit of the vehicle 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.150
 and maybe the most negative thing is that the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.670
 rear suspension does not take all 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.220
 good with short and high potholes 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.500
 intensity like typical parents 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.600
 black and yellow and it turns out a little 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.600
 rough and rough reaction 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.830
 the engine that animates this model is 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.410
 diesel has 13 liters 95 horsepower and 210 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.080
 newton-meter the truth is that it has 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.360
 correct operation and the power is 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.550
 more than enough to move the 1,300 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.470
 kilograms that weigh and the 4 or 5 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.990
 passengers who want to travel in it 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.360
 the accelerations are not bright and 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.830
 if we are loaded overtaking 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.710
 They will take their time but we can not 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.930
 blame a lack of power are 95 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.110
 horses and react as expected 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.110
 they 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.770
 the only models that have an engine 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.590
 Diesel clearly smoother and quieter 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.620
 they are renault clio 1.5 dci and the 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.390
 volkswagen pole 1.6 tdi but if we talk 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.340
 of the general quality of driving the 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.650
 aveo is practically the same 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.350
 height than the aforementioned clio or that a seat 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.170
 ibiza and then there is the aesthetic section 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.150
 which is something personal but from the 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.220
 objective point of view the aveo is a 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.650
 very good car is a very good 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.650
 utilitarian and totally recommendable 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.850
 yes
