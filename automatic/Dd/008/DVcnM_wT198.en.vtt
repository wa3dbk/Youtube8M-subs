00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
your focus very quickly the priority

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.859 
your focus very quickly the priority
there<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:55.070> speed<00:01:55.430> of<00:01:55.640> focus<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.000> your<00:01:56.330> subject

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
there is speed of focus to your subject

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.600 
there is speed of focus to your subject
but<00:01:57.410> when<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.590> guys<00:01:57.740> are<00:01:57.860> doing<00:01:58.009> video<00:01:58.340> it's

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
but when you guys are doing video it's

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.490 
but when you guys are doing video it's
really<00:01:58.850> nice<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.360> have<00:01:59.509> what<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.289> Zeiss

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
really nice to have what the Zeiss

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.170 
really nice to have what the Zeiss
lenses<00:02:00.890> have<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.220> that's<00:02:01.280> this<00:02:01.520> beautiful

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
lenses have and that's this beautiful

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.109 
lenses have and that's this beautiful
slow<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.869> long<00:02:03.229> focusing<00:02:04.100> throw<00:02:04.399> what<00:02:04.970> this

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
slow and long focusing throw what this

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.820 
slow and long focusing throw what this
means<00:02:05.330> you<00:02:05.539> can<00:02:05.690> do<00:02:05.810> very<00:02:06.110> very<00:02:06.380> nice<00:02:06.530> accurate

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
means you can do very very nice accurate

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.469 
means you can do very very nice accurate
focusing<00:02:07.520> pulls<00:02:07.789> and<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.090> can<00:02:08.239> do<00:02:08.330> things

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
focusing pulls and you can do things

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.270 
focusing pulls and you can do things
very<00:02:08.750> smoothly<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.350> very<00:02:09.380> slowly<00:02:09.800> so<00:02:10.130> that's

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
very smoothly and very slowly so that's

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.250 
very smoothly and very slowly so that's
a<00:02:10.369> nice<00:02:10.519> advantage<00:02:10.880> gives<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.810> key<00:02:12.019> feature

about<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.890> focusing<00:02:22.340> here<00:02:22.489> you'll<00:02:22.880> notice

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
about the focusing here you'll notice

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.670 
about the focusing here you'll notice
you<00:02:23.239> got<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.420> lot<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.660> numbers<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.260> but<00:02:24.410> all

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
you got a lot of numbers you but all

your distance is listed here so you can

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.210 
your distance is listed here so you can
really<00:02:26.720> find<00:02:27.019> your<00:02:27.230> marks<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.560> be<00:02:27.709> very<00:02:27.980> very

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
really find your marks and be very very

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.820 
really find your marks and be very very
accurate<00:02:28.459> it's<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.450> long<00:02:29.720> long<00:02:30.049> throw<00:02:30.440> very

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
accurate it's a long long throw very

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.370 
accurate it's a long long throw very
very<00:02:31.070> smooth<00:02:31.370> it's<00:02:31.760> got<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:31.940> bit<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.209> resistance

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
very smooth it's got a bit of resistance

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.350 
very smooth it's got a bit of resistance
to<00:02:33.380> dampen<00:02:33.799> your<00:02:33.920> focusing<00:02:34.400> here<00:02:34.579> and<00:02:34.850> the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
to dampen your focusing here and the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.000 
to dampen your focusing here and the
focusing<00:02:35.750> ring<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:35.959> nice<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.410> turn<00:02:36.680> but<00:02:36.890> it

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
focusing ring is nice to turn but it

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.460 
focusing ring is nice to turn but it
also<00:02:37.190> has<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.579> tooth<00:02:37.910> drag<00:02:38.390> well<00:02:38.630> this

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
also has this tooth drag well this

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.289 
also has this tooth drag well this
really<00:02:39.680> matches<00:02:40.250> all<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.430> focus<00:02:40.790> pullers

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
really matches all the focus pullers

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.370 
really matches all the focus pullers
that<00:02:41.420> you'll<00:02:41.540> find<00:02:41.720> out<00:02:41.840> on<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.019> new<00:02:42.140> rigs

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
that you'll find out on the new rigs

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.229 
that you'll find out on the new rigs
like<00:02:42.560> thus<00:02:42.829> innovators<00:02:43.370> Acuto<00:02:43.790> rigs<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.120> we

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
like thus innovators Acuto rigs that we

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.150 
like thus innovators Acuto rigs that we
carry<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.079> that<00:02:45.230> also<00:02:45.440> makes<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.829> really<00:02:45.890> nice

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
carry so that also makes it really nice

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.430 
carry so that also makes it really nice
for<00:02:46.190> videographer<00:02:46.970> well<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.049> other<00:02:48.230> things

for videographer well the other things

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.750 
for videographer well the other things
that<00:02:48.560> will<00:02:48.650> happen<00:02:48.799> when<00:02:49.070> you<00:02:49.130> manually<00:02:49.370> focus

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
that will happen when you manually focus

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.130 
that will happen when you manually focus
a<00:02:49.850> lens<00:02:50.060> like<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.269> is<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:50.660> get<00:02:50.810> lens

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
a lens like this is you get lens

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.110 
a lens like this is you get lens
breathing<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.799> what<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:52.040> is<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:52.430> as<00:02:52.579> you

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
breathing and what that is is as you

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.850 
breathing and what that is is as you
focus<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:53.510> lens<00:02:53.540> you'll<00:02:53.870> find<00:02:54.110> that<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.590> view

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
focus the lens you'll find that the view

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.560 
focus the lens you'll find that the view
kind<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.220> zooms<00:02:55.489> in<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.760> bit<00:02:55.910> your<00:02:56.060> frame<00:02:56.329> goes<00:02:56.540> a

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
kind of zooms in a bit your frame goes a

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.060 
kind of zooms in a bit your frame goes a
little<00:02:56.900> bit<00:02:57.019> more<00:02:57.170> telephoto<00:02:57.680> or<00:02:57.829> a<00:02:57.890> little

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
little bit more telephoto or a little

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.940 
little bit more telephoto or a little
bit<00:02:58.190> wider<00:02:58.400> as<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.780> focus<00:02:59.810> well<00:03:00.290> these<00:03:00.560> sepia

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
bit wider as you focus well these sepia

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.560

breathing<00:03:02.930> altogether<00:03:03.079> so<00:03:03.590> your<00:03:03.709> frame

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
breathing altogether so your frame

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.130 
breathing altogether so your frame
doesn't<00:03:04.160> change<00:03:04.489> everything<00:03:05.299> stays<00:03:05.540> exactly

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
doesn't change everything stays exactly

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.780 
doesn't change everything stays exactly
