00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.440
 hello to all friends different engines the 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.809
 Today's video I will show you how 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.520
 remove a thermal unit from an engine 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.740
 px in case we want or revise it o 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:31.670
 are replaced then see and remove 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:33.410
 also the mufflers will go first 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.680
 to make a nice clean of all those 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.350
 elements that can be annoying then 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.799
 this area bellows 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.360
 the filter carburetor box 

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:46.519
 we are going to remove the plastic cap 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.680
 the fan cover etc. 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.680
 then we start by removing the lid 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.500
 we take our two screws 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:17.080
 we also remove this covered fan 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.830
 let's move these cases 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.929
 let's go back to the candle vault and now 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.330
 let's loosen this bolt e 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.330
 we remove this plastic cover 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.679
 so here we are in front of our group 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.619
 thermal formed by the cylinder and the 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.020
 head now we 're going to loosen up 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:11.390
 these four from of with a key of 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.970
 11 and we will remove the head even when 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.239
 let's loose the dice we try to 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:23.840
 loosen them in crossover ways then 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:31.100
 first one then from the other side and from 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:33.530
 new on the other side this way one 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.280
 Slowly we proceed to wake them up 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.280
 completely 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:56.840
 we keep all our washers and here 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:59.000
 removed his head naturally from di e 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.150
 washers in case they were damaged and 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.569
 let's go replace this 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.000
 point as you can see if I challenge the 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.689
 cylinder does not come out because it's up to 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.500
 then the solutions are can 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:19.220
 disassemble even more and then drop the 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.889
 engine by removing the shock absorber 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.290
 the engine back or the other 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:27.980
 solution to remove the four 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.970
 prisoners to remove the four 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.250
 prisoners 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.689
 there is a very simple solution 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.719
 we take two dice the same as 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:39.579
 we have that fixed the head neither 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.579
 we put in first use or live 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:51.379
 immediately after the other once approached 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.720
 two dice this way we go to 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.930
 tighten against each other with two 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.870
 always the 11 keys and we go to 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:05.180
 tighten now we just have to 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.250
 use the nut we have in the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.280
 bottom 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:19.000
 see that we are going to loosen the 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:19.000
 prisoner and we start to unscrew 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.360
 naturally once loosened 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:41.200
 we can speed up the operation with a 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:46.900
 ratchet you see is so we remove the 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.490
 prisoner we remove our data e 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:58.030
 we do the same operation with 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:59.590
 others important thing 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.690
 if you want then when we go 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.940
 refit to the same extent 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.610
 let's take a caliber 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.900
 let's measure how much they owe 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.940
 stay out 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.940
 you will see we make a measure 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.130
 at this point, once we have taken ours away 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:53.630
 four prisoners we have to send the 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:06:11.060
 piston and down everything and we raise the 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:15.040
 cylinder we remove this siger that there 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.040
 it will then allow the plug to be removed 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:46.340
 we remove even if on this side I have 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.590
 preferred to remove the seals from all e 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:52.310
 two parts because I will use one 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.860
 self-made tool like this where 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.260
 will inhabit a threaded cylinder that has 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:03.760
 the same width as the plug 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:06.169
 see then I go insert screw 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.669
 this tool you have already got to 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:09.669
 see it in another video 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:17.260
 now I'm going to tighten and the pin, etc. 

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:38.340
 we continue to live here therefore removed 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:40.290
 even our piston is a very thing 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.420
 important 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.790
 I will have to open this engine then 

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.850
 there are no problems but in the case 

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.530
 you should change one cylinder first 

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.890
 what you have to do clean well 

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:55.680
 externally and then go to protect 

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:58.400
 to prevent dirt from falling inside 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.400
 of the crankcase 

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.150
 so we have come to the end also of 

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.130
 continue this video to register them 

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.260
 many the channel to stay always 

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.240
 updated with new videos 

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:12.120
 if you have any questions do not hesitate to 

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.440
 contact me I can only greet you e 

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.440
 see you in an upcoming video
