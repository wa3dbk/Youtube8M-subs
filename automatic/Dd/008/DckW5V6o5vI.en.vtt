but sources of very good sources tell me
that<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.349> very<00:00:28.920> good<00:00:29.099> Joop<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.939> naked

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090

that it's a very good Joop for the naked
2<00:00:31.250> personally<00:00:32.250> I've<00:00:32.460> only<00:00:32.759> had<00:00:33.469> two<00:00:34.469> issues

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
2 personally I've only had two issues

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.920 
2 personally I've only had two issues
with<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.460> palette<00:00:35.850> if<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.360> open<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.750> up

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
with this palette if I just open it up

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.330 
with this palette if I just open it up
and<00:00:39.379> firstly<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.500> white<00:00:40.770> packaging

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
and firstly is the white packaging

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.000 
and firstly is the white packaging
personally<00:00:42.270> these<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.260> white<00:00:43.440> packaging<00:00:43.890> is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
personally these the white packaging is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.340 
personally these the white packaging is
not<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.340> my<00:00:44.430> taste<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.789> prefer<00:00:45.180> black<00:00:45.719> packaging

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
not to my taste I prefer black packaging

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.650 
not to my taste I prefer black packaging
but<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.710> guess<00:00:46.890> that's<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.660> personal

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
but I guess that's just personal

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.330 
but I guess that's just personal
preference<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.289> some<00:00:49.829> people<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.160> said

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
preference and some people have said

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.740 
preference and some people have said
that<00:00:50.370> they<00:00:50.579> prefer<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.090> white<00:00:51.210> packaging

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
that they prefer the white packaging

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.350 
that they prefer the white packaging
over<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> original<00:00:53.280> black<00:00:53.520> packaging<00:00:54.030> so

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
over the original black packaging so

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.599 
over the original black packaging so
whatever<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:57.420> secondly<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.410> two<00:00:59.309> shades

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
whatever and and secondly is two shades

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.189 
whatever and and secondly is two shades
actually<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> palette<00:01:00.629> which<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.020> payoff

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
actually in the palette which the payoff

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.130 
actually in the palette which the payoff
of<00:01:01.620> them<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.370> all<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.730> good<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.809> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
showing up very well but probably

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.630

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
makes it incredibly cheap for a pallet

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.430 
makes it incredibly cheap for a pallet
of<00:03:03.480> this<00:03:03.720> size<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.280> pigmentation

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.290 
of this size and of this pigmentation
again<00:03:07.440> most<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.400> shades<00:03:08.640> are<00:03:08.850> really

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
again most of the shades are really

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.410 
again most of the shades are really
opaque<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.900> really<00:03:10.380> really<00:03:10.590> creamy<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.970> is

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
opaque and really really creamy so it is

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.199 
opaque and really really creamy so it is
overall<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:13.110> really<00:03:13.470> good<00:03:13.590> palette<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:15.150> I'm
