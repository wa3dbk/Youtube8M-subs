00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.510
 We recently talked about David Barton who is this American 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.129
 Evangelical Christian Zeir and conservative activist the last time we are 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:08.730
 He talked about it a few weeks ago 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.179
 We played a section of it saying that theocracy 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.580
 Does not exist if there is an election in other words if you have 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.150
 Any country where there is an election no matter what 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.130
 Fraudulent or stage that is they are not the theocratic of course it seems to be 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.859
 Forget places like Iran and Saudi Arabia 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.410
 And the tag in the end anyway is now returned in this video from 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.800
 A little class that he did where he explained how 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.899
 The Bible is actually part of the Constitution 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.719
 Through Amendment 7 says the Seventh Amendment 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.110
 In cases in public law where the disputed value exceeds twenty 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.850
 Dollars 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.199
 The right to trial should be preserved before a jury and not a fact tried by a jury 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.300
 Shelby reconsidered otherwise in any court 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.760
 The United States then according to the rules of public law above that and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.870
 He argues that 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.710
 This general law includes biblical law 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.909
 Her total dementia here is a little clip with him explaining 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.740
 Which involves but has never heard about 7 percent eliminated militants 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.530
 Seventy percent said abolishing the house laws of nature 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.920
 You can not refer to any spaces and ensure no acid with the same time 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.630
 Abortion 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.990
 From here we believe in the creation of evolution and there are no species there 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.520
 Built-in John Steelwell 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.759
 Palace or handover every process created 21 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.409
 The same thing with homosexuality plus I cable after two or three kinds of 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.180
 Ten million how easily 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.009
 There is always a deviation there is nothing that matches as a major guest blog 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.100
 This is what Native American homosexuality law calls a crime against nature 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.200
 Where you are in all this here are the laws of nature 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.530
 Yeah that's where you get the laws I got Rangers this summer I'm 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.670
 You do not get as let me know but let me tell you right up front 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.759
 You do not postpone it let me tell you not to kill 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.780
 Let me tell you not to steal the see laws of nature and Los Angeles got those 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.390
 I got the prices mentioned together 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.649
 And God is a loton of nature. This is what this is 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.080
 Rebound bond books have now become rarely Emma Constitution 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.580
 If he has the following difficulty that I do not blame you and the man who claims 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.770
 To learn a lot about nature 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.590
 He seems to be completely ignoring the fact that 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.790
 Humans only worship Goddesses that only humans 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.090
 Homosexuality is none of those natural 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.069
 If it's unique to humans the counter appears to range to summarize its argument about 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.810
 . 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.230
 Do not support the concept of anti-teen why you torture your own 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.030
 Children. 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.800
 In eternal olive with about natural that I do not think 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.860
 That typeof argument refers to the release method of a man like David Barton 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.319
 Yes now in the pope until recently he said that the way is basically literary 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.760
 Device-tool-tool 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.780
 I am but you know 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.110
 Here I have people who are just taking things very literally 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.129
 The people in the room go back to who was Hannah 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.459
 The fool always seems like a genius 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.909
 To a group of idiots this is exactly what happens here VII 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:09.500
 Modify 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.140
 Insurance companies have the right to be tried by a jury in some civil cases 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.280
 And it prevents the courts from turning the jury into a reach 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.569
 Again he does not say that the Bible 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.670
 Is part of the Constitution fits there 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.840
 This guy fills the room with people and they think Obama is an incredible kind 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.799
 Genius in 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.680
 The thinker does not make any sense
