00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.920
 now people are twisted 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:16.949
 Bahia arrived a moment that everyone 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.960

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:29.029
 tension and nervousness 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.720
 the day we barrel we are not in the arena 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:37.129

 One classic 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.590
 The classic ba-vi for me is an act of 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.660
 soccer fan 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.320
 after ten years since the Babi 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.330
 series to 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.240
 is the girl in the world at bay all but 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.630
 after all what makes something a classic 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.479
 classic is when something gets to the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.340
 eternal eternity are the works of 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.360
 leonardo da vinci michelangelo na 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.330

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.590
 all unforgettable classics 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.000
 football narrators often take 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.920
 borrowed from the world of the arts 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.160
 expression that everyone knows 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.800
 the show will start 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.260
 in classic day this is almost always 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.900
 true after all when 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.509
 artists are on the stage is a sign that 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.509
 something great is going to happen 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.950
 we have the symphony orchestra of the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.430
 Bahia to perform an unpublished work 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.069
 occupies for the first time the hymns of 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.209
 greater Bahian classic will be heard in a 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:32.830
 concert hall on the famous stage 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.830
 main of castro alves theater 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.080
 musicians experienced some of others 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.739
 countries but not less nervous 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.180
 even because it's classic day it's always 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.860
 different 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.569
 to my emotional and training in football 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.470
 a small fault sometimes the companion 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.230
 can save 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.080
 here if you fail you get more 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.810
 difficult so orchestra is like a 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.040
 team has to be training because 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.680
 otherwise in the hour 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.620
 failure for the team to run a 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.709
 demanding trainer a team well 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.549
 talented but that does not stop 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.820
 side to emotion tattoo bahia a song 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:24.500
 are two passions so they do not leave 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:27.250
 no way of the heart to play the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.250
 bay as I was 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:35.270
 will have some note in the nada you have 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.400
 after all as much as possible but know that 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.220
 functionalism does not leave much 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.220
 nobody has tuned out how it has been 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:49.150
 so in the audience of the last classics 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.150
 now tricolor chords the bahia anthem 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.780
 Hmm 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.200
 1 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.730
 O
