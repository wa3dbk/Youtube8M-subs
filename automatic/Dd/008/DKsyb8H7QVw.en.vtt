00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:08.210
 this is a project that was born from the 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.590
 head of don alex boter and he like 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.900
 retribution to everything that has 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.200
 delivered to the day wants to leave the 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.590
 public transport via river as a 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.820
 legacy for up to date so 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.430
 they built the boats that today 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.669
 day they are founding the waters of the rivers 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.619
 of a day more this floating neighborhood who 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.570
 was born from the idea that if we are going to have 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.759
 the boats where we were going to have 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.610
 our office and the most logical was in 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.100
 the river with which it was designed and 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.210
 built this floating neighborhood the 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.040
 architecture design engineering 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.590
 construction were made whole bed 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.530
 a day to see this is the only neighborhood 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.550
 floating in the world today 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.680
 self-sustaining everything that we 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.380
 we do within this neighborhood that are 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.270
 300 square meters we do it with the 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.040
 energy that we get from the 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.390
 solar energy 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.640
 we have 32 panels 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.059
 photovoltaic roofs that today 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.520
 generate around 35-40 kilowatt 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.060
 daily in us here we purify water 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.880
 of the river 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.369
 every day we take the river water 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.079
 in a first stage we took the salt to 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.240
 this water because this is a saline roll 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.890
 and in a second stage we treat it with 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.360
 ultraviolet in certain sectors 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.180
 that we occupy our boats 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.670
 we are much more efficient than the car 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.380
 the micro idea for example if you are 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.330
 I was staying at the hotel villa del rÃ­o 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.580
 produced with a form you delay 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.530
 20-25 minutes to get to the center with 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.500
 we delay you 12 do not take the 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.110
 tacos do not delay you have no risk of 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.600
 shock does not pay parking what 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.970
 we have when parking and you occupy I think 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.850
 that those who practically occupy us in 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.979
 certain stages of the year 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.820
 and it's here it's free it's 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.450
 used the niche state then 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.719
 we want 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.939
 that this project grows and is a real 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.299
 contribution and we know that it will be a real 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.939
 contribution to the day is growing a lot and if 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.950
 we can grow in the water 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.410
 occupying a space that does not take care anymore 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.860
 we do not pollute anymore we produce our 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.500
 own energy more we purify water from 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.500
 river that we are totally a contribution
