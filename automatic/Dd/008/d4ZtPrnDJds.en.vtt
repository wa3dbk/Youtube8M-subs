00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 and 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.990
 Hello friends, today we are going to do 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.599
 a nougat of cream with nuts is very 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.550
 easy and now that it comes at Christmas I 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.710
 you can do at home and you'll see that 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.460
 it will come out very good for this we are going to 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.180
 need 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.680
 ground almond see powder 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.680
 cream for riding 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.629
 walnuts 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.699
 milk powder and sugar and then we 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.020
 we will reserve a few nuts for 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.110
 decor 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.850
 we have put a saucepan where we will put 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.680
 the liquid cream 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:06.320
 milk powder 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:09.470
 and the sugar will stir well never 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.520
 we will stop stirring until we are left 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.470
 a mass a little homogenous and 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.110
 we separate from the fire we have cut 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.540
 previously some nuts so tiny 6 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:27.170
 and we add them to our mass 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.990
 we are other laps and finally you 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.750
 we always put the almond out of the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.370
 fire and stir well until we 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.360
 make a good kneading 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.360
 if you see 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.430
 never stop stirring 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.500
 once we have cooled down a bit 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.890
 we have passed over the work table and 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.479
 we are going to give it a cylindrical shape 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.479
 more or less that's how it is 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.890
 for mold I do not serve the boxes of 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.020
 those nougat but if you do not have 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.750
 you can use any mold that 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.270
 you have at home but since I am asia I have left 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.200
 I have already solved the measure in the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.220
 cut some pieces of paper because more or less 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.220
 so to the extent 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.720
 of our nougat 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.700
 what we can also here 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.959
 this is a vegetable paper of uses of 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.079
 to bake 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.769
 if there were perfectly and now 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.769
 we will introduce 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.790
 and the house itself serves as a mold and 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.790
 we will tighten well 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.860
 until you reach the corners 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.760
 came to use is the best 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.520
 once we have it so flattened 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.080
 to decorate we will put 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.990
 4 nuts 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.840
 over squeezing the session we do not know 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.840
 fall tight 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.209
 and now we will let it cool 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.209
 once it has cooled down 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.220
 and we will catch him 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.790
 and so we will leave it 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.269
 until the other environment 24 hours 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.930
 well, it's been 24 hours and we already have 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:01.690
 made our cream nougat with nuts 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.270
 let's see how it has been 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.270
 for this we are going to unmold 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.980
 fantastic 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.940
 is that madrid 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.940
 the gift we will pass 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.729
 for your presentation 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:35.720
 this nougat can hold you 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.730
 eight or ten days 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.370
 the preferred ones you leave wrapped with the 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.580
 same paper that we make every hour and 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.940
 also with a paper film well friends 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:52.270
 but I wish as always that you are doing 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.270
 or leave as good as this one
