intelligence test and this test if many
of<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.349> educators<00:00:28.830> know<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> way<00:00:29.670> to

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
measure the multiple intelligences or

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.569 
measure the multiple intelligences or
the<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.570> primary<00:00:33.840> learning<00:00:34.500> modality<00:00:35.280> for

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the the primary learning modality for

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.000 
the the primary learning modality for
each<00:00:35.700> child<00:00:36.000> how<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.750> child<00:00:37.260> processes

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
each child how the child processes

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.090 
each child how the child processes
information<00:00:38.420> best<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.780> when<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.800> comes<00:00:40.890> time

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
information best and when it comes time

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.889 
information best and when it comes time
for<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> poetry<00:00:41.670> unit<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.480> students

where they're going to present their
portfolio<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.670> work<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.270> they'll<00:00:54.420> go<00:00:54.570> back<00:00:54.780> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
portfolio of work so they'll go back to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.319 
portfolio of work so they'll go back to
the<00:00:55.110> multiple<00:00:55.410> intelligences<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.520> actually

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the multiple intelligences and actually

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.630 
the multiple intelligences and actually
look<00:00:57.570> at<00:00:57.750> their<00:00:58.079> primary<00:00:58.770> learning<00:00:59.100> modality

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
look at their primary learning modality

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.479 
look at their primary learning modality
and<00:00:59.879> align<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.719> their<00:01:01.320> poetry<00:01:01.829> for

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and align it with their poetry for

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.539 
and align it with their poetry for
example<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.619> you<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.890> somebody<00:01:05.369> who<00:01:05.519> is

information which empowers them makes

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.680 
information which empowers them makes
them<00:02:40.890> feel<00:02:41.100> confident<00:02:41.670> when<00:02:41.820> they<00:02:42.030> know<00:02:42.390> how

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
much more confident in fact some of them

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.540 
much more confident in fact some of them
are<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.530> didn't<00:02:46.830> know<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.070> that's<00:02:47.370> so

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
are like I didn't know that that's so

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.699 
are like I didn't know that that's so
cool<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.720> great<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.050> see<00:02:49.230> how<00:02:49.530> their

for<00:02:54.930> multiple<00:02:55.350> intelligences<00:02:56.100> involve<00:02:56.730> what

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
for multiple intelligences involve what

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.820 
for multiple intelligences involve what
we<00:02:57.300> call<00:02:57.510> learning<00:02:57.959> centers<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.800> a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
we call learning centers and this is a

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.440 
we call learning centers and this is a
great<00:02:59.130> game<00:02:59.520> day<00:02:59.760> let's<00:03:00.030> say<00:03:00.150> you've<00:03:00.270> got<00:03:00.300> a

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
Friday and you just want to help your

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.630 
Friday and you just want to help your
students<00:03:04.160> understand<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.220> material<00:03:05.610> better

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
students understand the material better

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.790 
students understand the material better
or<00:03:06.030> review<00:03:06.450> material<00:03:06.959> or<00:03:07.170> get<00:03:07.350> ready<00:03:07.530> for<00:03:07.739> a

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
or review material or get ready for a

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.740 
or review material or get ready for a
test<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.700> can<00:03:08.730> actually<00:03:09.150> set<00:03:09.360> up<00:03:09.390> learning

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
test you can actually set up learning

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.320 
test you can actually set up learning
centers<00:03:10.230> throughout<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:11.040> classroom<00:03:11.550> one

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
centers throughout the classroom one

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.270 
centers throughout the classroom one
center<00:03:12.660> can<00:03:12.810> have<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.959> vocabulary<00:03:13.440> memory<00:03:14.010> game

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
center can have a vocabulary memory game

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.460 
center can have a vocabulary memory game
so<00:03:14.880> again<00:03:15.150> just<00:03:15.180> like<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.840> memory<00:03:16.170> game<00:03:16.350> we

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
so again just like the memory game we

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.160 
so again just like the memory game we
played<00:03:16.680> as<00:03:16.800> kids<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:17.459> can<00:03:17.790> do<00:03:17.880> vocab<00:03:18.330> words<00:03:18.959> on

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
played as kids you can do vocab words on

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.729 
played as kids you can do vocab words on
one<00:03:19.380> side<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:20.040> then<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.000> meaning<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:22.320> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
one side and then the meaning of the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.680 
one side and then the meaning of the
word<00:03:22.950> actually<00:03:23.549> on<00:03:23.610> another<00:03:23.670> card<00:03:24.510> all

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
word actually on another card all

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.940 
word actually on another card all
together<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.230> they<00:03:25.350> can<00:03:25.530> be<00:03:25.620> different

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
together and they can be different

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.740 
together and they can be different
colors<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:26.700> can<00:03:26.850> do<00:03:27.000> memory<00:03:27.330> in<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.450> way

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
colors and you can do memory in that way

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.810 
colors and you can do memory in that way
you<00:03:28.470> can<00:03:28.620> do<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.860> riddle<00:03:29.130> challenge<00:03:29.640> which<00:03:29.790> is

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
you can do the riddle challenge which is

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.970 
you can do the riddle challenge which is
really<00:03:30.239> fun<00:03:30.510> each<00:03:30.900> Center<00:03:31.380> or<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.590> Center<00:03:31.950> for

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
really fun each Center or the Center for

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.860 
really fun each Center or the Center for
a<00:03:32.160> real<00:03:32.310> challenge<00:03:32.519> you'd<00:03:32.850> walk<00:03:33.060> up<00:03:33.299> try<00:03:33.810> to

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
a real challenge you'd walk up try to

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.300 
a real challenge you'd walk up try to
figure<00:03:34.110> out<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.470> riddle<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:34.950> then<00:03:35.040> maybe
