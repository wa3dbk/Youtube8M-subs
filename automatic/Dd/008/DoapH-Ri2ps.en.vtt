 give a mind the link in the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.110
 video description 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.900
 then we appear on the page and we 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.820

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.810
 the voices that are heard in the game 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.000
 after a few minutes you may be interested 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.350
 they can be entered into the server and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.350
 the files continue to download if 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.620
 while playing to put together a sign 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.080

 I'm going to do for mac to do to 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.480
 windows 7 windows windows all the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.750
 windows versions 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.760
 then here he tells us that we can 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.280
 download with Latin American music or 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.300
 with Spanish voices, how am I from

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.410
 with Spanish or Latin American voices 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.080
 but good I have is to download it 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.670
 it appears that 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.890
 is that the launcher is the installer 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.080
 then let's say it develops from 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.630
 administrator or as a user 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.360
 will appear the panel of the unter that says 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.819
 me with my version 4.3.4 space 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.349
 needed on the disk 28 gigabyte here 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.270
 as default it does not appear 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.300
 we will start on the local disk chip but 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.670
 we can install it where 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.850
 we want it can be in documents 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.690
 music images to the desktop if 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.930
 want or web downloads 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.190
 I do not it will be because I do not 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.310
 according to the terms of conditions 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.110
 let's say yes and then install 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.050
 I do not install it because I already have it 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.100
 Then I will cancel 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.110
 after he was shown a 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.880
 loading bar ends the time of 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.910
 loading is going to look like a 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.420
 small window 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.950
 in the upper left that says 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.290
 cubero walker is processing all the 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.610
 files that will leave you still not 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.440
 they have to move nothing from there because 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.500
 maybe you might have a fault 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.100
 in the installation the download and that 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.260
 then the game does not go well 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.040
 after it's finished loading that 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.709
 bar will appear 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.069
 today the window of the 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.409
 game that is going to look like it does not respond 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.300
 there were many people in the chapter to 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:28.030
 good chapter 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.530
 there are many people in the video in the 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.630
 first video that says it was like 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.850
 instruct Uruguay back in 5 minutes 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.560
 but then version 4.0 points 6 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.209
 good 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.280
 It turns out that there were many people who 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.490
 I asked 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.050
 that because it appears to me because it appeared 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.590
 that does not answer that it was left for 20 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.780
 minutes and that because it would appear 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.940
 the barrack appears in that if they touched it 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.940
 that was closing him good 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.970
 if you touch the box here they will close 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.830
 also and they touch the window that says 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.780
 that does not respond is going to close 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.630
 which is better than 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.569
 wait I think that that will not last 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.060
 more than 20 minutes already I think that 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.040
 obviously also the connection to 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.730
 internet and computer performance 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.730
 good 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.820
 I think that everything is explained 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.920
