 they also jerry and we were 12 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.030

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.520
 let's add the shrimp you 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.490
 lady go to supermarket wal about 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.770
 wheels or the fishmonger to find the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.710
 freshest shrimp you find and the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.410
 more economical a very important thing a 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.509
 detail they fly although you see a little 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.420
 strange and a half since the return so that 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.320
 do not notice anyone and having to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.780
 smell them they have to smell fresh they should not 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.330
 to smell strong nothing that they smell like 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.630
 ammonia nor do they smell very powerful to 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.970
 shellfish that are very dangerous other 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.880
 very important question when it comes to 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.610
 manipulate them when peeling 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.210

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.800
 little here at the time of starting the knows 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.230
 have a bowl with a little ice 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.330
 and on the ice put a bag of 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.210
 plastic so it's not going to burn and 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.130
 over the ice for some shrimp and 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.790
