00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.179
 private school in a mold insert 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.920
 to make all the children such a case 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.500
 premium all bad the gap between 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.720
 their life at home and then theirs to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.960
 the school is the smallest possible between 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960
 both 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.640
 wazir your way yama zuki respect when 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.390
 I entered a first school 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.210
 alternative 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.780
 I noticed the light in the eyes 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.970
 children 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.790
 dalphond the teachers are broke

 so on the move then we always drink 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:46.160
 sitting on a chair his wife it was 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.720
 as more was there with his 3rd year the 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.100
 youngest turns 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.449
 I am not convinced the older ones 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.920
 but groups that are forming and have 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.040
 a lot of group work so too 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.660
 have a lot to communicate with each other and 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.390
 I think it's wonderful that it breaks 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.770
 kind of lefaux at the site had resulted 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.420
 older and younger were 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.860
 hot plus family much more 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.399
 natural who take the reds 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.460
 calling aiming because we can have a 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:13.300
 model of before or doctor but have 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.300
 many children 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.840
 we are developing the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.850
 people this is my career of students in 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.100
 class then learn to master themselves 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.470
 in some situations it's 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.420
 to name emotions is to be in a state 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.369
 relationships with others and this gets 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.860
 to know oneself inside oneself 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.000
 to be able to insulter take the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.210
 good decisions in the eu 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.259
 he liked 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.869
 what is wonderful here in school 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:48.820
 it's about parental involvement and 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.960
 that makes students who are used to 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.020
 species in the environment of the shot 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:02.850
 more family-friendly it brings them to 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:05.500
 discover they are really me it's 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.110
 the task that aesthetics 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.750
 I would like to be a biologist on 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:17.470
