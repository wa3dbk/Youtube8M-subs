earlier and he just made a great play

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.410 
earlier and he just made a great play
know<00:01:16.310> it<00:01:17.310> stings<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.759> there<00:01:17.909> was<00:01:18.000> no<00:01:18.060> time<00:01:18.299> on

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
know it stings that there was no time on

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.640 
know it stings that there was no time on
the<00:01:18.479> clock<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:18.990> couldn't<00:01:19.259> come<00:01:19.409> down<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the clock that we couldn't come down to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.490 
the clock that we couldn't come down to
make<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> play<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.759> uh<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.270> guess<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
make a play but uh I guess that's a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.380 
make a play but uh I guess that's a
basketball<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.490> ball<00:01:23.670> didn't<00:01:24.030> bounce<00:01:24.060> our

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
basketball the ball didn't bounce our

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.359 
basketball the ball didn't bounce our
way<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.780> we're<00:01:25.409> gonna<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.799> regroup<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
way and we're gonna have to regroup and

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.670 
way and we're gonna have to regroup and
