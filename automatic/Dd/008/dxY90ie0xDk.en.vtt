00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
how come I'm not number one so Michelle

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.830

Obama<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.820> number<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.240> which<00:00:57.420> makes<00:00:57.600> sense

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
Obama is number one which makes sense

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.000 
Obama is number one which makes sense
because<00:00:57.990> she's<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> first<00:00:58.590> lady

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
Oprah is number three and I don't think

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.270 
Oprah is number three and I don't think
that's<00:01:01.320> fair<00:01:01.500> cuz<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.800> think<00:01:01.860> she<00:01:02.130> owns<00:01:02.340> Forbes

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
that's fair cuz I think she owns Forbes

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.010 
that's fair cuz I think she owns Forbes
so<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.790> pretty<00:01:06.120> cool<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.479> number<00:01:06.810> ten

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
so I it's pretty cool to be number ten

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.500
