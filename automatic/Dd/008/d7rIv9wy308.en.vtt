Saver<00:00:12.010> today<00:00:13.010> we're<00:00:13.160> gonna<00:00:13.250> talk<00:00:13.430> about<00:00:13.719> if

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
Saver today we're gonna talk about if

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.290 
Saver today we're gonna talk about if
high<00:00:15.109> efficiency<00:00:15.619> water<00:00:15.920> heating<00:00:16.369> and<00:00:16.520> water

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
high efficiency water heating and water

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.790 
high efficiency water heating and water
heating<00:00:17.449> is<00:00:17.839> important<00:00:18.320> because<00:00:18.439> it<00:00:18.679> can

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
heating is important because it can

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.189 
heating is important because it can
account<00:00:19.070> for<00:00:19.220> up<00:00:19.400> to<00:00:19.550> 15%<00:00:20.210> of<00:00:20.599> your<00:00:20.810> overall

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
account for up to 15% of your overall

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.589 
account for up to 15% of your overall
energy<00:00:21.560> bill<00:00:21.980> in<00:00:22.130> your<00:00:22.310> house<00:00:22.519> and<00:00:22.789> actually

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
energy bill in your house and actually

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.689 
energy bill in your house and actually
more<00:00:23.900> than<00:00:24.109> that<00:00:24.320> if<00:00:24.529> you<00:00:24.679> have<00:00:24.859> more<00:00:25.279> people

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
more than that if you have more people

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.720 
more than that if you have more people
in<00:00:25.999> a<00:00:26.359> smaller<00:00:26.630> house<00:00:27.189> so<00:00:28.189> here<00:00:28.429> we're<00:00:28.699> looking

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
in a smaller house so here we're looking

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.999 
in a smaller house so here we're looking
at<00:00:28.999> an<00:00:29.119> electric<00:00:29.480> water<00:00:29.630> heater<00:00:29.900> correct<00:00:30.589> yeah

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
at an electric water heater correct yeah

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.499 
at an electric water heater correct yeah
we<00:00:31.189> have<00:00:31.310> an<00:00:31.400> elect<00:00:31.609> sold<00:00:31.849> electric<00:00:32.329> water

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
we have an elect sold electric water

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.770 
we have an elect sold electric water
heater<00:00:32.810> that<00:00:33.500> they've<00:00:33.710> tried<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.750> make<00:00:35.750> a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
heater that they've tried to make a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.680 
heater that they've tried to make a
little<00:00:35.990> more<00:00:36.170> efficient<00:00:36.620> by<00:00:36.770> putting<00:00:37.070> in<00:00:37.220> some

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
little more efficient by putting in some

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.990 
little more efficient by putting in some
some<00:00:38.690> wrap<00:00:38.960> around<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:39.470> as<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:39.620> can<00:00:39.890> see<00:00:40.000> all

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
some wrap around it as you can see all

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.540 
some wrap around it as you can see all
right<00:00:41.150> so<00:00:41.510> if<00:00:41.960> I<00:00:42.200> feel<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.800> top<00:00:43.010> of<00:00:43.040> this<00:00:43.280> water

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
right so if I feel the top of this water

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.640 
right so if I feel the top of this water
heater<00:00:43.760> it's<00:00:44.240> hot<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:44.720> mean<00:00:44.960> right<00:00:45.200> here<00:00:45.410> it's

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
heater it's hot I mean right here it's

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.750 
heater it's hot I mean right here it's
pretty<00:00:45.980> hot<00:00:46.250> to<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.460> touch

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
pretty hot to the touch

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.150 
pretty hot to the touch
josephus<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:47.630> so<00:00:48.380> we<00:00:48.530> have<00:00:48.650> an<00:00:48.740> electric

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
josephus and so we have an electric

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.700 
josephus and so we have an electric
element<00:00:49.760> in<00:00:49.910> there<00:00:50.150> that's<00:00:50.660> just<00:00:50.990> consuming

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
element in there that's just consuming

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.250 
element in there that's just consuming
electricity<00:00:52.400> here<00:00:52.700> and<00:00:52.880> they<00:00:53.690> do<00:00:53.750> have<00:00:53.990> it<00:00:54.170> on

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
electricity here and they do have it on

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.650 
electricity here and they do have it on
a<00:00:54.290> timer<00:00:54.650> but<00:00:55.100> of<00:00:55.280> course<00:00:55.550> you<00:00:56.270> know<00:00:56.420> if<00:00:56.540> you

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
a timer but of course you know if you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.270 
a timer but of course you know if you
shut<00:00:56.840> it<00:00:56.930> off<00:00:57.050> for<00:00:57.260> six<00:00:57.410> hours<00:00:57.770> a<00:00:57.800> day<00:00:57.920> while

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
shut it off for six hours a day while

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.760 
shut it off for six hours a day while
you're<00:00:58.400> at<00:00:59.060> work<00:00:59.120> that<00:00:59.600> tanks<00:01:00.470> just<00:01:00.620> gonna

is<00:01:28.100> that<00:01:28.630> looks<00:01:29.630> like<00:01:29.780> what's<00:01:29.990> happening<00:01:30.409> is

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
is that looks like what's happening is

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.899 
is that looks like what's happening is
you're<00:01:30.740> getting<00:01:30.950> some<00:01:31.100> radiant<00:01:31.460> heat<00:01:31.609> coming

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
you're getting some radiant heat coming

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.370 
you're getting some radiant heat coming
back<00:01:32.060> up<00:01:32.270> from<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.600> tank<00:01:32.840> with<00:01:33.049> this<00:01:33.200> since

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
back up from the tank with this since

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.499 
back up from the tank with this since
these<00:01:33.530> pipes<00:01:33.770> aren't<00:01:34.039> insulated<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.909> you're

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
these pipes aren't insulated and you're

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:36.789 
these pipes aren't insulated and you're
correct<00:01:35.840> I<00:01:35.960> mean<00:01:35.990> that's<00:01:36.259> just<00:01:36.469> really<00:01:36.649> really

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
correct I mean that's just really really

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.739 
correct I mean that's just really really
warm<00:01:37.340> coming<00:01:37.639> back<00:01:37.819> through<00:01:37.999> their<00:01:38.210> thermal

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:38.749 
warm coming back through their thermal

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:40.989 
warm coming back through their thermal
siphoning<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.499> we've<00:01:39.649> got<00:01:39.889> you<00:01:40.159> know<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:40.789> we

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
siphoning and we've got you know so we

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.309 
siphoning and we've got you know so we
got<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.149> lot<00:01:41.329> of<00:01:41.389> heat<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.689> we<00:01:41.960> look<00:01:42.109> at<00:01:42.200> this

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
got a lot of heat and we look at this

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.020 
got a lot of heat and we look at this
with<00:01:42.469> a<00:01:42.530> thermal<00:01:42.920> imaging<00:01:43.219> camera<00:01:43.280> see<00:01:43.819> a<00:01:43.850> lot

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
with a thermal imaging camera see a lot

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.999 
with a thermal imaging camera see a lot
of<00:01:44.060> heat<00:01:44.329> coming<00:01:44.539> off<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.049> this<00:01:45.679> water

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
of heat coming off this this water

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.429 
of heat coming off this this water
heater<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:47.450> also<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.780> sides<00:01:48.170> of<00:01:48.380> the

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
heater and and also the sides of the

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.910 
heater and and also the sides of the
tank<00:01:48.679> now<00:01:49.600> now<00:01:50.600> here<00:01:51.350> we<00:01:51.469> are<00:01:51.499> in<00:01:51.619> Florida

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
tank now now here we are in Florida

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.859 
tank now now here we are in Florida
we're<00:01:52.369> in<00:01:52.490> a<00:01:52.549> cooling<00:01:52.819> climate<00:01:53.450> which<00:01:53.600> means

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
we're in a cooling climate which means

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.120 
we're in a cooling climate which means
most<00:01:54.109> of<00:01:54.319> the<00:01:54.380> year<00:01:54.560> we<00:01:54.679> have<00:01:54.829> our<00:01:54.979> air

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
most of the year we have our air

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.099 
most of the year we have our air
conditioning<00:01:55.549> running<00:01:55.880> that's<00:01:56.060> correct<00:01:56.420> so

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
conditioning running that's correct so

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.580 
conditioning running that's correct so
here<00:01:57.380> we're<00:01:57.560> adding<00:01:57.920> heating<00:01:58.609> load<00:01:58.880> now<00:01:59.630> we're

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
here we're adding heating load now we're

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.760 
here we're adding heating load now we're
inefficiently<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:02.479> very<00:02:03.229> expensively

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
inefficiently and very expensively

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.649 
inefficiently and very expensively
heating<00:02:04.130> our<00:02:04.219> water<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.759> then<00:02:05.119> allowing<00:02:05.389> that

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
heating our water and then allowing that

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.480 
heating our water and then allowing that
heat<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:06.109> escape<00:02:06.560> back<00:02:06.859> into<00:02:07.279> the<00:02:07.369> house

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
heat to escape back into the house

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.070 
heat to escape back into the house
environment<00:02:08.119> then<00:02:08.270> how<00:02:08.420> do<00:02:08.479> we<00:02:08.569> get<00:02:08.750> rid<00:02:08.780> of<00:02:08.929> it

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.990 
environment then how do we get rid of it
you<00:02:09.890> have<00:02:10.039> to<00:02:10.159> run<00:02:10.310> your<00:02:10.429> air<00:02:10.549> conditioner<00:02:10.849> or

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
you have to run your air conditioner or

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.300 
you have to run your air conditioner or
cool<00:02:11.239> it<00:02:11.269> back<00:02:11.480> down

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
cool it back down

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.710 
cool it back down
electricity<00:02:13.000> that's<00:02:13.270> right<00:02:13.420> that's<00:02:13.599> right

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
electricity that's right that's right

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.320

the<00:02:16.599> water<00:02:17.080> inefficiently<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.220> we've<00:02:18.550> get

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
the water inefficiently and we've get

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.790 
the water inefficiently and we've get
this<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.209> radiant<00:02:19.780> electricity<00:02:20.319> electric

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
this the radiant electricity electric

this the radiant electricity electric
heat<00:02:21.010> coming<00:02:21.340> off<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.489> that<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.120> then<00:02:22.480> we<00:02:22.720> have

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
heat coming off of that and then we have

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.930 
heat coming off of that and then we have
more<00:02:23.620> electricity<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:24.489> rid<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.910> just

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
more electricity to get rid of it just

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.460 
more electricity to get rid of it just
doesn't<00:02:25.420> make<00:02:25.510> any<00:02:25.690> sense<00:02:25.810> no<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.170> doesn't

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
doesn't make any sense no it doesn't

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.540 
doesn't make any sense no it doesn't
there's<00:02:26.620> got<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:26.890> be<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:27.010> more<00:02:27.160> efficient<00:02:27.520> way

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
there's got to be a more efficient way

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.479 
there's got to be a more efficient way
yeah<00:02:28.330> there<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:28.989> there<00:02:29.170> yes<00:02:29.410> yes<00:02:29.739> let's<00:02:30.370> go

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
yeah there is is there yes yes let's go

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.009 
yeah there is is there yes yes let's go
take<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.730> look<00:02:30.790> at<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.180> all<00:02:31.330> right<00:02:31.450> all<00:02:31.959> right

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
take a look at it all right all right

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.720 
take a look at it all right all right
Kelly<00:02:32.410> here<00:02:32.620> we<00:02:32.709> are<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.099> we're<00:02:33.280> looking<00:02:33.550> at

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
Kelly here we are and we're looking at

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.120 
Kelly here we are and we're looking at
the<00:02:34.090> efficient<00:02:34.810> alternative<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.709> big<00:02:35.950> ol

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
the efficient alternative to that big ol

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.860 
the efficient alternative to that big ol
electric<00:02:36.610> tank<00:02:36.880> style<00:02:37.090> water<00:02:37.360> heater<00:02:37.630> what's

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
electric tank style water heater what's

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.660 
electric tank style water heater what's
this<00:02:38.080> that's<00:02:38.500> correct<00:02:38.739> what<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.400> here

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
this that's correct what this is here

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.210 
this that's correct what this is here
this<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.090> gas<00:02:40.810> tankless<00:02:41.470> hot<00:02:41.739> water<00:02:41.800> heater

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
this is a gas tankless hot water heater

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.960 
this is a gas tankless hot water heater
all<00:02:42.760> right<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:44.220> what<00:02:45.220> it's<00:02:45.340> gonna<00:02:45.430> do<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:45.760> make

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
all right so what it's gonna do is make

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.210 
all right so what it's gonna do is make
hot<00:02:46.360> water<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:46.810> demand<00:02:46.840> that's<00:02:47.799> correct

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
hot water on demand that's correct

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.729 
hot water on demand that's correct
when<00:02:48.459> this<00:02:48.640> unit<00:02:48.970> only<00:02:49.120> runs<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:50.440> only<00:02:50.590> runs

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
when this unit only runs it only runs

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.800 
when this unit only runs it only runs
when<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.010> turn<00:02:51.160> on<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.400> hot<00:02:51.549> water<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.000> then

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
when you turn on the hot water and then

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.809 
when you turn on the hot water and then
what<00:02:53.019> it'll<00:02:53.200> happen<00:02:53.319> is<00:02:53.620> as<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.340> water<00:02:54.370> flows

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
what it'll happen is as the water flows

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.150 
what it'll happen is as the water flows
through<00:02:54.850> here<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.630> gas<00:02:55.810> flows<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.099> out

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
through here the gas flows in and out

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.640 
through here the gas flows in and out
and<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:58.180> heats<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.870> up<00:02:58.959> as<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.260> goes<00:02:59.380> there's<00:02:59.620> a

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
and it heats it up as it goes there's a

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.080 
and it heats it up as it goes there's a
bunch<00:02:59.830> of<00:02:59.920> burners<00:03:00.130> inside<00:03:00.670> here<00:03:00.940> and

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
bunch of burners inside here and

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.630 
bunch of burners inside here and
exhausts<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.900> hot<00:03:02.049> air<00:03:02.200> out<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.500> here<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.220> the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
exhausts the hot air out of here and the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.770 
exhausts the hot air out of here and the
water<00:03:03.819> flows<00:03:04.060> back<00:03:04.299> through<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.660> house

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
water flows back through the house

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.509 
water flows back through the house
you're<00:03:05.080> only<00:03:05.200> using<00:03:05.349> it<00:03:05.650> as<00:03:05.769> your<00:03:05.830> demand

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
you're only using it as your demand

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.740 
you're only using it as your demand
calls<00:03:06.760> for<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.180> you're<00:03:07.269> not<00:03:07.360> spending<00:03:07.480> a

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
calls for it so you're not spending a

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.330 
calls for it so you're not spending a
lot<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:07.900> extra<00:03:08.230> money<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:08.739> we<00:03:08.950> don't<00:03:09.130> have<00:03:09.310> a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
lot of extra money so we don't have a

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.280 
lot of extra money so we don't have a
tank<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:10.090> water<00:03:10.360> that<00:03:10.720> we're<00:03:10.840> trying<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.080> keep

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
tank of water that we're trying to keep

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.750 
tank of water that we're trying to keep
hot<00:03:11.530> all<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.799> time<00:03:11.950> that's<00:03:12.370> correct

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
hot all the time that's correct

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.640 
hot all the time that's correct
all<00:03:13.150> right<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:13.450> even<00:03:13.569> if<00:03:13.750> we<00:03:13.900> had<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:15.220> gas<00:03:16.650> tank

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
all right and even if we had a gas tank

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.890 
all right and even if we had a gas tank
style<00:03:17.920> water<00:03:18.220> heater<00:03:18.489> we<00:03:19.299> heat<00:03:19.450> up<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.720> water

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
style water heater we heat up the water

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.830 
style water heater we heat up the water
it<00:03:20.709> cools<00:03:21.400> down<00:03:21.519> again<00:03:22.030> up<00:03:22.239> through<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.570> flue

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
it cools down again up through the flue

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.319 
it cools down again up through the flue
and<00:03:23.200> we<00:03:23.950> heat<00:03:24.130> it<00:03:24.160> over<00:03:24.519> and<00:03:24.640> over<00:03:24.760> again<00:03:24.970> even

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
and we heat it over and over again even

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.210 
and we heat it over and over again even
when<00:03:25.450> we're<00:03:25.630> not<00:03:25.720> using<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.109> but<00:03:26.350> this<00:03:26.620> there's

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
when we're not using it but this there's

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.430 
when we're not using it but this there's
no<00:03:27.370> tank<00:03:27.640> at<00:03:27.760> all<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.209> we're<00:03:28.390> not<00:03:28.480> correcting<00:03:28.959> a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
no tank at all so we're not correcting a

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.640 
no tank at all so we're not correcting a
reservoir<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.459> water<00:03:30.489> hot<00:03:30.940> right<00:03:31.480> okay<00:03:32.440> and

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
reservoir of water hot right okay and

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.280 
reservoir of water hot right okay and
now<00:03:33.220> we're<00:03:33.579> in<00:03:33.790> Florida<00:03:34.180> here<00:03:34.810> mm-hmm

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
now we're in Florida here mm-hmm

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.030 
now we're in Florida here mm-hmm
and<00:03:35.430> we<00:03:36.430> have<00:03:36.670> this<00:03:36.850> unit<00:03:37.269> mounted<00:03:37.810> outside

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
and we have this unit mounted outside

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.309 
and we have this unit mounted outside
now<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:39.250> something<00:03:39.489> that<00:03:39.790> we<00:03:40.329> don't<00:03:40.450> see<00:03:40.600> up

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
now is something that we don't see up

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.240 
now is something that we don't see up
north<00:03:41.650> where<00:03:41.920> I'm<00:03:42.069> from<00:03:42.400> but<00:03:43.170> this<00:03:44.170> this<00:03:45.040> is

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
north where I'm from but this this is

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.129 
north where I'm from but this this is
the<00:03:45.400> vent<00:03:45.639> right<00:03:45.880> yes<00:03:46.299> sir<00:03:46.480> okay<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:46.840> the

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
the vent right yes sir okay so the

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.860 
the vent right yes sir okay so the
exhaust<00:03:47.470> gasses<00:03:48.100> come<00:03:49.000> right<00:03:49.209> out<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.510> here

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
exhaust gasses come right out of here

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.259 
exhaust gasses come right out of here
and<00:03:50.310> because<00:03:51.310> this<00:03:51.579> is<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.790> high<00:03:52.060> efficiency

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
and because this is a high efficiency

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.960 
and because this is a high efficiency
unit<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.200> way<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:54.069> heat<00:03:54.340> exchanger<00:03:54.940> is

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
unit the way that the heat exchanger is

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.110 
unit the way that the heat exchanger is
designed<00:03:55.540> so<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.650> hot<00:03:56.829> combustion<00:03:57.430> gases<00:03:57.910> go

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
designed so the hot combustion gases go

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.970 
designed so the hot combustion gases go
through<00:03:58.389> this<00:03:58.510> heat<00:03:58.720> exchanger<00:03:58.750> as<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.650> water

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
through this heat exchanger as the water

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.490 
through this heat exchanger as the water
goes<00:04:00.310> through<00:04:00.519> there<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.940> most<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:02.139> the<00:04:02.230> heat

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
goes through there it most of the heat

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.800 
goes through there it most of the heat
from<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.160> combustion<00:04:03.549> gases<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:04.299> transferred

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
from the combustion gases is transferred

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.300 
from the combustion gases is transferred
to<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.109> water<00:04:05.319> that's<00:04:05.680> correct

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
to the water that's correct

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.530 
to the water that's correct
so<00:04:06.760> in<00:04:07.120> fact<00:04:07.450> this<00:04:07.870> is<00:04:08.170> 90<00:04:09.060> it's<00:04:10.060> about<00:04:10.180> 90%

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
so in fact this is 90 it's about 90%

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.970 
so in fact this is 90 it's about 90%
efficient<00:04:11.230> 90%<00:04:12.130> so<00:04:12.600> only<00:04:13.600> 10%<00:04:14.079> of<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.709> heat

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
efficient 90% so only 10% of the heat

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.279 
efficient 90% so only 10% of the heat
from<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.430> combustion<00:04:15.790> gases<00:04:16.389> is<00:04:16.570> going<00:04:17.139> to<00:04:17.200> be

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
from the combustion gases is going to be

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.759 
from the combustion gases is going to be
lost<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.889> the<00:04:18.010> outside<00:04:18.609> where<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.329> typical<00:04:20.019> gas

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
lost to the outside where a typical gas

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.469 
lost to the outside where a typical gas

that<00:04:22.750> might<00:04:22.930> be<00:04:23.110> 15<00:04:23.560> years<00:04:23.830> old

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
that might be 15 years old

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.180 
that might be 15 years old
we'll<00:04:25.990> be<00:04:26.530> maybe<00:04:27.720> 65%<00:04:28.720> efficient<00:04:29.470> so<00:04:30.010> that

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
we'll be maybe 65% efficient so that

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.310 
we'll be maybe 65% efficient so that
means<00:04:30.370> 35%<00:04:31.120> of<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.270> heat<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.600> you<00:04:31.660> paid<00:04:31.990> for

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
means 35% of the heat that you paid for

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.870 
means 35% of the heat that you paid for
mm-hmm<00:04:32.950> either<00:04:33.220> in<00:04:33.870> gas<00:04:34.870> or<00:04:35.290> oil<00:04:35.320> is<00:04:35.890> going<00:04:36.760> out

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
mm-hmm either in gas or oil is going out

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.670 
mm-hmm either in gas or oil is going out
up<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.300> chimney<00:04:37.540> right<00:04:37.960> you're<00:04:38.170> just<00:04:38.200> losing

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
up the chimney right you're just losing

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.890 
up the chimney right you're just losing
it<00:04:38.770> straight<00:04:39.160> out<00:04:39.190> all<00:04:39.550> right<00:04:39.760> so<00:04:39.970> so<00:04:40.690> this<00:04:40.840> is

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
it straight out all right so so this is

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.070 
it straight out all right so so this is
much<00:04:41.620> more<00:04:41.860> efficient<00:04:42.340> and<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:43.270> we<00:04:43.930> also

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
much more efficient and and we also

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.790 
much more efficient and and we also
don't<00:04:44.590> have<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:45.070> risk<00:04:45.310> that<00:04:45.760> this<00:04:46.150> tank<00:04:46.800> well

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
don't have the risk that this tank well

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.500 
don't have the risk that this tank well
there<00:04:47.980> is<00:04:48.070> no<00:04:48.250> tank<00:04:48.520> but<00:04:48.700> that<00:04:48.730> a<00:04:49.030> tanks<00:04:49.390> not

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
there is no tank but that a tanks not

there is no tank but that a tanks not
water<00:04:49.780> heater<00:04:49.960> would<00:04:50.140> leak<00:04:50.530> all<00:04:51.220> right<00:04:51.400> load

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
water heater would leak all right load

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.460 
water heater would leak all right load
your<00:04:51.820> house<00:04:52.030> that's<00:04:52.510> this<00:04:52.630> with<00:04:52.840> all<00:04:53.320> this

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
your house that's this with all this

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.170 
your house that's this with all this
would<00:04:53.680> do<00:04:53.830> is<00:04:53.860> lose<00:04:54.190> water<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.640> outside<00:04:55.000> as

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
would do is lose water to the outside as

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.850 
would do is lose water to the outside as
you<00:04:55.210> can<00:04:55.390> see<00:04:55.540> you<00:04:55.720> would<00:04:55.810> not<00:04:56.020> if<00:04:56.290> your<00:04:56.590> many

just<00:05:11.500> floods<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.919> whole<00:05:12.070> house<00:05:12.250> big<00:05:12.640> flood

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
just floods the whole house big flood

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.540 
just floods the whole house big flood
big<00:05:13.419> and<00:05:13.780> you<00:05:14.169> know<00:05:14.200> carpets<00:05:14.770> ruined<00:05:15.220> flooring

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
big and you know carpets ruined flooring

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.460 
big and you know carpets ruined flooring
ruined<00:05:15.910> and<00:05:16.030> all<00:05:16.060> that<00:05:16.300> yes<00:05:16.540> sir<00:05:16.720> yeah<00:05:16.930> so<00:05:17.200> no

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
ruined and all that yes sir yeah so no

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.170 
ruined and all that yes sir yeah so no
risk<00:05:17.919> of<00:05:18.070> that<00:05:18.190> here<00:05:18.400> even<00:05:18.580> if<00:05:18.790> this<00:05:18.940> was

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
risk of that here even if this was

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.270 
risk of that here even if this was
located<00:05:19.510> inside<00:05:19.810> because<00:05:20.260> there<00:05:20.380> is<00:05:20.590> no<00:05:20.919> tank

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
located inside because there is no tank

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.440 
located inside because there is no tank
that's<00:05:22.000> correct

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
that's correct

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.740 
that's correct
all<00:05:22.570> right<00:05:22.810> and<00:05:23.020> and<00:05:23.320> now<00:05:24.010> we<00:05:24.070> also<00:05:24.340> have<00:05:24.610> a

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
all right and and now we also have a

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.900 
all right and and now we also have a
modulating<00:05:25.750> gas<00:05:26.350> valve<00:05:26.710> so<00:05:27.010> if<00:05:27.100> we<00:05:27.250> there's<00:05:27.820> a

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
modulating gas valve so if we there's a

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.400 
modulating gas valve so if we there's a
flow<00:05:28.210> sensor<00:05:28.480> in<00:05:28.810> here<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.110> if<00:05:29.169> we're<00:05:29.290> only

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
flow sensor in here and if we're only

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.590 
flow sensor in here and if we're only
using<00:05:29.590> a<00:05:29.890> little<00:05:30.100> bit<00:05:30.250> of<00:05:30.370> hot<00:05:30.610> water<00:05:30.790> it<00:05:31.450> only

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
using a little bit of hot water it only

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.630 
using a little bit of hot water it only
have<00:05:31.810> a<00:05:31.840> little<00:05:32.140> flame<00:05:32.380> make<00:05:32.979> make<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.430> little

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
have a little flame make make a little

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.310 
have a little flame make make a little
bit<00:05:33.820> of<00:05:33.910> right<00:05:34.090> hot<00:05:34.360> water<00:05:34.570> that<00:05:34.840> is<00:05:34.990> what<00:05:35.200> it

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
bit of right hot water that is what it

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.590 
bit of right hot water that is what it
does<00:05:35.530> you<00:05:36.280> can<00:05:36.430> take<00:05:36.610> it<00:05:36.760> in<00:05:36.910> it<00:05:37.180> only<00:05:37.300> will

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
does you can take it in it only will

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.230 
does you can take it in it only will
heat<00:05:37.780> what<00:05:38.020> you're<00:05:38.200> using<00:05:38.640> shuts<00:05:39.640> off<00:05:39.820> as<00:05:40.030> soon

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.060 
heat what you're using shuts off as soon
as<00:05:40.360> you<00:05:40.479> are<00:05:40.510> finished<00:05:40.630> using<00:05:41.169> it<00:05:41.410> and<00:05:41.620> then

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
as you are finished using it and then

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.380 
as you are finished using it and then
just<00:05:42.400> comes<00:05:42.580> back<00:05:42.669> home<00:05:42.940> whenever<00:05:43.180> you<00:05:43.240> turn

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
just comes back home whenever you turn

just comes back home whenever you turn
the<00:05:43.479> hot<00:05:43.600> water<00:05:43.630> back<00:05:43.960> on<00:05:44.169> so<00:05:44.470> you're<00:05:45.340> again

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.040 
the hot water back on so you're again
you're<00:05:45.850> not<00:05:45.940> using<00:05:46.210> a<00:05:46.330> tank<00:05:46.600> you're<00:05:46.840> not<00:05:46.960> gonna

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
you're not using a tank you're not gonna

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.200 
you're not using a tank you're not gonna
run<00:05:47.260> out<00:05:47.320> of<00:05:47.470> hot<00:05:47.710> water<00:05:47.740> for<00:05:48.130> showers<00:05:48.580> you're

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
run out of hot water for showers you're

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.730 
run out of hot water for showers you're
not<00:05:49.360> gonna<00:05:49.510> run<00:05:49.720> out<00:05:49.780> of<00:05:49.990> hot<00:05:50.110> water<00:05:50.229> for<00:05:50.470> doing

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
not gonna run out of hot water for doing

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.219 
not gonna run out of hot water for doing
dishes<00:05:51.120> it's<00:05:52.120> just<00:05:52.330> gonna<00:05:52.419> continue<00:05:52.600> to<00:05:53.020> run

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
dishes it's just gonna continue to run

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.110 
dishes it's just gonna continue to run
as<00:05:53.500> long<00:05:53.710> as<00:05:53.860> you<00:05:53.979> were<00:05:54.130> asking<00:05:54.640> for<00:05:54.790> hot<00:05:54.910> water

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
as long as you were asking for hot water

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.710 
as long as you were asking for hot water
so<00:05:55.840> a<00:05:56.340> tankless<00:05:57.340> water<00:05:57.610> heater<00:05:58.270> even<00:05:58.630> though

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
so a tankless water heater even though

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.110 
so a tankless water heater even though
it's<00:05:58.870> smaller<00:05:59.169> will<00:05:59.890> cost<00:06:00.160> more<00:06:00.520> than<00:06:00.760> a<00:06:00.820> tank

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
it's smaller will cost more than a tank

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.719 
it's smaller will cost more than a tank
style<00:06:01.540> water<00:06:01.810> heater<00:06:02.110> but<00:06:02.890> it's<00:06:03.280> worth<00:06:03.550> it

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
style water heater but it's worth it

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.850 
style water heater but it's worth it
because<00:06:03.870> we<00:06:04.870> spent<00:06:05.110> a<00:06:05.169> little<00:06:05.290> bit<00:06:05.500> more<00:06:05.710> in

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
because we spent a little bit more in

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.219 
because we spent a little bit more in
the<00:06:05.979> equipment<00:06:06.280> when<00:06:06.820> we<00:06:07.000> buy<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.300> mm-hmm<00:06:07.990> over

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
the equipment when we buy it mm-hmm over

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.250 
the equipment when we buy it mm-hmm over
the<00:06:08.350> life<00:06:08.740> of<00:06:08.919> this<00:06:09.130> unit<00:06:09.550> which<00:06:09.790> could<00:06:10.090> be<00:06:10.300> you

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
the life of this unit which could be you

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.520 
the life of this unit which could be you
could<00:06:11.320> run<00:06:11.620> 15<00:06:12.250> 20<00:06:12.640> years<00:06:12.850> so<00:06:13.060> over<00:06:13.570> 15<00:06:14.020> or<00:06:14.050> 20

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
could run 15 20 years so over 15 or 20

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.520 
could run 15 20 years so over 15 or 20
years<00:06:14.560> we're<00:06:15.040> gonna<00:06:15.190> use<00:06:15.370> a<00:06:15.400> lot<00:06:15.820> less<00:06:15.880> gas

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
years we're gonna use a lot less gas

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.620 
years we're gonna use a lot less gas
running<00:06:17.530> through<00:06:17.830> here<00:06:18.190> and<00:06:18.370> it'll<00:06:18.970> make<00:06:19.300> that

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
running through here and it'll make that

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.380 
running through here and it'll make that
extra<00:06:20.200> investment<00:06:20.560> in<00:06:20.950> equipment<00:06:21.390> initially

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.390 
extra investment in equipment initially

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.480 
extra investment in equipment initially
seemed<00:06:23.169> well<00:06:23.590> worth<00:06:23.979> it<00:06:24.160> because<00:06:24.250> we're<00:06:24.400> gonna

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
seemed well worth it because we're gonna

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.130 
seemed well worth it because we're gonna
say<00:06:24.669> many<00:06:24.970> times<00:06:25.060> that<00:06:25.510> yes<00:06:25.750> you<00:06:25.900> will
