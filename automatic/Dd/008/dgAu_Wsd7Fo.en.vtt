00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920
 this is a horse drawn for us 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:12.809
 it not born until 2009, a precisely again 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.759
 set up because that's a nice picture 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.140
 harmonic building has all 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:23.369
 friendly nice drives too 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:26.510
 Interesting ancestry of the father is in 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.420
 tournament sport a well-known stallion 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.230
 bradley will turn a son of 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.460
 Two attempts is bitter and the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.870
 mother is winner of kienberg very much from 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.520
 the mountain is a daughter of salka 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.300
 von Neubronn says Locksmith 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.460
 Brawn daughter of Stiga and the father 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.379
 of sarah is no lesser than animal 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.059
 from the rappenhof so of the descent 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.370
 he has a lot to show 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.710
 from his character from his building 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.719
 We are very pretty, so we are also long 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.580
 have thought about it long ago 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.869
 only the movement was then 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:14.570
 ultimately too little though he 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.570
 only four years old is just here 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.750
 I would want to wait for one 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.560
 future stallion that he already there 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.479
 more time to move 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.320
 and that's why we prefer to have it 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.439
 a beautiful was made after all 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.680
 fine nice drives despite its four 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.990
 years to ride properly 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.439
 So not so young anymore 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:49.079
 horses moderately what helps rein in building 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.220
 and so far as it goes transitions 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.979
 then so if we see later 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.530
 it may be that it's a bit 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.320
 funny starts running but then what 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.070
 Relatively quickly we have relaxed quite 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.350
 normal eights fog around on it 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.560
 no bells about number so the boy 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.640
 horse wants to show a bit of bother 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.980
 please do not frame the Swiss 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.390
 pass it goes goes away alone 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.880
 So where are only a few meters time 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.830
 give yourself a bit to break in 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.810
 Of course you could do something with a few 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.850
 Glock indirectly from the outset away 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.190
 but so is much more interesting if 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.940
 You can see here at the end of the long side 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.090
 there would be pretty good already in the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.400
 clock now ad ad completely anyway 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.190
 acta very pleasant to ride very softly 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.440
 next to a young horse he looks what 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.550
 everything is going on do not know how many times I 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.430
 here sometimes alone on the ground 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.670
 he was also ridden 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.930
 formal ridden 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.200
 you have to roll away a bit 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.200
 sit 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.050
 but you can see it is all around 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.300
 tidy bagged he does too 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:08.450
 here on the railway crisis yukos drives 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:13.420
 Of course it takes quite a lot 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.420
 there is still more exercise in it 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:31.570
 beautiful nice stepped outside you can 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.600
 some dressage riders work decades 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.490
 to do it 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.230
 fun aside that the now so problem 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.810
 have just left here that is so 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.090
 easily in the outside run through the curve 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.150
 can go on it also continues 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.400
 just a really good run 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:04:02.080
 Actually it's almost fair 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:04:06.000
 seldom good gallop is me anyway 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.000
 left gallop on the left has love 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:14.950
 very nice facility here very clean 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:28.840
 real picture beautiful drives more beautiful 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:31.890
 character and almost without reins only with 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.500
 agree by parrying it could be 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.940
 interesting for the one the one 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.460
 little experience with boys 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.990
 horses strikes as a bit of what the 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.390
 fan has a lot of experience you need 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:48.400
 not to have because he is already relative 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:51.090
 already ridden and he was never really 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.220
 complicated by the character 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.830
 beautiful screen look and 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.990
 just have to ride on now 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.170
 there will not be anything special with it 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.460
 happen to them but just outside 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:06.190
 walk in the beautiful weather 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.020
 then you're sud leg work and the 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.120
 normal program but nothing 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.150
 special and for that it is one for the 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.110
 you can and want to do something like that 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.110
 it is a beautiful value
