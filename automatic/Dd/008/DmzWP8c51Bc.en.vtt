00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.240
 these guys are here today with the 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.460
 player review by gervinho to the left 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.249
 from series to which shows up with an 81 of 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.629
 over or 93 dribbling speed 83 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:16.640
 69 of 64 shooting passage of physical or 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.320
 arcade no medium high three stars 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.560
 for the weak three-star mons ability 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.460
 player paid 4,300 credits but now 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.260
 the price is around 3 thousand 5 I call 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.070
 with clips this player 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.820
 the first feature to list is the 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.520
 speed an excellent speed with 94 e 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.500
 acceleration is a speed 92 click 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.800
 the player that really becomes 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.280
 impregnable in open spaces and when 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.739
 part an engine and it is really let's say 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.270
 if not impossible, very difficult 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.480
 recover 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.780
 when it is triggered we also have dribbling 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.070
 an excellent pure dribble with 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.070
 85 88 of agility this feature is 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.650
 very good is combined with the speed becomes 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.430
 really devastating 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.979
 we have the shot that the shooting unfortunately 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.409
 it's not the best though it's a shot 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.229
 discreet but the best 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:23.510
 we found that effect 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:27.049
 that on paper is 69 but in play we say 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.630
 during the games we hear that we say 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.820
 on a higher value 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.119
 we have the 64 of physical that 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.310
 characterized by the force 56 is a 75 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.260
 balance well these 85 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.100
 balance seemed to me much more 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.680
 in game way more because he didn't 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.540
 a lot of strength certainly makes it hard to 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.080
 can overtake defenders who have one 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.650
 physical strength greater than 90 85 though 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.280
 thanks to the balance on paper 75 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.799
 but it has much higher values 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.930
 this player also holds some 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.080
 physical contact 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.360
 then we talk about the passage 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.250
 the passage is a very characteristic 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.670
 good with 74 of short passing 75 of 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.190
 cross and 67 of long passing player who 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.270
 as mentioned by the statistics it has 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.910
 on paper it does not seem that great though 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.040
 can ensure that the game is a 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.840
 player really 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.650
 devastating that speed that 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.170
 dribbling is an amazing thing is the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.050
 unfortunately dribbling could be more 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.920
 effective if gervinho had four 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.480
 star skill 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.810
 unfortunately this player has 3 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:52.190
 we hope for a future upgrade 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.830
 among the pros and cons of this player 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:00.870
 have speed pull that effect 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:05.550
 dribbling and passing and also 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.670
 the balance between the cons we have the three 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.550
 skill stars and 56 strength 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.890
 therefore this player is promoted 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.610
 since launched in the open spaces is 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.400
 truly a devastating player 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:24.450
 tried in a 4 3 3 with fernando tip 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.360
 torres the really good result 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.370
 and the price is around 3500 credits 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.959
 but I really recommend you 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:37.560
 try it if you want to do a 4 3 series 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.510
 with him and leaving a comment 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.549
 if you have any suggestions for i 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.060
 players to try 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:49.610
 then leave a like and above all 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.610
 join the channel hello to the next one
