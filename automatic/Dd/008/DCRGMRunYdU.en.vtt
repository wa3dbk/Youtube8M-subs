2:15 it's the SD model that Sam David
and<00:00:13.070> what<00:00:14.070> was<00:00:14.190> happening<00:00:14.610> was<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:15.089> was<00:00:15.299> stuck

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
and what was happening was it was stuck

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.710 
and what was happening was it was stuck
in<00:00:15.839> gear<00:00:15.870> all<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.260> time<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:17.400> would<00:00:18.300> release<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
in gear all the time I would release the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.630 
in gear all the time I would release the
handle<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.439> would<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.770> keep<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.130> going

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
handle it would just keep on going

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.810 
handle it would just keep on going
and<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.960> wouldn't<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.260> able<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.410> her<00:00:22.529> even<00:00:22.859> when

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
and I wouldn't be able to her even when

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.060 
and I wouldn't be able to her even when
it<00:00:23.939> was<00:00:24.029> idle<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.359> wouldn't<00:00:24.570> build<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.779> back<00:00:24.900> up

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
it was idle I wouldn't build it back up

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.109 
it was idle I wouldn't build it back up
because<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> wheels<00:00:26.369> would<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.730> locked<00:00:26.939> in

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
because the wheels would be locked in

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.800 
because the wheels would be locked in
gear<00:00:27.560> anyway<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.769> had<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.160> here<00:00:29.810> was

their goods but they underestimated my
sheer<00:00:56.010> manliness<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> was<00:00:57.480> able<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
sheer manliness here so I was able to

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.540 
sheer manliness here so I was able to
grab<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.699> thing<00:00:59.760> bend<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> way

grab this thing bend it out of the way
and<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.670> allowed<00:01:02.910> me<00:01:03.059> access<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.600> could<00:01:03.780> get

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and that allowed me access I could get

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.609 
and that allowed me access I could get
the<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:05.010> could<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> belt<00:01:06.270> off<00:01:06.479> there<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> is

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the I could get the belt off there it is

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.010 
the I could get the belt off there it is
right<00:01:07.770> there

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
right there

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.480 
right there
also<00:01:10.020> what<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.350> need<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.310> need<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
also what you need to do is you need to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.980 
also what you need to do is you need to
take<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.880> spring<00:01:12.270> off<00:01:12.450> there's<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> big

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
take this spring off there's a big

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.660 
take this spring off there's a big
spring<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> back<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.369> what<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
spring on the back here and what that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.749 
spring on the back here and what that
does<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.119> holds<00:01:15.479> tension<00:01:16.640> against<00:01:17.640> your

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
does is that holds tension against your

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.600 
does is that holds tension against your
pulley<00:01:17.970> wheel<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:19.560> transmission<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.460> that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
pulley wheel of the transmission so that

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.390 
pulley wheel of the transmission so that
the<00:01:20.729> belt<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.060> nice<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.450> tight<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.189> this<00:01:23.189> is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the belt is nice and tight and this is

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.270 
the belt is nice and tight and this is
just<00:01:23.780> hell<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.409> thing<00:01:25.650> off<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.130> it's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
just hell to get this thing off and it's

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.490 
just hell to get this thing off and it's
going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.580> very<00:01:26.850> difficult<00:01:27.810> getting<00:01:28.320> it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
going to be very difficult getting it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.399 
going to be very difficult getting it
back<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.920> which<00:01:29.159> I'm<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.430> looking<00:01:29.700> forward<00:01:29.939> to

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
back on which I'm not looking forward to

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.539 
back on which I'm not looking forward to
but<00:01:31.409> I'll<00:01:31.530> just<00:01:31.560> summon<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> power<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
but I'll just summon the power of the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.260 
but I'll just summon the power of the
bicep<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.420> get<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.689> back<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:34.049> there<00:01:34.200> somehow

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
bicep and get it back on there somehow

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.319 
bicep and get it back on there somehow
anyway<00:01:36.409> this<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.650> transmission<00:01:38.520> upside

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
anyway this is your transmission upside

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.160 
anyway this is your transmission upside
down<00:01:39.570> I've<00:01:39.930> got<00:01:40.320> took<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> wheels<00:01:41.159> off<00:01:42.170> top

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
down I've got took the wheels off top

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.730 
down I've got took the wheels off top
one<00:01:43.409> bottom<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:45.290> everything<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.560> goes<00:01:46.710> with

one bottom one everything that goes with
it<00:01:47.009> all<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.299> snap<00:01:48.689> rings<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.259> everything

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
it all the snap rings and everything

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.969 
it all the snap rings and everything
else<00:01:50.149> that<00:01:51.149> allowed<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.810> thing<00:01:52.049> once<00:01:52.799> it's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
else that allowed this thing once it's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.319 
else that allowed this thing once it's
unhooked<00:01:53.250> from<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> spring<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.000> flip<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
unhooked from the spring you can flip it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.679 
unhooked from the spring you can flip it
around<00:01:55.610> anyway<00:01:56.610> first<00:01:56.880> thing<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.119> noticed<00:01:57.479> here

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
around anyway first thing I noticed here

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.410 
around anyway first thing I noticed here
was<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.140> my<00:01:58.979> spring<00:01:59.340> was<00:01:59.490> missing<00:01:59.880> as<00:02:00.240> you

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
was that my spring was missing as you

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.209 
was that my spring was missing as you
can<00:02:00.570> see<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:02.040> is

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
can see I have it on there now this is

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.810 
can see I have it on there now this is
the<00:02:02.340> spring<00:02:02.640> right<00:02:03.570> here<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:05.250> way<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.520> works

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the spring right here the way this works

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.609 
the spring right here the way this works
is<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.450> pull<00:02:06.659> your<00:02:06.810> cable<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.469> don't

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
is this you pull your cable you don't

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.710 
is this you pull your cable you don't
see<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> cable<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:08.459> because<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.700> bought<00:02:09.690> a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
see the cable on here because I bought a

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.760 
see the cable on here because I bought a
new<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> don't<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.530> it

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
new one I don't have it

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.500 
new one I don't have it
got<00:02:10.980> yet<00:02:11.660> what<00:02:12.660> happens<00:02:12.990> here<00:02:14.210> is<00:02:15.210> when<00:02:15.390> you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
got yet what happens here is when you

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.610 
got yet what happens here is when you
pull<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.840> cable<00:02:16.970> with<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.000> hand<00:02:18.420> lever<00:02:18.630> it

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
pull the cable with a hand lever it

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.800 
pull the cable with a hand lever it
pushes<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.130> thing<00:02:20.370> over<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.300> pushes<00:02:21.660> it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
pushes this thing over and pushes it

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.640 
pushes this thing over and pushes it
into<00:02:22.020> gear<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:24.080> what<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.230> does<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.530> that

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
into gear and what that does is that

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.230 
into gear and what that does is that
engages<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.100> clutch<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.760> spring<00:02:27.060> of

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
engages a clutch and the spring of

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.460 
engages a clutch and the spring of
course<00:02:27.420> pulls<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.840> back<00:02:27.870> but<00:02:28.290> what<00:02:28.380> was

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
course pulls it back but what was

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.520 
course pulls it back but what was
happening<00:02:28.920> was<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.370> spring<00:02:29.760> not<00:02:30.090> being<00:02:30.390> there

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.260 

didn't<00:02:34.530> take<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.740> out<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:34.860> gear<00:02:34.980> again<00:02:35.340> didn't

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
didn't take it out of gear again didn't

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.920 
didn't take it out of gear again didn't
dis<00:02:36.360> again<00:02:37.880> e<00:02:38.880> way<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> have<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> spring<00:02:39.570> on<00:02:39.720> there

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
dis again e way I have a spring on there

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.420 
dis again e way I have a spring on there
I<00:02:39.960> went<00:02:40.200> over<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.410> Lowe's<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.980> bought<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.130> cheap

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
I went over to Lowe's and bought a cheap

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.250 
I went over to Lowe's and bought a cheap
one<00:02:41.670> it's<00:02:41.910> not<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.270> right<00:02:42.420> gauge<00:02:42.720> it's<00:02:43.140> not

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
one it's not the right gauge it's not

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.320 
one it's not the right gauge it's not
what<00:02:43.410> they<00:02:43.530> call<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.700> got<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> very<00:02:45.150> low

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
what they call for it's got a very low

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.880 
what they call for it's got a very low
tension<00:02:45.630> it'll<00:02:46.110> probably<00:02:46.260> wear<00:02:46.500> out<00:02:46.530> in<00:02:46.710> a

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
tension it'll probably wear out in a

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.000 
tension it'll probably wear out in a
year<00:02:47.040> or<00:02:47.190> two<00:02:47.990> but<00:02:48.990> that's<00:02:49.380> what<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.650> put<00:02:49.860> on

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
year or two but that's what I put on

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.470 
year or two but that's what I put on
there<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.460> I'll<00:02:50.550> just<00:02:50.610> deal<00:02:50.940> with<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.150> when<00:02:51.390> it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
there and I'll just deal with it when it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.210 
there and I'll just deal with it when it
fails<00:02:51.690> again<00:02:51.870> if<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.440> does<00:02:54.740> there's<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:55.830> there's

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
fails again if it does there's a there's

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.770 
fails again if it does there's a there's
a<00:02:56.280> box<00:02:56.460> of<00:02:56.640> assorted<00:02:56.760> Springs<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.420> can<00:02:57.570> get<00:02:57.690> at

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
a box of assorted Springs you can get at

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.090 
a box of assorted Springs you can get at
low<00:02:57.930> as<00:02:58.050> I<00:02:58.170> put<00:02:58.350> one<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.620> there<00:02:58.800> with<00:02:58.920> low

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
low as I put one on there with low

low as I put one on there with low
tension<00:02:59.520> on<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.790> mainly<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.200> don't

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
tension on it mainly just so I don't

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.900 
tension on it mainly just so I don't
have<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.680> hold<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:01.980> thing<00:03:02.250> down<00:03:02.460> on<00:03:02.490> a<00:03:02.730> high

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
have to hold that thing down on a high

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.340 
have to hold that thing down on a high
tension<00:03:03.210> thing<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:06.720> know<00:03:06.810> when<00:03:06.960> you<00:03:07.050> hold<00:03:07.200> in

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
tension thing you know when you hold in

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.020

the Milan more and more in the grass
with<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.910> that's<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:12.870> I'm<00:03:13.290> going<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.530> put<00:03:13.680> it

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
with it so that's it I'm going to put it

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.520 
with it so that's it I'm going to put it
back<00:03:13.830> together<00:03:14.040> put<00:03:14.970> everything<00:03:15.180> back<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:15.530> get

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
back together put everything back on get

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.440 
back together put everything back on get
it<00:03:16.620> running<00:03:16.950> probably<00:03:17.670> change<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.090> oil

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
it running probably change the oil

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.440 
it running probably change the oil
I<00:03:18.660> also<00:03:19.590> took<00:03:19.740> this<00:03:19.950> opportunity<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.670> replace

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
I also took this opportunity to replace

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.730 
I also took this opportunity to replace
one<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:21.810> my<00:03:21.959> cables<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:27.170> here<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.560> bad

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
one of my cables and here is the bad

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.949 
one of my cables and here is the bad
cable<00:03:29.190> right<00:03:29.310> here<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.060> if<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.390> can<00:03:30.540> see<00:03:30.780> the

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
cable right here and if you can see the

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.640 
cable right here and if you can see the
end<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.880> it<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.209> completely<00:03:33.840> toast<00:03:34.290> and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
end of it it is completely toast and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.560 
end of it it is completely toast and
it's<00:03:34.890> ready<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.220> go<00:03:35.340> at<00:03:35.850> any<00:03:36.180> minute

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
it's ready to go at any minute

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.830 
it's ready to go at any minute
so<00:03:37.520> that<00:03:38.520> goes<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.850> my<00:03:38.940> clutch<00:03:39.240> I<00:03:39.510> went<00:03:39.750> ahead

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
so that goes to my clutch I went ahead

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.260 
so that goes to my clutch I went ahead
and<00:03:40.080> replace<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.380> since<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.910> know<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.030> don't

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
and replace that since you know I don't

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.220 
and replace that since you know I don't
want<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.420> have<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.630> break<00:03:42.780> while<00:03:43.020> I'm<00:03:43.110> cutting

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
want to have it break while I'm cutting

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.209 
want to have it break while I'm cutting
the<00:03:43.410> grass<00:03:44.570> anyway<00:03:45.570> that's<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:46.910> fun<00:03:47.910> stuff
