how<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.080> mod<00:00:13.920> works<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.460> through<00:00:14.820> save<00:00:15.120> data

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
how this mod works is through save data

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.769 
how this mod works is through save data
now<00:00:16.320> there<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> modded<00:00:17.430> save<00:00:17.640> but<00:00:18.420> you

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
now there is a modded save but you

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.320 
now there is a modded save but you
simply<00:00:19.020> cannot<00:00:19.410> take<00:00:19.890> modern<00:00:20.369> save<00:00:20.550> copied<00:00:21.180> on

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
simply cannot take modern save copied on

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.599 
simply cannot take modern save copied on
your<00:00:21.570> ps3<00:00:21.810> because<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:22.830> sort<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.220> copyright

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
your ps3 because it's sort of copyright

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.910 
your ps3 because it's sort of copyright
protected<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.260> what<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.500> need<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.769> do

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
protected in that so what we need to do

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.779 
protected in that so what we need to do
is<00:00:26.130> resign<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.830> now<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.220> basically<00:00:29.490> works

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
is resign it now that basically works

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.670 
is resign it now that basically works
and<00:00:30.650> by<00:00:31.650> taking<00:00:32.660> like<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.870> data<00:00:34.079> from<00:00:34.500> your

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
and by taking like the data from your

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.350 
and by taking like the data from your
user<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.309> any<00:00:36.000> save<00:00:36.300> data<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.180> is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
user on any save data and so for this is

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.319 
user on any save data and so for this is
black<00:00:39.570> ops<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.190> then<00:00:41.190> applying<00:00:41.670> sort<00:00:42.270> of

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
black ops and then applying sort of

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
black ops and then applying sort of
applying<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.469> modded<00:00:43.800> save<00:00:44.010> files

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
applying that to the modded save files

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.700 
applying that to the modded save files
it<00:00:44.489> works<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.879> your<00:00:44.940> user<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.780> if<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.500> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
YouTube how it do it and if you know

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.359 
YouTube how it do it and if you know
what<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.700> its<00:01:11.909> program<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:13.530> computer<00:01:14.010> which

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
what is its program for computer which

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.120 
what is its program for computer which
is<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.270> costs<00:01:15.570> about<00:01:15.659> 15<00:01:16.170> pounds<00:01:16.380> or

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
is like it costs about 15 pounds or

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.620

twenty dollars or something like that

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.950 
twenty dollars or something like that
and<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.770> obviously

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
and so obviously

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.020 
and so obviously
just<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.710> get<00:01:21.799> this<00:01:21.979> if<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.640> already<00:01:22.729> have<00:01:22.940> it

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
just to get this if you already have it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.250 
just to get this if you already have it
then<00:01:23.180> do<00:01:23.330> that<00:01:23.510> but<00:01:23.690> if<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:23.840> don't<00:01:24.020> have<00:01:24.140> it

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
then do that but if you don't have it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.230 
then do that but if you don't have it
then<00:01:24.380> look<00:01:25.250> in<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.430> description<00:01:25.549> for<00:01:26.060> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
then look in the description for the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.930 
then look in the description for the
link<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:27.590> these<00:01:27.710> mods<00:01:28.159> are<00:01:28.340> pretty<00:01:28.760> cool

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
link and so these mods are pretty cool

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.260 
link and so these mods are pretty cool
but<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:30.200> only<00:01:30.590> bad<00:01:30.740> thing<00:01:30.770> is<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.729> only<00:01:31.940> work

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
but the only bad thing is the only work

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.060 
but the only bad thing is the only work
in<00:01:32.540> solo<00:01:32.990> they<00:01:33.440> do<00:01:33.680> not<00:01:33.710> work<00:01:33.979> in<00:01:34.130> line<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:36.070> i'm

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
in solo they do not work in line and i'm

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.830 
in solo they do not work in line and i'm
not<00:01:37.130> sure<00:01:37.280> if<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.580> have<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.940> but<00:01:38.150> what<00:01:38.300> i<00:01:38.330> do<00:01:38.450> is

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
not sure if you have to but what i do is

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.870 
not sure if you have to but what i do is
sign<00:01:39.170> out<00:01:39.380> before<00:01:39.800> i<00:01:40.070> start<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:40.490> game<00:01:40.670> and

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
sign out before i start the game and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.180 
sign out before i start the game and
just<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.869> make<00:01:41.990> sure<00:01:42.020> it<00:01:42.229> doesn't<00:01:42.649> overwrite

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
just to make sure it doesn't overwrite

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.520 
just to make sure it doesn't overwrite
the<00:01:43.340> mods<00:01:43.580> but<00:01:44.210> either<00:01:44.420> way<00:01:44.630> when<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:45.229> start

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
the mods but either way when you start

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.010 
the mods but either way when you start
the<00:01:45.619> game<00:01:45.649> up<00:01:45.950> again<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.909> need<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.330> recopy<00:01:47.810> it

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
the game up again you need to recopy it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.570 
the game up again you need to recopy it
so<00:01:48.409> you<00:01:48.500> can<00:01:48.619> just<00:01:48.649> sort<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:48.979> leave<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.159> memory

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
so you can just sort of leave a memory

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.899 
so you can just sort of leave a memory
stick<00:01:50.110> in<00:01:51.110> your<00:01:51.170> ps3<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.159> usually<00:01:52.250> copy<00:01:52.759> it

stick in your ps3 and it usually copy it
in<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.649> but<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:54.770> will<00:01:54.950> lose<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.850> the
