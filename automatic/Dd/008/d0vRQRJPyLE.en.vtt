00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.030
 form and color in art have 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.370
 very specific meanings 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.350
 whose interpretation may vary however 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.560
 based on the thought of each individual 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.240
 artist to the genre you approach and 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.790
 at the time in which you find yourself 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.770
 with the term form in general 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.730
 we indicate the outward appearance of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.309
 something 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.290
 the structure of a figure the color 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.750
 instead it enters the perceptive sphere 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.720
 demotiva goes to emphasize 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.910
 the expressiveness of the forms the form 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.730
 is sometimes born as an expression of the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.550
 pure color between form and color is generated 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.990
 then an alchemy, a lawyer almost 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.579
 spiritual that releases vital energy 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:06.030
 alessandro scalabrini considers instead 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.190
 the non-natural element form a kind 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.470
 artificial reef that imprisons i 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.560
 colors forcing them into a space 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.380
 unnatural and his research focuses 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.770
 in an attempt to untie the color from the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.770
 form 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.570
 born in the province of Modena since 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.420
 child alessandro scalabrini learns to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.479
 watch the world perceive it and ad 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.369
 listen to it beyond appearance 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.090
 painting has always been part of 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.549
 his life 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.670
 parents loved art and their own 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.560
 art becomes its path 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.920
 that interest that keeps him tied to 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.190
 his past and memories and becomes the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.649
 his decidedly personal way of 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.580
 look at the world beyond the appearance of 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.580
 what you see 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.820
 just because the human being is used to it 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.060
 to consider what he sees inside 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.489
 of recognizable boundaries of men that 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.580
 they are reassuring constructions but yes 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.700
 then reveal the artist proposes illusory 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.220
 totally informal works in which 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.950
 the color expressed as a graphic sign 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.950
 as an unconscious and automatic writing 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.690
 occupies the entire surface of the canvas e 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.690
 thus tells its path 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.990
 for the artist, color lives beyond 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.600
 form in a uniform monochrome sign 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.080
 continuous intertwining on itself 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.500
 quick and nervous is instinctive alessandro 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.750
 scalabrini is impulsive and gestural like 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.810
 a superficial similarity with the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.210
 action painting gives a glimpse of but it is 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.760
 especially reflective and even 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.890
 conceptual in the moment in which it abandons 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.980
 any formal and chromatic reference 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.850
 leaving the sign and writing 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.410
 mental strength of communication 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.150
 observe with the mind and not with the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.490
 eyes wants to be the input that 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.730
 alessandro scalabrini offers to his 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.300
 user to those who stop to understand 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.910
 the artwork from this graphic tangle 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.720
 the artist lets his own come out 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.700
 ideas 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.240
 ignoring the appearance of the forms 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.970
 even when these lines appear 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.590
 circles and triangles are not figures for 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.370
 alessandro scalabrini 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.430
 they are monochrome or even thoughts 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.970
 in the shade or even akron pier 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.920
 lacking color because it is not the 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.070
 their chromatism to establish the 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.040
 meaning the color emerges as 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.880
 formal non-figurative element and yes 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.520
 lets interpret by the observer here 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.640
 then that same shade seems 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.040
 bring out different nuances 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.200
 expression of a dynamic open mind 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.660
 ready for change capable of 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.590
 to renew oneself in the external aspect and in the 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.290
 implied meaning the artist does not 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.200
 apparently his writing is 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.570
 an invitation to enter the work a 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.240
 find that point of contact that there 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.560
 lets you discover the meaning more 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.560
 deep of the sign
