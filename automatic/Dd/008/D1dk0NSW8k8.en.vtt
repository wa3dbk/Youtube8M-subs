like<00:00:25.859> well<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:27.500> concentrate<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
like well just concentrate on the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.110 
like well just concentrate on the
upstroke<00:00:29.189> which<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.179> harder<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.910> it's<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
upstroke which is harder to do it's the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.459 
upstroke which is harder to do it's the
upbeat<00:00:33.809> not<00:00:34.440> necessarily<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> upstroke<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:36.750> I

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
upbeat not necessarily the upstroke if I

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.729 
upbeat not necessarily the upstroke if I
can<00:00:37.649> go<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> spiel<00:00:38.489> please<00:00:39.120> ska<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:40.500> known

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
originally on the wrong beat yeah and so

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.529 
originally on the wrong beat yeah and so
when<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.590> were<00:00:52.649> doing<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.340> Jamaica<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
when they were doing it in Jamaica it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.369 
when they were doing it in Jamaica it
wasn't<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.719> oh<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.230> that

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
wasn't it was so but oh but it's that

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.080 
wasn't it was so but oh but it's that
obvious<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.190> know<00:01:02.280> yeah<00:01:02.460> two<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.850> four

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
obvious that you know yeah two and four

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.840 
obvious that you know yeah two and four
or<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> beat<00:01:04.140> yeah<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.580> like

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
or and of a beat yeah so that's not like

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.560 
or and of a beat yeah so that's not like
uh<00:01:06.260> upstroke<00:01:07.260> necessarily<00:01:08.130> no<00:01:08.760> no<00:01:09.090> that's

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
uh upstroke necessarily no no that's

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.630 
uh upstroke necessarily no no that's
there's<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> component<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.619> but<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.400> fact

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
there's a component of that but in fact

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.450 
there's a component of that but in fact
like<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.180> try<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.990> try<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.560> only<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
like I try to I try to only go to the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.960 
like I try to I try to only go to the
upstroke<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.409> when<00:01:16.979> playing<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.670> sort

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
upstroke when the when playing it sort

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.850 
upstroke when the when playing it sort
of<00:01:18.030> pushing<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.540> will<00:01:18.840> would<00:01:19.229> create<00:01:19.500> fatigue

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
of pushing it will would create fatigue

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.499 
of pushing it will would create fatigue
like<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.430> fast<00:01:20.700> yeah<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.450> don't

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
like if it's really fast yeah I don't

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.399 
like if it's really fast yeah I don't
think<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.780> go<00:01:23.540> much<00:01:24.540> faster<00:01:24.750> than<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.170> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
think you go much faster than that and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.510 
think you go much faster than that and
you're<00:01:25.560> you're<00:01:25.860> gonna<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.280> pretty

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
you're you're gonna get pretty

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149 
you're you're gonna get pretty
diminishing<00:01:27.090> returns<00:01:27.420> yeah<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.320> but

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
diminishing returns yeah but like but

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.679 
diminishing returns yeah but like but
you<00:01:29.340> know<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.700> lot<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> slower<00:01:30.299> groovy

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
you know a lot of the slower groovy

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.179 
you know a lot of the slower groovy
stuff<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.350> really<00:01:31.500> comfortable<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
stuff it's it's really comfortable to

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.499 
stuff it's it's really comfortable to
just<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:32.579> push<00:01:32.820> down<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
just you know push down and then the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.660 
just you know push down and then the
Jamaican<00:01:33.900> stuff<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.799> use<00:01:34.950> small<00:01:35.250> voicings

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
Jamaican stuff if you use small voicings

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.980 
Jamaican stuff if you use small voicings
and<00:01:35.729> play<00:01:35.909> with<00:01:36.030> your<00:01:36.119> thumb<00:01:36.360> that's<00:01:36.659> great

that was like anyway you know that's the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.209 
that was like anyway you know that's the
down<00:01:55.110> versus<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.680> schpeel

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
down versus up schpeel

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.760 
down versus up schpeel
yeah<00:01:56.460> alright<00:01:56.820> what's<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> key<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:58.200> cuz

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
yeah alright what's the key to like cuz

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.469 
yeah alright what's the key to like cuz
every<00:01:59.070> time<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.310> do<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.909> guess<00:02:00.149> chord

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
every time I do it I guess chord

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.359 
every time I do it I guess chord
voicings<00:02:00.869> are<00:02:01.020> key<00:02:01.350> cuz<00:02:01.560> I'm<00:02:01.680> always<00:02:01.860> gonna

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
voicings are key cuz I'm always gonna

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.219 
voicings are key cuz I'm always gonna
play<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.790> big<00:02:03.090> ugly<00:02:03.329> chord<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:03.990> this

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.069 
play like a big ugly chord like this
and<00:02:04.439> then<00:02:04.710> I'm<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:04.860> gonna<00:02:05.450> strum<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
and then I'm just gonna strum it up and

and then I'm just gonna strum it up and
that's<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.740> getting<00:02:07.920> not<00:02:08.879> really<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that's like getting not really all the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.979 
that's like getting not really all the
way<00:02:09.569> there

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
way there

way there
yeah<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.379> mean<00:02:10.619> chord<00:02:11.160> voicings<00:02:11.550> are<00:02:11.760> important

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
yeah I mean chord voicings are important

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.670
