00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.699
 delicious quick made recipe 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.949
 we need about half a kilo 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.240
 medium-sized onion symbolic here 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.539
 presented by these many onions 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.490
 fresh basil spatters cross it was 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.770
 me any other it is also one 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:38.460
 good olive oil garlic salt and nice 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.780
 Bank you get also is lovely done 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.219
 first I thing all the junk and 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.539
 small pieces so most of it 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.559
 Drum here take tomatoes and wash 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.989
 cut small 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.480
 which actually always works best with the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.640
 here for tumors and the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.710
 really have to be that small 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:03.359
 Personally , I always like to do it 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:05.010
 either way just so nice that afford 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.380
 he said so very small pieces of 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.820
 undercut very fat google block 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.670
 here that is quite like once again out 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.680
 and the rest comes in here for that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.320
 recipe for well I'll say two to 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.080
 Three good eater should be the whole 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.549
 500 grams process so much 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.650
 I do not have dinner today because of that 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.000
 do it now only with two the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.530
 corresponding quantities of ingredients for the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.180
 I write big portion here but how 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.610
 always our video then I take me 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.229
 But such a suitable onion for the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.729
 big portion should already be at least 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.770
 be a medium size on the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.159
 but old fashioned ways cut 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.070
 This time is really so fine 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.259
 then tomato in Indian garlic 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.409
 and snowing quite the bottom up 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.860
 in detail afterwards for the big takes 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.390
 like two to three and also in the 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.490
 bowl so a handful of basil 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.060
 pluck off wash off and dry 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.450
 wings together and also very fine 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.450
 to cut 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.560
 and that must not happen until 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.480
 to the finger mitteschÃ¶n that can also 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.100
 happens if you hurry so there 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.140
 but I do not leave me by 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.520
 discourage 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.870
 but I'll take mine now 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.280
 digel knife because it would be a 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.400
 a little bit so well governed 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.160
 guess exactly that was it already 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.730
 almost quite spatter vinegar pure 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:35.700
 Here is a larger splash of olive oil and 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.620
 about pepper salt stir up done 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.180
 farmsaat now i cut here from 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.330
 this year pretty thin baguette 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.430
 pretty elongated pieces off 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.390
 it is hoped that fit and leave fit 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.980
 I now call a bit 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.459
 integrated crispy naturally 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.420
 function here seven minutes only months 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.220
 the venus was adorable 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.380
 it only tastes good if it is crispy and 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.910
 while the bread becomes crispy, that can 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.320
 there is a little line to her 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.720
 you will probably call others completely 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.000
 have or microwave as I should 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.310
 make it look and sound like that 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.519
 and now comes my delicious special oil 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.750
 what I like to take for something like that 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.670
 But today everything should go wrong 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.620
 Of course not swimming but only 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:22.680
 be wetted hereby on the plate 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:28.380
 cult then ketter with the breast it 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:31.310
 so far, they will not be here today 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.310
 tear out of your hands 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.370
 So normally I do that 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.769
 but I survived for that, I really have it there 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.019
 hofa league my stupidity 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.140
 good appetite no longer 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.140
 Well
