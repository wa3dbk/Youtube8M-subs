a<00:02:29.260> little<00:02:29.380> bit<00:02:29.710> dirty<00:02:29.950> but<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.700> guess<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.090> only

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
a little bit dirty but I guess the only

a little bit dirty but I guess the only
alternative<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.470> be<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.770> receiving

for<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.960> MSBs<00:02:38.770> I'd<00:02:39.520> say<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.970> grip<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.360> the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
for the MSBs I'd say the grip is the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.120 
for the MSBs I'd say the grip is the
most<00:02:40.690> important<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.530> reduce<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.980> recoil

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
most important to reduce the recoil

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.220 
most important to reduce the recoil
which<00:02:42.640> allows<00:02:42.910> all<00:02:43.450> three<00:02:43.720> shots<00:02:43.990> from<00:02:44.140> that

which allows all three shots from that

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.590 
which allows all three shots from that

burst to land a hit otherwise you'll

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.630
