00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
and then if it's not working still

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.190 
and then if it's not working still
upgrade<00:01:39.000> these<00:01:39.150> numbers<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.659> bigger<00:01:39.900> numbers

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
upgrade these numbers to bigger numbers

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.950

so i got 365 days of saved so it saves

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.590 
so i got 365 days of saved so it saves
for<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.259> whole<00:01:43.409> year<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.979> i<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.270> put<00:01:45.479> this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
for a whole year and i just put this

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.020 
for a whole year and i just put this
huge<00:01:45.810> number<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.530> 10<00:01:46.979> million<00:01:47.430> hands<00:01:47.909> or

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
huge number like 10 million hands or

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.580 
huge number like 10 million hands or
something<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.590> basically

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
something like that just basically

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.609 
something like that just basically
telling<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.040> save<00:01:50.310> everything<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:52.470> can

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
telling it to save everything you can

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.340 
telling it to save everything you can
change<00:01:52.860> these<00:01:53.100> numbers<00:01:53.159> obviously<00:01:53.700> i<00:01:54.360> think

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
change these numbers obviously i think

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.420 
change these numbers obviously i think
the<00:01:55.439> bigger<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.829> better<00:01:56.390> but

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
the bigger the better but

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.320 
the bigger the better but
if<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.120> do<00:01:59.240> that<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.780> then<00:02:00.940> close<00:02:01.940> it<00:02:01.970> it

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
if you do that and then close it it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.090 
if you do that and then close it it
should<00:02:02.600> start<00:02:02.870> working<00:02:03.080> right<00:02:03.440> away<00:02:03.500> and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
should start working right away and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.130 
should start working right away and
that's<00:02:05.060> pretty<00:02:05.300> much<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.540> it's<00:02:05.840> working<00:02:06.110> now

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
that's pretty much it it's working now

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.320 
that's pretty much it it's working now
