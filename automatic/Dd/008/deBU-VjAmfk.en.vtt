00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
liner to my top lash line and I wanted

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.660 
liner to my top lash line and I wanted
to<00:03:37.900> use<00:03:38.049> liquid<00:03:38.319> because<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.159> has<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.519> really

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
to use liquid because it has that really

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.449 
to use liquid because it has that really
shiny<00:03:40.299> texture<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:41.139> wet<00:03:41.440> looking<00:03:41.859> texture

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
shiny texture that wet looking texture

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.879 
shiny texture that wet looking texture
like<00:03:43.230> it's<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.319> little<00:03:44.470> bit<00:03:44.680> greasy<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.709> just

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
like it's a little bit greasy so just

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.949 
like it's a little bit greasy so just
take<00:03:48.099> that<00:03:48.129> line<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.760> extended<00:03:49.510> outward

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
take that line in the extended outward

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.379 
take that line in the extended outward
past<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.470> lash<00:03:50.680> line<00:03:51.099> not<00:03:51.730> really<00:03:52.030> winging

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
past the lash line not really winging

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.390 
past the lash line not really winging
apart<00:03:52.870> but<00:03:53.169> just<00:03:53.409> kind<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.709> dragging<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.310> out

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
apart but just kind of dragging it out

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.119 
apart but just kind of dragging it out
so<00:03:54.459> we<00:03:54.819> have<00:03:54.909> more<00:03:55.150> of<00:03:55.239> a<00:03:55.299> flat<00:03:55.739> looking<00:03:56.739> shape

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
so we have more of a flat looking shape

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.439 
so we have more of a flat looking shape
to<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.549> eye<00:03:59.639> next<00:04:00.639> I'm<00:04:00.819> going<00:04:01.060> back<00:04:01.239> in<00:04:01.419> with

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
underneath that black liquid liner

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.009 
underneath that black liquid liner
making<00:04:05.709> almost<00:04:05.979> like<00:04:06.069> a<00:04:06.190> double<00:04:06.639> line<00:04:07.150> and

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
making almost like a double line and

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.500 
making almost like a double line and
just<00:04:08.139> smudging<00:04:08.530> that<00:04:08.739> around<00:04:09.190> so<00:04:09.400> we<00:04:09.729> have<00:04:09.760> a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
just smudging that around so we have a

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.930 
just smudging that around so we have a
