it<00:05:44.050> would<00:05:44.139> be<00:05:44.169> really<00:05:44.379> easy<00:05:44.499> at<00:05:44.889> 1000<00:05:45.369> RP<00:05:45.669> every

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
it would be really easy at 1000 RP every

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.029

what<00:05:46.779> every<00:05:47.050> minute<00:05:47.379> every<00:05:47.469> two<00:05:47.739> minutes

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
what every minute every two minutes

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:49.649 
what every minute every two minutes
because<00:05:48.610> it<00:05:48.879> takes<00:05:48.999> like<00:05:49.149> two<00:05:49.269> minutes<00:05:49.449> to<00:05:49.569> do

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:49.659 
because it takes like two minutes to do

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:51.479 
because it takes like two minutes to do
this<00:05:49.779> mission<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:50.259> seven<00:05:50.860> thousand<00:05:51.249> dollars

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:51.489 
this mission and seven thousand dollars

this mission and seven thousand dollars
every<00:05:51.639> two<00:05:51.849> minutes<00:05:52.119> so<00:05:52.179> that's<00:05:52.329> pretty<00:05:52.539> cool

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:52.629 
every two minutes so that's pretty cool

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:55.919 
every two minutes so that's pretty cool
and<00:05:53.050> yes<00:05:53.829> so<00:05:54.129> hopefully<00:05:54.789> this<00:05:54.969> can<00:05:55.809> get

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:55.929
