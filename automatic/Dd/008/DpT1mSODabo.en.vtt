00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
millimeter this is a version two we are

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.779 
millimeter this is a version two we are
just<00:00:19.740> testing<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.730> out<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.090> make<00:00:21.210> sure

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
just testing this out to make sure

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.800 
just testing this out to make sure
testing<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.269> guys<00:00:24.449> can<00:00:24.630> get<00:00:24.750> a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
testing this out so you guys can get a

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.470 
testing this out so you guys can get a
hands-on<00:00:25.140> view<00:00:26.130> because<00:00:26.340> most<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.180> are

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
hands-on view because most of you are

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.279 
hands-on view because most of you are
using<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.800> zooms<00:00:29.400> Prime's<00:00:29.970> or<00:00:30.269> etc<00:00:30.630> so

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
using this for zooms Prime's or etc so

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.510 
using this for zooms Prime's or etc so
let<00:00:31.470> me<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:31.679> run<00:00:31.800> through<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.070> stops<00:00:32.309> so

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
let me just run through the stops so

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.700 
let me just run through the stops so
this<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> first<00:00:33.270> step<00:00:33.469> this<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
this is the first step this is the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.180 
this is the first step this is the
second<00:00:35.070> stop<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> third<00:00:36.390> stop<00:00:37.190> ford

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
second stop this is the third stop ford

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.500 
second stop this is the third stop ford
stopped<00:00:38.570> fifth<00:00:39.570> stop<00:00:40.100> six<00:00:41.100> up<00:00:41.690> seven<00:00:42.690> stop

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
stopped fifth stop six up seven stop

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.619 
stopped fifth stop six up seven stop
eight<00:00:45.510> step<00:00:46.110> nine<00:00:46.800> stop<00:00:47.100> sorry<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:48.480> is

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
eight step nine stop sorry and this is

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.990 
eight step nine stop sorry and this is
at<00:00:48.840> max<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:51.980> well<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.219> almost<00:00:53.430> block<00:00:53.820> out

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
at max so well I can almost block out

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.950 
at max so well I can almost block out
light<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.649> maximum<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.430> pretty<00:00:56.579> cool

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960

this is being shot at 24 millimeter this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.609 
this is being shot at 24 millimeter this
allows<00:01:04.290> me<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:05.390> mean<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.659> usable<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
this is shot at 24 millimeter so right

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.950 
this is shot at 24 millimeter so right
now<00:01:30.960> I'm<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.439> be<00:01:31.530> manual<00:01:31.860> focusing

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
now I'm just going to be manual focusing

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.920 
now I'm just going to be manual focusing
to<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.290> f<00:01:34.560> 2.8<00:01:34.890> looks<00:01:35.430> like<00:01:35.689> during<00:01:36.689> high

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
to see what f 2.8 looks like during high

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.340 
to see what f 2.8 looks like during high
noon<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.590> twelve<00:01:37.860> o<00:01:37.920> clock<00:01:37.950> right<00:01:38.250> now<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
alright I'm going to move it up to 35

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.959 
alright I'm going to move it up to 35
millimeter<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.369> we're<00:01:52.369> going<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.520> redo<00:01:52.850> this

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
millimeter and we're going to redo this

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.399 
millimeter and we're going to redo this
test<00:01:53.030> one<00:01:53.390> more<00:01:53.509> time<00:01:54.549> so<00:01:55.930> I'm<00:01:56.930> moving<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:57.380> back

freakin sweet so let's move it back to
number<00:02:21.860> seven<00:02:22.250> or<00:02:22.989> seven<00:02:23.989> or<00:02:24.049> eight<00:02:24.200> this

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
number seven or seven or eight this

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.289 
number seven or seven or eight this
looks<00:02:25.160> like<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.370> happy<00:02:25.610> medium<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.180> is

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
looks like a happy medium so this is

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.680 
looks like a happy medium so this is
that<00:02:26.420> f<00:02:26.599> 35<00:02:27.590> millimeters<00:02:28.040> 2.8<00:02:31.540> seems<00:02:32.540> like

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
that f 35 millimeters 2.8 seems like

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.220 
that f 35 millimeters 2.8 seems like
everything<00:02:33.200> retained<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.860> sharpness<00:02:35.230> looks

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
everything retained the sharpness looks

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.920 
everything retained the sharpness looks
good<00:02:36.470> looks<00:02:37.010> great<00:02:37.840> we<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:38.989> some<00:02:39.110> more

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
good looks great we get some more

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.020 
good looks great we get some more
real-life<00:02:41.930> footage<00:02:42.790> 35<00:02:43.790> millimeters<00:02:46.030> and

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
real-life footage 35 millimeters and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.690 
real-life footage 35 millimeters and
like<00:02:47.239> my<00:02:47.360> San<00:02:47.540> okay

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.940 

so<00:02:53.300> it<00:02:53.420> looks<00:02:53.480> pretty<00:02:53.930> sharp<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.530> second

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
so it looks pretty sharp the second

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.490 
so it looks pretty sharp the second
version<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.370> filter<00:02:55.670> works<00:02:55.790> well<00:02:56.500> anyway

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
version of this filter works well anyway

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.990 
version of this filter works well anyway
let's<00:02:58.400> shift<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.540> 50<00:03:00.379> millimeters<00:03:01.000> so

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
let's shift it to 50 millimeters so

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.030 
let's shift it to 50 millimeters so
again<00:03:02.330> this<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.629> 50<00:03:02.930> millimeter<00:03:03.349> with<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.650> 24

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
again this is 50 millimeter with the 24

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.270 
again this is 50 millimeter with the 24
to<00:03:04.129> 70<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:05.230> let<00:03:06.230> me<00:03:06.319> reset<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.800> filter<00:03:07.069> all

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
to 70 and let me reset the filter all

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.780 
to 70 and let me reset the filter all
the<00:03:07.370> way<00:03:07.430> back<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:09.260> minimum<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:10.730> is

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
the way back to minimum so this is

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.430 
the way back to minimum so this is
minimum<00:03:11.920> first<00:03:12.920> stop<00:03:13.450> second<00:03:14.450> stop<00:03:14.630> third

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
minimum first stop second stop third

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.199 
minimum first stop second stop third
stop<00:03:15.800> or<00:03:16.580> stop<00:03:16.910> fits<00:03:17.660> top<00:03:17.930> six<00:03:18.799> top<00:03:19.040> seven<00:03:19.970> stop

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.240 
stop or stop fits top six top seven stop
aight<00:03:20.690> stop<00:03:21.110> nine<00:03:21.920> stop<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.400> max<00:03:23.030> so

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
aight stop nine stop and max so

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.530 
aight stop nine stop and max so
effectively<00:03:25.250> blocking<00:03:25.549> all<00:03:25.760> that<00:03:25.940> light<00:03:26.090> let

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
effectively blocking all that light let

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.800 
effectively blocking all that light let
me<00:03:26.630> reset<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.049> its<00:03:27.290> proper<00:03:28.360> exposure<00:03:29.360> level

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
me reset it to its proper exposure level

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.509 
me reset it to its proper exposure level
and<00:03:30.019> then<00:03:30.410> get<00:03:30.739> it<00:03:30.829> manual<00:03:31.220> focused<00:03:33.430> widen<00:03:34.430> it

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
and then get it manual focused widen it

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.059 
and then get it manual focused widen it
up<00:03:34.610> just<00:03:34.849> a<00:03:35.000> little<00:03:35.180> bit<00:03:35.299> more<00:03:36.040> alright<00:03:37.040> and

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
up just a little bit more alright and

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.479 
up just a little bit more alright and
there<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.340> have<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.579> so<00:03:38.510> this<00:03:38.690> is<00:03:39.489> properly

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
there you have it so this is properly

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.729 
there you have it so this is properly
exposed<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.829> guess<00:03:42.829> on<00:03:42.950> my<00:03:42.980> LCD<00:03:43.489> looks<00:03:43.970> good<00:03:44.739> so

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
exposed I guess on my LCD looks good so

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.140 
exposed I guess on my LCD looks good so

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.319 
decent what else do i want to say i
can't<00:03:57.709> really<00:03:58.220> see<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.430> sky<00:03:58.730> because<00:03:58.970> it's

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
can't really see the sky because it's

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.770 
can't really see the sky because it's
high<00:03:59.480> noon<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.549> can't<00:04:01.819> exactly<00:04:02.299> capture

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
high noon so it can't exactly capture

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.680 
high noon so it can't exactly capture
that<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.170> lastly<00:04:03.739> let<00:04:03.950> me<00:04:04.040> move<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.690> 70

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
that and lastly let me move to 70

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.170 
that and lastly let me move to 70
millimeter<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:07.160> let<00:04:07.250> me<00:04:07.310> go<00:04:07.579> ahead<00:04:07.609> and<00:04:07.760> reset

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
millimeter so let me go ahead and reset

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.520 
millimeter so let me go ahead and reset
this<00:04:08.299> one<00:04:08.480> more<00:04:08.630> time<00:04:08.750> it's<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:09.769> minimum<00:04:11.530> for

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
this one more time it's that minimum for

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.340 
this one more time it's that minimum for
the<00:04:12.620> fader<00:04:12.829> filter<00:04:13.220> when<00:04:13.850> you<00:04:13.940> focus<00:04:14.150> this<00:04:14.480> so

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
the fader filter when you focus this so

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.229 
the fader filter when you focus this so
this<00:04:15.560> is<00:04:15.590> minimum<00:04:16.010> opening<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.669> here<00:04:16.970> you<00:04:17.120> go

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
this is minimum opening and here you go

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.920 
this is minimum opening and here you go

stop<00:04:26.620> seven<00:04:27.620> stops<00:04:27.800> sorry<00:04:28.150> 80<00:04:29.150> now<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.720> was

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
stop seven stops sorry 80 now I was

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.320 
stop seven stops sorry 80 now I was
right<00:04:30.110> nine<00:04:30.380> stop<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:31.160> course<00:04:31.340> 10<00:04:31.760> so<00:04:32.090> this

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
right nine stop and of course 10 so this

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.629 
right nine stop and of course 10 so this
is<00:04:32.360> effectively<00:04:33.020> blocking<00:04:33.410> light<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:34.400> let<00:04:34.550> me

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
is effectively blocking light so let me

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.040 
is effectively blocking light so let me
get<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:34.880> proper<00:04:35.150> exposure<00:04:35.419> one<00:04:35.720> more<00:04:35.840> time

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
get the proper exposure one more time

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.350 
get the proper exposure one more time
and<00:04:37.150> then<00:04:38.150> just<00:04:38.539> focus<00:04:39.880> again<00:04:40.880> I<00:04:41.060> don't<00:04:41.210> see

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
and then just focus again I don't see

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.980 
and then just focus again I don't see
any<00:04:41.479> hits<00:04:41.660> in<00:04:41.870> image<00:04:42.289> quality<00:04:43.240> sharpness<00:04:44.240> so

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
any hits in image quality sharpness so

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.870 
any hits in image quality sharpness so
this<00:04:45.590> version<00:04:46.490> 2<00:04:46.700> seems<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:47.660> be<00:04:47.780> pretty<00:04:48.080> decent

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
this version 2 seems to be pretty decent

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.790 
this version 2 seems to be pretty decent
one<00:04:49.880> caveat<00:04:50.240> about<00:04:50.570> this<00:04:50.900> is<00:04:51.110> that<00:04:51.169> you<00:04:51.380> can't

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
one caveat about this is that you can't

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.260 
one caveat about this is that you can't
use<00:04:52.039> the<00:04:52.220> lens<00:04:52.430> hood<00:04:52.639> while<00:04:52.820> you're<00:04:53.030> filming

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
use the lens hood while you're filming

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.159 
use the lens hood while you're filming
so<00:04:54.169> make<00:04:54.590> sure<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.800> be<00:04:55.220> aware<00:04:55.460> of<00:04:55.520> this<00:04:56.169> because

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
so make sure to be aware of this because

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.659
