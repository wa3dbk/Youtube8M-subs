as<00:00:04.490> you<00:00:05.450> can<00:00:05.540> see<00:00:05.689> this<00:00:05.810> Crossing<00:00:06.200> is<00:00:06.319> a

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029 
as you can see this Crossing is a

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.750 
as you can see this Crossing is a
activated<00:00:08.029> very<00:00:08.889> hide<00:00:09.889> for<00:00:10.219> some<00:00:10.340> reason<00:00:10.639> I

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
activated very hide for some reason I

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.390 
activated very hide for some reason I
don't<00:00:10.910> know<00:00:11.090> why<00:00:14.769> look<00:00:15.769> at<00:00:15.860> the<00:00:15.980> battery<00:00:16.309> is

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
don't know why look at the battery is

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.650 
don't know why look at the battery is
like<00:00:16.610> dead<00:00:16.759> or<00:00:16.790> something<00:00:17.060> if<00:00:17.240> it<00:00:17.330> even<00:00:17.450> has<00:00:17.630> a

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
like dead or something if it even has a

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.710 
like dead or something if it even has a
battery<00:00:18.020> I'm<00:00:18.110> not<00:00:18.230> sure<00:00:18.439> could<00:00:19.510> this<00:00:20.510> is<00:00:20.689> a

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
battery I'm not sure could this is a

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.689 
battery I'm not sure could this is a
private<00:00:21.170> line<00:00:21.350> it's<00:00:21.650> not<00:00:21.710> maintained<00:00:22.519> by<00:00:22.640> the

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
private line it's not maintained by the

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.170 
private line it's not maintained by the
railroad<00:00:23.029> got<00:00:23.810> a<00:00:23.840> contractor<00:00:24.650> to<00:00:24.769> do<00:00:24.890> it<00:00:25.090> and<00:00:26.090> I

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
railroad got a contractor to do it and I

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.939 
railroad got a contractor to do it and I
have<00:00:26.300> no<00:00:26.420> idea<00:00:26.449> who<00:00:26.840> to<00:00:26.869> call<00:00:27.109> to<00:00:27.170> get<00:00:27.619> it<00:00:27.740> fixed

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
have no idea who to call to get it fixed

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.189 
have no idea who to call to get it fixed
so<00:00:30.429> the<00:00:31.429> bells<00:00:31.609> aren't<00:00:31.820> ringing<00:00:31.880> either<00:00:32.199> so

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
so the bells aren't ringing either so

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:44.279 
so the bells aren't ringing either so
there's<00:00:33.320> a<00:00:33.350> little<00:00:33.530> power<00:00:33.650> for<00:00:33.980> some<00:00:34.129> reason

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.180 

came<00:00:45.289> out<00:00:45.410> on<00:00:45.469> the<00:00:45.530> other<00:00:45.649> side<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:45.829> the<00:00:45.949> street

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
came out on the other side of the street

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.119 
came out on the other side of the street
here<00:00:46.399> I<00:00:47.260> think<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.379> reason<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:48.829> the

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
here I think the reason that the

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.799 
here I think the reason that the
crossing<00:00:49.550> might<00:00:49.670> be<00:00:49.790> doing<00:00:50.000> this<00:00:50.149> is<00:00:50.390> because

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
crossing might be doing this is because

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.720 
crossing might be doing this is because
of<00:00:51.110> all<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.940> standing<00:00:53.300> water<00:00:53.570> over<00:00:53.870> here<00:00:54.730> then

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
of all the standing water over here then

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.009 
of all the standing water over here then
again<00:00:55.820> I'm<00:00:56.000> not<00:00:56.030> too<00:00:56.239> sure<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.449> this<00:00:56.600> crossing

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
again I'm not too sure of this crossing

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.389 
again I'm not too sure of this crossing
has<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.199> circuit<00:00:57.649> on<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.800> track<00:00:58.010> or<00:00:58.160> not<00:00:58.219> if

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
has a circuit on the track or not if

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.829 
has a circuit on the track or not if
it's<00:00:58.550> manually<00:00:58.969> controlling<00:00:59.300> that<00:00:59.510> shooter

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
it's manually controlling that shooter

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:14.399 
it's manually controlling that shooter
all<00:01:00.559> this<00:01:00.769> water<00:01:02.199> standing<00:01:03.199> water<00:01:03.379> is<00:01:03.589> no<00:01:03.710> good

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.109 

you<00:01:14.890> can<00:01:15.039> see<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:15.249> roadway<00:01:15.549> isn't<00:01:15.850> too<00:01:15.939> good

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
you can see the roadway isn't too good

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:35.240 
you can see the roadway isn't too good
either

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:47.289 

see

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.720 

again<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.079> lights<00:01:48.259> are<00:01:48.409> very<00:01:48.680> dim

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.070 

no<00:01:52.330> bells<00:01:53.880> down<00:01:54.880> there's<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.420> other<00:01:55.540> crossing

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
no bells down there's the other crossing

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.480 
no bells down there's the other crossing
where<00:01:56.230> the<00:01:56.320> train<00:01:56.530> derailed<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.130> one<00:01:57.280> time

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
where the train derailed that one time

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.810 
where the train derailed that one time
but<00:01:57.850> year<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.480> half<00:01:58.660> ago
