00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.090
 we are with this that is the 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.040
 youtube application who says that today 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.769
 May 6 I just realized that the 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.120
 application no longer shows videos of 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.720
 our subscriptions or videos that 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.910
 have been uploaded 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.430
 good as you see here we are in what is 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.020
 what would come being unfolds us 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.510
 all videos that have been uploaded and not 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.760
 we see nothing but the sign or the 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.220
 video of the warning that youtube is going to 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.590
 turn things off that you can not see 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.570
 warned from April 20 as 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.250
 we are seeing here and it is going to be in fact 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.920
 we will not be able to download from the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.690
 January 28 but those who were 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.780
 downloaded as they were going to continue using the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.930
 in fact until yesterday it seems to me yesterday 5 of 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.290
 May we could continue using it but 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.720
 Now we 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.100
 let's say we enter into some subscription 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.190
 as we see nothing appears on what 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.020
 is videos uploaded but in activity if 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.660
 we will appear even we will be able to 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.960
 upload some videos as you see here the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.940
 gameplay this 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.369
 and the truth is that I do not know if I'm going to go 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.430
 dying little by little if this is the 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.130
 principle if they are going to cut it from a 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.770
 chop do not go from tomorrow or 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.170
 even see these videos is not it 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.880
 the best as I say dying little to 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.159
 little and until the end do not let us in 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.940
 to the servers thing that happened with the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.680
 facebook application 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.380
 and the truth is that I had not commented 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.790
 none of this because it gives me a little 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.010
 I do not say the same 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.770
 what was the navigation and the application 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.490
 I did not like it so much, I did not feel it a bit 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.890
 rough a little robust 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.360
 it was not as friendly as the application 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.880
 on cell phones 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.500
 so I always preferred to see a 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.939
 video from the cell phone apart that many 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.860
 videos were not compatible with the 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.570
 youtube application of feet vita no 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.220
 so that's why more than anything I had 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.860
 commented nothing I just used this 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.210
 application when it was truly 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.560
 I needed to use it when I had that place 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.689
 charged when I was away from the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.049
 computer but I understand that there 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.630
 people or children that are better do not have 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.979
 cellular or they do not have the computer to 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.709
 the hand and well they are easy 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.590
 use the application thing that still 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.880
 we have the youtube browser and always 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.620
 we will have good browser 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.680
 internet and there we can open the page 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.560
 of youtube not the mobile 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.890
 mobile site and then nothing the truth 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.380
 is that I do not do it 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.730
 a very hard decision that there 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.350
 removed because as I say almost not what 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.600
 used but you down here can 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.000
 tell me what you think they have 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.950
 retired this application I more than anything 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.430
 I had it saved, see that there it was 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.930
 saved then the truth is that 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.760
 I do not suffer much with having been removed 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.900
 this application and gentlemen that has been 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.760
 all for today's video I hope that you 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.170
 have liked you already know here below I defined 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.980
 your comments and see you in the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.980
 next see you later
