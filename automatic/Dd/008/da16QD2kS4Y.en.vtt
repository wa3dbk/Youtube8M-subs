this in vanilla minecraft

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.800 
this in vanilla minecraft
and<00:06:04.700> my<00:06:04.880> should<00:06:05.150> feed<00:06:05.360> him<00:06:05.479> because<00:06:05.660> he's<00:06:05.780> a

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
and my should feed him because he's a

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.600 
and my should feed him because he's a
pretty<00:06:06.229> damn<00:06:06.500> tough<00:06:06.740> boss<00:06:07.010> I've<00:06:07.160> got<00:06:07.190> to<00:06:07.430> say<00:06:07.580> I

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
pretty damn tough boss I've got to say I

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.610 
pretty damn tough boss I've got to say I
think<00:06:07.820> that<00:06:08.000> you<00:06:08.120> probably<00:06:08.180> do<00:06:08.930> deserve<00:06:09.410> those

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
think that you probably do deserve those

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.050 
think that you probably do deserve those
rewards<00:06:10.100> so<00:06:10.520> I<00:06:10.550> think<00:06:10.669> that's<00:06:10.880> pretty

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
rewards so I think that's pretty

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.490 
rewards so I think that's pretty
balanced<00:06:11.539> and<00:06:11.660> stuff<00:06:11.870> I<00:06:11.990> think<00:06:12.020> it's<00:06:12.320> really

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
balanced and stuff I think it's really

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.409 
balanced and stuff I think it's really
