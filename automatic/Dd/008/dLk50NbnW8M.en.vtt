like<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.470> all<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.130> not<00:00:26.189> from

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
like it all this is that it's not from

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.560 
like it all this is that it's not from
both<00:00:26.730> sides<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.289> if<00:00:28.439> i<00:00:28.740> press<00:00:28.949> f5<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.730> it's

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
both sides so if i press f5 here it's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.849

a<00:01:21.689> Christmas<00:01:21.990> tree<00:01:22.140> from<00:01:22.229> both<00:01:22.470> side<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.369> even

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
a Christmas tree from both side it even

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.760 
a Christmas tree from both side it even
has<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.880> little<00:01:24.210> cross<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.170> top<00:01:25.200> that

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
has like a little cross on the top that

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530 
has like a little cross on the top that
some<00:01:26.430> people<00:01:26.670> put<00:01:26.850> down<00:01:27.000> their<00:01:27.150> Christmas

some people put down their Christmas

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.530 
some people put down their Christmas
trees<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.189> his<00:01:29.400> feet<00:01:29.790> are<00:01:30.030> basically

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
trees and I think his feet are basically

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.149 
trees and I think his feet are basically
a<00:01:30.630> failed<00:01:30.990> present<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.040> what

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
a failed present I think that's what

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.590 
a failed present I think that's what
they<00:01:32.220> were<00:01:32.280> supposed<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.060> don't<00:01:33.479> know<00:01:33.540> if

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
they were supposed to be I don't know if

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.050 
they were supposed to be I don't know if
they'd<00:01:33.720> assigned<00:01:34.140> out<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.829> box<00:01:35.579> when<00:01:35.970> they

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
they'd assigned out of the box when they

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.460 
they'd assigned out of the box when they
were<00:01:36.150> making<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> skin<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:36.960> something<00:01:37.320> or

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
were making the skin or something or

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.690 
were making the skin or something or
maybe<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.920> fire<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.369> I'm<00:01:38.490> completely

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
maybe it's on fire and I'm completely

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.999 
maybe it's on fire and I'm completely
wrong<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.530> supposed<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> be

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
wrong but I think that supposed to be

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.700 
wrong but I think that supposed to be
