and up a little bit so when I take that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.330 
and up a little bit so when I take that
into<00:02:24.960> consideration<00:02:24.990> if<00:02:25.830> enemies<00:02:26.190> are

can<00:04:07.400> just<00:04:07.430> get<00:04:07.670> over<00:04:07.970> some<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.330> few

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
can just get over some of the few

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.650 
can just get over some of the few
shortcomings<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.349> oddities<00:04:09.650> with<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.540> like<00:04:11.540> I

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
shortcomings and oddities with it like I

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.509 
shortcomings and oddities with it like I
said<00:04:11.720> with<00:04:12.080> those<00:04:12.349> one<00:04:12.920> of<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.069> things<00:04:13.340> is

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
said with those one of the things is

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.250 
said with those one of the things is
that<00:04:13.580> the<00:04:13.819> reload<00:04:14.090> time<00:04:14.120> is<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.780> little<00:04:15.170> bit

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
that the reload time is a little bit

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.039 
that the reload time is a little bit
slow<00:04:15.590> on<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:16.329> but<00:04:17.329> you<00:04:17.660> know<00:04:17.750> you<00:04:17.810> don't<00:04:17.959> have

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
slow on it but you know you don't have

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.960 
slow on it but you know you don't have
to<00:04:18.229> necessarily<00:04:18.320> worry<00:04:19.010> about<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.370> ammo<00:04:19.700> and

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
to necessarily worry about the ammo and

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.000 
to necessarily worry about the ammo and
you<00:04:20.660> know<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.900> ammo<00:04:21.109> count<00:04:21.290> does<00:04:21.590> help<00:04:21.889> with

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
you know the ammo count does help with

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.990 
you know the ammo count does help with
that<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.220> little<00:04:22.400> bit<00:04:24.460> also<00:04:25.460> if<00:04:25.669> you<00:04:25.790> can<00:04:25.970> just

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
that a little bit also if you can just

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.940 
that a little bit also if you can just
get<00:04:26.240> used<00:04:26.419> to<00:04:26.690> you<00:04:27.229> know<00:04:27.350> when<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.800> lay<00:04:27.919> down

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
get used to you know when you lay down

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.170 
get used to you know when you lay down
the<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:29.660> fire<00:04:30.010> if<00:04:31.010> you<00:04:31.430> just<00:04:31.729> you<00:04:31.940> know<00:04:32.030> lay

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
the the fire if you just you know lay

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.100 
the the fire if you just you know lay
down<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.660> trigger<00:04:33.729> if<00:04:34.729> you<00:04:34.910> get<00:04:35.090> used<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:35.870> its

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
down the trigger if you get used to its

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.390 
down the trigger if you get used to its
quirky<00:04:36.850> you<00:04:37.850> know<00:04:37.970> recoil<00:04:39.070> like<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.160> said<00:04:40.220> it

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
quirky you know recoil like I said it

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.570 
quirky you know recoil like I said it
goes<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.789> the<00:04:40.820> right<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.330> up<00:04:41.630> so<00:04:42.620> if<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.460> just

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
goes to the right and up so if you just

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.550 
goes to the right and up so if you just
maintain<00:04:44.270> with<00:04:44.479> that<00:04:44.660> you<00:04:44.840> should<00:04:44.990> be<00:04:45.110> fine<00:04:45.350> of

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
maintain with that you should be fine of

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.170 
maintain with that you should be fine of
course<00:04:45.590> at<00:04:45.949> longer<00:04:46.220> distances<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:47.000> don't

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
course at longer distances you don't

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.629 
course at longer distances you don't
want<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.590> lay<00:04:48.590> down<00:04:48.620> on<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.010> trigger<00:04:49.280> finger

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
want to lay down on the trigger finger

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.390 
want to lay down on the trigger finger
you<00:04:49.850> kind<00:04:50.030> of<00:04:50.090> just<00:04:50.240> want<00:04:50.450> to<00:04:50.539> do<00:04:51.080> burst<00:04:52.070> shots

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
you kind of just want to do burst shots

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.760 
you kind of just want to do burst shots
and<00:04:52.669> the<00:04:53.000> best<00:04:53.210> way<00:04:53.450> I've<00:04:53.690> seen<00:04:54.260> it<00:04:54.470> with<00:04:54.620> this

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
and the best way I've seen it with this

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.400 
and the best way I've seen it with this
gun<00:04:55.039> is<00:04:55.070> just<00:04:55.400> by<00:04:55.520> doing<00:04:55.580> single<00:04:56.000> shop<00:04:56.410> you

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
gun is just by doing single shop you

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.460 
gun is just by doing single shop you
know<00:04:57.530> range<00:04:58.130> shots<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:59.570> recoil<00:04:59.960> with<00:05:00.229> this

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
know range shots the recoil with this

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.510 
know range shots the recoil with this
AAG<00:05:00.830> for<00:05:01.760> me<00:05:01.880> doesn't<00:05:02.180> seem<00:05:02.419> too<00:05:02.660> bad<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:04.400> know

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
AAG for me doesn't seem too bad you know

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.580 
AAG for me doesn't seem too bad you know
maintaining<00:05:04.940> hipfire<00:05:05.539> accuracy<00:05:05.930> seems<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.500> be

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
maintaining hipfire accuracy seems to be

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.400 
maintaining hipfire accuracy seems to be
relatively<00:05:06.919> easy<00:05:07.360> from<00:05:08.360> closer<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.990> medium

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
relatively easy from closer to medium

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.310 
relatively easy from closer to medium
ranges<00:05:10.360> closer<00:05:11.360> ranges<00:05:11.720> you<00:05:11.900> can<00:05:12.020> just<00:05:12.200> lay

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
ranges closer ranges you can just lay

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.830 
ranges closer ranges you can just lay
down<00:05:12.349> on<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.740> trigger<00:05:13.010> but<00:05:13.460> at<00:05:14.060> medium<00:05:14.450> ranges

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
down on the trigger but at medium ranges

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.379 
down on the trigger but at medium ranges
you<00:05:14.990> kind<00:05:15.200> of<00:05:15.229> want<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.470> be<00:05:15.560> birth<00:05:15.770> shots<00:05:16.389> but

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
you kind of want to be birth shots but

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.810 
you kind of want to be birth shots but
one<00:05:17.599> of<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.780> things<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:18.200> the<00:05:18.800> m16<00:05:19.460> goers

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
one of the things that the m16 goers

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.370 
one of the things that the m16 goers
might<00:05:20.030> like<00:05:20.180> with<00:05:20.330> this<00:05:20.479> gun<00:05:20.630> yet<00:05:20.870> again<00:05:21.139> like

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
might like with this gun yet again like

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.879 
might like with this gun yet again like
I<00:05:21.500> said<00:05:21.530> it<00:05:21.860> has<00:05:22.039> a<00:05:22.070> similar<00:05:22.639> iron<00:05:23.450> sight<00:05:23.889> so

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
I said it has a similar iron sight so

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.290 
I said it has a similar iron sight so
for<00:05:25.250> those<00:05:25.340> of<00:05:25.400> you<00:05:25.639> that<00:05:25.760> are<00:05:25.880> looking<00:05:26.090> for<00:05:26.270> a

for those of you that are looking for a

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
more automatic solution to the m16 but

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:30.879 
more automatic solution to the m16 but
keep<00:05:29.570> in<00:05:29.690> mind<00:05:29.720> it<00:05:30.080> does<00:05:30.229> a<00:05:30.260> little<00:05:30.590> bit<00:05:30.710> less

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
keep in mind it does a little bit less

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.610 
keep in mind it does a little bit less
damage<00:05:31.400> um<00:05:31.720> you<00:05:32.720> know<00:05:32.810> this<00:05:32.990> would<00:05:33.169> be<00:05:33.289> your

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
damage um you know this would be your

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.190 
damage um you know this would be your
gun<00:05:34.220> here

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
gun here

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.380 
gun here
of<00:05:36.190> course<00:05:36.460> if<00:05:36.610> you<00:05:36.700> get<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:36.940> holo<00:05:37.150> sight

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
of course if you get the holo sight

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.720 
of course if you get the holo sight
version<00:05:37.840> of<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.140> OGG<00:05:38.340> you<00:05:39.340> get<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.490> different

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
version of the OGG you get a different

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.430 
version of the OGG you get a different
field<00:05:40.180> of<00:05:40.360> view<00:05:40.480> when<00:05:40.660> you<00:05:40.750> aim<00:05:40.900> down<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:41.110> site

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
field of view when you aim down the site

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.410 
field of view when you aim down the site
because<00:05:41.950> of<00:05:42.160> the<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:42.640> holo<00:05:42.820> sight<00:05:43.090> that's

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
because of the the holo sight that's

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.550 
because of the the holo sight that's
being<00:05:43.690> used<00:05:44.700> so<00:05:45.810> that's<00:05:46.810> really<00:05:47.140> a<00:05:47.170> matter<00:05:47.410> of

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
being used so that's really a matter of

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.810 
being used so that's really a matter of
preference<00:05:47.920> if<00:05:48.250> you<00:05:48.310> just<00:05:48.490> want<00:05:48.640> a<00:05:48.670> different

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
preference if you just want a different

preference if you just want a different
looking<00:05:49.150> site<00:05:49.450> and<00:05:49.720> if<00:05:49.810> you<00:05:49.960> do<00:05:50.290> not<00:05:50.440> like<00:05:50.680> the

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
looking site and if you do not like the

looking site and if you do not like the
fact<00:05:51.070> that<00:05:51.190> it<00:05:51.400> looks<00:05:51.610> very<00:05:51.910> similar<00:05:52.090> to<00:05:52.270> the

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
fact that it looks very similar to the

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.570 
fact that it looks very similar to the
m16<00:05:53.050> iron<00:05:53.320> sight<00:05:53.620> you<00:05:54.040> can<00:05:54.160> always<00:05:54.400> buy<00:05:54.550> the

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
m16 iron sight you can always buy the
