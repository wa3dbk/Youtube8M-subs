00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
that off i just got this image against

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.060 
that off i just got this image against
the<00:01:50.990> background<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.619> that's<00:01:52.740> okay<00:01:53.040> i

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the background here and that's okay i

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.319 
the background here and that's okay i
should<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.399> went<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.759> cleaned<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.119> up

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
saturation now I'm going to turn around

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.690 
saturation now I'm going to turn around
and<00:02:01.380> hit<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.799> with<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.070> hundred<00:02:02.460> percent

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
and hit this with a hundred percent

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.969 
and hit this with a hundred percent
saturation<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.140> really<00:02:04.469> blow<00:02:04.799> out

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
saturation it's going to really blow out

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.770 
saturation it's going to really blow out
everything<00:02:05.460> over<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.270> that's<00:02:06.540> kind<00:02:06.750> of

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
mask on i'm going to grab a regular

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.070 
mask on i'm going to grab a regular
brush<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.510> see<00:02:12.750> my

hush<00:02:13.170> now<00:02:13.410> I'm<00:02:13.860> at<00:02:13.980> fourteen<00:02:14.460> percent<00:02:14.640> we

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
hush now I'm at fourteen percent we

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.880 
hush now I'm at fourteen percent we
could<00:02:15.210> increase<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.140> little<00:02:16.530> bit<00:02:16.620> not<00:02:16.860> too

could increase that a little bit not too
much<00:02:17.100> probably<00:02:17.550> about<00:02:17.790> twenty<00:02:18.120> four<00:02:18.330> percent

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
much probably about twenty four percent

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
just going to change that layer mode

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.300 
just going to change that layer mode
from<00:02:53.580> normal<00:02:53.640> down<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.690> multiply<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.530> we're

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
from normal down to multiply and we're

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.070 
from normal down to multiply and we're
going<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.520> do<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.790> excuse<00:02:57.360> me<00:02:57.480> normal<00:02:57.930> down

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
going to do this excuse me normal down

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.110 
going to do this excuse me normal down
to<00:02:58.230> multiply<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.920> now<00:02:59.490> we're<00:02:59.730> going<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.880> just

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
to multiply and now we're going to just

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.540 
to multiply and now we're going to just
take<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.480> opacity<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.800> reduce<00:03:02.250> that

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
take the opacity of this and reduce that

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.030 
take the opacity of this and reduce that
and<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.360> kind<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.750> bring<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.080> back<00:03:04.560> up<00:03:04.860> now

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
and just kind of bring that back up now
