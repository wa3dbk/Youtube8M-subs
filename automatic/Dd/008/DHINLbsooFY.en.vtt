00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
bears I will put my LED on see our gimme

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.469 
bears I will put my LED on see our gimme
if<00:01:24.750> we're<00:01:25.290> losing<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.740> my<00:01:26.189> responsibility

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
if we're losing it my responsibility

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.420 
if we're losing it my responsibility
much<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> US<00:01:28.170> side<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.740> our<00:01:29.009> gimme

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
much like the US side is our gimme

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.120 
much like the US side is our gimme
primarily<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.900> map<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.200> more<00:01:31.710> important<00:01:32.100> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
primarily this map is more important to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.740 
primarily this map is more important to
control<00:01:32.369> your<00:01:32.549> gimme<00:01:32.790> than<00:01:33.060> anything<00:01:33.600> else

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
control your gimme than anything else

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.149 
control your gimme than anything else
because<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.320> camped<00:01:34.650> off<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.920> map

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
because if you get camped off this map

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.690 
because if you get camped off this map
you<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.290> getting<00:01:37.290> back<00:01:37.439> out<00:01:37.710> much<00:01:38.490> like

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
you are not getting back out much like

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.230 
you are not getting back out much like
saying<00:01:39.119> at<00:01:39.390> metro<00:01:40.290> okay<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.759> important

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
saying at metro okay so it is important

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.510 
saying at metro okay so it is important
to<00:01:42.299> hold<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.530> US<00:01:43.770> map<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.159> showed<00:01:44.189> you
