00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.849
 what happens if you take a random game with 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.220
 older consoles throw on portable 

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:11.700
 I do not think about what will happen in the end with you 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.559
 crash 47 and today reviewing borderlands 2 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.429
 versions for ps vita 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.429
 go 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.120
 so we are considering a sequel unexpectedly 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.970
 succeeded project birth 2009 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.800
 we have a border i have a funny rbg mix 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.290
 first person cooperative shooter 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.450
 in a natural way shot having collected not 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.400
 a small community of fans at the game is not 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.410
 there was a plot as such there was only 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.000
 the four main characters are some kind of refuge on 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.370
 dried planet pandora 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.010
 legends said that the refuge is melting 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.350
 untold riches and ancient secrets on 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.370
 in fact it all turned out to be idle chatter 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.440
 and ended the game pretty sorry 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.690
 then the next discovery occurred 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.240
 shelter provoked the occurrence on 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.160
 the entire planet of a valuable resource and mind 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.020
 which is more precious than gold on pandora 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.600
 corporation hyperion invaded under 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.400
 led by handsome jack jack 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.020
 intends to open another even more 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.940
 secret refuge and with the help of it 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.890
 content wipe all living things off your face 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.320
 planets but surviving hunters 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.070
 treasures organized resistance to 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.450
 he is beaten by four new heroes 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.000
 like last time to choose from you 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.320
 the four main classes are tank siren 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.360
 assassins team 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.399
 everything is clear from the names the tank has 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.530
 good health and can wear two 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.660
 guns immediately siren uses magic 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.750
 the assassin prefers to kill quietly and 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.550
 fast team standard team also 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.090
 there are two additional downloads 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.069
 class what is the gameplay us 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.380
 granted a bunch of quests sometimes 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.289
 funny sometimes quite boring almost 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.830
 always it comes down to go there kill 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.140
 Togo 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.539
 but oddly enough it kills here very much 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.060
 fun is the formula for serious sam 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.039
 you have a lot of opponents running 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.020
 move fast and do not yawn 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.390
 for killing and completing quests we 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.080
 get experience and gradually increase 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.330
 your level 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.479
 like any rpg every class has 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.240
 your skill tree from your level 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.980
 access depends more powerful cannon guns 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.870
 like the rest of it is completely alive 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.090
 random random game 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.010
 generates a weapon creating it from 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.810
 various kinds of combinations of sights 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.640
 ammunition color cases 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.459
 characteristics in such a simple way 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.380
 the game holds a wealth of opinions 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.170
 agro hirino and weapons quantities 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.570
 the world of pandora is beautiful varied and 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.730
 huge it is divided into several locations 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.460
 however, without quests he especially do 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.350
 nothing moisture and plenty of dialogue 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.210
 always full of black humor and satire 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.580
 which does not understand those who do not own 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.410
 English and the most interesting thing 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.570
 version for ps vita saved all 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.450
 the above but had to go on 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.620
 certain sacrifices 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.540
 graphic performance is noticeable 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.220
 worsened though not lethal 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.740
 frames per second a cut 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.540
 half that killing part of the fun 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.090
 the reason for this is the time between shots 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.950
 hitting too big and get on 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.650
 fast moving side in arm almost 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.200
 impossible cooperative which so 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.730
 The older version was also famous. 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.880
 now you can only play with one 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.320
 friend and it's also very sad worth 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.000
 do talk about how many problems 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.950
 delivers connection to someone else's game 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.110
 the number of opponents has decreased 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.240
 somewhere around one fifth now they just 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.310
 explode without leaving corpses to the game 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.170
 was going more stable we will not forget about 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.710
 periodic departures of the game on an even 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.590
 place of gods and graphic artifacts in 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.930
 in general I will tell you the following at this port 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.940
 there are a lot of problems but 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.280
 no less most of them are solved already 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.080
 Announced the second update of course 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.780
 it was wrong to release so raw 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.550
 product but I was more or less satisfied 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.980
 the end result and got a lot 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.120
 positive emotions in borderlands 2 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.580
 play fun 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.560
 really fun i can with clean 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.200
 heart to say that if you were waiting for this 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.060
 the game do not hesitate and purchase those 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.140
 less this is the worst version of all my 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.060
 score 70 out of 10 and you had a crash 47 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.459
 after two months of dead silence 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.050
 I had personal reasons for a break 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.450
 whom I informed my VKontakte group 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.370
 but now I hope I can resume 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.530
 standard review schedule 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.120
 I invite you to the already mentioned crumbs 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.640
 the link to which is in the description 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.160
 I also want to express my gratitude for 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.590
 self- provided coupe of the game I am 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.210
 have long supported myself and plan 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.160
 continue data mutually beneficial 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.160
 cooperation all bye
