despite having a 1.2 gigahertz process
so<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.990> interface<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.710> device<00:01:29.070> isn't

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
so the interface of the device isn't

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.100 
so the interface of the device isn't
really<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> smoothest<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.810> seen

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
apps crash on us quite frequently so the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.609 
apps crash on us quite frequently so the
device<00:01:44.670> also<00:01:44.939> boasts<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.570> 1080p<00:01:46.350> video
