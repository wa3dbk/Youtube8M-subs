00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
make sure this gets really hot because

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.300 
make sure this gets really hot because
the<00:01:24.420> heat<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.780> what<00:01:25.020> activates<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.100> color

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
meaning where the color hits it doesn't

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.230 
meaning where the color hits it doesn't
get<00:01:28.440> hot<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.800> we're<00:01:28.920> not<00:01:29.070> staying<00:01:29.369> again

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
get hot and we're not staying again

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.520 
get hot and we're not staying again
that's<00:01:30.420> what<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.630> heat<00:01:30.780> shield<00:01:31.050> is<00:01:31.170> fine<00:01:31.380> I'll

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that's what the heat shield is fine I'll

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.810 
that's what the heat shield is fine I'll
make<00:01:31.649> sure<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> steam<00:01:32.100> doesn't<00:01:32.280> come<00:01:32.550> up<00:01:32.640> and
