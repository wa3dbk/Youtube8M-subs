00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.650
 arrive also through I read here is not one 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.010
 base advises to proceed 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.410
 I read simulates the head of the pac e 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.200
 touring 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.380
 because it would really be represented 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.230
 step course for the one green for zero e 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:37.510
 when they are all turned off for nothing e 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:40.770
 arduino simulates how one would behave 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.960
 turing machine then the algorithm 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.320
 that even cover the algorithm that 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 runs 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.090
 so now he is reading the values sta 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.970
 reading red green based on 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.340
 that really changes 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:16.290
 his program written inside 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:20.370
 there is the arduino of taste and rules 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.020
 gorino and hello arduino inside we say one 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.860
 specific turing machine that sees i 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.270
 his and you should change it you should 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:37.430
 change the arduino code like 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:39.660
 I used to call the arduino code 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.760
 it contains a car and touring 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:48.740
 with the various states the reading of the leds and 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:51.950
 arduino receives from rcx what 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.780
 was presented with a red led for the in 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.119
 based on this changes the color 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.049
 ok and receive passes through the 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:03.560
 just tower communication yes 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.439
 is managed by a program written in 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.880
 more yes review use of bees by 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:16.220
 windows to connect via usb to 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:21.940
 street tower paragraph then goes on bridge 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.930
 computer between arduino correct and ok 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:33.190
 you can also show program which 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:37.489
 you did this lesson here 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.799
 incipio more than the turing machine e 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.060
 this case prints 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:47.599
 hello and those on specific rules 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.410
 on the rules it is possible to see it 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:54.099
 and on the other hand the online version e 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.099
 javascript 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:10.040
 here too we can insert in the 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:13.200
 console our commands load ok 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.750
 sun to leave 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.269
 in practice the sequences of the simulation are simulated 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.959
 turing machine 15 writes the head 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.930
 that coloring of red 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.830
 sign up for the string of things 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.830
 command we 've been through 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:36.050
 ok it's finished here
