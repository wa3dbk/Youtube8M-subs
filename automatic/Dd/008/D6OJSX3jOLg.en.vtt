figured that mayweather was gonna win i
figured<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:10.920> he's<00:00:11.099> gonna<00:00:11.190> outbox<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.880> our

classroom<00:00:12.480> but<00:00:12.719> then<00:00:12.840> again<00:00:13.099> maybe<00:00:14.099> class<00:00:14.519> is

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
classroom but then again maybe class is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.310 
classroom but then again maybe class is
not<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> best<00:00:15.150> word<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.509> use<00:00:15.630> for<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.170> end

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
not the best word to use for the end

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.540

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
get to that later but I figured that

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.439

left<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.549> right<00:01:44.700> hook<00:01:44.850> because<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.240> was

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
left and right hook because that was
