as<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.020> terrible<00:02:49.860> tune<00:02:50.190> at<00:02:50.520> first<00:02:50.880> like<00:02:51.239> it<00:02:51.390> did

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
as a terrible tune at first like it did

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
strong reaction to it I thought it was

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.060 
strong reaction to it I thought it was
cool<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.200> band<00:02:55.380> was<00:02:55.530> going<00:02:55.590> for<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> different

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070

sound<00:02:56.400> but<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.790> thing<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.600> more<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.810> chewed

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
sound but the thing is the more I chewed

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.710 
sound but the thing is the more I chewed
it<00:02:58.560> over<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.340> more<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.730> track<00:03:00.000> kind<00:03:00.300> of<00:03:00.480> lost

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
it over the more the track kind of lost

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.560

flavor<00:03:01.290> for<00:03:01.770> me<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.489> saw<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.940> though<00:03:03.390> the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
flavor for me and I saw that though the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.080 
flavor for me and I saw that though the
sound<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:04.050> kind<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.440> interesting<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:05.430> doesn't

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
little indulgent of them to go back to

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.979 
little indulgent of them to go back to
the<00:04:17.280> 80s<00:04:17.669> take<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.030> sound<00:04:18.359> from<00:04:18.510> there<00:04:18.750> go<00:04:18.959> back
