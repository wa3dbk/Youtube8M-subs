00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.519
 album earth firm what difference does it have? 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.809
 this tour to the tour that exists 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.430
 you were here before the palace 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.659
 sport what are different things that 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.860
 will have the public that is the 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.290
 opportunity to appreciate in this new 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.180
 show many new songs this 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.159
 it's a tour and like the tours 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.570
 previous a tour of all my 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.030
 discs but in our surprises there are 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.730
 many dances for example on the tour 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:26.060
 previous there were not so many bailaoras and now 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.320
 now they forced me to move more the truth 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.030
 that sometimes it kind of encouraged me more 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.050
 on this tour if there's a lot of dancing 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.800
 there are intimate moments with my guitar 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.110
 nothing else 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.890
 with these very much with a lot of swing with 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.320
 a lot of energy so it's a little bit that 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.140
 go up and down and good the fact that already 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.360
 are eight albums are already more songs than 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.190
 people have listened so 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.270
 very happy and I go back and I repeat no no no 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.770
 I get tired of saying how excited I am 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.720
 I am able to present myself before chan 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.790
 of course it does look precisely at 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.230
 purpose 28 years of career there is something 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.760
 that draws my attention and 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.590
 the one that we know you as a singer-songwriter 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.160
 very romantic songs but the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.570
 latest albums songs like scream 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.130
 breathe I do not give up on 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.230
 occasions as if they transmit a 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.270
 message of encouragement since we get up already 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.100
 positive something has happened in life 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.030
 personalities of luis fonsi or simply you 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.500
 you understand that as an artist you are 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.670
 committed to take ministry 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.340
 I think what happens is that the fact of 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.030
 that what is important in the fact of 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.940
 that people have given me the opportunity 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.290
 of carrying a message and in addition to 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.690
 sing love songs and sing 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.500
 Songs of heartbreak is important 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.180
 bring a positive message to youth 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.280
 and public and take advantage of the fact that 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.470
 I have a microphone, a camera in front 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.990
 mine to say positive words and for 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.420
 that always inside my album I like 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.630
 share that positivism breathes not me 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.950
 I give up embrace life and 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.570
 take messages always good then to 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.790
 through facebook and twitter and 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.600
 then I congratulate you for your entire career 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.600
 and I know he was on holy Sunday and 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.650
 come back for now this is the concert 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.300
 that is set and I think I think that 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.770
 it's good because I've already shown up 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.260
 the past on holy Sunday and always 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.790
 because as an artist it is a challenge to introduce yourself 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.220
 a new place but that does not mean that 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.330
 do not come back later because of this I have 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.970
 many want also someday to be able 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.310

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.290
