parts needed to redo it and it turned

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.639 
parts needed to redo it and it turned
out<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.780> parts<00:00:52.050> were<00:00:52.199> all<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> wrong

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
out that the parts were all the wrong

ones they weren't for this car at all so

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.180 
ones they weren't for this car at all so
I<00:00:54.390> went<00:00:54.570> out<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.870> invested<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.559> cap<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.100> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
I went out and I invested in a cap and a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.369 
I went out and I invested in a cap and a
rotor<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.730> four<00:00:57.329> new<00:00:57.510> spark<00:00:57.870> plugs<00:00:58.170> they

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
rotor and four new spark plugs they

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.049 
rotor and four new spark plugs they
didn't<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.680> any<00:00:58.859> new<00:00:58.980> spark<00:00:59.280> plug<00:00:59.489> wires<00:00:59.699> just

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
didn't get any new spark plug wires just

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.000 
didn't get any new spark plug wires just
yet<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.109> don't<00:01:01.260> think<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.530> need<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.710> coil

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
yet and I don't think I need a coil

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
yet and I don't think I need a coil
because<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> coil<00:01:02.699> seems<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.300> good<00:01:03.449> that's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
because the coil seems to be good that's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.800 
because the coil seems to be good that's
the<00:01:04.470> battery<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> red<00:01:05.250> car<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.610> course

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
the battery on the red car of course

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.170 
the battery on the red car of course
anyway<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.080> took<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.070> took<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> distributor

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
anyway I took the took the distributor

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.929 
anyway I took the took the distributor
cap<00:01:09.210> off<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.130> wish<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.400> had<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.760> show

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
cap off and the I wish I had it to show

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.789 
cap off and the I wish I had it to show
you<00:01:12.000> because<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.600> truly<00:01:12.930> doesn't<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.530> truly

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
you because it truly doesn't it truly

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.289 
you because it truly doesn't it truly
doesn't<00:01:13.979> go<00:01:14.159> anywhere<00:01:14.490> near<00:01:14.640> explaining<00:01:15.270> just

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
doesn't go anywhere near explaining just

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.880 
doesn't go anywhere near explaining just
how<00:01:15.509> burnt<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.170> thing<00:01:16.409> was<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.830> really

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
how burnt that thing was it's really

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.780 
how burnt that thing was it's really
amazing<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> car<00:01:17.729> ran<00:01:17.970> at<00:01:18.119> all<00:01:18.590> but<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:20.460> didn't

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
amazing the car ran at all but it didn't

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.090 
amazing the car ran at all but it didn't
solve<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.150> problems<00:01:21.630> at<00:01:22.470> least<00:01:22.680> not<00:01:22.890> all<00:01:22.920> of

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
solve the problems at least not all of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.580 
solve the problems at least not all of
them<00:01:23.369> because<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.450> fuel<00:01:24.630> pump<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> car<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
them because the fuel pump on the car is

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.350 
them because the fuel pump on the car is
intermittent<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.430> has<00:01:26.880> clearly<00:01:27.150> been

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
intermittent and has clearly been

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.780 
intermittent and has clearly been
replaced<00:01:27.780> before<00:01:28.340> I've<00:01:29.340> also<00:01:29.460> done<00:01:29.729> some

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
replaced before I've also done some

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.840 
replaced before I've also done some
stuff<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> interior<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:32.130> make<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.460> nicer

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
stuff in the interior to make it nicer

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.050 
stuff in the interior to make it nicer
and<00:01:32.970> better<00:01:34.159> get<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.280> key<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> there<00:01:35.970> I'm

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and better get that key out of there I'm

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.980 
and better get that key out of there I'm
going<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.299> need<00:01:36.420> that

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.240 

oh<00:01:39.430> I<00:01:40.430> almost<00:01:40.790> fell<00:01:41.090> over<00:01:41.119> there's<00:01:41.540> no<00:01:41.659> armrest

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
oh I almost fell over there's no armrest

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.530 
oh I almost fell over there's no armrest
the<00:01:43.250> first<00:01:43.460> thing<00:01:43.640> I<00:01:43.729> did<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:44.030> I<00:01:44.150> got<00:01:44.330> rid<00:01:44.510> of

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
the first thing I did is I got rid of

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.109 
the first thing I did is I got rid of
that<00:01:44.750> terrible<00:01:45.110> abomination<00:01:45.979> that<00:01:46.190> was

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
that terrible abomination that was

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.230 
that terrible abomination that was
acting<00:01:47.450> as<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.659> radio<00:01:47.960> in<00:01:48.200> this<00:01:48.320> thing<00:01:48.380> I

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
acting as a radio in this thing I

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.390 
acting as a radio in this thing I
replaced<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.420> with<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:51.070> 2000<00:01:52.070> model-year

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
replaced it with the 2000 model-year

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.180
