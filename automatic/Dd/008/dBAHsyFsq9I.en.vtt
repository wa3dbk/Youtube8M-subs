the<00:01:00.090> ductwork<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.870> car<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.949> this

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the ductwork of the car we have this

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.579 
the ductwork of the car we have this
unit<00:01:02.520> right<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.719> an<00:01:03.840> evaporator

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
unit right here this is an evaporator

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.190 
unit right here this is an evaporator
the<00:01:05.369> refrigerant<00:01:06.210> from<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.900> air

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the refrigerant from the air

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.080 
the refrigerant from the air
conditioning<00:01:07.890> system<00:01:08.280> flows<00:01:08.580> through<00:01:08.970> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
conditioning system flows through it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.469 
conditioning system flows through it
makes<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.780> very<00:01:09.990> cold<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.520> fan<00:01:11.850> blows

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
makes it very cold then the fan blows

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.160 
makes it very cold then the fan blows
air<00:01:13.110> through<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:14.040> which<00:01:15.000> cools<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.990> air

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
air through this which cools the air

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.910 
air through this which cools the air
that<00:01:16.830> air<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.700> comes<00:01:18.090> through<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.409> into

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that air then comes through and out into

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.320 
that air then comes through and out into
the<00:01:20.400> car<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.200> evaporator<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.100> wet<00:01:23.430> you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the car so the evaporator is wet you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.760 
the car so the evaporator is wet you
know<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.720> stuff<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.290> runs<00:01:25.530> out

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
know all that stuff that runs out

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.980 
know all that stuff that runs out
underneath<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.520> car<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.689> keeps

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
underneath the car and so on that keeps

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.590 
underneath the car and so on that keeps
it<00:01:28.200> wet<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.890> means<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.729> great<00:01:29.970> place<00:01:30.329> for

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
it wet that means it's a great place for

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.990 
it wet that means it's a great place for
mold<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.409> mildew<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:32.100> grow<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> does

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
mold and mildew to grow and it does

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.590 
mold and mildew to grow and it does
believe<00:01:33.570> me<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.159> bottom<00:01:35.549> line<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.210> if

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
believe me so the bottom line here is if

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.780 
believe me so the bottom line here is if
you<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:37.049> an<00:01:37.200> air<00:01:37.470> conditioning<00:01:38.070> system<00:01:38.130> that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
you have an air conditioning system that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.050 
you have an air conditioning system that
smells<00:01:39.420> when<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.380> turn<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.610> may<00:01:42.000> be

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
smells when you turn it on you may be

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.090 
smells when you turn it on you may be
dealing<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:42.659> mold<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.320> mildew<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.950> that

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
dealing with mold and mildew and that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.639 
dealing with mold and mildew and that
means<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.579> could<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.850> dangerous<00:01:45.409> now<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.619> of

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
means it could be dangerous now one of

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.039 
means it could be dangerous now one of
the<00:01:46.829> best<00:01:47.009> ways<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.340> treat<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the best ways to treat it is with a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.149 
the best ways to treat it is with a
product<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.850> frigate<00:01:50.850> clean<00:01:51.090> which<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159
