00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
to make the door you want to put two

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.049 
to make the door you want to put two
pistons<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.590> top<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.890> each<00:00:41.010> other<00:00:41.129> leave<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> gap

then<00:00:42.450> place<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.050> book<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.890> block<00:00:44.100> that's<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
then place the book the block that's the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.500 
then place the book the block that's the
box<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.149> want<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.840> your<00:00:46.530> arm<00:00:47.329> for<00:00:48.329> your

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
box that you want for your arm for your

door<00:00:49.110> i'm<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.100> use<00:00:50.250> down<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:50.910> one

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
door i'm going to use down for this one

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.150 
door i'm going to use down for this one
and<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.260> want<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.500> leave<00:00:52.620> another<00:00:52.829> block

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and then you want to leave another block

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.069 
and then you want to leave another block
gap<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.420> want<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> go<00:00:54.719> back<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.930> your

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
gap and you want to go back to your

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.630 
gap and you want to go back to your
piston<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> walk<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.340> front<00:00:56.520> and

piston you want to walk in front and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.310 
piston you want to walk in front and
place<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.030> again<00:00:57.270> once<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.140> done<00:00:58.260> that

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
place it again once you have done that

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.950 
place it again once you have done that
you<00:00:58.680> want<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.010> go<00:00:59.190> put<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.940> block<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.780> you

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you want to go put the block that you

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.619 
you want to go put the block that you
have<00:01:01.140> had<00:01:01.530> stacked<00:01:01.949> off<00:01:02.160> behind<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.239> bottom

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
have had stacked off behind the bottom

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.289 
have had stacked off behind the bottom
piston<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.070> want<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> drop<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.900> down

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
piston and then you want to drop in down

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.750 
piston and then you want to drop in down
and<00:01:09.299> bring<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.659> down<00:01:09.689> against<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.530> i<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:11.930> and

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
and bring it down against what i do and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.580 
and bring it down against what i do and
then<00:01:14.760> i'll<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:14.909> bring<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> across<00:01:15.659> through

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
then i'll just bring it across through

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.170 
then i'll just bring it across through
here<00:01:16.799> he's<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> keep<00:01:17.700> digging<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.090> out

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
here he's going to keep digging it out

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.670 
here he's going to keep digging it out
to<00:01:18.509> make<00:01:18.630> us<00:01:18.780> one<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.170> fun<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.530> want

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to do is you want to first of all

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.109 
to do is you want to first of all
because<00:01:25.530> red<00:01:25.920> sign<00:01:26.100> has<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:26.460> one<00:01:26.909> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
because red sign has to go down one you

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.870 
because red sign has to go down one you
want<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> go<00:01:28.110> down<00:01:28.409> from<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.310> there<00:01:29.520> so

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
want to go down from here to there so

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.789 
want to go down from here to there so
there<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.390> that's<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.810> down<00:01:31.049> from<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> floor

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
there so that's one down from the floor

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.640 
there so that's one down from the floor
level<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.579> that's<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.060> two<00:01:33.270> down<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.500> go

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
level so that's a two down and I just go

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.700 
level so that's a two down and I just go
around<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.960> keep<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.470> until

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
around like this keep it going and until

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.740 
around like this keep it going and until
about<00:01:37.829> here<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.759> want<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.000> put<00:01:39.180> another<00:01:39.390> one

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
about here you want to put another one

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.050 
about here you want to put another one
of<00:01:39.869> your<00:01:39.960> blocks<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.650> already<00:01:40.860> had<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.790> block

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
of your blocks you already had one block

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.660 
of your blocks you already had one block
in<00:01:42.240> front<00:01:42.649> but<00:01:43.649> i<00:01:43.710> usually<00:01:43.920> do<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.460> front

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
in front but i usually do it in front

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.120 
in front but i usually do it in front
off<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.720> line<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> piston<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.040> this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
off in line with the piston so it's this

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.060 
off in line with the piston so it's this
plot<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.079> put<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.470> redstone<00:01:49.740> torch

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
plot and then you put a redstone torch

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.889 
plot and then you put a redstone torch
on<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.640> block<00:01:50.850> connecting<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> redstone

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
on the block connecting to the redstone

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.260 
on the block connecting to the redstone
wire<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.320> an<00:01:52.590> inverter<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.729> will<00:01:53.880> make<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.030> to

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
wire as an inverter this will make it to

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.209 
wire as an inverter this will make it to
the<00:01:54.360> door<00:01:54.509> will<00:01:54.750> stay<00:01:54.990> closed<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.799> when<00:01:56.040> you

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the door will stay closed but when you

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.399 
the door will stay closed but when you
stacked<00:01:56.969> avater<00:01:57.270> it'll<00:01:57.570> open<00:01:57.719> up<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.229> then

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
stacked avater it'll open up and then

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.959 
stacked avater it'll open up and then
you<00:01:58.500> want<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.680> put<00:01:58.860> redstone<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.729> side

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
you want to put redstone on this side

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.020 
you want to put redstone on this side
and<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:01.320> want<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.560> line<00:02:02.159> up<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.520> block

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and you want to line up with the block

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.420 
and you want to line up with the block
again<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.600> you'll<00:02:04.350> probably<00:02:04.469> want<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.130> get

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
again and you'll probably want to get

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.399 
again and you'll probably want to get
your<00:02:05.520> block<00:02:05.700> out<00:02:05.880> again<00:02:06.060> place<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:07.079> put

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
your block out again place it there put

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.100 
your block out again place it there put
another<00:02:07.500> torch<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.220> side<00:02:08.489> walk<00:02:09.060> back

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
another torch on this side walk back

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.850 
another torch on this side walk back
get<00:02:10.920> your<00:02:11.130> redstone<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:13.650> want<00:02:13.800> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
get your redstone and you want to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.710 
get your redstone and you want to
organize<00:02:14.070> out<00:02:14.550> how<00:02:14.760> you're<00:02:15.000> going<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.330> do<00:02:15.540> this

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
organize out how you're going to do this

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.060 
organize out how you're going to do this
so<00:02:15.960> you<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.110> want<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.410> bring<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.710> down<00:02:16.860> like

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
so you just want to bring it down like

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.390 
so you just want to bring it down like
this<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:18.210> how<00:02:18.420> I'll<00:02:18.600> do<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:22.190> there<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.340> go

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
you got that that is how you make the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.480 
you got that that is how you make the
simple<00:02:26.640> ish<00:02:27.320> redstone<00:02:28.320> tutorial<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.220> how<00:02:29.310> you

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
simple ish redstone tutorial of how you

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.390 
simple ish redstone tutorial of how you
can<00:02:29.730> probably<00:02:29.970> do<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:31.470> creative<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.220> how

can probably do this the creative of how

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.220 
can probably do this the creative of how
it<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:33.000> can<00:02:33.180> hide<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.780> pretty<00:02:33.990> easy

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
it like you can hide this is pretty easy

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.580 
it like you can hide this is pretty easy
just<00:02:34.590> gotta<00:02:35.180> do<00:02:36.180> your<00:02:36.330> stuff<00:02:36.660> but<00:02:36.959> I'm<00:02:37.080> it's

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
going to cover this like this for now

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.720 
going to cover this like this for now
but<00:02:39.720> like<00:02:40.290> right<00:02:40.590> here<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.100> put<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.520> in

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
but like right here you put like in

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.430 
but like right here you put like in
front<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.360> do<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.140> stack

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
front of this you do this and you stack

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.020 
front of this you do this and you stack
it<00:02:43.470> up<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:43.920> can't<00:02:44.160> see<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.550> front<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.880> that

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
it up so you can't see in front of that

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.270 
it up so you can't see in front of that
it's<00:02:45.930> how<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.110> do<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.440> when<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.740> don't<00:02:47.100> want

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
it's how you do it when you don't want

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.310 
it's how you do it when you don't want
people<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.550> see<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.850> stuff<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:49.020> that's<00:02:49.080> how

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
people to see that stuff so that's how

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.680 
people to see that stuff so that's how
you<00:02:49.380> do<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.459> briefing<00:02:50.700> but<00:02:51.120> then<00:02:51.270> that's<00:02:51.450> only

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
you do the briefing but then that's only

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.900 
you do the briefing but then that's only
one<00:02:51.959> side<00:02:51.989> wait<00:02:52.770> up<00:02:52.920> yeah<00:02:53.220> it'll<00:02:53.459> be<00:02:53.550> only<00:02:53.640> one

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
one side wait up yeah it'll be only one

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.190 
one side wait up yeah it'll be only one
side<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.330> what<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.570> need<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.750> do<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.170> need

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
side so what you need to do is you need

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.850 
side so what you need to do is you need
to<00:02:55.580> wait<00:02:56.580> up<00:02:58.070> which<00:02:59.070> where's<00:02:59.370> my<00:02:59.459> pizza<00:02:59.730> man

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
to wait up which where's my pizza man

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.320 
to wait up which where's my pizza man
for<00:03:01.860> some<00:03:02.040> reason<00:03:02.430> one<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.760> these<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.030> open

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
for some reason one of these is open

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.600 
for some reason one of these is open
with<00:03:03.480> stock<00:03:03.810> still<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:06.239> that's<00:03:06.450> down<00:03:07.610> this

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
with stock still so that's down this

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.250 
with stock still so that's down this
other<00:03:08.850> one<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.180> an<00:03:09.239> open<00:03:09.540> for<00:03:09.750> some<00:03:09.900> reason

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
other one it's an open for some reason

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.229 
other one it's an open for some reason
because<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.130> blocked<00:03:11.430> off<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.820> redstone

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
because I blocked off the redstone

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.680 
because I blocked off the redstone
signal<00:03:12.900> right<00:03:13.260> easy<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:15.150> don't<00:03:15.390> want<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.570> make

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
signal right easy you don't want to make

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.690 
signal right easy you don't want to make
sure<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.049> don't<00:03:16.140> block<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.560> signal<00:03:16.769> like<00:03:17.580> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
sure you don't block the signal like the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.340 
sure you don't block the signal like the
red<00:03:17.880> stone<00:03:18.090> because<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.630> certain<00:03:18.900> parts<00:03:19.200> where

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
red stone because it certain parts where

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.750 
red stone because it certain parts where
you<00:03:19.440> can't<00:03:19.709> do<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.010> have<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.250> go<00:03:20.430> over<00:03:20.580> top

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
you can't do it you have to go over top

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.850 
you can't do it you have to go over top
of<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.150> once<00:03:21.750> you've<00:03:21.840> done<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.680> want

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
of it so once you've done that you want

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.710 
of it so once you've done that you want
to<00:03:22.890> go<00:03:22.950> underneath<00:03:23.519> where<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.030> door<00:03:24.299> is<00:03:24.330> just

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
to go underneath where the door is just

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.759 
to go underneath where the door is just
keep<00:03:25.019> going<00:03:25.320> underneath<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:27.080> just<00:03:28.080> go<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
keep going underneath I just go to and

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:29.900 
keep going underneath I just go to and
plant<00:03:28.980> doesn't<00:03:29.280> really<00:03:29.489> matter<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.760> can

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
plant doesn't really matter you can

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.759 
plant doesn't really matter you can
always<00:03:30.060> fix<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.450> up<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.750> then<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.410> want<00:03:31.680> to

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
always fix it up and then you want to
