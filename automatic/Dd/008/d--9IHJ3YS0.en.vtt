00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.190
 well this is a small monologue and today 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.559
 I'm going to tell you what I do 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.929
 when it came to the channel we saw that the 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.480
 station if the guard is in good 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.210
 humor let me in if it's already sea 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.349
 world for our city not outside 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.020
 either of them is very difficult 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:24.259
 As I bring many suitcases there are stairs 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.880
 to go up and down then there I come 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.189
 me with suitcases on top 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.919
 I always meet people I know because 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.410
 Well here I work and I stay to talk 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.530
 with them a ratillo came the dressing room 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.890
 I combed my hair 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.370
 you pain me make up 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.710
 because then I say we did not look very pretty 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.520
 true 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.250
 so I was born 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.710
 then immediately leaving the 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.160
 dressing room came to do a small 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:01.660
 scale to the cafeteria how can you give 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:05.050
 account a brownie can never miss 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.360
 they sell salads they sell a corral of 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.530
 things well parents for food 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.690
 balanced like a chocolate brownie 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.010
 and then I come to the board that is at 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.890
 three and a half where we had it 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.650
 talking about religion policy 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.610
 - from the board but then here we are very 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.440
 punctual after that I change 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.720
 in the men's bathroom because the one in 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.600
 Women do not have a mirror 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.800
 and I put the pea this I start to 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:40.410
 exercise to kill nerves 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.630
 and at half past four o'clock 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.070
 in which we start the program just 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.210
 you can miss it 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.210
 better every time 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.860
 and the program is over we have another 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.350
 board where we talk about what we are going to 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.190
 do the next day although we have 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.250
 three days 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.070
 and that's it 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.580
 again I grab my bags I climb the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:10.280
 stairs the bass came to my car 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.280
 you drive to my home I open the door 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.240
 I give a kiss to my bread are and so 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.240
 walk
