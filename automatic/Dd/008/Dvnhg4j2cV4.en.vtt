00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.490
 coli 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.029
 think about doing 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.860
 the prison break run again 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.819
 as 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.819
 the other video in hd 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:17.980
 to get started 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.280
 we make a square of paper with a folio 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.399
 Rousseff after doing it the size you want 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.829
 I am doing it 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.829
 big 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.829
 so you can see the folds the steps 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 do not believe it 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.460
 bush for bouquets this one after offering a branch 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.400
 denouncing corners that do not inform the crowd 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.990
 this corner 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.990
 we fold it in half 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.900
 koenig eagerness same entity that the removal of cer 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.650
 we do the same with these premises with which we have 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.570
 putting them parallel to the student of the center 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.690
 cb stay down like this 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.399
 with the folds of course 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.870
 did from inside and so far 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.170
 but they do not 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.170
 we leave the folds sale 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.650
 It must stay down like this 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.270
 now 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.220
 this is going to be the floating cuec 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 we do not talk 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.410
 the harshness but not all Chileans who drinking 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.860
 that does not happen 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.830
 we open a little 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.260
 on paper 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
 we started years ago 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.210
 help us less twice 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.230
 finish 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.289
 now let's make the tail 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.749
 we do not talk 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.749
 similar to the previous 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.659
 the demonstrations 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.459
 commander 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.209
 now we are going against 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.449
 let's do 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.889
 the same as at the beginning we are going to take these fifths 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.229
 and we're going to put it parallel to extremadura 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.609
 folding the alhambra 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.539
 stroessner 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.539
 mesquida the head of our province 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.439
 we do the same with a plot 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:08.209
 seen the children 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.120
 again the folds we put it in 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.199
 télam - 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:15.549
 of the folds that you get 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.549
 with both sides of course 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.699
 we have something left 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.459
 with little skill we opened 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.069
 head 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.069
 forward 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:41.589
 I do not care that we do a little bit here 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:44.589
 and inward 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.239
 as I said before this city head our orbit 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.830
 the peak does not matter that we were a little 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.379
 points 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.429
 well I hope to do 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.429
 in this context we can not show our way 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.719
 and we must stay down like this 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.339
 we'll finish the neck later now let's go with the 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:13.359
 I share 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.389
 we put the tail in then 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.959
 the only thing that needs to be done now 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.009
 in this evening with little 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.009
 i will take it out 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.499
 we do not talk about what we have left 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:31.210
 the tickets a little bit 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.210
 those that the field well 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.029
 what do we do 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.029
 we take 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.960
 even out 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.430
 trying to catch a bit 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.139
 Of the arc 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.139
 the usach and 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:58.849
 it's the same with this side too 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.400
 helping us 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.419
 of the other 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.460
 to establish 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.990
 in doubles 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.590
 from the go and we go inwards since these will not be remembered 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.289
 the citizenship something like that 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.379
 so 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:26.819
 this corner 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.590
 He used it doubling as much as he could 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.210
 the area of ​​the head 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.349
 always trying so I do it 2 a little 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.120
 all right 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.559
 of perspective 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:42.039
 tilting a little man to bend them completely straight 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.349
 tilted a little twice 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.349
 we are the first side the sum is the same with this one 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.169
 good gesture are 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.650
 of the oit if you want you can make your bow 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.919
 neither 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:00.990
 The tail 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.020
 as we want 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.499
 anyone to finish the room 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:09.339
 What is the most 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:11.319
 we double 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.319
 in this way 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.490
 peeters 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.669
 is not enough the double 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:28.370
 as we have done in 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.699
 previous steps 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.789
 we got the head made in 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.509
 to take something like that 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.509
 we are a little bit more or less direct 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.569
 you can if you want 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:43.280
 leaving a little wider 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.680
 with a little more 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.809
 the scientists 

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:50.080
 I'm here 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.080
 pd- to fly down 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.509
 it's not a little 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:56.740
 indurain 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.740
 everyone writes 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.849
 you can leave more space who this if you want to cry 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:07.229
 and if you liked it 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:09.719
 we take the peak 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:12.979
 we take it to act 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:14.949
 we put it towards 

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:17.759
 towards part b 

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:20.430
 and now the flyers end up achieving 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.430
 so what else do you want 

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:29.729
 nor write 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:32.339
 so let's let the club 

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:34.719
 the end 

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:37.719
 and good until iniesta 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.280
 nor prison break 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.539
 there we can be competitive with Moscow
