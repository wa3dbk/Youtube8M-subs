00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
situation called code black and that's

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.890 
situation called code black and that's
sort<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.650> basis<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.180> show<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
sort of the basis of the show and the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.780 
sort of the basis of the show and the
documentary<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:17.100> quite<00:01:17.310> impressed<00:01:17.490> with

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
documentary I was quite impressed with

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.760 
documentary I was quite impressed with
the<00:01:17.970> trailer<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.509> think<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> only<00:01:19.290> thing<00:01:19.470> I'm<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the trailer I think the only thing I'm a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.560 
the trailer I think the only thing I'm a
little<00:01:19.830> disappointed<00:01:20.670> about<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.210> that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
little disappointed about is that

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.899 
little disappointed about is that
they're<00:01:22.229> kind<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.710> putting<00:01:22.920> aside<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.729> whole

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
they're kind of putting aside the whole

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
they're kind of putting aside the whole
point<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> documentary<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:25.799> it's

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
point of the documentary and what it's

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
point of the documentary and what it's
really<00:01:26.040> about<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.180> decided<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.750> focus

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
really about and just decided to focus

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.170 
really about and just decided to focus
on<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.650> doctors<00:01:29.070> which<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.640> really<00:01:30.150> what

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
on the doctors which is not really what

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.020 
on the doctors which is not really what
the<00:01:30.630> documentary<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.350> about<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:32.250> hopefully

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the documentary is about but hopefully

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.249 
the documentary is about but hopefully
that's<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.450> trailer<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.810> they<00:01:33.869> will<00:01:34.140> be

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
that's just a trailer and they will be

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.200 
that's just a trailer and they will be
addressing<00:01:34.590> some<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.040> issues<00:01:35.180> brought<00:01:36.180> up

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
addressing some of the issues brought up

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
addressing some of the issues brought up
by<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.509> documentary<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> show<00:01:37.590> because<00:01:37.770> I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
by the documentary in the show because I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.289 
by the documentary in the show because I
think<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.130> could<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.790> something<00:01:39.150> really

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
think that could be something really

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.450 
think that could be something really
interesting<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.229> different<00:01:40.530> I'm<00:01:41.040> looking

to<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:08.380> movie<00:02:08.710> but<00:02:09.520> that's<00:02:10.060> okay<00:02:10.420> this<00:02:10.750> is

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
to the movie but that's okay this is

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.470 
to the movie but that's okay this is
about<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.230> guy<00:02:11.440> that's<00:02:11.680> given<00:02:11.980> this<00:02:12.430> pill<00:02:12.940> that

gives him access to more of his brain

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.720 
gives him access to more of his brain
it's<00:02:16.810> like<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.930> brain<00:02:17.230> boosting<00:02:17.800> kind<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.400> pill
