00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.030
 blueberry then we come to our 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.800
 parking point the passengers 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.660

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.239
 the positive side of the job is there 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.290
 not really routine we meet 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.000
 a lot of people 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.070
 we work in an atmosphere that is 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.980
 very very good with colleagues with 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.150
 who is used to flying with whom 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.950
 the days pass quickly even if they 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.570
 are difficult the negative sides 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.640
 it's going to be the schedules we get up very 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.840
 early so it's not necessarily easy 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.850
 is never safe from a weather 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.620
 capricious could be a very good 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.090
 stewardess of course 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.680
 to be very smiling 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.239
 because we are the image of the company 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.769
 it's the first thing the passenger 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.080
 will see when they get on the plane 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.910
 must also know how to be very 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.380
 diplomat take a lot of hindsight 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.299
 in relation to situations 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.100
 conflictual have a very good 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.280
 lifestyle is very important in 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.500
 this business because it's an environment that 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.660
 is pretty aggressive for the body the plane 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.340
 what the air is very dry and then the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.750
 pressurization depressurization 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.269
 several times a day we can become 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.000
 cabin attendant also line trainer 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.160

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.330
 a very beautiful brand image and it's 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.530
