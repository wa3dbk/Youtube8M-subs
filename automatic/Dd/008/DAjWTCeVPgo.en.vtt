which sells for 2999 now there are
actually<00:00:15.089> six<00:00:15.389> versions<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.199> case<00:00:16.500> each

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
actually six versions of this case each

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.800 
actually six versions of this case each
one<00:00:17.340> has<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> different<00:00:17.640> name<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.119> essentially
