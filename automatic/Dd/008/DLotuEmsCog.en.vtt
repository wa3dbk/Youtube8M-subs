reefs and the water temperature it can
be<00:00:46.680> 84<00:00:47.190> degrees<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.760> thought<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.420> was<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.630> fantasy

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
be 84 degrees I thought it was a fantasy

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.300 
be 84 degrees I thought it was a fantasy
I<00:00:49.080> couldn't<00:00:49.440> believe<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.650> such<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> place

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
I couldn't believe that such a place

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.840 
I couldn't believe that such a place
existed<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.060> the<00:00:51.180> continental<00:00:51.570> United<00:00:51.900> States

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
existed in the continental United States

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.890 
existed in the continental United States
because<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.030> turned<00:00:54.210> out<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.360> friend<00:00:54.630> of<00:00:54.750> mine

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
because it turned out a friend of mine

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.220 
because it turned out a friend of mine
came<00:00:55.560> to<00:00:55.710> key<00:00:55.860> largo<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.310> holiday<00:00:56.700> and<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:58.170> I

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
came to key largo on holiday and so I

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.720 
came to key largo on holiday and so I
thought<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.680> well<00:00:59.070> let<00:00:59.190> me<00:00:59.250> go<00:00:59.370> down<00:00:59.490> and

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
see if this mythical place truly exists

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.460 
see if this mythical place truly exists

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
reality was such that there were these

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.390 
reality was such that there were these
beautiful<00:01:10.200> coral<00:01:10.439> reefs<00:01:10.619> there<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.070> warm

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
beautiful coral reefs there was warm

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880 
beautiful coral reefs there was warm
water<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:12.060> terrific<00:01:12.780> water<00:01:13.470> clarity

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
water that was terrific water clarity

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.620 
water that was terrific water clarity
and<00:01:14.329> by<00:01:15.329> November<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.960> was<00:01:16.200> living<00:01:16.439> here

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
and by November I was living here

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.200 
and by November I was living here
where<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.259> opened<00:01:18.560> my<00:01:18.680> studio<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.159> process<00:01:19.909> film

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
where I opened my studio to process film

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.649 
where I opened my studio to process film
into<00:01:20.680> rent<00:01:21.680> cameras<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:22.430> in<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.210> afternoon

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
into rent cameras and in the afternoon

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.420 
into rent cameras and in the afternoon
when<00:01:24.020> I<00:01:24.079> had<00:01:24.259> no<00:01:24.409> customers<00:01:24.619> i<00:01:25.009> would<00:01:25.159> go<00:01:25.280> out

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
when I had no customers i would go out

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.080 
when I had no customers i would go out
and<00:01:25.610> i<00:01:26.390> would<00:01:26.600> dive<00:01:27.380> our<00:01:27.560> coral<00:01:27.860> reefs<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.369> of

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
and i would dive our coral reefs and of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.370 
and i would dive our coral reefs and of
course<00:01:29.299> that's<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:29.659> think<00:01:29.899> it's<00:01:30.020> really<00:01:30.170> where

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
course that's I think it's really where

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.440 
course that's I think it's really where
I<00:01:30.409> learned<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.979> do<00:01:31.490> underwater<00:01:31.820> photography

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
I learned to do underwater photography

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.149 
I learned to do underwater photography
well<00:01:32.630> I<00:01:34.270> think<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.509> coral<00:01:35.780> reef<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.229> very

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
well I think the coral reef is a very

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.399 
well I think the coral reef is a very
inspiring<00:01:37.549> echo<00:01:37.909> system<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.810> oceans<00:01:39.200> of

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
inspiring echo system the oceans of

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.260 
inspiring echo system the oceans of
course<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:39.770> much<00:01:39.950> of<00:01:40.130> our<00:01:40.250> whole<00:01:40.460> planet<00:01:40.729> ties

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
course so much of our whole planet ties

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.899 
course so much of our whole planet ties
into<00:01:41.569> the<00:01:41.659> ocean<00:01:41.990> FFM<00:01:42.619> is<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.340> obvious<00:01:43.759> it

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
into the ocean FFM is so obvious it

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.059 
into the ocean FFM is so obvious it
almost<00:01:44.149> doesn't<00:01:44.810> bear<00:01:45.140> repetition<00:01:45.920> but

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
almost doesn't bear repetition but

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.010 
almost doesn't bear repetition but
unless<00:01:46.789> people<00:01:47.149> have<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.420> opportunity<00:01:47.960> to

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
unless people have the opportunity to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.380 
unless people have the opportunity to
see<00:01:48.319> how<00:01:48.439> beautiful<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.009> is<00:01:49.039> and<00:01:49.189> to<00:01:49.549> see<00:01:49.789> the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
see how beautiful it is and to see the

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.719 
see how beautiful it is and to see the
interrelationship<00:01:50.929> I<00:01:51.439> think<00:01:51.679> then<00:01:52.610> they

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
interrelationship I think then they

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.520 
interrelationship I think then they
don't<00:01:52.939> understand<00:01:53.720> how<00:01:53.840> very<00:01:54.080> important<00:01:54.470> it

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
don't understand how very important it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.010 
don't understand how very important it
is<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:54.890> protect<00:01:55.280> our<00:01:55.459> oceans<00:01:55.819> and<00:01:56.149> you<00:01:56.840> know<00:01:56.929> to

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
is to protect our oceans and you know to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.469 
is to protect our oceans and you know to
be<00:01:57.170> aware<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.590> issues<00:01:58.069> like<00:01:58.399> over<00:01:58.670> fishing<00:01:58.909> and

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
be aware of issues like over fishing and

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.779 
be aware of issues like over fishing and
shark<00:02:00.020> finning<00:02:00.349> and<00:02:00.709> all<00:02:01.099> the<00:02:01.369> things<00:02:01.580> that

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
shark finning and all the things that

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.949 
shark finning and all the things that
are<00:02:01.939> challenging<00:02:02.929> for<00:02:03.349> our<00:02:03.409> oceans<00:02:03.740> today

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.210 

there's<00:02:08.959> a<00:02:09.049> lot<00:02:09.079> of<00:02:09.200> places<00:02:09.440> that<00:02:09.799> I<00:02:09.829> go<00:02:09.890> right

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
there's a lot of places that I go right

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.539 
there's a lot of places that I go right
now<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:10.610> have<00:02:10.930> they<00:02:11.930> have<00:02:12.049> better<00:02:12.200> water

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
now that have they have better water

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.059 
now that have they have better water
clarity<00:02:13.549> they<00:02:14.390> probably<00:02:14.660> have<00:02:14.959> more<00:02:15.560> dramatic

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
clarity they probably have more dramatic

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.220 
clarity they probably have more dramatic
walls<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:17.090> know<00:02:17.239> it's<00:02:17.540> just<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.840> function<00:02:18.019> of

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
walls you know it's just a function of

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.860 
walls you know it's just a function of
their<00:02:18.410> geography<00:02:18.709> their<00:02:19.250> geology<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.000> they

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
their geography their geology and they

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.170 
their geography their geology and they
may<00:02:21.049> have<00:02:21.260> more<00:02:21.700> dramatic<00:02:22.700> wide-angle

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
may have more dramatic wide-angle

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.630 
may have more dramatic wide-angle
scenics<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:23.780> terms<00:02:24.019> of<00:02:24.260> marine<00:02:24.590> life

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
scenics but in terms of marine life

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
scenics but in terms of marine life
there's<00:02:25.640> no<00:02:25.760> place<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.239> dive<00:02:26.420> in<00:02:26.569> the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
there's no place that I dive in the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.680 
there's no place that I dive in the
Caribbean<00:02:26.989> that<00:02:27.200> has<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:28.090> density<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.299> marine

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
Caribbean that has the density of marine

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.509 
Caribbean that has the density of marine
life<00:02:29.720> population<00:02:30.530> where<00:02:31.069> we<00:02:31.190> have<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.459> the

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
life population where we have in the

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.370 
life population where we have in the
Florida<00:02:31.819> Keys<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.660> think<00:02:32.870> that's<00:02:33.019> our<00:02:33.139> big

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
Florida Keys and I think that's our big

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.000 
Florida Keys and I think that's our big
success<00:02:33.769> story

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
success story

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.660 
success story
a<00:02:36.799> lot<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:37.830> people<00:02:37.950> come<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.400> Key<00:02:38.519> Largo

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
a lot of people come to Key Largo

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.130 
a lot of people come to Key Largo
because<00:02:39.060> they<00:02:39.180> want<00:02:39.360> experience<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:39.870> people

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
because they want experience this people

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.350

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
Rove and while they're here they get to

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.780 
Rove and while they're here they get to
experience<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.349> know<00:02:43.470> all<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.370> other<00:02:44.519> dive

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
experience you know all the other dive

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.949 
experience you know all the other dive
sites<00:02:45.090> we<00:02:45.329> have<00:02:45.360> they're<00:02:45.629> going<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.810> go<00:02:45.900> to

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
sites we have they're going to go to

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.470 
sites we have they're going to go to
molasses<00:02:46.530> they're<00:02:46.709> going<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:46.890> go<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.480> probably

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
molasses they're going to go to probably

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.240 
molasses they're going to go to probably
die<00:02:48.569> French<00:02:48.900> reef<00:02:49.170> they're<00:02:49.439> going<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
die French reef they're going to the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.740 
die French reef they're going to the
second<00:02:50.610> dive<00:02:50.700> is<00:02:50.879> off<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.209> bed<00:02:51.360> with<00:02:51.569> which

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
second dive is off in the bed with which

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.670 
second dive is off in the bed with which
is<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> world<00:02:52.680> war<00:02:52.799> two<00:02:52.980> shipwreck<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:54.750> think

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
is a world war two shipwreck so I think

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.430 
is a world war two shipwreck so I think
we<00:02:55.980> have<00:02:56.159> a<00:02:56.190> very<00:02:56.340> diverse<00:02:57.230> portfolio<00:02:58.230> of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
we have a very diverse portfolio of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.250 
we have a very diverse portfolio of
attractions<00:02:59.370> but<00:03:00.209> as<00:03:00.810> far<00:03:00.989> as<00:03:01.049> I'm<00:03:01.230> concerned

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
attractions but as far as I'm concerned

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.259 
attractions but as far as I'm concerned
I'm<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.920> tremendous<00:03:02.730> supporter<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
I'm a tremendous supporter of the

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.330 
I'm a tremendous supporter of the
artificial<00:03:03.750> reef<00:03:03.900> program<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.260> think<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.709> it

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
artificial reef program I think it it

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.440 
artificial reef program I think it it
has<00:03:05.459> been<00:03:05.609> a<00:03:05.670> terrific<00:03:06.319> tourism<00:03:07.319> enhancement

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
has been a terrific tourism enhancement

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.509 
has been a terrific tourism enhancement
but<00:03:09.450> also<00:03:09.659> I<00:03:10.079> think<00:03:10.140> it's<00:03:10.890> been<00:03:11.010> very<00:03:11.040> good<00:03:11.370> for

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
but also I think it's been very good for

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.210 
but also I think it's been very good for
the<00:03:11.609> marine<00:03:11.790> life<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:15.859> don't<00:03:16.859> get<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.069> dive

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
the marine life I don't get to dive

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.160 
the marine life I don't get to dive
every<00:03:17.519> day<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.760> my<00:03:17.819> life<00:03:17.909> it's<00:03:18.540> very<00:03:18.750> special

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
every day of my life it's very special

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.170 
every day of my life it's very special
when<00:03:19.379> when<00:03:19.769> my<00:03:20.340> business<00:03:20.700> takes<00:03:20.909> me<00:03:21.090> under
