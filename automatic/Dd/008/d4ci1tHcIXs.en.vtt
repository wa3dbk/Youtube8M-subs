00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.379 
started and making their own sorting
equipment<00:00:10.250> the<00:00:11.250> machines<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.730> grief<00:00:11.940> are<00:00:12.059> very

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
equipment the machines of grief are very

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.310 
equipment the machines of grief are very
easy<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.719> program<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.860> it's<00:00:14.040> quite<00:00:14.849> easy<00:00:15.630> to

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
easy to program so it's quite easy to

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.160 
easy to program so it's quite easy to

talking<00:02:39.490> about<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.970> easy<00:02:40.450> sort<00:02:41.670> one<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.910> the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
talking about the easy sort one of the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.340 
talking about the easy sort one of the
main<00:02:44.200> issues<00:02:44.830> as<00:02:45.160> well<00:02:45.280> is<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:47.230> are

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
main issues as well is that you are

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.370 
main issues as well is that you are
talking<00:02:47.530> about<00:02:47.770> smaller<00:02:48.730> growers<00:02:49.380> smaller

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
talking about smaller growers smaller

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.990 
talking about smaller growers smaller
growers<00:02:50.770> have<00:02:51.070> not<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:51.370> much<00:02:51.490> space<00:02:51.670> in<00:02:51.880> a

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
growers have not so much space in a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.080 
growers have not so much space in a
packing<00:02:52.240> station<00:02:52.450> their<00:02:53.440> need<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:54.090> less

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
packing station their need is less

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.040 
packing station their need is less
capacity<00:02:55.710> they<00:02:57.000> their<00:02:58.000> budget<00:02:58.270> is<00:02:58.480> smaller<00:02:58.930> as

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
capacity they their budget is smaller as

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.090 
capacity they their budget is smaller as
well<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.320> you<00:02:59.380> have<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.620> offer<00:02:59.770> a<00:02:59.860> machine

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
well so you have to offer a machine

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.550 
well so you have to offer a machine
which<00:03:00.310> fits<00:03:00.640> in<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.910> budget<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.810> lower<00:03:02.080> cost

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
which fits in the budget the lower cost

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.410 
which fits in the budget the lower cost
machine<00:03:02.860> but<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.520> course<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.850> machine<00:03:04.090> has<00:03:04.270> to

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
machine but of course the machine has to

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.080 
machine but of course the machine has to
be<00:03:04.620> reliable<00:03:05.620> as<00:03:05.710> well<00:03:05.890> we<00:03:06.220> can<00:03:06.460> make

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
be reliable as well we can make

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.560 
be reliable as well we can make
preparations<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:08.230> advance<00:03:09.070> for<00:03:10.060> measuring

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
preparations in advance for measuring

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.830 
preparations in advance for measuring
internal<00:03:11.140> quality<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:12.250> at<00:03:12.490> this<00:03:12.820> time<00:03:13.150> it

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
internal quality so at this time it

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.380 
internal quality so at this time it
wouldn't<00:03:14.320> be<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.470> necessity<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:15.670> have<00:03:15.730> internal

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
wouldn't be a necessity to have internal

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.660 
wouldn't be a necessity to have internal
quality<00:03:16.750> on<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> machine<00:03:17.200> but<00:03:17.860> for<00:03:18.190> instance<00:03:18.340> in

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
quality on a machine but for instance in

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.000 
quality on a machine but for instance in
two<00:03:18.940> or<00:03:19.180> three<00:03:19.210> years<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:20.530> market<00:03:20.710> could<00:03:20.950> be

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
two or three years the market could be

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.660 
two or three years the market could be
demanding<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:23.410> can<00:03:23.590> add<00:03:23.830> some<00:03:24.520> additional

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
demanding you can add some additional

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.700 
demanding you can add some additional
outlets<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:25.960> you<00:03:26.020> can<00:03:26.230> add<00:03:26.380> some<00:03:26.410> additional

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
outlets so you can add some additional

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.450 
outlets so you can add some additional
sorting<00:03:27.430> groups<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.940> it's<00:03:28.540> very<00:03:28.870> easily

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
sorting groups and it's very easily

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:38.000 
sorting groups and it's very easily
extendable

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.030 

during<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.129> years<00:03:39.370> we<00:03:40.329> also<00:03:40.890> improved<00:03:41.890> our

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
during the years we also improved our

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.270 
during the years we also improved our
machines<00:03:42.519> by<00:03:43.480> making<00:03:43.959> them<00:03:44.110> faster<00:03:44.769> more

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
machines by making them faster more

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.149 
machines by making them faster more
accurate<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.150> more<00:03:46.450> fruit<00:03:46.750> friendly<00:03:47.200> we<00:03:48.099> are

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
accurate and more fruit friendly we are

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.250 
accurate and more fruit friendly we are
looking<00:03:48.579> for<00:03:48.849> always<00:03:49.480> looking<00:03:49.659> for<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.049> best
