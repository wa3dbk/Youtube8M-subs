00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.179 

hi<00:00:05.400> guys<00:00:05.640> someone<00:00:06.600> has<00:00:06.810> asked<00:00:07.109> me<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.259> explain

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
hi guys someone has asked me to explain

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.240 
hi guys someone has asked me to explain
how<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:09.019> shorten<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.380> length<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:11.040> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
how to shorten the length of the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.520 
how to shorten the length of the
balanced<00:00:11.580> yoga<00:00:12.059> strap<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.139> actually

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
balanced yoga strap so this is actually

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.560 
balanced yoga strap so this is actually
the<00:00:13.710> adjustable<00:00:14.250> strap<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.759> my<00:00:14.910> fellow<00:00:15.150> has

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
the adjustable strap that my fellow has

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
the adjustable strap that my fellow has
coming<00:00:15.870> now<00:00:17.449> the<00:00:18.449> longest<00:00:18.810> length<00:00:19.109> it's<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
coming now the longest length it's a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.939 
coming now the longest length it's a
hundred<00:00:19.920> centimeters<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.080> at<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.320> shortest

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
hundred centimeters and at the shortest

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.640 
hundred centimeters and at the shortest
so<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:24.029> longest<00:00:24.420> length<00:00:24.630> would<00:00:24.900> go<00:00:25.289> through

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
so the longest length would go through

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.689 
so the longest length would go through
the<00:00:26.580> last<00:00:26.789> hole<00:00:27.500> 100<00:00:28.500> centimeters<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.279> at<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the last hole 100 centimeters and at the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.600 
the last hole 100 centimeters and at the
shortest<00:00:30.119> length<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.630> 96<00:00:31.320> centimeters<00:00:31.650> now

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
shortest length it's 96 centimeters now

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.670 
shortest length it's 96 centimeters now
that's<00:00:33.059> only<00:00:33.210> 4<00:00:33.540> centimeters<00:00:34.140> centimeters

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
that's only 4 centimeters centimeters

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.979 
that's only 4 centimeters centimeters
difference<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:36.059> doesn't<00:00:36.300> really<00:00:36.600> make<00:00:36.960> any

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
difference that doesn't really make any

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.709 
difference that doesn't really make any
difference<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.860> me<00:00:37.980> considering<00:00:38.550> I'm<00:00:39.059> 5<00:00:39.450> foot

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
difference to me considering I'm 5 foot

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.590 
difference to me considering I'm 5 foot
it's<00:00:40.110> not<00:00:40.290> still<00:00:40.559> quite<00:00:40.890> long<00:00:41.160> even<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.180> even

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
it's not still quite long even if even

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.619 
it's not still quite long even if even
wearing<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.230> crossbody<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.030> I've<00:00:45.149> done<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
wearing a crossbody so what I've done is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.369 
wearing a crossbody so what I've done is
I've<00:00:46.140> found<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.800> way<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.550> actually<00:00:47.960> shorten<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
I've found a way to actually shorten the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.389 
I've found a way to actually shorten the
strap<00:00:49.710> without<00:00:50.610> cutting<00:00:51.210> anything<00:00:51.649> I<00:00:52.649> don't

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
strap without cutting anything I don't

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.389 
strap without cutting anything I don't
even<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:54.600> need<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> whole<00:00:55.949> I've

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
even really need to do a whole I've

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.400 
even really need to do a whole I've
found<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.120> actually<00:00:57.660> held<00:00:58.050> even

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
found that it's actually held even

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.860 
found that it's actually held even
though<00:00:58.789> there's<00:00:59.789> no<00:00:59.969> hole<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.510> I'll<00:01:00.660> explain

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
though there's no hole so I'll explain

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.920 
though there's no hole so I'll explain
that<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.649> what<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:03.180> obviously

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that to you so what I do is obviously

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.410 
that to you so what I do is obviously
you<00:01:04.619> under<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.909> from<00:01:06.119> one<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you under and do it from one of the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.370 
you under and do it from one of the
holes<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.130> it<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.250> look<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.790> now<00:01:09.720> what

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
holes so it will look like this now what

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.109 
holes so it will look like this now what
you'll<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.850> need<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.180> actually<00:01:12.990> push

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
you'll do is you need to actually push

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.859 
you'll do is you need to actually push
so<00:01:15.119> put<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.930> way<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.670> middle<00:01:18.240> circle

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
so put it that way so that middle circle

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.200 
so put it that way so that middle circle
is<00:01:19.170> sort<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.740> facing<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.820> you'll<00:01:23.970> do

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
is sort of facing out and what you'll do

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.590 
is sort of facing out and what you'll do
from<00:01:24.479> there<00:01:25.549> is<00:01:26.900> see<00:01:27.900> how<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.259> facing<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:29.600> you

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
from there is see how it's facing up you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.990 
from there is see how it's facing up you
basically<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.380> push<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:34.729> I'll<00:01:35.729> push

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
basically just push that in so I'll push

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:48.219 
basically just push that in so I'll push
it<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.540> way<00:01:43.009> right<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.920> actually

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
it that way right so you can actually

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.470 
it that way right so you can actually
play<00:01:49.229> around<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.829> got<00:01:49.979> longer

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
play around you got longer

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.280 
play around you got longer
sorry<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.890> go<00:01:53.070> short<00:01:53.370> so<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.720> will<00:01:54.930> put<00:01:55.170> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
sorry to go short so I will put it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:04.430 
sorry to go short so I will put it
through<00:01:59.660> to<00:02:00.660> I<00:02:02.930> don't<00:02:03.930> know<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.140> these<00:02:04.260> are

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
through to I don't know what these are

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:12.590 
through to I don't know what these are
called<00:02:04.470> loops<00:02:09.560> at<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.590> time<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:11.910> usually<00:02:12.150> have

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
called loops at a time so I usually have

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:29.270 
called loops at a time so I usually have
it<00:02:12.720> be<00:02:12.870> short<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.940> what<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.480> found<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:29.100> can

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
it be short so what I found is you can

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.210 
it be short so what I found is you can
either<00:02:29.550> punch<00:02:30.090> more<00:02:30.420> holes<00:02:30.750> along<00:02:31.350> there<00:02:31.650> or

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
either punch more holes along there or

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.390 
either punch more holes along there or
just<00:02:33.120> one<00:02:33.450> more<00:02:33.660> hole<00:02:33.990> with<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.740> would<00:02:35.190> have

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
just one more hole with you would have

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.780 
just one more hole with you would have
it<00:02:35.580> at<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.210> decide<00:02:36.540> length<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.980> actually

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
it at the decide length I actually

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.390 
it at the decide length I actually
haven't<00:02:39.240> done<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.750> I've<00:02:39.930> found<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.530> um<00:02:40.770> it

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
haven't done that I've found that um it

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.700 
haven't done that I've found that um it
actually<00:02:41.940> stays<00:02:44.030> even<00:02:45.030> though<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.570> bit<00:02:46.500> heavy

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
actually stays even though I a bit heavy

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.250 
actually stays even though I a bit heavy
as<00:02:49.710> you<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.100> see<00:02:50.370> if<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.910> pulled<00:02:54.020> not<00:02:55.020> much

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
as you can see if I pulled not much

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.340 
as you can see if I pulled not much
really<00:02:55.709> happens<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:57.120> that's<00:02:57.630> completely<00:02:57.959> up

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
really happens so that's completely up

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.960 
really happens so that's completely up
to<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.650> if<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.860> wish<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.280> do<00:03:00.209> another<00:03:00.480> hole

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
to you if you wish to do another hole

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.100 
to you if you wish to do another hole
and<00:03:03.680> if<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.800> can<00:03:04.980> see<00:03:05.270> it's<00:03:06.270> definitely<00:03:06.690> much

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
and if you can see it's definitely much

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.350 
and if you can see it's definitely much
shorter<00:03:07.560> less<00:03:08.280> hanging<00:03:08.610> when<00:03:09.090> you're

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
shorter less hanging when you're

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.070 
shorter less hanging when you're
carrying<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> crook<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.830> your<00:03:10.890> arm
