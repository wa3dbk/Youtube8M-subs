I sell a lot of iBook and MacBook
computers<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.899> most<00:00:07.049> common<00:00:07.500> question

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
computers and the most common question

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.009 
computers and the most common question
my<00:00:07.950> customers<00:00:08.429> ask<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:09.030> what<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
my customers ask is what is the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.320 
my customers ask is what is the
difference<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.610> I've<00:00:11.610> made<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.000> video<00:00:12.210> to

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
difference so I've made this video to

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.060 
difference so I've made this video to
hopefully<00:00:12.570> answer<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.349> as<00:00:13.500> completely<00:00:13.889> as

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
hopefully answer that as completely as

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.210 
hopefully answer that as completely as
possible<00:00:15.049> first<00:00:16.049> let's<00:00:16.470> examine<00:00:16.619> how<00:00:16.949> they

Windows PCs now let's talk about some of
the<00:00:54.510> differences<00:00:56.120> first<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:57.480> it's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the differences first I think it's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.090 
the differences first I think it's
important<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> understand<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> last

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
important to understand that the last

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.599 
important to understand that the last
ebooks<00:00:59.579> were<00:00:59.730> manufactured<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.539> 2006<00:01:01.500> at<00:01:01.859> this

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
ebooks were manufactured in 2006 at this

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.399 
ebooks were manufactured in 2006 at this
point<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.090> MacBook<00:01:03.539> was<00:01:03.719> introduced<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.379> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
point the MacBook was introduced as a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.710 
point the MacBook was introduced as a
replacement<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> iBook<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.540> most

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
replacement to the iBook the most

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240 
replacement to the iBook the most
important<00:01:07.229> difference<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:07.770> would<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
important difference of all would be the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.170 
important difference of all would be the
