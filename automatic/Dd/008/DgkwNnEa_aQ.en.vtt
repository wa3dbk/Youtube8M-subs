driving<00:03:38.660> you're<00:03:38.810> doing<00:03:39.110> or<00:03:39.380> you're<00:03:39.980> just<00:03:40.010> your

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
driving you're doing or you're just your

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.190 
driving you're doing or you're just your
general<00:03:40.489> preference<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:41.690> that's<00:03:41.989> always

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
general preference and so that's always

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.800 
general preference and so that's always
kind<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.680> neat<00:03:42.830> thing<00:03:42.860> in<00:03:43.220> any<00:03:43.430> car<00:03:43.790> but<00:03:44.630> the

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
kind of a neat thing in any car but the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.750 
kind of a neat thing in any car but the
problem<00:03:45.260> this<00:03:45.380> car<00:03:45.620> has<00:03:45.860> is<00:03:46.250> they've<00:03:46.550> also

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
problem this car has is they've also

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.479 
problem this car has is they've also
sort<00:03:47.150> of<00:03:47.209> tried<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.630> create<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.290> stiff<00:03:49.280> on

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
sort of tried to create this stiff on

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.430 
sort of tried to create this stiff on
centre<00:03:49.910> feel<00:03:50.209> with<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.510> power<00:03:50.690> steering<00:03:51.290> and

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
centre feel with the power steering and

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.220 
centre feel with the power steering and
it<00:03:52.160> actually<00:03:52.340> has<00:03:52.850> a<00:03:52.880> stickiness<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:53.989> so

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
it actually has a stickiness to it so

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.310 
it actually has a stickiness to it so
whenever<00:03:54.410> you<00:03:54.709> go<00:03:54.830> off-center<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:56.810> just<00:03:57.140> it

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
whenever you go off-center it just it

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.750 
whenever you go off-center it just it
feels<00:03:57.470> like<00:03:57.680> it's<00:03:57.830> sticking<00:03:58.070> and<00:03:58.400> then<00:03:58.519> you

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
feels like it's sticking and then you

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.220 
feels like it's sticking and then you
have<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:59.000> break<00:03:59.209> past

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
have to break past

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.830 
have to break past
and<00:04:00.380> so<00:04:00.920> when<00:04:01.099> you're<00:04:01.190> going<00:04:01.370> straight<00:04:01.840> it's

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
and so when you're going straight it's

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.479 
and so when you're going straight it's
just<00:04:03.140> always<00:04:03.410> something<00:04:04.069> that<00:04:04.099> you<00:04:04.250> feel<00:04:04.459> like

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
just always something that you feel like

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.729 
just always something that you feel like
you've<00:04:04.760> got<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:05.030> correct<00:04:05.330> for<00:04:05.599> because<00:04:06.050> it

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
you've got to correct for because it

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.320 
you've got to correct for because it
wants<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.190> stick<00:04:07.400> in<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.640> certain<00:04:07.970> spot<00:04:08.300> and

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
wants to stick in a certain spot and

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.140 
wants to stick in a certain spot and
doesn't<00:04:08.959> really<00:04:09.280> allow<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.610> do<00:04:10.880> really

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
doesn't really allow you to do really

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.660 
doesn't really allow you to do really
minut<00:04:11.690> corrections<00:04:12.380> without<00:04:12.800> breaking<00:04:13.430> past

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
minut corrections without breaking past

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.760 
minut corrections without breaking past
this<00:04:14.000> stick<00:04:14.420> point<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:15.290> so<00:04:15.500> when<00:04:15.650> you're

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
this stick point and so when you're

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.340 
this stick point and so when you're
going<00:04:15.980> straight<00:04:16.130> like<00:04:16.489> this<00:04:16.639> right<00:04:16.850> here<00:04:17.350> you

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
going straight like this right here you

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.530 
going straight like this right here you
just<00:04:18.820> Corrections<00:04:19.820> or<00:04:20.030> something<00:04:20.359> that<00:04:20.480> you

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
just Corrections or something that you

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.170 
just Corrections or something that you
constantly<00:04:21.169> have<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.500> do<00:04:21.799> just<00:04:22.490> like<00:04:22.669> any<00:04:22.910> car

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
constantly have to do just like any car

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.150 
constantly have to do just like any car
but<00:04:23.480> you<00:04:23.600> feel<00:04:23.900> them<00:04:24.200> more<00:04:24.440> here<00:04:24.770> because

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
but you feel them more here because

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.800 
but you feel them more here because
you're<00:04:25.400> breaking<00:04:25.730> past<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.210> stick<00:04:26.540> point

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
you're breaking past that stick point

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.080 
you're breaking past that stick point
and<00:04:27.380> no<00:04:27.560> adjusting<00:04:28.070> here<00:04:28.340> seems<00:04:28.700> to<00:04:28.880> change

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
and no adjusting here seems to change

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.020 
and no adjusting here seems to change
that<00:04:29.419> at<00:04:29.570> all<00:04:29.720> it's<00:04:30.080> just<00:04:30.320> very<00:04:30.530> bizarre<00:04:31.030> under

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.210 

now<00:04:53.520> power<00:04:53.760> from<00:04:54.030> this<00:04:54.150> 1.6<00:04:54.840> liter<00:04:55.050> engine<00:04:55.220> not

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.590 
too bad at it as you saw a torque steer
really<00:04:58.410> isn't<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:58.860> bad<00:04:59.100> at<00:04:59.310> all<00:04:59.430> either<00:04:59.790> now

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
really isn't that bad at all either now

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.530 
really isn't that bad at all either now
I<00:05:00.930> say<00:05:01.350> that<00:05:01.620> in<00:05:02.040> its<00:05:02.280> own<00:05:02.430> context<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.360> what<00:05:03.510> I

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
I say that in its own context and what I

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.080 
I say that in its own context and what I
mean<00:05:03.750> by<00:05:03.810> that<00:05:04.110> well<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.920> GTI<00:05:05.250> and<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.820> Ford

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
mean by that well the GTI and the Ford

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.240 
mean by that well the GTI and the Ford
Focus<00:05:06.300> ST<00:05:06.690> both<00:05:07.140> have<00:05:07.410> quite<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:07.890> bit<00:05:08.100> more

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
Focus ST both have quite a bit more

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.120 
Focus ST both have quite a bit more
horsepower<00:05:08.460> than<00:05:09.120> this<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.900> GTI<00:05:10.320> about<00:05:10.650> 25

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
horsepower than this the GTI about 25

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.080 
horsepower than this the GTI about 25
more<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:11.730> the<00:05:12.060> Ford<00:05:12.390> Focus<00:05:12.830> well<00:05:13.830> 40<00:05:14.460> or<00:05:14.700> more

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
more and the Ford Focus well 40 or more

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.020 
more and the Ford Focus well 40 or more
better<00:05:15.750> so<00:05:16.290> we're<00:05:16.860> not<00:05:16.980> quite<00:05:17.160> as<00:05:17.340> powerful<00:05:17.910> as

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
better so we're not quite as powerful as

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.580 
better so we're not quite as powerful as
those<00:05:18.240> but<00:05:18.540> this<00:05:18.750> engine<00:05:19.110> does<00:05:19.320> have<00:05:19.560> a

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
those but this engine does have a

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.350 
those but this engine does have a
pleasant<00:05:20.010> power<00:05:20.370> curve<00:05:20.700> puts<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.060> bit<00:05:21.210> of<00:05:21.300> a

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
pleasant power curve puts a bit of a

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.090 
pleasant power curve puts a bit of a
kick<00:05:21.600> in<00:05:21.750> your<00:05:21.870> back<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:22.410> doesn't<00:05:22.890> have<00:05:23.040> a

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
kick in your back and doesn't have a

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.230 
kick in your back and doesn't have a
terrible<00:05:23.640> sound

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
terrible sound

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.970 
terrible sound
this<00:05:24.630> transmission<00:05:24.960> actually<00:05:25.470> does<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.650> pretty

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
this transmission actually does a pretty

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.040 
this transmission actually does a pretty
good<00:05:26.100> job<00:05:26.250> of<00:05:26.490> doing<00:05:26.640> this<00:05:26.970> shifts<00:05:27.390> both<00:05:27.780> up

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
good job of doing this shifts both up

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.810

almost<00:07:24.090> take<00:07:24.450> it<00:07:24.570> to<00:07:24.690> the<00:07:24.780> dealership<00:07:25.290> if<00:07:25.410> I

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.530 
almost take it to the dealership if I

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.810 
almost take it to the dealership if I
owned<00:07:25.710> it<00:07:25.830> and<00:07:25.920> say<00:07:26.040> what's<00:07:26.250> wrong<00:07:26.460> with<00:07:26.520> my

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:26.820 
owned it and say what's wrong with my

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.760 
owned it and say what's wrong with my
car<00:07:27.090> but<00:07:27.420> I've<00:07:27.720> read<00:07:27.990> plenty<00:07:28.050> of<00:07:28.590> other

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770 
car but I've read plenty of other

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.220 
car but I've read plenty of other
reports<00:07:29.310> from<00:07:29.490> other<00:07:29.730> media<00:07:30.180> outlets<00:07:30.240> talking

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.230

about<00:07:31.470> the<00:07:32.040> same<00:07:32.280> thing<00:07:32.610> so<00:07:32.940> I<00:07:33.120> tend<00:07:33.810> not<00:07:33.870> to

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 
about the same thing so I tend not to

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.810 
about the same thing so I tend not to
think<00:07:34.170> it's<00:07:34.500> an<00:07:34.620> issue<00:07:34.770> with<00:07:35.070> our<00:07:35.190> tester<00:07:35.640> here

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:35.820 
think it's an issue with our tester here

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.420 
think it's an issue with our tester here
so<00:07:36.060> that<00:07:36.210> said<00:07:36.540> the<00:07:36.780> car<00:07:36.990> gets<00:07:37.200> 3<00:07:37.560> out<00:07:37.770> of<00:07:38.070> 5

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.430 
so that said the car gets 3 out of 5

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.670 
so that said the car gets 3 out of 5
