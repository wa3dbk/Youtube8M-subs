00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.930
 o'clock are great 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.890
 I'm going to choose this one called ruiz 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.310
 o'clock brownies and they are three types of 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.490
 brown tsitos and I will create this look 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.170
 perfect for an appointment at night I'll 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.259
 start by applying a little bit of the base 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.300
 cover mad on my eyelids so that the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.729
 Makeup with the men is very much 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.729
 cutest adhere and last longer 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.960
 I'm going to take this dark brown first 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.869
 from here and I'm going to apply from the 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.150
 outer part of my eye halfway 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.369
 of the mobile eyelid as well as they are 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.690
 watching and this is going to create a depth 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.690
 very beautiful 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.960
 I'm going to take this same color and I'm going 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.590
 to slide under the eyelashes 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.690
 lower this will give amplitude to 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.150
 our eyes and also that it will create a 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.680
 smoky effect that makes our eyes 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.680
 look very sensual 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.150
 Now I'm going to take the color of half 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.849
 this although it has a little bit of brown 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.140
 over there it also has a little red 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:41.750
 of pink so it's a pretty color 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.150
 different pretty and I'm going to mix it 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.730
 also a little bit with the dark brown that 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.620
 we applied a moment ago and this is going to 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.620
 Give a very nice effect on the eyes 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.600
 Now I'm going to take this brush and the color 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.510
 lighter to illuminate below the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.700
 eyebrows and also the lacrimal ones remember 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.730
 to illuminate is super important because 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.870
 it attracts light to our eyes and makes 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.870
 that stand out much more 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.200
 Now let's add a little bit of 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.200
 intensity to our gaze with the 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.360
 twist eyeliner in black abstraction ' 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.550
 this is a black color and we are going to 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.560
 delineate inside the eyes and 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.200
 we are also going to delineate over the 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.540
 upper lashes we're not going to make a 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.940
 line too dramatic too 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.030
 thick or anything like that we just go 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.790
 to make our eyelashes look 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.530
 more abundant we are going to create that effect 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.530
 with this outlined 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.940
 yes 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.710
 now we go back to our base and in this 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.040
 I am going to apply it in all the 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.660
 face you already know to eliminate the 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.300
 imperfections leave a super face 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.410
 cute well prepared and then I'm going to 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.220
 seal this base with the powders 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.100
 undercover that are a powder 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.130
 translucent that will seal the base and 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.500
 they're going to leave our skin a bit nuanced 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.170
 for much longer but mostly without 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.480
 reload the face now I'm going to finish 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.480

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.790

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.010

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.690

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.260
