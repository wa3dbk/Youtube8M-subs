- 527 oh so now okay
we<00:00:13.889> have<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.250> subtract<00:00:14.790> from<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.509> right<00:00:15.719> hand

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
we have to subtract from the right hand

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.730 
we have to subtract from the right hand
side<00:00:15.990> right

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
side right

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.029 
side right
okay<00:00:17.430> then<00:00:18.000> first<00:00:18.990> thing<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.470> have<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.830> look

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
okay then first thing you have to look

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.900 
okay then first thing you have to look
at<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.119> four<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.810> seven<00:00:22.590> that's<00:00:23.340> it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
at it of four and seven that's it

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.380 
at it of four and seven that's it
so<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:24.600> call<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.320> once<00:00:25.710> digit<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:26.880> four

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
so we call this one once digit but four

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.519 
so we call this one once digit but four
-<00:00:28.050> seven

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
- seven

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.189 
- seven

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
this is going to be we have the power of

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.270 
this is going to be we have the power of
one<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.640> means<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.510> gonna<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.280> see
