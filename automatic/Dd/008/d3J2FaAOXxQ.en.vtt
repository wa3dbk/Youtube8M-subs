what would you have done we were looking

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.700 
what would you have done we were looking
to<00:01:44.340> boil<00:01:44.579> first<00:01:44.729> also<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.240> VHS<00:01:45.600> well<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.680> far

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
to boil first also in a VHS well so far

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.590 
to boil first also in a VHS well so far
in<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> tournament<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.360> was<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
in the in the tournament so that was the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.149 
in the in the tournament so that was the
only<00:01:48.689> reason<00:01:48.960> apart<00:01:49.320> from<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.799> don't

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
only reason apart from that I don't

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.560 
only reason apart from that I don't
think<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.369> wicket<00:01:50.610> will<00:01:50.759> change<00:01:51.000> moschino

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
think the wicket will change moschino

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.030 
think the wicket will change moschino
looks<00:01:51.899> likely<00:01:52.350> better<00:01:52.500> than<00:01:52.710> some<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
looks likely better than some of the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.770 
looks likely better than some of the
wickets<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.880> reason<00:01:54.149> being<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.420> groundsman

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
wickets the reason being the groundsman

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.389 
wickets the reason being the groundsman

brilliantly<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.340> one<00:02:15.460> more<00:02:15.640> game<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.060> go<00:02:16.180> and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
brilliantly so one more game to go and

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.150 
brilliantly so one more game to go and
hopefully<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.200> middle<00:02:17.620> already<00:02:17.920> stressed

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
hopefully the middle already stressed

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.830 
hopefully the middle already stressed
will<00:02:18.340> be<00:02:18.490> up<00:02:18.580> for<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.790> some<00:02:19.330> people<00:02:19.600> are<00:02:19.690> saying

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
will be up for it some people are saying

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.150 
will be up for it some people are saying
that<00:02:19.990> you've<00:02:20.170> had<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.740> slightly<00:02:20.980> easier

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
that you've had it slightly easier

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.950 
that you've had it slightly easier
because<00:02:21.610> you've<00:02:21.820> been<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.120> dominating<00:02:22.810> you're

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
because you've been so dominating you're

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.600 
because you've been so dominating you're
not<00:02:23.080> had<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> really<00:02:23.500> tough<00:02:23.680> game<00:02:24.100> South<00:02:24.280> Africa

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
not had a really tough game South Africa

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.580 
not had a really tough game South Africa
was<00:02:24.730> tough<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.090> other<00:02:25.210> day<00:02:25.390> do<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.350> believe

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
was tough the other day do you believe

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.580 
was tough the other day do you believe
in<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.910> not<00:02:27.910> really<00:02:28.210> though<00:02:28.390> because<00:02:28.570> of<00:02:28.750> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
in that not really though because of the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.280 
in that not really though because of the
trickier<00:02:29.950> targets<00:02:30.460> to<00:02:30.550> chase<00:02:30.760> other<00:02:31.080> 135<00:02:32.080> than

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
trickier targets to chase other 135 than

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.170 
trickier targets to chase other 135 than
the<00:02:32.380> 130s<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.070> know<00:02:33.190> more<00:02:33.760> often<00:02:33.910> than<00:02:34.120> not

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
the 130s you know more often than not

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.730 
the 130s you know more often than not
when<00:02:34.420> you're<00:02:34.540> chasing<00:02:34.720> 180<00:02:35.140> Orleans<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.650> know

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
when you're chasing 180 Orleans you know

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.860

what<00:02:35.980> needs<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.430> be<00:02:36.550> done<00:02:36.580> but<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.360> 130s

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
what needs to be done but it's the 130s

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.380 
what needs to be done but it's the 130s
and<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.020> 35<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.710> that<00:02:39.010> really<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:40.120> know<00:02:40.210> push

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and the 35 so that really you know push

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.450 
and the 35 so that really you know push
you<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.660> think<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.960> bit<00:02:41.080> too<00:02:41.260> much<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:41.740> I<00:02:41.950> feel<00:02:42.340> we

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
you to think a bit too much so I feel we

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.580 
you to think a bit too much so I feel we
got<00:02:42.490> we<00:02:43.150> didn't<00:02:43.330> have<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:43.690> easy<00:02:43.720> yes<00:02:44.380> maybe

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
got we didn't have it so easy yes maybe

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.260 
got we didn't have it so easy yes maybe
the<00:02:44.800> small<00:02:45.010> card<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.340> suggesting<00:02:45.820> something

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
the small card is suggesting something

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.480 
the small card is suggesting something
but<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.810> feel<00:02:47.170> still<00:02:47.380> we<00:02:47.530> had<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.680> tough<00:02:47.890> one<00:02:48.070> and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
but I feel still we had a tough one and

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.770 
but I feel still we had a tough one and
