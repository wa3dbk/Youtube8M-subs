fast forward past not worth anything to

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.120 
fast forward past not worth anything to
us<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:26.149> we're<00:01:27.049> actually<00:01:27.350> suggesting<00:01:28.039> that

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
us and so we're actually suggesting that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.029 
us and so we're actually suggesting that
in<00:01:28.460> fact<00:01:28.759> maybe<00:01:29.659> that's<00:01:30.020> completely<00:01:30.649> wrong

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
in fact maybe that's completely wrong

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.910 
in fact maybe that's completely wrong
and<00:01:31.340> those<00:01:32.090> fast<00:01:32.479> forwarded<00:01:32.960> spots<00:01:33.229> we<00:01:33.770> need

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
and those fast forwarded spots we need

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.459 
and those fast forwarded spots we need
to<00:01:34.009> rethink<00:01:34.490> whether<00:01:35.179> and<00:01:35.689> what<00:01:36.079> the<00:01:36.259> real

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
to rethink whether and what the real

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.160 
to rethink whether and what the real
value<00:01:36.920> is<00:01:37.069> for<00:01:37.369> folks<00:01:37.520> we<00:01:38.359> wanted<00:01:38.749> to<00:01:38.869> get<00:01:39.049> our

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
value is for folks we wanted to get our

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.700 
value is for folks we wanted to get our
heads<00:01:39.409> around<00:01:39.530> what<00:01:40.119> happens<00:01:41.119> if<00:01:41.270> I<00:01:41.390> see<00:01:41.710> one

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
heads around what happens if I see one

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.880 
heads around what happens if I see one
brand<00:01:42.950> really<00:01:43.490> quickly<00:01:44.140> then<00:01:45.140> another<00:01:45.649> brand

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
brand really quickly then another brand

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.779 
brand really quickly then another brand
really<00:01:46.039> quickly<00:01:46.539> do<00:01:47.539> these<00:01:47.749> to<00:01:48.280> co-mingle<00:01:49.280> in

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
really quickly do these to co-mingle in

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.090 
really quickly do these to co-mingle in
some<00:01:50.240> interesting<00:01:50.539> way<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.799> answer<00:01:51.829> of

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
some interesting way and the answer of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.059 
some interesting way and the answer of
course<00:01:52.310> is<00:01:52.729> that<00:01:52.819> they<00:01:53.509> do<00:01:53.569> and<00:01:54.079> one<00:01:54.889> of<00:01:54.920> the

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
course is that they do and one of the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.419 
course is that they do and one of the
key<00:01:55.249> features<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:57.399> similarity<00:01:58.399> or

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
key features is the similarity or

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.239 
key features is the similarity or
dissimilarity<00:01:58.759> between<00:01:59.329> these<00:01:59.899> two<00:02:00.249> brands

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
dissimilarity between these two brands

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:02.879 
dissimilarity between these two brands
that<00:02:01.369> you're<00:02:01.520> exposed<00:02:01.909> to<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:02.270> for<00:02:02.420> example<00:02:02.749> a

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:02.889 
that you're exposed to so for example a

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.309 
that you're exposed to so for example a
brand<00:02:03.889> might<00:02:04.639> have<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.090> personality<00:02:05.659> like<00:02:05.959> we

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
brand might have a personality like we

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.160 
brand might have a personality like we
people<00:02:06.530> do<00:02:06.859> and<00:02:07.100> one<00:02:07.789> brand<00:02:08.030> might<00:02:08.270> be<00:02:08.420> sincere

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
people do and one brand might be sincere

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.380 
people do and one brand might be sincere
and<00:02:09.860> another<00:02:10.640> brand<00:02:10.910> might<00:02:11.090> be<00:02:11.209> really

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
and another brand might be really

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.680 
and another brand might be really
exciting<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.970> normally<00:02:13.970> traditionally

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
media experts have argued that we want
