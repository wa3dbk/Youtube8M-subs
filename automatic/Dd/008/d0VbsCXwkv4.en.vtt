00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
very long time to kill that's that's

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.920 
very long time to kill that's that's
basically<00:02:40.500> what<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:40.770> do<00:02:40.890> but<00:02:41.220> he<00:02:41.460> will<00:02:41.900> draw<00:02:42.900> you

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930

in<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.470> spit<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:43.920> back<00:02:44.160> out<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.550> stuff<00:02:44.900> so

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
in and spit you back out and stuff so

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.040 
in and spit you back out and stuff so
it's<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.620> little<00:02:46.800> bit<00:02:46.950> hard<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.790> open<00:02:48.750> that

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
it's a little bit hard to open that

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.620 
it's a little bit hard to open that
chest<00:02:49.110> but<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.890> at<00:02:50.610> least<00:02:50.760> try<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.210> open<00:02:51.390> that
