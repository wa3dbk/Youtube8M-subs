looked at a horse's bomb not very long
exact<00:00:52.670> well<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:53.820> are<00:00:53.880> larger<00:00:54.390> than<00:00:54.420> most

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720

track in order to redress the balance I
think<00:01:07.240> it's<00:01:07.450> worth<00:01:07.600> pointing<00:01:07.780> out<00:01:07.960> we've<00:01:08.140> had

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
think it's worth pointing out we've had

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.560 
think it's worth pointing out we've had
to<00:01:08.500> complete<00:01:08.979> ID<00:01:09.130> so<00:01:09.400> far<00:01:09.640> one<00:01:10.060> from<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.330> woman

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
to complete ID so far one from a woman

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.300 
to complete ID so far one from a woman
one<00:01:10.840> from<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.050> man<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.560> woman<00:01:11.830> was<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:12.010> genius

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
one from a man the woman was a genius

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.770 
one from a man the woman was a genius
the<00:01:13.150> man<00:01:13.360> was<00:01:13.630> not<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:18.460> fat<00:01:18.790> ass<00:01:19.090> ignorant

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
the man was not you fat ass ignorant

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.070 
the man was not you fat ass ignorant
women<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.360> actually<00:01:25.660> practically

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
women is it actually practically

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.840 
women is it actually practically
possible<00:01:26.350> I'm<00:01:26.680> not<00:01:26.830> convinced<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.400> it<00:01:27.520> is<00:01:27.640> I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
possible I'm not convinced that it is I

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.980 
possible I'm not convinced that it is I
think<00:01:28.090> that<00:01:28.210> we<00:01:28.330> have<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.479> couple<00:01:28.660> of<00:01:28.840> things

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
think that we have a couple of things

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.930 
think that we have a couple of things
that<00:01:29.050> firstly<00:01:29.560> admittedly<00:01:30.310> you<00:01:30.520> would<00:01:30.700> have

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
that firstly admittedly you would have

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.790 
that firstly admittedly you would have
to<00:01:31.090> put<00:01:31.240> stabilizers<00:01:31.930> on<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.200> bike<00:01:32.350> well

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
to put stabilizers on the bike well

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.780 
to put stabilizers on the bike well
that's<00:01:32.920> lowering<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.310> down<00:01:33.340> because<00:01:33.580> that's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
that's lowering you down because that's

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.630 
that's lowering you down because that's
more<00:01:33.940> friction<00:01:34.210> already<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:35.530> could<00:01:36.250> do<00:01:36.399> but

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
more friction already it could do but

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.730 
more friction already it could do but
you<00:01:36.820> know<00:01:36.940> according<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:37.869> my<00:01:37.960> calculations

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
you know according to my calculations

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.280 
you know according to my calculations
and<00:01:39.040> they<00:01:39.250> are<00:01:39.399> very<00:01:39.430> solid<00:01:40.060> calculations<00:01:40.840> yes

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
and they are very solid calculations yes

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.290 
and they are very solid calculations yes
we're<00:01:41.890> talking<00:01:42.040> about<00:01:42.220> 180<00:01:42.759> miles<00:01:43.030> an<00:01:43.149> hour

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.550 

well<00:01:54.110> let<00:01:55.110> me<00:01:55.230> put<00:01:55.440> this<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.620> you<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:56.930> man<00:01:57.930> can

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
well let me put this to you a man can

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.550 
well let me put this to you a man can
run<00:01:58.740> at<00:01:58.950> 10<00:01:59.250> miles<00:01:59.520> an<00:01:59.670> hour<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.530> ride<00:02:01.530> a

motorbike 100 miles on her horse
motorbike<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:13.280> think<00:02:14.280> one<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.700> great

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
motorbike I think one of the great

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.420 
motorbike I think one of the great
advantages<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.140> mode<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.650> transport<00:02:17.280> is

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
advantages of this mode of transport is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.070 
advantages of this mode of transport is
that<00:02:17.880> we've<00:02:18.030> had<00:02:18.150> 100<00:02:18.720> years<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:18.960> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
that we've had 100 years of the

emissions from a horse pike are going to

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.790 
emissions from a horse pike are going to
be<00:02:26.910> pretty<00:02:27.090> obvious<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.780> emissions<00:02:28.440> from<00:02:28.590> the

the show before no we do physically
build<00:03:02.709> as<00:03:02.860> many<00:03:02.980> things<00:03:03.190> as<00:03:03.400> we<00:03:03.909> can<00:03:04.150> well<00:03:04.690> we

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810

on<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.519> computer<00:03:12.940> if<00:03:13.030> they<00:03:13.120> could<00:03:13.269> build

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
on a computer if they could build

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.780 
on a computer if they could build
something<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.989> showed<00:03:14.409> it<00:03:14.709> working<00:03:15.129> this<00:03:15.640> is

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
something that showed it working this is

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.460 
something that showed it working this is
apparently<00:03:16.299> i<00:03:16.420> believe<00:03:16.870> technically

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
apparently i believe technically

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.220 
apparently i believe technically
accurate<00:03:17.670> what<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.819> would<00:03:19.060> sound<00:03:19.360> like<00:03:19.510> if<00:03:19.870> a

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
accurate what it would sound like if a

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.750 
accurate what it would sound like if a
horse<00:03:20.409> were<00:03:20.680> on<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:20.950> bike<00:03:21.159> and<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.400> think<00:03:21.579> you<00:03:21.640> can

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
horse were on a bike and I think you can

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:37.240 
horse were on a bike and I think you can
tell<00:03:21.909> they're<00:03:22.060> not<00:03:22.239> going<00:03:22.390> 180<00:03:22.870> miles<00:03:23.170> an<00:03:23.230> hour

I think is interesting
there<00:03:44.970> are<00:03:45.090> sound<00:03:45.390> engineer<00:03:45.780> doesn't<00:03:46.140> majan

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
there are sound engineer doesn't majan

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.790 
there are sound engineer doesn't majan
that<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.739> horse<00:03:46.950> will<00:03:47.220> want<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.519> use<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:48.060> bell
