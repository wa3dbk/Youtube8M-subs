can see it's taking a bite right out of

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.410 
can see it's taking a bite right out of
that<00:01:08.710> wood<00:01:08.979> it's<00:01:09.729> going<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:09.939> saw<00:01:10.179> right

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
that wood it's going to saw right

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.429 
that wood it's going to saw right
through<00:01:10.659> it<00:01:12.149> no<00:01:13.149> if<00:01:13.270> I<00:01:13.329> was<00:01:13.509> sawing<00:01:14.020> something

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
through it no if I was sawing something

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.830 
through it no if I was sawing something
really<00:01:14.679> hard<00:01:14.950> be<00:01:15.759> careful<00:01:16.179> with<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.450> saw<00:01:16.630> that

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
really hard be careful with the saw that

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.940 
really hard be careful with the saw that
you<00:01:16.929> don't<00:01:17.079> get<00:01:17.170> this<00:01:17.259> all<00:01:17.469> really<00:01:17.679> hot

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
you don't get this all really hot

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.130 
you don't get this all really hot
because<00:01:18.640> if<00:01:18.789> the<00:01:18.880> saw<00:01:19.090> blade<00:01:19.329> gets<00:01:19.569> hot<00:01:19.780> the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
because if the saw blade gets hot the

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.779 
because if the saw blade gets hot the
chain<00:01:20.409> what's<00:01:21.069> going<00:01:21.219> to<00:01:21.280> end<00:01:21.399> up<00:01:21.429> happening

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
chain what's going to end up happening

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.749 
chain what's going to end up happening
with<00:01:21.999> it<00:01:22.210> it's<00:01:22.719> going<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.899> split<00:01:23.429> so<00:01:24.429> when<00:01:24.639> I'm

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
with it it's going to split so when I'm

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.270 
with it it's going to split so when I'm
about<00:01:24.969> halfway<00:01:25.270> point<00:01:28.920> I'm<00:01:29.920> just<00:01:30.130> going<00:01:30.249> to

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
little barbs on the blades it's going to

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.789 
little barbs on the blades it's going to
cut<00:01:42.729> through<00:01:42.880> here<00:01:43.149> really<00:01:43.719> nice<00:01:43.869> it<00:01:44.469> may<00:01:44.649> get

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
cut through here really nice it may get

cut through here really nice it may get
bound<00:01:45.009> up<00:01:45.189> once<00:01:45.399> in<00:01:45.549> a<00:01:45.609> while<00:01:45.789> what<00:01:46.749> does<00:01:46.899> a

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
bound up once in a while what does a

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.200 
bound up once in a while what does a
good<00:01:47.109> job

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.179 

and<00:01:51.210> there<00:01:51.359> we<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.679> beautiful<00:01:52.679> clean<00:01:52.920> cut

and there we have it beautiful clean cut

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.419 
and there we have it beautiful clean cut
so<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.119> right<00:01:54.420> through<00:01:55.159> one<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> other

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
so on right through one of the other

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.010 
so on right through one of the other
things<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.030> do<00:01:57.179> with<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.509> saw<00:01:57.810> is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
things that you can do with this saw is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.709 
things that you can do with this saw is
make<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.590> into<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> bow<00:01:59.310> saw<00:01:59.609> instead<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.569> using

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
make it into a bow saw instead of using

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.719 
make it into a bow saw instead of using
the<00:02:00.899> tooth<00:02:01.140> loss<00:02:01.439> method<00:02:01.890> which<00:02:02.039> can<00:02:02.280> get

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
the tooth loss method which can get

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.889 
the tooth loss method which can get
really<00:02:02.850> inefficient<00:02:03.119> if<00:02:03.539> you're<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.840> a

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
really inefficient if you're in a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.840 
really inefficient if you're in a
survival<00:02:04.049> situation<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.429> lots<00:02:05.700> of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
survival situation and you have lots of

it probably should try to have a little
bit<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.169> a<00:04:20.290> bow<00:04:20.470> in<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.739> just<00:04:21.190> like<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:21.639> so

bit of a bow in it just like this so

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.420 
bit of a bow in it just like this so
what<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:22.720> need<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.930> do<00:04:23.169> is<00:04:23.530> cut<00:04:23.860> this<00:04:24.010> end<00:04:24.250> off

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
what I need to do is cut this end off

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.750 
what I need to do is cut this end off
and<00:04:24.790> make<00:04:25.419> it<00:04:25.600> into<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:26.080> nice<00:04:26.380> bow<00:04:27.040> shape<00:04:27.370> that

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
and make it into a nice bow shape that

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.120 
and make it into a nice bow shape that
way<00:04:27.970> when<00:04:28.150> that's<00:04:28.330> nice<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.780> hard<00:04:28.990> nice<00:04:29.860> and

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
way when that's nice and hard nice and

way when that's nice and hard nice and
taut<00:04:30.340> I<00:04:30.610> can<00:04:31.000> do<00:04:31.150> sawing<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.110> lot<00:04:32.260> more

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
taut I can do sawing a lot more

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.850 
taut I can do sawing a lot more
efficiently<00:04:32.919> than<00:04:33.130> using<00:04:33.580> two<00:04:34.150> hands<00:04:34.710> now<00:04:35.710> one

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
efficiently than using two hands now one

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.770 
efficiently than using two hands now one
of<00:04:35.890> those<00:04:36.039> little<00:04:36.160> edges<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.180> chopped<00:04:37.539> off

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
of those little edges that I chopped off

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.500 
of those little edges that I chopped off
right<00:04:38.650> there<00:04:38.919> that<00:04:39.760> is<00:04:39.970> going<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.180> hold<00:04:40.330> that

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
right there that is going to hold that

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.070 
right there that is going to hold that
on<00:04:40.720> so<00:04:41.560> it<00:04:41.680> won't<00:04:41.800> pull<00:04:42.070> off<00:04:42.330> again<00:04:43.330> I<00:04:43.539> know<00:04:43.750> now

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
on so it won't pull off again I know now

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.080 
on so it won't pull off again I know now
that<00:04:44.110> this<00:04:44.500> end<00:04:44.740> is<00:04:44.830> going<00:04:44.979> to<00:04:45.039> fit<00:04:45.250> so<00:04:45.910> all<00:04:46.060> I

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
that this end is going to fit so all I

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.360 
that this end is going to fit so all I
do<00:04:46.270> is<00:04:46.600> string<00:04:46.990> it<00:04:47.110> like<00:04:47.229> a<00:04:47.260> bow<00:04:47.500> I'm<00:04:48.130> going<00:04:48.280> to

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
do is string it like a bow I'm going to

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.640 
do is string it like a bow I'm going to
bend<00:04:48.580> then<00:04:49.120> bend<00:04:49.570> this<00:04:50.200> is<00:04:50.440> why<00:04:50.590> it's

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
bend then bend this is why it's

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.320 
bend then bend this is why it's
important<00:04:51.100> not<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.280> use<00:04:51.550> dead<00:04:51.789> wood<00:04:52.000> for<00:04:52.180> this

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
important not to use dead wood for this

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.690 
important not to use dead wood for this
while<00:04:52.990> you<00:04:53.110> want<00:04:53.320> something<00:04:53.680> that's<00:04:53.800> fairly

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
while you want something that's fairly

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.940 
while you want something that's fairly
flexible<00:04:55.860> look<00:04:56.860> at<00:04:56.979> that<00:04:57.160> beautiful<00:04:58.060> bow<00:04:58.600> saw

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
flexible look at that beautiful bow saw

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.320 
flexible look at that beautiful bow saw
now<00:04:59.950> we're<00:05:00.400> going<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.580> try<00:05:00.729> this<00:05:00.760> out<00:05:01.060> one<00:05:01.270> more

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
now we're going to try this out one more

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.219 
now we're going to try this out one more
time<00:05:01.479> let's<00:05:02.410> make<00:05:02.620> a<00:05:02.650> couple<00:05:02.979> of<00:05:03.070> cuts<00:05:04.110> so<00:05:05.110> now

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
time let's make a couple of cuts so now

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.930 
time let's make a couple of cuts so now
as<00:05:05.410> a<00:05:05.440> bow<00:05:05.680> saw<00:05:05.710> we're<00:05:06.280> going<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.639> exact

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
as a bow saw we're going to the exact

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.820 
as a bow saw we're going to the exact
same<00:05:07.120> thing<00:05:07.389> but<00:05:07.960> instead<00:05:08.200> of<00:05:08.320> coming<00:05:08.590> up<00:05:08.680> from

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
same thing but instead of coming up from

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.560 
same thing but instead of coming up from
the<00:05:08.889> bottom<00:05:09.130> we're<00:05:09.940> going<00:05:10.030> to<00:05:10.120> come<00:05:10.270> up<00:05:10.300> down

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
the bottom we're going to come up down

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.480 
the bottom we're going to come up down
from<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.870> top<00:05:11.020> we're<00:05:11.950> going<00:05:12.039> to<00:05:12.130> go<00:05:12.190> nice<00:05:12.460> and

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
from the top we're going to go nice and

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.570 
from the top we're going to go nice and
easy<00:05:12.789> this<00:05:13.660> takes<00:05:13.990> almost<00:05:14.650> no<00:05:14.860> energy<00:05:15.130> no

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
easy this takes almost no energy no

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.210 
easy this takes almost no energy no
effort<00:05:16.419> whatsoever<00:05:16.450> I<00:05:17.200> can<00:05:17.860> just<00:05:18.039> basically

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
effort whatsoever I can just basically

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.670 
effort whatsoever I can just basically
take<00:05:18.729> my<00:05:18.910> time<00:05:19.120> with<00:05:19.180> this<00:05:19.360> maybe<00:05:20.289> I'll<00:05:20.470> hold

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
take my time with this maybe I'll hold

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.029 
take my time with this maybe I'll hold
down<00:05:20.770> like<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:21.720> away<00:05:22.720> we<00:05:22.870> go<00:05:23.039> most

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
down like that and away we go most

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.460 
down like that and away we go most
important<00:05:24.460> thing<00:05:24.639> is<00:05:25.360> to<00:05:25.419> just<00:05:25.600> keep<00:05:25.840> at<00:05:26.440> it

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
important thing is to just keep at it

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.890 
important thing is to just keep at it
nice<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.340> easy<00:05:27.430> make<00:05:28.180> sure<00:05:28.210> that<00:05:28.360> my<00:05:28.630> blade's

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
nice and easy make sure that my blade's

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.580 
nice and easy make sure that my blade's
not<00:05:29.110> getting<00:05:29.669> too<00:05:30.669> terribly<00:05:31.210> warm<00:05:31.479> nice<00:05:32.380> and

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
not getting too terribly warm nice and

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:41.810 
not getting too terribly warm nice and
slow<00:05:33.060> cut<00:05:34.060> right<00:05:34.240> through<00:05:34.270> it

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.000 

so<00:05:42.820> look<00:05:42.970> at<00:05:43.060> that<00:05:43.210> a<00:05:43.480> lot<00:05:44.230> less<00:05:44.410> effort<00:05:44.590> than<00:05:44.830> I

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
so look at that a lot less effort than I

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.980 
so look at that a lot less effort than I
would<00:05:45.160> have<00:05:45.190> normally<00:05:45.430> had<00:05:45.760> to<00:05:45.880> use<00:05:46.090> using<00:05:46.930> the

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
would have normally had to use using the

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.230 
would have normally had to use using the
flossing<00:05:47.260> method<00:05:47.770> use<00:05:48.550> materials<00:05:49.060> right

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
flossing method use materials right

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.510 
flossing method use materials right
