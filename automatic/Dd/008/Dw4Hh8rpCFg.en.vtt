00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
actually using mirco up nut Mayo

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.100 
actually using mirco up nut Mayo
this<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.489> fake<00:02:08.940> Mayo<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.810> good<00:02:10.080> and

have<00:03:16.150> this<00:03:16.269> celery<00:03:16.569> it's<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.810> little<00:03:17.049> tricky

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
have this celery it's a little tricky

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.800 
have this celery it's a little tricky
because<00:03:17.530> it's<00:03:18.130> kind<00:03:18.459> of<00:03:18.549> what<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.970> like<00:03:19.209> like

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
because it's kind of what you like like

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.420 
because it's kind of what you like like
how<00:03:19.989> many<00:03:20.049> raisins<00:03:20.560> do<00:03:20.859> you<00:03:20.920> like<00:03:21.100> in<00:03:21.280> your

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
how many raisins do you like in your

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.250 
how many raisins do you like in your
salad<00:03:21.850> how<00:03:22.000> many<00:03:22.209> nuts<00:03:22.660> do<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:22.959> like<00:03:23.109> in<00:03:23.230> your

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
salad how many nuts do you like in your

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.509 
salad how many nuts do you like in your
salad<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:24.609> I'll<00:03:24.819> probably<00:03:25.120> end<00:03:25.389> up<00:03:25.510> doing

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
salad so I'll probably end up doing

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.309 
salad so I'll probably end up doing
