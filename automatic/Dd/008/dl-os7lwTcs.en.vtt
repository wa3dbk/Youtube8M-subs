00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.390
 alex the biomasses are stocked where they sell crushed well you can send to the 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.089
 production we will make a tour on the square then continue 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.110
 the choice of biomass we will go to the control room 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.979
 all the tips 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:16.880
 the power plant 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.580
 all the mission monitoring system - in the atmosphere and then we'll come back 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:22.949
 on 4 photos 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.579
 the first thing that hands continue the is by course the fact that 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.060
 There are no mushrooms behind us 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.550
 if this is a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.090
 a thing of which we have a very serene establishment also because it is burning 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.880
 natural biomasses 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.870
 there is no pollutant coming out of dogs also because we use a double 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.100
 filtration system we have both the filter 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.800
 the high voltage electrostatics combined with a sleeve filter and Taylor dial 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.800
 to have the same bar 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.650
 we start the material and then the plant is burned and made 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.120
 if this is our raw material the hotmail gaming timber coming from 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.030
 woods the neighboring arrived this size 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.030
 and oh, k we're in the yard to have 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.470
 minimum seasonal storage photo the market near trigoria model 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.079
 we bring the correct size to be 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.430
 if it is burned nn boiler 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.190
 philosophy where others work in orange knitwear 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.030
 branchetti 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.289
 in this way 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.979
 we must necessarily have absolute novelty of a sufficient size 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.120
 content 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.040
 and this video shows you the quality standard of the product once 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.890
 finished first 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.150
 what kind of wood is burned to trust any type of wood burned 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.070
 while the whole world all those my friends is not prized except by 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.600
 today the wood is brought to the val di non I do the chestnut 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.609
 the branches are important 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.909
 all the portals are all types of timber materials 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.000
 full house 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.670
 re in qualitatively valid to be able to be brought with me my avatar news 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.280
 your stratocaster property 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.700
 it means boiler and therefore of this maximum dimension as it confirms us 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.190
 also the same codognola engineer who also explains why 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:15.959
 these prefecture 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.209
 enables effective combustion to be obtained inside the boiler 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.189
 to minimize emissions to make maximum use of them 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.959
 energy of wood 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.769
 precisely for this reason therefore as the system designed for this 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.790
 size would make it impossible to carry out the combustion the most pieces 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.120
 large in particular of different materials that cannot but be 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.079
 comerlegno cannot be reported
