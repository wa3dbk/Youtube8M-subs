it back to a shiny luster again you can

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.070 
it back to a shiny luster again you can
notice<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.290> one's<00:02:54.560> easier<00:02:55.870> then<00:02:56.870> this

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
notice that this one's easier then this

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.050 
notice that this one's easier then this
side<00:02:57.350> because<00:02:57.799> this<00:02:58.010> side<00:02:58.250> was<00:02:58.580> smoother

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
side because this side was smoother

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.720 
side because this side was smoother
underneath<00:02:59.709> this<00:03:00.709> one<00:03:00.980> was<00:03:01.160> bumpier<00:03:01.549> because

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
underneath this one was bumpier because

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.670 
underneath this one was bumpier because
remember<00:03:01.850> all<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.239> layers<00:03:02.780> I<00:03:03.019> had<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.319> do<00:03:03.440> to

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
remember all the layers I had to do to

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.580 
remember all the layers I had to do to
get<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.400> right<00:03:04.700> pattern<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:06.380> had<00:03:06.560> a

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
get the right pattern so this had a

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.559 
get the right pattern so this had a
higher<00:03:06.890> bum<00:03:07.250> pitch<00:03:07.459> so<00:03:07.850> I'm<00:03:07.940> hoping<00:03:08.330> that

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
higher bum pitch so I'm hoping that

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.710 
higher bum pitch so I'm hoping that
that's<00:03:08.810> not<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.440> acrylic<00:03:10.100> coming<00:03:10.549> through<00:03:10.790> we

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
that's not the acrylic coming through we

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.780 
that's not the acrylic coming through we
shall<00:03:11.989> soon<00:03:12.350> see<00:03:12.380> if<00:03:13.040> after<00:03:13.430> using<00:03:13.609> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
shall soon see if after using the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.569 
shall soon see if after using the
rubbing<00:03:14.060> compound<00:03:14.530> it's<00:03:15.530> not<00:03:15.709> looking<00:03:16.010> good<00:03:16.370> I
