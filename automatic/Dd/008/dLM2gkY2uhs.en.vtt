short gaze and ambush now personally in

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.290 
short gaze and ambush now personally in
my<00:00:29.199> opinion<00:00:29.770> ambush<00:00:30.430> is<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.880> better<00:00:31.090> one

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
my opinion ambush is the better one

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.729 
my opinion ambush is the better one
because<00:00:31.660> it<00:00:31.779> gives<00:00:31.840> you<00:00:31.990> that<00:00:32.079> increase<00:00:32.529> in

because it gives you that increase in

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.250 
because it gives you that increase in
stability<00:00:32.949> along<00:00:33.760> with<00:00:33.940> the<00:00:34.059> reload<00:00:34.390> compared

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
stability along with the reload compared

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.510 
stability along with the reload compared
to<00:00:35.350> short<00:00:35.590> gaze<00:00:35.770> which<00:00:35.949> only<00:00:36.129> gives<00:00:36.280> you<00:00:36.430> that

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
to short gaze which only gives you that

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.569

perk<00:00:39.970> slot<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:41.260> my<00:00:41.440> opinion<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.890> best<00:00:42.280> perk<00:00:42.579> to

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
perk slot in my opinion the best perk to

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.750 
perk slot in my opinion the best perk to
have<00:00:42.880> here<00:00:43.510> would<00:00:43.899> be<00:00:43.930> hidden<00:00:44.350> hand<00:00:44.590> and<00:00:44.860> if

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
have here would be hidden hand and if

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.180 
have here would be hidden hand and if
you<00:00:46.059> don't<00:00:46.239> know<00:00:46.300> what<00:00:46.420> hidden<00:00:46.630> hand<00:00:46.809> does<00:00:47.079> it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
you don't know what hidden hand does it

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.069 
you don't know what hidden hand does it
increases<00:00:48.190> your<00:00:48.309> target<00:00:48.820> acquisition<00:00:49.079> which

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
increases your target acquisition which

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.200 
increases your target acquisition which
pretty<00:00:50.260> much<00:00:50.350> means<00:00:50.680> your<00:00:51.190> aim<00:00:51.460> assist<00:00:51.910> is

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
pretty much means your aim assist is

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.030 
pretty much means your aim assist is
going<00:00:52.450> to<00:00:52.510> be<00:00:52.600> increased<00:00:53.020> so<00:00:53.530> makes<00:00:53.710> it<00:00:53.829> a<00:00:53.890> lot

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
going to be increased so makes it a lot

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.720 
going to be increased so makes it a lot
easier<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:54.550> hit<00:00:54.820> headshots<00:00:55.450> on<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:56.230> enemy<00:00:56.730> now
