 running on the rounds in the field is in many 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:40.849
 championships as an uncle and then I 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:43.700
 participated with him I was leaving I saw the 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.069
 people running and then I stayed 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.920
 imagining that is the opportunity 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.489
 not cease to sing to you and the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.690
 life where the interest in running 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:59.989
 It goes from the six - year-old tip 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.950
 and I always accompanied the chosen ones 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:07.280
 I always wanted to run 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.260
 already met I had the opportunity to 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.930
 to talk to us about the support of 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.970
 your parents' family and how 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.459
 interaction in the home since you 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.189
 participates in a category that involves 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.750
 motovelocidade risk has chances of 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.500
 fall and everything 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.209
 My family is very supportive because 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.069
 she knows that it is a risky sport but 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.919
 You know that I have an excuse for 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.510
 keep it perfect and a coverall protects 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.480
 very well too 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.510
 so I can have this support 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.180
 perhaps in various places in the life of 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:46.909
 inside the lane for you, how do you do? 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.489
 deal with fear he thinks that just like 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:53.870
 do not intend to bike yourself feel 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.949
 safe and thus a matter of curve and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.900
 techniques 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.040
 the teacher taught to us each 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.669
 one more time 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.739
 and then we will improve the 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.430
 discipline after you started 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.500

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.729
 do you think the sport helped to be 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.650
 more disciplined 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:16.079

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.910
