00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 can push the lawn whether hansa 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.140
 Rostock is so good with the Balkans 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.599
 like that, let's take a look at the heat 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.759
 he can defeat the home curse interest 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.610
 coach robert roloson he had the fc 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.900
 hansa last breathed life again 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.850
 maybe hansa can do it under him 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.250
 get first home win of the year 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.400
 in the square but first makes the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.699
 adversary right pressure 22 minute benjamin 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.019
 10 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.860
 so hansa but gates are played out 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:39.079
 fights on 38 minute corner rostock and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.079
 Halil Savran head balancing 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.540
 1 to 1 to break that makes only roloson 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.260
 but his home premiere as 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.940
 transition coach celebrates the sheet 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.560
 should turn seven minutes after 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.540
 re- whistle corner münster and simon 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.900
 Scherder head the guests back in 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.320
 leadership and sets hansa down powerfully 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.390
 print 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.630
 seven minutes later corner again 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.420
 Munster and have cashed his 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.320
 hit again by a header 1 to 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.840
 3 it was not quite Julian 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.840
 Jakobs tries and is lucky 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.390
 Minster Scherder the scorer to 1 2 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.250
 fake jacobs ball still from 223 of the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.080
 Connection is restored and 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.540
 Transitional roloson can be back 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.270
 hope even scents the compensation 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.729
 this handheld game of münsters grote 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.410
 he already had yellow from now on 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.590
 platz and hansa gets the free kick 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.590
 completely right 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.299
 but halil saffron shoots easily 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.570
 bad 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.210
 no chance 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.830
 the management of the team because we 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.130
 us because I could have rewarded it 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.940
 and good demand 42 that we have a lot afterwards 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.320
 again 4 against the one thing but but 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.030
 that's how it matters 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.950
 the ball of hansa keeper jörg hahnel 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.840
 lands at the opponent 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.770
 and he does not stay long, of course 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.800
 ask two too much 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.540
 hansa has been easy since the middle of december 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.500
 no longer win in your own stadium 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.420
 Practical plan has confessed we have 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.730
 actually had four very good chance 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.830
 then have the great luck to make the goal 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.670
 is it okay then we have something 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.890
 consume that succeeded 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.970
 because either do not go down the 4 2 that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.440
 is there more in front of the statistics but 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.360
 Sounds stupid it's all result 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.520
 politics but I think that the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.720
 guys tried to do something 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.140
 we asked what I asked 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.820
 This will not be a simple Easter week 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.769
 for hansa but it's off to burghausen 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.730
 and then who sits on the trainerbank 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.730
 is not clear yet
