00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
let's start doing it this is a key piece

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.009 
let's start doing it this is a key piece
of<00:00:59.489> cloth<00:01:00.739> till<00:01:01.739> drop<00:01:02.220> there's<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.300> bowl<00:01:03.540> below

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
of cloth till drop there's a bowl below

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.710 
of cloth till drop there's a bowl below
it<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.700> these<00:01:05.700> are<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.060> thinker's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
it and these are the thinker's

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.580 
it and these are the thinker's
see<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.290> remember<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.010> step<00:01:08.310> by<00:01:08.460> step<00:01:08.760> but

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
see it's remember this step by step but

and makes it clean it together nicely
and<00:01:24.329> now<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.920> take<00:01:26.130> out<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.490> water<00:01:26.720> see<00:01:27.890> how

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and now we take out the water see how

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.690 
and now we take out the water see how
fast<00:01:32.210> for<00:01:33.210> small<00:01:33.689> family<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.289> two<00:01:34.649> or<00:01:35.640> three
