00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
mean the blood is really good the sounds

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.320

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
is really the sound is really good in

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.380 
is really the sound is really good in
this<00:02:28.420> game<00:02:28.660> um<00:02:29.820> but<00:02:30.820> yeah<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.030> mean<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.300> just

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
this game um but yeah I mean it just

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.320 
this game um but yeah I mean it just
gets<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.630> little<00:02:31.660> repetitive<00:02:32.020> after<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.500> while

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
gets a little repetitive after a while

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.700 
gets a little repetitive after a while
see<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.660> could<00:02:34.810> do<00:02:34.870> like<00:02:34.990> combos<00:02:35.440> now

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
see that you could do like combos now

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.860 
see that you could do like combos now
and<00:02:35.980> then<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.220> game<00:02:36.400> which<00:02:37.240> nothing<00:02:37.540> makes<00:02:37.690> it

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
and then the game which nothing makes it

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.120 
and then the game which nothing makes it
cool<00:02:38.320> um<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:40.030> like<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.450> said<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.930> mean<00:02:41.140> as<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
cool um but like I said I mean as the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.650 
cool um but like I said I mean as the
same<00:02:42.310> problem<00:02:42.459> for<00:02:42.760> me<00:02:42.880> at<00:02:42.970> least<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.330> last

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
same problem for me at least is the last

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.449 
same problem for me at least is the last
one<00:02:43.870> just<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.320> repetitiveness<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.280> whole

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
one just the repetitiveness of the whole

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.600 
one just the repetitiveness of the whole
of<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.570> whole<00:02:46.750> game<00:02:47.110> play
