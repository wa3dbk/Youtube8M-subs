00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.550 
buy these all the reels on the market
well<00:00:19.830> you'd<00:00:19.980> buy<00:00:20.130> these<00:00:20.420> purely<00:00:21.420> because<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
well you'd buy these purely because the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.900 
well you'd buy these purely because the

reduces<00:00:47.670> friction<00:00:47.879> enable<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> cast

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
reduces friction enable you to cast

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.600 
reduces friction enable you to cast
further<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.890> basically<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.399> want<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
further and basically what I want to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.180 
further and basically what I want to
show<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.120> basically<00:00:51.649> because<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.949> reel

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
show you is basically because this reel

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.569 
show you is basically because this reel
is<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.670> about<00:00:53.969> casting<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.629> robustness<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
is all about casting and robustness and

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.279 
is all about casting and robustness and
it<00:00:56.579> hasn't<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> got<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> bait<00:00:57.239> well<00:00:57.449> now<00:00:57.539> how<00:00:58.230> can

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
it hasn't I got a bait well now how can

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.099 
it hasn't I got a bait well now how can
I<00:00:58.530> make<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.180> faster<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.420> drag<00:01:00.690> system<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
I make this faster this drag system a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.619 
I make this faster this drag system a
bit<00:01:01.230> faster<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.309> enable<00:01:03.030> me<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.180> use<00:01:03.449> it

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
bit faster to enable me to use it

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.010 
bit faster to enable me to use it
quickly<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:04.680> fishing<00:01:05.330> basically<00:01:06.330> what

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
quickly when I'm fishing basically what

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.679 
quickly when I'm fishing basically what
we<00:01:07.110> do<00:01:07.430> is<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> insides<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.570> this

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
we do is it's what the insides and this

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.280 
we do is it's what the insides and this
will<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.900> done<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.080> very<00:01:10.229> real<00:01:10.560> very<00:01:11.150> easily

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
will be done a very real very easily

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.730 
will be done a very real very easily
what<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.310> take<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> spool<00:01:15.390> off

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
what we do is we take the spool off

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.700 
what we do is we take the spool off
inside<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.950> cap<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> nylon<00:01:18.180> Bush<00:01:18.710> if

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
inside this cap is a nylon Bush if

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.440 
inside this cap is a nylon Bush if
that's<00:01:19.950> already<00:01:20.159> there<00:01:20.520> we've<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.360> do

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
that's already there we've got to do

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.969 
that's already there we've got to do
nothing<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.290> that's<00:01:22.530> already<00:01:22.770> there

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
nothing with it and that's already there

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.230 
nothing with it and that's already there
with<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.670> we're<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> do

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
with this so we're not going to do

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.320 
with this so we're not going to do
anything<00:01:24.450> with<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.799> was<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.100> spring<00:01:26.700> we

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
anything with that if it was a spring we

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.880 
anything with that if it was a spring we
need<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> nylon<00:01:28.110> Bush<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> same<00:01:28.619> size

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
need to get a nylon Bush the same size

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.920 
need to get a nylon Bush the same size
of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> spring<00:01:29.340> replace<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.970> but<00:01:30.390> as<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.750> not

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
of the spring replace it but as it's not

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.100 
of the spring replace it but as it's not
and<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> bush<00:01:32.040> will<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.110> basically

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and it is a bush will do this basically

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.960 
and it is a bush will do this basically
what<00:01:34.200> we're<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.790> we're<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:35.820> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
what we're going to do we're going to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.620 
what we're going to do we're going to
open<00:01:36.270> up<00:01:36.390> these<00:01:36.540> three<00:01:36.840> screws<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:38.509> if<00:01:39.509> you

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
open up these three screws and if you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.210 
open up these three screws and if you
can<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:42.829> we're<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> once

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
can see there and we're going to once

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.310 
can see there and we're going to once
we've<00:01:44.399> done<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:47.149> we're<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
we've done that we're going to take the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.830 
we've done that we're going to take the
fluid<00:01:49.680> filled<00:01:49.890> washes<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.490> from<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> inside

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.140 

one

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
one

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.580 
one
two<00:02:01.880> three<00:02:03.049> and<00:02:04.049> we're<00:02:04.140> going<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.320> replace

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
two three and we're going to replace

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.789 
two three and we're going to replace
those<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.340> exactly<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.270> same<00:02:06.479> size<00:02:06.810> nylon

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
those with exactly the same size nylon
