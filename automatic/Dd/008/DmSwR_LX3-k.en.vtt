00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
technology right here that in the future

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.660

trigger what you need to for all the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.920 
trigger what you need to for all the
current<00:03:45.390> guns

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
current guns

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.800 
current guns
it'll<00:03:46.680> just<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:47.070> press<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.459> button<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:47.910> the

it'll just you press the button and the
transport<00:03:49.260> technology<00:03:49.920> will<00:03:50.730> just<00:03:51.560> map<00:03:52.560> that

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
transport technology will just map that

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.300 
transport technology will just map that
as<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.070> B<00:03:53.220> button<00:03:54.020> so<00:03:55.020> that's<00:03:55.770> pretty<00:03:56.070> cool

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
as the B button so that's pretty cool

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.710 
as the B button so that's pretty cool
and<00:03:56.489> that's<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.880> only<00:03:57.090> reason<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.510> bought

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
and that's the only reason I bought

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.810 
and that's the only reason I bought
another<00:03:57.989> one<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.380> these<00:03:58.580> otherwise<00:03:59.580> I<00:03:59.760> know

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
another one of these otherwise I know

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.370 
another one of these otherwise I know
there's<00:04:00.090> another<00:04:00.330> third-party<00:04:00.780> one<00:04:01.230> that

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
there's another third-party one that

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.770 
there's another third-party one that
comes<00:04:01.530> in<00:04:01.650> black<00:04:01.980> looks<00:04:02.880> almost<00:04:03.120> like<00:04:03.600> the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
comes in black looks almost like the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.610 
comes in black looks almost like the
real<00:04:03.959> Wii<00:04:04.470> Remote<00:04:05.300> but<00:04:06.300> I<00:04:06.600> thought<00:04:07.320> I'd<00:04:07.470> go

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
real Wii Remote but I thought I'd go

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.310 
real Wii Remote but I thought I'd go
with<00:04:07.770> this<00:04:07.890> one<00:04:08.100> again<00:04:08.250> because<00:04:08.989> it<00:04:09.989> worked

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
with this one again because it worked

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.650 
with this one again because it worked
before<00:04:10.650> just<00:04:11.190> crapped<00:04:11.580> out<00:04:11.790> could<00:04:12.450> have<00:04:12.540> been

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
before just crapped out could have been

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.520 
before just crapped out could have been
for<00:04:12.840> me<00:04:12.930> dropping<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.500> in<00:04:13.590> last<00:04:13.830> video<00:04:15.470> but<00:04:16.470> I
