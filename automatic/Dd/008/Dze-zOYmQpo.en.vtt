but<00:00:45.470> i<00:00:45.560> did<00:00:45.890> on<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.280> xbox<00:00:46.640> 360<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:47.900> as<00:00:48.020> you<00:00:48.050> can

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
but i did on the xbox 360 so as you can

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.750 
but i did on the xbox 360 so as you can
see<00:00:48.440> we<00:00:48.680> did<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:48.890> at<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.130> back<00:00:49.340> of<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.580> house

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
see we did it at the back of the house

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.390 
see we did it at the back of the house
because<00:00:50.090> it's<00:00:50.510> a<00:00:50.630> really<00:00:50.900> large<00:00:51.230> door<00:00:51.920> but<00:00:52.310> you

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
because it's a really large door but you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.800 
because it's a really large door but you
can<00:00:52.490> also<00:00:52.610> probably<00:00:52.910> do<00:00:53.120> it<00:00:53.150> in<00:00:53.330> front<00:00:53.540> of<00:00:53.690> the

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
can also probably do it in front of the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.840 
can also probably do it in front of the
house<00:00:53.900> and<00:00:54.230> there<00:00:54.770> is<00:00:54.860> also<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.190> way<00:00:55.310> inside<00:00:55.610> the
