 track and donkey is worth keeping track of 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.710
 what's going on extreme how cool and 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.020
 fantastic transfer 10 Swedes coming out 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.090
 forward realized most and in general 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.270
 of course throwing the author of the game figure well 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.810
 acted in unequal composition not every 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.810
 myself 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.150
 it is represented by number 44 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.440
 as a side job j 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.260
 Look here brilliant transfer bags 3 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.370
 May does not fall on the puck of his partner 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.600
 further under the crossbar 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.600
 building center with 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.000
 good 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.430
 now put out the purpose of this 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.460
 on whether he himself is sick after that 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.140
 it turns out so far only in the three Datsyuk 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.900
 everyone else is trying on their own 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.160
 do it all in this way 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.500
 solving a problem 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.320
 this very dense guardianship and national teams 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.610
 sweden action puck swedes abandoned in 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.979
 unequal compositions 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.040
 it certainly does take into account and does honor 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.520
 here is this roll collection shop11 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.740
 fantastic throw blue 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.440
 manages to understand now 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.570
 inside 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.320
 it seems to him 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.320
 Yevgeny Medvedev 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.110
 we must we too understand the eyes top 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.600
 in the hope of repeating and so they played 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.990
 puck Russians and throw you here of course 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.220
 big hello evgeny 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.590
 pass he may not have seen moments 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.509
 throw because i have us 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.390
 on stood right in front of him and here is this 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.979
 Repeat clearly shows that did not have time 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.039
 swift look only just 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.810
 defender is coming to this line now 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.750
 does not have time to move link 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.010
 gets the puck for his opportunity 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.349
 try something but again not 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.150
 extremities perch mozyakin so when 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.890
 crookedly will drive his mozyakin pushes 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.260
 three minutes rest now seriously 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.790
 most ilya nikulin wished to gain 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.790
 Malkin move 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.540
 on the far post crafty on the patch 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.970
 Kulemin is waiting for Malkin and throw 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.160
 one Russian team brilliantly played 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.220
 most lots are newbies in quality 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.010
 extra hitter 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.570
 Sergey Mozyakin not and people are attacking 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.570
 view by all means dance and retired 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.240
 came out lying on the blue line which 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.590
 difference in this situation 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.040
 times the draw is very good to the sheep 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.040
 of course 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.110
 Biryukov drove on 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.640
 here is a penny here look at the site 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.040
 full line of attackers pro and 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.820
 defenders were betrayed by the genius on the ice 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.260
 reforging did mold work there 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.390
 interfere 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.189
 defend the swedish team and scores 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.450
 sergey ointment once after missed pucks 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:31.129
 and here is the removal that they just went 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.260
 This evidence of the sheep is very 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.329
 climbs dangerously through his own patch 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.870
 so sure of your strength sasha on 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.879
 falcon 31 brilliantly here it is a combination 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.340
 behalf of Alexander Ovechkin himself began 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.049
 such a turnaround two gears reached 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.060
 alien 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.349
 Sona and there already ovechkina is cracking down on 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.349
 great speed 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.490
 he gave it like this until completion 31 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.970
 Russian team is very confident 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.970
 feels himself 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.030
 we would show this to us from the very beginning 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.769
 combination here ovechkin sunk and 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:19.220
 removing the opponent is very awkward there alda 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:21.170
 I fell apart at us pro green 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.830
 and the near corner of the puck thrust up 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.230
 near corner and always goalkeeper problems and 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.370
 here ovechkin attacked even before from the circle 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.840
 a throw-in from approximately a throw-in 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.699
 Radula as a block and there on 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.699
 the cast was already tuned to Ilya Kovalchuk 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.490
 41 41 Swedes crumble Swedes 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.880
 crumble already hard to imagine that 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.660
 they have to do in order to 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.259
 return to the game incomprehensible lind tank 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:06.110
 change it already a hundred percent and we m 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:06.110
 the mouth can already warm up 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.590
 and prepare yourself to ensure that he 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.580
 will hold the next period like this 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.590
 wonderful cast 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.220
 it turns out 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.009
 consider the whole combination datsyuk 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.550
 Ilya Kovalchuk 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.950
 I have not been straight rebounding and was not 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.460
 stolen was a ricochet was small 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.740
 bounce and this bounce embarrassed them 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.039
 as well as to understand whom 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.490
 swedish player 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:43.039
 blew if in the first period 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.590
 There were some hopes from the Swedes that 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.750
 which one can continue this hockey 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.020
 something can be continued from it 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.690
 get something in the second period of course 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.009
 here and please 5 the puck takes off yet 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.259
 all of the two of this are back a 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:03.940
 we are already conducting 51 in full 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:06.460
 today we roll in swedes 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.440
 and of course I fucked a little bit sorry 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.960
 becomes Sergey mozyakin second puck 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.410
 only scored two meetings so 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.020
 it's a pity 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:17.320
 they knew what they were going to they knew whom 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.200
 bring we gave such optimistic 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.060
 for jumped the forecast to the very beginning of this 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.420
 meeting Sergey Fedotov centimeter 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:28.670
 as they tried 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.670
 but this hat make a claim and mood 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:34.980
 soften even called what is coming back 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.920
 from an interesting team but 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.860
 but see what happens 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.580
 I honestly don't quite understand why 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.580
 still not sideways 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.620
 missed ice puck
