Shyamalan<00:00:12.090> most<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.139> us<00:00:13.290> really<00:00:14.009> kind<00:00:14.370> of

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
Shyamalan most of us really kind of

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.490 
Shyamalan most of us really kind of
hated<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.059> we<00:00:15.900> didn't<00:00:16.139> really<00:00:16.230> want<00:00:16.410> to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
hated it and we didn't really want to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.810 
hated it and we didn't really want to
see<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.740> part<00:00:16.920> two<00:00:17.100> because<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.520> thought<00:00:17.670> it

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
see it part two because we thought it

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.660 
see it part two because we thought it
would<00:00:18.000> further<00:00:18.660> damage<00:00:19.289> The<00:00:19.949> Last<00:00:20.430> Airbender

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
would further damage The Last Airbender

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.810 
would further damage The Last Airbender
on<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> big<00:00:21.420> screen<00:00:22.519> unfortunately<00:00:23.519> it's

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
on the big screen unfortunately it's

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.029 
on the big screen unfortunately it's
looking<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.570> The<00:00:24.869> Last<00:00:25.050> Airbender<00:00:25.350> -<00:00:25.859> you

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
looking like The Last Airbender - you

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.730 
looking like The Last Airbender - you
could<00:00:26.310> actually<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> possibility<00:00:27.740> we

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
could actually be a possibility we

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.080 
could actually be a possibility we
thought<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.099> production<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> film<00:00:29.910> would

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
thought the production on the film would

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.790 
thought the production on the film would
pretty<00:00:30.539> much<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.720> dead<00:00:31.109> since<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.619> been

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
pretty much be dead since it's been

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.770 
pretty much be dead since it's been
years<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.489> really<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.149> haven't<00:00:33.329> heard<00:00:33.540> much

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
years and really we haven't heard much

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.750 
years and really we haven't heard much
from<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:35.040> looking<00:00:35.309> at<00:00:35.489> at<00:00:35.700> night

from it but looking at at night

movies plans one of the movies actually

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.330 
movies plans one of the movies actually
has<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> script<00:00:58.050> that's<00:00:58.199> already<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
has a script that's already and the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.760 
has a script that's already and the
other<00:00:59.489> two<00:00:59.760> are<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.030> outlines<00:01:00.570> now<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.620> you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
other two are just outlines now if you

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.009 
other two are just outlines now if you
think<00:01:02.070> about<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.579> kind<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.879> back<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.780> time

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
think about it kind of back to the time

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.929 
think about it kind of back to the time
when<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.619> last<00:01:04.769> airbender<00:01:05.280> came<00:01:05.489> out<00:01:05.670> you'll

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
when the last airbender came out you'll

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.149 
when the last airbender came out you'll
remember<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:07.080> last<00:01:07.320> airbender<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
remember that the last airbender to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.090 
remember that the last airbender to
script<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:08.909> actually<00:01:09.270> complete<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.860> was

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
script was actually complete and I was

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.340 
script was actually complete and I was
thinking<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.570> skirt<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.200> he's

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
thinking what if the skirt that he's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.170 
thinking what if the skirt that he's
talking<00:01:13.650> about<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.250> complete<00:01:14.760> is

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
talking about that's complete is

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.140 
talking about that's complete is
actually<00:01:15.810> The<00:01:15.990> Last<00:01:16.229> Airbender<00:01:16.530> -<00:01:17.130> now<00:01:17.970> it's

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
actually The Last Airbender - now it's

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.640 
actually The Last Airbender - now it's
certainly<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.570> possibility<00:01:18.810> because<00:01:19.439> he

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
certainly a possibility because he

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.170 
certainly a possibility because he
hasn't<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.159> been<00:01:20.280> too<00:01:20.580> active<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
hasn't really been too active in the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.719 
hasn't really been too active in the
movie<00:01:21.509> industry<00:01:21.830> since<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.070> movie<00:01:23.250> released

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
movie industry since that movie released

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.490 
movie industry since that movie released
you<00:01:23.909> know<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:24.180> he's<00:01:24.450> working<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.869> after<00:01:25.080> earth

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you know now he's working on after earth

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.160 
you know now he's working on after earth
but<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:26.759> expect<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.570> guy<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> be

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
but can we really expect a guy to be

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.590 
but can we really expect a guy to be
developing<00:01:28.650> multiple<00:01:28.970> full-blown<00:01:29.970> scripts

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
developing multiple full-blown scripts

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.440 
developing multiple full-blown scripts
at<00:01:30.780> movies<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.500> mean<00:01:32.100> he<00:01:32.340> has<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> squid<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.240> one

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
at movies I mean he has a squid as one

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.450 
at movies I mean he has a squid as one
script<00:01:33.810> that's<00:01:33.990> complete<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> two<00:01:35.280> other

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
script that's complete and two other

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.640 
script that's complete and two other
about<00:01:35.820> lines<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.840> assume<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
about lines you have to assume that the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.469 
about lines you have to assume that the
two<00:01:37.890> other<00:01:38.070> outlines<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.729> movies<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.270> he's

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
two other outlines are movies that he's

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.480 
two other outlines are movies that he's
now<00:01:39.689> contemplating<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.100> can't<00:01:41.369> really

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
now contemplating and you can't really

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.789 
now contemplating and you can't really
expect<00:01:41.909> him<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.150> make<00:01:42.270> full<00:01:42.750> book<00:01:42.990> full<00:01:43.560> blown

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
expect him to make full book full blown

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.310 
expect him to make full book full blown
scripts<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.939> completely<00:01:45.479> different<00:01:45.930> movies

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
scripts for completely different movies

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.590 
scripts for completely different movies
so<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:46.890> kind<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.640> assume<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.450> this

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
so we kind of have to assume that this

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.590 
so we kind of have to assume that this
one<00:01:48.930> full<00:01:49.740> script<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.340> he<00:01:50.460> has<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
one full script that he has is the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.719 
one full script that he has is the
script<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> Last<00:01:52.500> Airbender<00:01:52.770> -<00:01:53.280> which<00:01:53.579> has

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
script of the Last Airbender - which has

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.319 
script of the Last Airbender - which has
already<00:01:53.970> been<00:01:54.619> confirmed<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.860> complete<00:01:56.329> now

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
already been confirmed as complete now

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.200 
already been confirmed as complete now
this<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.689> something

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
this is something

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.300 
this is something
kind<00:01:58.510> of<00:01:58.600> hate<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:59.020> assume<00:01:59.380> because<00:01:59.680> you<00:02:00.190> know

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
kind of hate to assume because you know

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.070 
kind of hate to assume because you know
no<00:02:00.580> one<00:02:00.700> really<00:02:00.970> wants<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.299> see<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.600> part<00:02:01.930> to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
no one really wants to see a part to

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.560 
no one really wants to see a part to
this<00:02:02.320> movie<00:02:02.799> but<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.460> reality<00:02:04.030> is<00:02:04.150> that<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.540> is

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
this movie but the reality is that it is

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.890 
this movie but the reality is that it is
certainly<00:02:05.260> a<00:02:05.380> possibility<00:02:06.150> you<00:02:07.150> know<00:02:07.270> he's

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
certainly a possibility you know he's

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.469 
certainly a possibility you know he's
contemplating<00:02:08.590> he<00:02:09.069> doesn't<00:02:09.429> know<00:02:09.640> which<00:02:10.209> of

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
contemplating he doesn't know which of

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.570 
contemplating he doesn't know which of
the<00:02:10.690> three<00:02:10.929> movies<00:02:11.140> he's<00:02:11.680> choosing<00:02:12.010> he<00:02:12.280> said

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
the three movies he's choosing he said

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.580 
the three movies he's choosing he said
that<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:13.270> know<00:02:13.390> his<00:02:13.660> heart<00:02:13.990> hasn't<00:02:14.260> really

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
that you know his heart hasn't really

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.530 
that you know his heart hasn't really
decided<00:02:14.709> or<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:15.400> fighting<00:02:16.000> something<00:02:16.420> like

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
decided or it's fighting something like

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.350 
decided or it's fighting something like
that<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:18.069> know<00:02:18.220> it's<00:02:18.430> just<00:02:18.550> it's<00:02:19.120> not<00:02:19.300> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
that and you know it's just it's not a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.170 
that and you know it's just it's not a
good<00:02:19.690> thing<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:20.319> we<00:02:20.470> kind<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:20.830> have<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.340> brace

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
good thing but we kind of have to brace

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.380 
good thing but we kind of have to brace
ourselves<00:02:22.390> for<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.170> possibility<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.390> avatar

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
ourselves for the possibility of avatar

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.300 
ourselves for the possibility of avatar
really<00:02:25.690> being<00:02:25.930> disgraced<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.739> big<00:02:26.950> screen

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
really being disgraced on the big screen

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.330 
really being disgraced on the big screen
again<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.180> after<00:02:28.840> Earth<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.350> know<00:02:29.470> his<00:02:29.680> new

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340
