00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
remember as an offensive player I always

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.960 
remember as an offensive player I always
said<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.979> protect<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> basketball

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
so if he's not protecting the basketball

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.030 
so if he's not protecting the basketball
I<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:45.450> flick<00:01:45.689> at<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.869> basketball<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.979> you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
I can flick at the basketball so you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.460
