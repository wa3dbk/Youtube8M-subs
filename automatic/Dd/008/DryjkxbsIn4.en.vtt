breastplate isn't near as is it isn't

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.140 
breastplate isn't near as is it isn't
near<00:03:07.109> as<00:03:07.200> important<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:08.159> it<00:03:08.700> gives<00:03:08.909> you<00:03:09.030> the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
near as important so it gives you the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.300 
near as important so it gives you the
ability<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.510> get<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> harness<00:03:10.079> set<00:03:11.040> up<00:03:11.159> like

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
ability to get a harness set up like

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.039 
ability to get a harness set up like
this<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.790> then<00:03:12.269> if<00:03:12.389> you<00:03:12.480> end<00:03:12.629> up<00:03:12.720> doing<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:12.989> lot

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
this and then if you end up doing a lot

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.179 
this and then if you end up doing a lot
of<00:03:13.230> tracking<00:03:13.470> or<00:03:13.739> like<00:03:13.829> I<00:03:13.859> said<00:03:13.980> you're<00:03:14.129> gonna

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
of tracking or like I said you're gonna

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.220 
of tracking or like I said you're gonna
front<00:03:14.519> load<00:03:14.700> your<00:03:14.879> dog<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> lot<00:03:15.329> you<00:03:15.959> can<00:03:16.109> add

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.430 
this breastplate to it and take it off
so<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.329> don't<00:03:18.540> have<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.810> dog<00:03:19.049> doesn't<00:03:19.199> have<00:03:19.319> to

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
so you don't have to dog doesn't have to

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.080 
so you don't have to dog doesn't have to
carry<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.709> extra<00:03:19.980> weight<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.639> we<00:03:20.730> know<00:03:20.819> that

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
carry the extra weight and we know that

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.750 
carry the extra weight and we know that
weight<00:03:21.359> is<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:23.190> know<00:03:23.280> sort<00:03:23.579> of<00:03:23.639> the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
weight is the you know sort of the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.490 
weight is the you know sort of the
killer<00:03:24.030> of<00:03:24.120> time<00:03:24.480> in<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.720> field<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.230> heart<00:03:25.410> of

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
killer of time in the field the heart of

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.050 
killer of time in the field the heart of
the<00:03:25.560> dog<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:25.889> more<00:03:26.040> carries<00:03:26.400> them<00:03:26.609> the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
the dog that more carries them the

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.720 
the dog that more carries them the
faster<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.599> gets<00:03:27.780> hot<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.620> quicker<00:03:29.609> he

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
faster it gets hot the the quicker he

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.939 
faster it gets hot the the quicker he
burns<00:03:30.000> out<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:30.690> hold<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.260> whole<00:03:31.440> process

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
burns out that hold that whole process

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.979 
burns out that hold that whole process
so<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.250> goal<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.790> set<00:03:33.209> beat<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.900> be

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
so the goal is to set beat you to be

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.659 
so the goal is to set beat you to be
able<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.169> get<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.590> dog<00:03:34.769> up<00:03:34.980> based<00:03:35.220> on<00:03:35.370> what

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
you're looking to do with them and

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.659 
you're looking to do with them and
that's<00:03:37.319> what<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:37.650> adapter<00:03:38.129> does<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.519> it's

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
that's what this adapter does is it's

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.789 
that's what this adapter does is it's
just<00:03:38.730> one<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.449> one<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.079> process<00:03:40.650> to

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
just one of that one of that process to

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.800 
just one of that one of that process to
be<00:03:40.919> able<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.129> help<00:03:41.310> get<00:03:41.579> the<00:03:41.699> dog<00:03:41.849> up<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.690> do
