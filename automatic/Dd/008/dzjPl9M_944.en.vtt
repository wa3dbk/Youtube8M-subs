be straight up with you guys since the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.000 
be straight up with you guys since the
beginning<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:38.399> episode<00:00:38.820> was<00:00:39.420> actually<00:00:40.140> nine

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
beginning the episode was actually nine

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.549 
beginning the episode was actually nine
and<00:00:41.399> ten<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.210> don't<00:00:42.870> know<00:00:42.930> if<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.140> makes<00:00:43.290> sense

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
and ten I don't know if that makes sense

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.209 
and ten I don't know if that makes sense
so<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.719> like<00:00:45.719> games<00:00:46.200> from<00:00:46.590> episode

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
so this is like like games from episode

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.510 
so this is like like games from episode
9<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.789> episode<00:00:48.239> 10<00:00:48.800> why<00:00:49.800> why<00:00:50.129> did<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
9 in episode 10 why why did I do that

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.510 
9 in episode 10 why why did I do that
because<00:00:51.079> since<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.620> know<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.770> was<00:00:53.100> new<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
because since you know I was new to the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.119 
because since you know I was new to the
xbox<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.480> even<00:00:55.140> though<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.320> mean<00:00:55.590> some<00:00:55.920> say

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
xbox one even though I mean some say

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
xbox one even though I mean some say
it's<00:00:56.340> exactly<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> same<00:00:57.120> thing<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> xbox

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
it's exactly the same thing as the xbox

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.060 
it's exactly the same thing as the xbox
360<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:59.129> not<00:00:59.399> on<00:01:00.500> its<00:01:01.500> way<00:01:01.770> different

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
360 it's not on its way different

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.460 
360 it's not on its way different
especially<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:03.180> least<00:01:03.480> for<00:01:03.960> me<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
especially at least for me was the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.830 
especially at least for me was the
controller<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.580> game<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.270> game<00:01:06.299> itself

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
controller the game the game itself

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.179 
controller the game the game itself
wasn't<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.799> new<00:01:08.610> or<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:10.189> didn't

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.520 
wasn't that like new or you know didn't
I<00:01:11.310> mean<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.850> didn't<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.600> feel<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.930> much<00:01:13.409> of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
I mean I didn't really feel that much of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.920 
I mean I didn't really feel that much of
a<00:01:13.619> change<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> did<00:01:15.210> when<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.479> came<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
a change but I did when it came to the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.280 
a change but I did when it came to the
controller<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.640> reason<00:01:17.700> um<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:19.049> was

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
controller and for that reason um I was

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.770

felt<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> little<00:01:59.670> bit<00:01:59.850> more<00:01:59.939> comfortable<00:02:00.270> with

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
felt a little bit more comfortable with

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.450 
felt a little bit more comfortable with
the<00:02:00.840> game<00:02:01.049> especially<00:02:01.439> with<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> controller

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the game especially with the controller

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.690 
the game especially with the controller
because<00:02:02.640> that's<00:02:02.880> where<00:02:03.149> my<00:02:03.299> problem<00:02:03.750> was<00:02:04.700> it's

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
because that's where my problem was it's

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.429 
because that's where my problem was it's
not<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.049> don't<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
not that it's not that I don't like the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.730 
not that it's not that I don't like the
new<00:02:07.560> controller

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
new controller

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.800

beginning of FIFA since fifa 10 this is

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.540 
beginning of FIFA since fifa 10 this is
the<00:02:43.450> formation<00:02:43.750> i<00:02:43.990> use<00:02:44.230> why<00:02:44.530> because<00:02:45.040> i<00:02:45.250> think

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
the formation i use why because i think

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.570 
the formation i use why because i think
you<00:02:45.850> got<00:02:46.090> like<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.960> you<00:02:47.710> got<00:02:47.920> a<00:02:47.950> different

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
you got like a you got a different

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.090 
you got like a you got a different
position<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.660> don't<00:02:50.230> know<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.320> just<00:02:50.620> think<00:02:50.860> you

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
position I don't know I just think you

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.120 
position I don't know I just think you
covered<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.490> whole<00:02:51.700> field<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.920> its<00:02:53.920> really

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
covered the whole field and its really

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.550 
covered the whole field and its really
good<00:02:54.430> for<00:02:54.460> attacking<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.540> it's<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:56.140> mean<00:02:56.320> eV

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
good for attacking and it's I mean eV

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.350 
good for attacking and it's I mean eV
and<00:02:56.650> if<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:56.980> know<00:02:57.100> how<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.250> defend<00:02:57.490> if<00:02:58.030> you're

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
and if you know how to defend if you're

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.750 
and if you know how to defend if you're
a<00:02:58.390> pretty<00:02:58.780> decent<00:02:59.170> defender<00:02:59.650> then<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.580> won't

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
a pretty decent defender then you won't

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.700 
a pretty decent defender then you won't
have<00:03:00.820> any<00:03:01.000> problems<00:03:01.510> with<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.690> even<00:03:02.260> though<00:03:02.470> it

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
have any problems with it even though it

four<00:07:38.790> games<00:07:39.060> all<00:07:39.780> those<00:07:40.350> games<00:07:40.740> I<00:07:41.100> did<00:07:41.580> record
