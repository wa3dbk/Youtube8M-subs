00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 let's know more about the context in 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.609
 the one that takes this decision from the USA 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.970
 for that we make contact with these 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.340
 comrades jorge gestoso jorge usa says 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.139
 which is a threat what represents 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.880
 russia for its allies that are the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.779
 Eastern European countries and for 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.460
 Baltic people and I would like you to tell me 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.500
 about this context in which eeuu 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.100
 take this decision mate 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.250
 now what's interesting in what they are 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:34.000
 clearly observing the analysts is 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:38.410
 the manipulation of information something 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.110
 as well as the discrediting of russia and 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.629
 putin and disinformation for example the 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.699
 example that was seen this morning was the 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.890
 cbs television network one of the 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.010
 most important television networks in 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.900
 about audiences here in usa 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.829
 interviewing ashton cÃ¡rter is to say 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.600
 the secretary of defense and then what 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.280
 that lack of information for the 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.270
 American citizen who does not 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.210
 claim is where this topic starts and 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.560
 this in subject what is not repeated what 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.320
 you do not see what it does not bring in the press 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.140
 Press mainstream media more 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.160
 audience is when this topic begins 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.530
 this Ukrainian theme starts with a 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.590
 soft state coup given to 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.110
 legitimately elected government when that 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.100
 government makes an economic decision that 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.130
 no , please 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.790
 that accident decides for example to do 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.060
 business with the russian block in that 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.570
 western moment through the meeting 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.920
 European and fundamente de usa and organizes 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.860
 a blow takes him out of power puts a 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.409
 president who is favorable to be 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.729
 generous with the term for 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.649
 Western interests that 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.500
 he immediately signed a free agreement 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.619
 trade and then stays with the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.350
 control of ukraine that could if you 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.390
 would have spread through time 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.440
 take control of the peninsula of 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.110
 Crimea where Russia has nothing less than 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.040
 a strategic point that is your fleet 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.620
 naval that is to say and it was even intended 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.130
 the West intended to suffocate Russia to 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.980
 that level to all this nor the means of 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.890
 communication nor ashton crankcase this 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.370
 tomorrow in the interview this is mentioned 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.680
 there is this for the citizen 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.910
 average American and the movie or 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.610
 be the story 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.160
 in that interview giving exactly in 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.470
 the terms upside down like the 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.650
 Uruguayan writer eduardo galeano el 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.070
 world upside down you are asked then 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.240
 instead of reporting the facts that is 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.520
 the provocation is generated by 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.780
 West when grabbing like beach 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:05.560
 disembark to ukraine for again 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.290
 push corroding suffocate russia that 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.300
 provocation does not exist in the media 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.300
 communication or in the way that 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.520
 communicates the secretary of defense and in 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.940
 the interview begins when a 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.120
 reporter asks tell me this is not 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.970
 a provocation for president putin 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.880
 and he answers no no no no to the contrary 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.980
 the only one that is causing here is the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.610
 president putin because he is a 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.230
 threat because he can eventually 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.080
 reproduce that time of union 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.300
 Soviet that was the extensions the 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.340
 expansionist ambitions of the union 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.350
 Soviet and here we have the 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.440
 topic 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.390
 that Russia wants to expand and attack 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.420
 your neighbors get to europe 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.760
 which President Putin has never 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.790
 given neither signs nor is it in his plans 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.740
 nor in any kind of indication in that 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.590
 sense now yes we see this still 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.080
 in more perspective open this high of 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.270
 the cold war era where the 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.410
 president here in eeuu was ronald 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.300
 reagan that I already absolutely wanted 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.910
 suffocate from the military point of view 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.830
 to the Soviet Union assembling what it 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.480
 they called the Star Wars' area 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.600
 although it did not work is to say that 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.770
 permanently there is a level bombing 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:30.000
 economic with sanctions at military level 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.980
 trying to strangle without any type 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.970
 measurement 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:40.080
 let's say I can give this one a 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.630
 respite to russia permanently 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.550
 agreeing to putting him in the lure but 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.240
 let's say from the point of view of 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.389
 information what is observed is how 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.490
 the average American citizen is 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.729
 they present the facts to you absolutely 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.610
 backwards than those who attack who are a 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.669
 threaten those who are a provocation that 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.060
 russia and that justifies the 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.979
 construction and sale of the industry 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.610
 of the war of the us because he thinks 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:15.120
 he thinks they will be selling him 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.190
 heavy military machinery to six countries 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.069
 that is , they have found six clients 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.789
 more and war industry is 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:25.949
 essential for walking or good health 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.409
 of the American economy say there's 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:31.319
 that permanently look for a bad guy 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:34.380
 the movie to then go out between 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:36.919
 quotes to counteract it or go out to 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.319
 defend for example ashton crankcase today 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.300
 he was speaking on behalf of the six countries 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:45.300
 where they are going to install war material 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:49.860
 for their interests and they said that those 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:53.669
 countries had expressed their discomfort and 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.660
 his fear that Russia might invade 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.520
 the 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.260
 but we never hear of any name 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.180
 from none of those countries that 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.870
 they manifested something by the style of saying 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:07.590
 once again the worrying thing is that it 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:10.380
 is exacerbating militarism like you 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.830
 you said very well open this is the biggest 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.470
 military deployment since the end of the 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.630
 cold war and permanently it 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.150
 listen to the drums here in the usa 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.730
 that there could be a third war 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.160
 world but here in the way that the 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.650
 they want to present to the public 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.260
 is that they defend themselves because in 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.720
 reality what you want to start that 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.870
 war that invasion those actions 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.560
 military is russia and they are once again 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:43.620
 a victim of those who of some 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.650
 way they do not respect the rules they do not respect 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.800
 politics but not respect and the 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:52.150
 execution of soft coups that 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.640
 does not appear on radars now 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.710
 Russia appears as a threat but 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.930
 never show proof of what 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.160
 means that jorge gestosa threat there 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.960
 is our partner from washington 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.960
 thanks for that jorge see you soon
