reversed<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.790> essentially<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.509> mean<00:01:33.900> it's

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
reversed it essentially I mean it's

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.410 
reversed it essentially I mean it's
still<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.619> day<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.070> edition<00:01:35.189> but<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.939> mean<00:01:36.210> it's

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
still a day one edition but I mean it's

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.390 
still a day one edition but I mean it's
not<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.689> bad<00:01:36.869> right<00:01:37.259> um<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.040> think<00:01:38.100> that's

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
not as bad right um so I think that's

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.429 
not as bad right um so I think that's
why<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:39.000> lot<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.450> us<00:01:39.630> try<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.810> make<00:01:39.990> these<00:01:40.110> videos

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
why a lot of us try to make these videos

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.319 
why a lot of us try to make these videos
is<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:41.369> make<00:01:41.520> them<00:01:41.640> early<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> we

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
is because we make them early and we

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.240 
is because we make them early and we
speculate<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> lot<00:01:43.170> because<00:01:43.350> they're

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
speculate a lot because they're

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.620 
speculate a lot because they're
listening<00:01:44.460> especially<00:01:44.820> with<00:01:45.180> storm<00:01:45.390> 4

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
listening especially with storm 4

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.120 
listening especially with storm 4
they're<00:01:45.780> actually<00:01:46.229> taking<00:01:46.560> feedback<00:01:46.740> into

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
they're actually taking feedback into

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.440 
they're actually taking feedback into
account<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.460> they<00:01:47.549> actually<00:01:47.729> want<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.240> hear

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
account like they actually want to hear

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
account like they actually want to hear
what<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> community<00:01:49.110> has<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.619> say<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.250> what

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
what the community has to say and what

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.429 
what the community has to say and what
they<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:50.790> do<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> improve<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.780> think<00:01:51.960> jutsu

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
they can do to improve and I think jutsu

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.960 
they can do to improve and I think jutsu
clashes<00:01:52.860> would<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.520> those<00:01:53.670> things

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
clashes would be one of those things

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.569 
clashes would be one of those things
that'll<00:01:54.600> add<00:01:54.780> two<00:01:55.380> things<00:01:55.409> actually<00:01:55.829> it'll

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
that'll add two things actually it'll

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.459 
that'll add two things actually it'll
add<00:01:56.729> some<00:01:56.759> gameplay<00:01:57.630> mechanics<00:01:58.110> it'll<00:01:58.320> add<00:01:58.439> a

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
add some gameplay mechanics it'll add a

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.350 
add some gameplay mechanics it'll add a
new<00:01:58.710> way<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.860> defend<00:01:59.369> yourself<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.119> let's<00:02:00.270> say

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
new way to defend yourself so let's say

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.760 
new way to defend yourself so let's say
you<00:02:00.450> run<00:02:00.600> out<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.750> sub<00:02:01.020> bars<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.500> somebody's

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
you run out of sub bars and somebody's

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.709 
you run out of sub bars and somebody's
coming<00:02:02.009> at<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.250> with<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.579> jutsu<00:02:02.909> instead<00:02:03.600> of

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
coming at you with a jutsu instead of

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.990 
coming at you with a jutsu instead of
maybe<00:02:03.869> dodging<00:02:04.469> or<00:02:04.680> something<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.130> you

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
maybe dodging or something like that you

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.630 
maybe dodging or something like that you
could<00:02:06.119> do<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.479> crash<00:02:06.719> um<00:02:07.020> also<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.190> also<00:02:08.310> just

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
could do to crash um also it also just

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.279 
could do to crash um also it also just
adds<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.119> little<00:02:09.270> bit<00:02:09.450> more<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.690> an<00:02:09.750> anime<00:02:10.080> feel

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
adds a little bit more of an anime feel

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.600 
adds a little bit more of an anime feel
because<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.770> lot<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.190> people<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.459> play

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
because a lot of the people that play

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.580 
because a lot of the people that play
these<00:02:11.760> games<00:02:12.000> are<00:02:12.239> fans<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> anime

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
these games are fans of the anime

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.990 
these games are fans of the anime
or<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.830> manga<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.220> doubt<00:02:14.489> people<00:02:14.520> are<00:02:14.760> really

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
or the manga I doubt people are really

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.610 
or the manga I doubt people are really
playing<00:02:15.239> this<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> fighting<00:02:16.170> enjoyment

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
playing this for the fighting enjoyment

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.559 
playing this for the fighting enjoyment
because<00:02:16.950> they're<00:02:17.069> not<00:02:17.190> really<00:02:17.400> uh<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:18.270> depth

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
because they're not really uh in depth

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.940 
because they're not really uh in depth
fighting<00:02:18.930> games<00:02:19.080> at<00:02:19.230> all<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.380> think<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.770> people

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
fighting games at all I think the people

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.620 
fighting games at all I think the people
that<00:02:20.310> are<00:02:20.430> playing<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.819> are<00:02:20.970> actually<00:02:21.300> just

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
that are playing it are actually just

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.500 
that are playing it are actually just
fans<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.380> series<00:02:22.739> in<00:02:22.970> itself<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.480> I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
fans of the of the series in itself so I

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.839 
fans of the of the series in itself so I
think<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.840> lot<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.200> times<00:02:25.440> we<00:02:25.950> want<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.250> sort

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
think a lot of the times we want to sort

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.270 
think a lot of the times we want to sort
of<00:02:26.940> feel<00:02:27.180> like<00:02:27.209> we're<00:02:27.599> we're<00:02:27.900> playing<00:02:28.280> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
of feel like we're we're playing the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.059 
of feel like we're we're playing the
show<00:02:29.489> sort<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> think<00:02:31.080> that's<00:02:31.230> why<00:02:31.410> with

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
show sort of and I think that's why with

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.530 
show sort of and I think that's why with
like<00:02:32.340> Dragonball<00:02:32.880> Z<00:02:33.090> game<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:33.480> example

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
like Dragonball Z game for example

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.970 
like Dragonball Z game for example
that's<00:02:33.870> why<00:02:33.989> people<00:02:34.170> really<00:02:34.440> likes<00:02:34.650> budokai

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
that's why people really likes budokai

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.290 
that's why people really likes budokai
Tenkaichi<00:02:35.130> 3<00:02:35.459> because<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.849> kind<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.120> felt<00:02:36.269> like

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
Tenkaichi 3 because it kind of felt like

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.420 
Tenkaichi 3 because it kind of felt like
you<00:02:36.390> were<00:02:36.540> playing<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.959> show<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.160> that's<00:02:38.280> a

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
you were playing the show and that's a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.070 
you were playing the show and that's a
sort<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.849> feeling<00:02:39.239> they<00:02:39.690> haven't<00:02:39.930> been<00:02:39.989> able

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
sort of a feeling they haven't been able

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.320 
sort of a feeling they haven't been able
to<00:02:40.260> replicate<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:41.010> much<00:02:41.250> with<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.150> newer

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
to replicate that much with the newer

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.150 
to replicate that much with the newer
generation<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.900> consoles<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:43.530> hopefully

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
generation of consoles but hopefully

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.410 
generation of consoles but hopefully
they<00:02:44.280> can<00:02:44.430> do<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.670> with<00:02:44.819> storm<00:02:45.060> forward<00:02:45.390> I

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
they can do that with storm forward I

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.820 
they can do that with storm forward I
think<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.660> way<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.840> do<00:02:46.019> it<00:02:46.049> would<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.319> jutsu

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
think a way to do it would be jutsu

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.410 
think a way to do it would be jutsu
clashes<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.400> don't<00:02:47.970> know<00:02:48.030> if<00:02:48.090> they<00:02:48.209> can<00:02:48.390> be

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
clashes I don't know if they can be

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.630 
clashes I don't know if they can be
something<00:02:48.900> that's<00:02:49.049> very<00:02:49.260> very<00:02:49.380> common<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:50.280> like

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
something that's very very common I like

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.759 
something that's very very common I like
every<00:02:51.000> time<00:02:51.269> there's<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.959> verizon<00:02:52.380> gun<00:02:52.500> versus

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
every time there's a verizon gun versus

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.880 
every time there's a verizon gun versus
a<00:02:52.799> judo<00:02:53.220> or<00:02:53.459> something<00:02:53.850> they<00:02:54.690> clash<00:02:55.019> or<00:02:55.319> like

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
a judo or something they clash or like

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.430 
a judo or something they clash or like
let's<00:02:56.250> say<00:02:56.489> if<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.030> guys<00:02:57.180> charge<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.630> up<00:02:57.750> exact

let's say if you guys charge it up exact
like<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:58.769> go<00:02:58.890> full<00:02:59.190> charge

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
like if you go full charge

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.120 
like if you go full charge
Rasengan<00:03:00.150> full<00:03:00.599> charge<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.110> Jory<00:03:01.410> chidori

Rasengan full charge to Jory chidori

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.580 
Rasengan full charge to Jory chidori
then<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:03.000> clashes<00:03:03.269> or<00:03:03.660> like<00:03:04.080> if<00:03:04.170> it's<00:03:04.319> that<00:03:04.470> if

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
then it clashes or like if it's that if

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.530 
then it clashes or like if it's that if
it's<00:03:04.769> charged<00:03:05.160> around<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.580> same<00:03:05.819> amount<00:03:05.849> then

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
it's charged around the same amount then

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.759 
it's charged around the same amount then
it'll<00:03:06.780> clash<00:03:06.959> because<00:03:07.260> like<00:03:07.410> let's<00:03:07.650> say

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
it'll clash because like let's say

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.650 
it'll clash because like let's say
somebody<00:03:08.160> sits<00:03:08.640> there<00:03:08.790> all<00:03:08.819> day<00:03:09.150> charging<00:03:09.569> up

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660

somebody sits there all day charging up
a<00:03:09.720> Chidori<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.319> then<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> guy<00:03:10.620> just<00:03:10.830> like<00:03:10.950> gets

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
a Chidori and then a guy just like gets

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.440 
a Chidori and then a guy just like gets
up<00:03:11.370> from<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.549> ground<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.060> shits<00:03:12.330> out<00:03:12.390> a

up from the ground and it shits out a
Rasengan<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.260> think<00:03:13.739> they<00:03:13.830> got<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.010> charge<00:03:14.310> up

the<00:03:14.549> Jidori<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.540> win<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.959> jutsu<00:03:16.410> crash

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
automatically without there being a

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.270 
automatically without there being a
clash<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.870> speak<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.650> know<00:03:19.890> that's<00:03:20.070> what
