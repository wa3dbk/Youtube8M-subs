00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.949
 promised I told you we were talking to you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.710
 to make me simulator 2015 when you knew 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.820
 something extra 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.920
 at the beginning I made the video 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.680
 there were a few photos something that was 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.740
 been a video at most is now 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.230
 another video that they do also came out 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.780
 see already better let's say let me 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.460
 they are already marked by the first one 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.239
 they had shown the novelty that is 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.129
 having inserted let's say the trees cut 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.969
 let's say the game's original original e 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.500
 not that the forest is the forest and fashions 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.910
 well today we are just on the site 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.840
 official as you see they already have us 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.480
 inserted on the left we say a 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.460
 half icon of the new game and on 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.559
 right we have 2013 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.650
 meanwhile we can go and see let's say 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.650
 already some alley what they are doing 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.280
 brands new swarm 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.300
 that is, new holland finally have them 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.800
 usually allowed on very few and here 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.640
 few that are ever there are not even 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:27.030
 made your own really excellent way 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.820
 fender john deere thinks of us anyway 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.910
 or other fashions that make me really good 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.680
 then without losing too much 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.410
 Chatter 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.740
 let's see what we say a little bit all 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.830
 means all we say go of 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.520
 insert we have an Amazon plow i 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.520
 usual 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.000
 the usual consumer sprayers 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.049
 etc. etc. but they do not add any 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.020
 other bergmans are known to have wagons e 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.000
 begin a novero that they are there are 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.640
 still working they still have to put them 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.840
 in hand they add every day 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.560
 something here we have a cart 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.860
 little ficher and husbands ficher year for for 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.230
 deprive grimm and we have the usual collection 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.110
 seed potatoes beetroot potatoes 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.380
 is 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.470
 is something else that is happening from the images 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.230
 they seem to have improved graphics 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.660
 more detailed sharper than 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.950
 let us say to that of 2003 we hope 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.550
 well 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.170
 jens we basically have machinery 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.360
 so to make the deal here is that 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.060
 my name is it will go then precisely in the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.500
 in the fashion of the trees in short 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.459
 made to cut such trees 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.459
 breezes and so on 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:51.060
 kram fish we have the usual loved ones to which it 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:57.120
 many others will come out with 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.909
 we have a plow and turn hay ea 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.349
 this one is new to me all here I don't have 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.659
 still seen the usual we have ours 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.420
 dear the mixers is other than still 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:13.680
 they are working new holland we have a 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:17.489
 t8 329 2 packers and no one knows yet 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.530
 what they invent then will dye we have 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.560
 for now only two things a seeder 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.459
 a straw collector appear on the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.730
 hay are still taken let's say a little 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:34.370
 back I try done that as an exit 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:38.219
 we are all asking are we think 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.650
 late September and October the a 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:42.689
 September October November we are there 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.689
 in short, it will come out 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.669
 at least the demo will come out like this 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.359
 bit the full game will obviously come out 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.209
 a little later 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:54.389
 here we have the machinery this is the 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.540
 first scorpion king machine for 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.939
 let's say the trees are cut and I love you 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.519
 the buffalo I think for the collection of 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.459
 logs and take things away 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.699
 we also see together we have a fortis 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:11.780
 190 for now there is nothing else then 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:15.620
 maybe there's just this 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.799
 even here google's death is never 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.470
 heard we have two binders for 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:26.590
 the grass paillets etc. and a wagon 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.590
 normal work and between ballast 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:35.340
 can definitely serve here mind 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:41.190
 or let's say at least the basic things are 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:46.470
 an 2gb or an equivalent md 8600 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.690
 minimum 512 series are this guys 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.560
 just play with the minimum game 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.110
 pesaro 2 giga here is this in the disc weighs 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.440
 2 giga contrary of 2013 will be a little 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:03.020
 less and where they don't say much then you know 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.300
 as soon as you start adding fashions 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.400
 these things here you can also 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.910
 forget it you must surely go one 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.270
 little closed however I remember it 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.690
 2006 we say frequency has though 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.640
 however more video card you have 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.800
 it is better to play because it is anyway 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:28.550
 I can manage to do 30 fps with 760 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.700
 with certain fashions, certain shots 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.440
 racism 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:38.340
 the game is what it knows is not that 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:42.260
 just think about it and sky for all PCs 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.260
 consoles etcetera 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:50.230
 ps3 this can still the old nothing 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:53.560
 for now there is only the pc but I think 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:56.260
 do a little also to the consoles well 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.570
 this is precisely the novelty of leaving you 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.910
 and to keep you updated on the fact of 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.020
 2015 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.080
 nothing I recommend sign up 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.500
 commented leave a nice like and hello a 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.500
 all the next
