00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Halli hello and welcome here 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.200
 to the culture of me so of nico share 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.480
 from only 10 7 we have it in special 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.480
 announced and off you go after the intro 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.290
 Yes 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.630
 and here we are already in one 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.400
 corner of my room where I punish so much 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.320
 and produce youtube videos 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.750
 do schoolwork and what you do not 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.640
 still so everything makes and I stand here 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.180
 Just a corner with the camera in 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.129
 the hand 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.589
 and once we left each other 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.480
 turn then we see two 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:41.970
 bookshelves yes i used to have a lot 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.739
 read a lot now so where you yet 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.670
 in the evening rather youtube video looks everything 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.019
 that's a bit to read 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.760
 background advised 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.110
 unfortunately you will not find much time for it 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.449
 but otherwise I still have mine 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.670
 two bookshelves still mainly yes 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.820
 filled with new books from earlier but 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.250
 also a few scary or fantasy rhine 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.860
 be it the hobbit or something 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.720
 always represent everything here as well 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.180
 here we see the small desk 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.380
 where you should usually work yes 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.150
 even if I somehow do not do that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.470
 I use my own desk but 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.000
 here is the other desk with the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.100
 harry potter studies also in special 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.200
 yes, yes, he's really there 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.049
 and if we turn left then 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.490
 we see that was the wrong direction 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.470
 if we turn left then 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.240
 the green wall we see that perhaps 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.800
 already know from our live stream 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.409
 from some videos directly below 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.510
 is the couch was there for example that 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.010
 yes we mine is 07 10,000 subscribers 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.330
 special recorded so you know 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.979
 probably this corner already here 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.750
 a little better and right behind it 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.830
 there is a green wall and the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.840
 For example, we also have 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.310
 livestream used in the first live stream 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.050
 in the second , the whole thing was a bit 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.830
 differently constructed and these reasons wall 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.180
 I can then just with one 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.320
 any background on one 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.940
 Replace cut program 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.979
 and then it just looks like 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.540
 it now just so if you me in the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.979
 seen window and now we come 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.150
 even to the desk back there 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.460
 is still in the wardrobe 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.799
 not important and here we see 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.470
 the wireless headphones empty the endowment 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.630
 yes, who are more often our videos 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.920
 I watch knows these are wireless headphones 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.500
 we already have a consequence 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.869
 wireless headphones as well as view correctly 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.400
 we do not know and then see 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.110
 we are also the wireless mouse yes I am 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.269
 the radio does not inspire any more 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.980
 long because somehow it annoys me that 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.540
 I end up having to recharge things directly 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.280
 Conquer you find an empty eaten 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.780
 fruit plate or I have just now 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.730
 stand one of the eaten fruit hall 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.470
 is on the top left 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.080
 I say the smallest 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.510
 advent calendar of the world that's yes 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.099
 a chocolate advent calendar 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.510
 and you have only of this 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.099
 I saw Santa Claus completely 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.599
 forgot to mention yes that is too 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.799
 an advent calendar now in the 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.930
 Christmas time therefore everything here 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.489
 a little Christmassy decorated directly 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.709
 on the screen you will find the 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.909
 microsoft lifecam all technical data 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.739
 you can also find in the video 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.970
 description as possible also left if 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.799
 I found it all and 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.900
 We have already streamed with it 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.299
 twice and that has really good 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.340
 quality right next to it is my radio 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.019
 what is currently on port lever 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.099
 and then I hear from the two boxes 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.510
 I have the sound as well since 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.709
 newest set and that pleased 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.489
 me totally because that is a lot 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.959
 better than the television now to do 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.340
 for a network player or yes 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.019
 is a video producer on youtube 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.760
 sound quality of course the a and o and 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.700
 that's why you 're the raw one too 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.409
 internal 1a a very good microphone like 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.150
 I think and that's at a mixer 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.519
 connected xlr cable 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.269
 as there are many buttons and what hÃ¼tchen 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.769
 Whatever we can do 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.859
 Power on and off 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.599
 and there's this mixer as well 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.790
 Of course we have the 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.470
 computer do not forget that and 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.150
 you will find the technical data 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.560
 Of course, all in the video description 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.760
 and enlightened so bad needs me 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.739
 actually pretty much does not matter like mine 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.660
 computer looks the main thing he is running 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.790
 and he does that to some extent on the left 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.620
 of it we find my printer over the 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.030
 I always print things that way 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.090
 with a draw game makes and misses 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.639
 is still some akoya laptop the 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.989
 I have for the time being for the 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.910
 right computer I now simply the 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.010
 times right computer bought and thus 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.900
 also produces videos and you want it 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.519
 Do not believe minecraft ran at 10 fps 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.239
 or something and that's still true 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.250
 not better 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.510
 there you can watch the old videos on the 107th 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.699
 take a look and then you see 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.260

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.120
 could deliver laptop or I only with 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.680
 It was possible to deliver this laptop 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.209
 really cruel here we still find 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.310
 a green plant that I persist 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.199
 forget to water and outside is yes 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.530
 nice to light when you see me 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:20.239
 back in the dust and I believe that 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.370

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.960

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.180

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.350
