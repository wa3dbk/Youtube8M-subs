00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
because it was pretty awesome in my

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.539 
because it was pretty awesome in my

killstreaks and you know asst acid as I

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.810 
killstreaks and you know asst acid as I
think<00:03:33.540> assassin<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.049> tier<00:03:34.320> one<00:03:34.560> perk<00:03:34.860> now<00:03:35.579> it

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
think assassin is tier one perk now it

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.960 
think assassin is tier one perk now it
doesn't<00:03:36.180> hide<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:37.049> from<00:03:37.850> from<00:03:38.850> the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
doesn't hide you from from the

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
killstreaks it hides you from the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.650 
killstreaks it hides you from the
defensive<00:03:41.760> kill<00:03:41.940> streaks<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.269> they<00:03:42.540> are

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
defensive kill streaks like they are

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.289 
defensive kill streaks like they are
support<00:03:43.079> counter<00:03:43.950> UAV<00:03:44.100> UAV<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:44.760> stuff<00:03:45.180> like

support counter UAV UAV and stuff like
that<00:03:45.359> I<00:03:45.510> think<00:03:45.959> don't<00:03:46.410> quote<00:03:46.530> me<00:03:46.680> on<00:03:46.739> this

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
that I think don't quote me on this

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.190 
that I think don't quote me on this
because<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.220> did<00:03:47.700> blast<00:03:48.030> on<00:03:48.209> my<00:03:48.329> research<00:03:48.660> stuff

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
because I did blast on my research stuff

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.819 
because I did blast on my research stuff
on<00:03:49.380> mine<00:03:49.560> 143<00:03:49.980> was<00:03:50.070> pretty<00:03:50.280> long<00:03:50.459> ago<00:03:50.670> but

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
on mine 143 was pretty long ago but

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.009 
on mine 143 was pretty long ago but
either<00:03:52.829> way<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.579> doubt<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.480> people<00:03:54.840> will

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
either way I doubt that people will

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.270 
either way I doubt that people will
sacrifice<00:03:55.410> tier<00:03:56.100> 2<00:03:56.390> for<00:03:57.390> something<00:03:57.930> like<00:03:58.280> you

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
sacrifice tier 2 for something like you

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.370 
sacrifice tier 2 for something like you
know<00:03:59.430> for<00:03:59.700> for<00:03:59.940> blind<00:04:00.239> like<00:04:00.420> they<00:04:00.600> might<00:04:00.840> you

the<00:04:34.700> faster<00:04:35.180> pace<00:04:35.419> of<00:04:35.660> modern<00:04:36.050> 153<00:04:36.680> no<00:04:37.460> really

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
the faster pace of modern 153 no really

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.520 
the faster pace of modern 153 no really
places<00:04:38.419> to<00:04:38.540> hide<00:04:38.750> since<00:04:39.139> they<00:04:39.230> remove<00:04:39.500> the

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
places to hide since they remove the

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.750 
places to hide since they remove the
verdict<00:04:39.919> vertical<00:04:40.610> verticality<00:04:41.600> excuse<00:04:42.500> me

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
verdict vertical verticality excuse me

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.990 
verdict vertical verticality excuse me
and<00:04:43.760> so<00:04:43.910> no<00:04:44.060> really<00:04:44.300> places<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:44.900> hide<00:04:45.110> no

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
and so no really places to hide no

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.210 
and so no really places to hide no
bullshit<00:04:47.000> in<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.270> corner<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:48.410> we<00:04:48.680> might<00:04:48.919> see

bullshit in the corner so we might see

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.580 
bullshit in the corner so we might see
some<00:04:49.250> good<00:04:49.790> fast-paced<00:04:50.480> action<00:04:50.780> with<00:04:51.560> the
