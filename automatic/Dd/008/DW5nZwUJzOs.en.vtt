00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.490 
I think that there are a lot of little
tiny<00:02:09.520> solutions<00:02:10.240> that<00:02:10.479> could<00:02:10.660> come<00:02:11.200> out<00:02:11.230> of

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
tiny solutions that could come out of

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.680 
tiny solutions that could come out of
anywhere<00:02:11.800> lots<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.460> little<00:02:12.700> things<00:02:12.820> that's

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
anywhere lots of little things that's

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.600 
anywhere lots of little things that's
the<00:02:13.900> future<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.650> started<00:02:15.160> with<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.400> mirror

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
the future I started with the mirror

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.730 
the future I started with the mirror
that's<00:02:16.030> my<00:02:16.240> passion<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.170> had<00:02:17.350> this<00:02:17.500> vision

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
that's my passion and I had this vision

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.260 
that's my passion and I had this vision
to<00:02:17.950> do<00:02:18.070> this<00:02:18.220> place<00:02:18.490> where<00:02:18.730> all<00:02:18.790> his<00:02:18.910> artists

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
to do this place where all his artists

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.420 
to do this place where all his artists
would<00:02:19.390> come<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.930> opened<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.440> storefront<00:02:20.709> because

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
would come I opened a storefront because

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.490 
would come I opened a storefront because
that<00:02:22.120> was<00:02:22.300> my<00:02:22.330> way<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.110> could<00:02:23.350> do

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
that was my way that I could do

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.590 
that was my way that I could do
something<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:24.700> turn<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.030> lights<00:02:25.209> on<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.420> a

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
something to turn the lights on in a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.660 
something to turn the lights on in a
space<00:02:25.900> where<00:02:26.200> they<00:02:26.440> were<00:02:26.560> out<00:02:26.709> before<00:02:27.100> detroit

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
space where they were out before detroit

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.490 
space where they were out before detroit
could<00:02:27.940> be<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.180> one<00:02:28.390> city<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.230> grew<00:02:29.410> one

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
could be the one city that grew one

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.110 
could be the one city that grew one
hundred<00:02:29.709> percent<00:02:29.740> of<00:02:30.130> its<00:02:30.250> food<00:02:30.580> within<00:02:31.000> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
hundred percent of its food within the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.780 
hundred percent of its food within the
city<00:02:31.300> limits<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:32.190> that's<00:02:33.190> an<00:02:33.310> interesting

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
city limits and that's an interesting

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.670 
city limits and that's an interesting
angle<00:02:34.030> on<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.540> place<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.110> people<00:02:35.200> think<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.560> as

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
angle on a place that people think of as

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.500 
angle on a place that people think of as
an<00:02:35.770> industrial<00:02:35.950> wasteland<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.000> said<00:02:37.270> okay
