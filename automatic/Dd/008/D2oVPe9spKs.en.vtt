00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.609 
frontiers is an expansion of the concept
of<00:00:20.430> Heroes<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.689> can<00:00:21.810> actually<00:00:21.960> level<00:00:22.380> them<00:00:22.500> up

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
of Heroes you can actually level them up

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.410 
of Heroes you can actually level them up
through<00:00:23.010> using<00:00:23.220> them<00:00:23.460> admissions<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.210> then

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
through using them admissions and then

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.380

use those leveled up skills to increase

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.120 
use those leveled up skills to increase
their<00:00:27.599> stats<00:00:27.930> or<00:00:28.230> abilities<00:00:28.710> stuff<00:00:28.949> like<00:00:29.099> that

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
their stats or abilities stuff like that

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.710

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
so if you didn't play the first game

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.060 
so if you didn't play the first game
essentially<00:00:31.349> you'll<00:00:31.500> start<00:00:31.769> off<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.009> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
essentially you'll start off with a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.709 
essentially you'll start off with a
blank<00:00:32.340> map<00:00:32.579> here<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.059> these<00:00:33.149> little<00:00:33.420> spaces

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
blank map here and these little spaces

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.600 
blank map here and these little spaces
basically<00:00:34.590> tell<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.340> build<00:00:35.520> the

basically tell you you can build the
tower<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.870> case<00:00:37.079> we're<00:00:37.290> going<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
tower there in this case we're going to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.350 
tower there in this case we're going to
have<00:00:37.590> enemies<00:00:37.950> pouring<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.640> trying<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> get<00:00:39.270> to
