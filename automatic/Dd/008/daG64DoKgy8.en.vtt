 today I bring you another recipe this time 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.169
 it's a salad but it has a touch 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.270
 different why why this salad 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.640
 not so low in calories being a 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.829
 Complete food should provide enough 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.230
 protein is going to contribute moderately 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.660
 fat that provide the same carbohydrate 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.730
 We can eat salads equal low 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.190
 in almost zero carbohydrates or salads 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.200
 calories but birds are very boring 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.550
 so here I bring you an option that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.340
 is very very good for this stage of 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.680
 definition that is going to give you flavor is going to 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.630

 reviewing the website is totally 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.129
 new state in it for a long time 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.380
 time there are almost lists and it's not that list 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.630
 all training is already activated 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.340
 online and an explanation about 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.409
 what is this movement that this channel 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.630
 I left my comments down here if they go 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.710
 to review ideas a little hand up for 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.110
 support the channel 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.140
 well let's go to the video 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.730
 we started with the ingredients here 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.700
 he broke them down what they are going to use 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.460
 first it 's lettuce base after 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.220
 We have chicken tastes are 300 grams 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.400
 raw we have 20 grams of peanuts 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.950
 20 grams of blueberries 12 grams or 2 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.290
 spoonfuls of bacon substitute and 2 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.720
 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of dressing 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.640
 Cesar Light the first ingredient of 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.520
 chicken gluten which is a mixture of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.070
 soy protein and chicken make is 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.440
 a source is quite cheap we see that 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.590
 per 100 grams has almost 18 grams of 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.530
 protein 4 grams of fat almost 7 grams 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.350
 of carbohydrates and has a gram of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.720
 fiber then it's a little higher in 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.030
 carbohydrates and fats than chicken but 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.429
 same is still high protein here 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.840
 I show you the ingredients we see that 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.380
 the first ingredient is chicken meat 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.750
 and secondarily soy protein 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.209
 then it is a complete protein and as 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.380
 I told them this package is quite cheap 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.380
 to cost the 25 pesos 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.349
 here the lettuce already disinfected the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.840
 next ingredient for giving a 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.420
 little fat and flavor to the pomegranate are 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.540
 the peanuts enchilados by 100 grams 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.090
 they give us 50 grams of fat 2 of 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.510
 carbohydrates and 27 protein then 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.760
 and they will support good fiber is high in 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.939
 fat and moderate in protein 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.590
 here the dehydrated blueberries this goes 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.860
 to be contrast with salty bats 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.409
 because those pure returns are sweet 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.000
 carbohydrates almost almost pure sugar but 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.709
 It will give us a good flavor and is used in 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.180
 adequate portions we will not use 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.920
 half of the portion that are 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.480
 approximately 16 grams of 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.569
 carbohydrates 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.159
 now the favorite and the richest of all 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.159
 is the invitation the bacon 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.129
 this sometimes I find myself in soria hand 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.090
 provided that I found it and wanted to do 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.090
 the recipe 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.040
 we have that for a spoonful it has a 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.909
 gram of fat one gram of carbohydrates 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.560
 and 2 grams of protein then contributes 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.550
 very good flavor and do not provide many 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.530
 calories 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.840
 and this one of light kisses that was 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.730
 using in recipes notes and it is very 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.610
 good because it gives flavor and does not have 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.960
 a lot of fat has only one gram and 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.940
 medium fat in grams of 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.590
 carbohydrates and has no proteins 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.590
 let's use two portions 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.510
 well here they are all and let's go to step 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.879
 one 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.209
 step 1 is cooking the chicken in the 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.209
 skillet 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.040
 a medium-high and it puts the 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.100
 cooking spray or the oil they are going to 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.100
 use 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.659
 and something very important is that on its own 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.550
 It does not have much flavor 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.890
 this taste for the same thing that has soy 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.200
 but here comes the importance of 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.739
 uneasiness because because anything that 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.060
 let's eat if you do not want zone well no no 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.130
 it's going to have a good taste, it's not going to 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.190
 encourage to eat it then here we have 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.050
 the spices that I use have 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.980
 black pepper or tabasco we have chile 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.980
 lemon and garlic powder 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.980
 this while more 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.440
 best variety get flavors and you 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.529
 you're going to bore less 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.149
 here we give you a little garlic 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:46.789
 to begin taking smoke because if 

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:49.699
 want to burn the powder in the end after 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:53.959
 we have the chile with lemon a bit to 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:56.359
 give that spicy flavor and pepper to 

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:57.859
 end of adding these ingredients to me 

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:59.509
 they like a little more oil or spray 

00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:01.989
 to cook so they stick well 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.989
 ingredients 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.819
 here maybe erletxes but I saw that I was 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:09.819
 would fall it does not make it higher 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.889
 here the second step is to put the 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.749
 lettuce dressing 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:19.879
 the will operates part to be able 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:22.389
 Mix it well before adding the 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.389
 other ingredients 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.270
 the two portions we cover and now the 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.270
 cardio 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.770
 but the bridge 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.520
 good ready now everything is fine 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.470
 mixed we put it in a deep dish 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.630
 where are we going to mix all the 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.670
 ingredients 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.890
 here we add the portions already 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.700
 measures are 20 grams of peanut and 20 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.700
 grams of blueberries 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.870
 Finally you will add the 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.300
 protein already cooked here are the 300 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.430
 grams of chicken 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.879
 the next step is to add the 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.919
 favorite the substitute if he does not 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:17.199
 I was checking the scale so lopez 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:20.390
 in another fret and electronics not all 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:25.060
 they are two portions with 12 grams 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.060
 here it ends up mixing everything very well 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.330
 and we already have the salad what follows is 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.250
 boil I tell them the information 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.860
 nutrimental at the end is for all the 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.729
 recipe but you can easily draw two 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.259
 portions and share with someone 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:41.809
 ah I like to make bigger meals 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:44.300
 to eat less times a day but 

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:48.830
 easily divide those calories between 2 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:52.870
 and there they have their 12 nutrimental 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:56.590
 here we see that the recipe in total has 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:07:00.530
 816 calories 42 grams of carbohydrates 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:03.500
