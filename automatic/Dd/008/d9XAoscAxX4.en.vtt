 hi i am michi change of violet and this 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.799
 is drawing my life I was born in a city 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.719
 which is basically square the silver 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.580
 I have two brothers my dad and my mom 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.620
 I always had a kitten called 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.269
 sofÃ­a and it's pretty lazy and now 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.070
 I have another one called click as I have 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.960
 two brothers never use dolls 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.789
 I always played with the cars and 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.410
 the struggles with my brothers as I had 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.910
 that there should be a balance between 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.109
 men and women almost always what 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.359
 what my older brother was doing was 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.189
 to build works I encouraged myself towards this the grip 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.599
 It is already current if I like to give you 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.280
 it was always thanks to him because when 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.350
 we were kids he always encouraged me 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.270
 to do it and apart he was very 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.610
 creative so from 6 years old 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.140
 I started studying acting in 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.180
 actually to have fun studying 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.920
 study I started studying at 12 that 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.230
 was when I started to understand more or less 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.579
 what it was about when I turned 13 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.079
 and nothing led me to study comedy 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.149
 musical because I saw that not only 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.879
 I liked to act too I liked to sing 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.920
 and dance one day I told justina a 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.019
 friend girl boy to be called 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.390
 I had no idea what they meant here 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.949
 I did not understand what he said there is now in 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.640
 casting you have to upload a video nothing 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.070
 plus 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.050
 20 thousand videos were uploaded and they called 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.000
 11 people and they called me happens that 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.229
 you had to be 17 years older and I 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 I was 15 so I got to the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.409
 producer gave me the face of a baby with 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.479
 the freckles they had and they made 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.280
 do here until it's with tub 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.720

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.190

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.140
 transformed into a hippie was 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.670
 studying theater teachers in the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.470

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.240
 ready I go later I go to the shopping 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.040
 The company's ideas do not seem to me anything 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.229
 Do not prepare a song or prepare a song 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.570
 monologue does not prepare a choreography or 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.910
 there were not many people passing the hours 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.500
 the hours of the calls passed and I said 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.330
 Well it was already the minute that I'm going to do 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.950
 I'm running to a cyber for a 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.630
 track to sing enough a song to 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.090
 dance and wanted to act clueless I 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.830
 I invented them so I went in with decided the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.450
 it's true that I thought they were going to 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.920
 to say that I do not behave as if I'm 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.300
 in my house because I really was not 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.220
 importing at that moment what I thought 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.590
 of those people I left and I had fun 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.899
 ferrÃ© and a lot I made them laugh and when 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.460
 I left they said over there it 's cute and I 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.320
 I said darling, you have to see me 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.690
 They made up two months later they called me 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.580
 for a second casting and I was 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.680
 we are finishing recording the third 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.900
 violet season and I appreciate obvious 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.490
 that I see changes in my against violet without 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.900
 know what some camera without knowing in 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.390
 where I had to stop without knowing 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.610
 basically act and then I learned everything 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.620
 it was my school it was in the place where I 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.540
 I was able to implement everything that I had 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.760
 learned that it was basically theory 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.920
 I went to the practical I made it strong 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.810
 I understood a lot of things I still do 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.210
 understand a lot of others what 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.740
 I hope it is to continue working 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.630
 that I want I do not mind acting in the 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.370
 street at a traffic light in a theater 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.260
 making movies doing television 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.880
 doing anything I want to 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.920
 trunk that what happens to me with the body 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.810

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.410
