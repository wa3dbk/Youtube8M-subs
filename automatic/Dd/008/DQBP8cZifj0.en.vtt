00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:06.540
 hi to all youtube earth and half 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.629
 tips and tricks for a video tutorial on 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.070
 ps3 so how do you connect in wifi 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:17.689
 so wireless to your box where I know 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.689
 what does it really depend on the brand 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.699
 video because I know that before I 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.859
 do not know how to do it and then I looked at a 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.220
 video explained to me and then my lodge and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.839
 can do 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.060
 ouch and a video for all those who 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.790
 were still a few months we see 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.900
 there you go in settings while 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.070
 low ream network after parameters 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:44.780
 Internet connection 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.780
 it's ok so there you make easy 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:54.570
 so after you make connection without 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.150
 wire but of course because connection 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.760
 by cable and it's not on the theme that 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.920
 I 'm here it's wireless here is where 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.170
 you make us stop over who goes this 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.030
 year so there you do mine 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.790
 it's this one so you look at the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.400
 number of livebox your box here you are 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.380
 tap it you do that there you 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.000
 put wpa psk and so on and you 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.070
 go see on your buzz according to the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.720
 mark a lot on them or on them 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.100
 sides or below I do not know where he 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.530
 puts in any case it's over there is a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.700
 code with letters and numbers 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.979
 so you take it you write it 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.320
 undocumented how I did for and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.130
 you write it off by cons 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.070
 otherwise it does not work and I already have it 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.799
 tried with terez it does not work 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.950
 so I thought I forgot the voice 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.950
 age 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:58.900
 so it's a bit long but after you 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:09.890
 you're more annoyed you'll see that 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:15.400
 then and the last ones here are you there 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:18.260
 do it the most expensive side so the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.330
 management of accor verification of the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.450
 reason configuration again thanks for 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.730
 wait so here it is so you 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.070
 displays and stuff you did ok 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.590
 it was the collection so there he will see 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:35.330
 get to check he'll put you self 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.460
 success and all and so that's you 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.480
 see her here for now his mother 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.480
 success story 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.680
 verification in progress ti two 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.329
 checks that's what stuff to 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.489
 cows and so that's it's good 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.340
 normally so collection test 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.170
 finished the salary it's over and there 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.609
 normally to check if you have 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.439
 a playstation network account for 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.629
 really be sure it's one 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.790
 or do bassa collection connects 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.319
 automatically 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.329
 so we'll see if they connect 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.709
 it is that you are connected in wifi 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:19.150
 with your box so it looks like 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.150
 operate to argue 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.290
 so that was it works and so 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.750
 successful tutorial so I hope that you 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.519
 will have helped and all that will have unlocked you 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.549
