considered an emergency because of the

unfortunately<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.490> say<00:00:20.670> I've<00:00:20.789> run<00:00:21.000> off<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
unfortunately I can say I've run off the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.720 
unfortunately I can say I've run off the
road<00:00:21.449> before<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.740> was<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.070> avoid<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> car

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
road before and it was to avoid a car

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.000 
road before and it was to avoid a car
that<00:00:23.970> had<00:00:24.090> pulled<00:00:24.330> right<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.810> front<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.199> me<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
that had pulled right in front of me and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.609 
that had pulled right in front of me and
my<00:00:26.160> ability<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> slow<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.210> car<00:00:27.449> down<00:00:27.619> changed

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
my ability to slow the car down changed

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.089 
my ability to slow the car down changed
greatly<00:00:29.250> because<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.670> was<00:00:29.970> driving<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.570> grass

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
greatly because I was driving on grass

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.310 
greatly because I was driving on grass
this<00:00:32.099> grass<00:00:32.430> surface<00:00:33.000> meant<00:00:33.600> less<00:00:33.899> traction

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
this grass surface meant less traction

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.400 
this grass surface meant less traction
so<00:00:35.190> my<00:00:35.370> braking<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.149> steering<00:00:36.360> became<00:00:37.020> far

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
so my braking and steering became far

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.970 
so my braking and steering became far
less<00:00:37.550> responsive<00:00:38.840> therefore<00:00:39.840> control<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
less responsive therefore control of the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.630 
less responsive therefore control of the
car<00:00:41.329> decreased<00:00:46.129> running<00:00:47.129> off<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.280> road

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
car decreased running off the road

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.260 
car decreased running off the road
really<00:00:48.120> has<00:00:48.420> two<00:00:48.690> causes<00:00:49.489> one<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.820> simply

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
really has two causes one is simply

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.350 
really has two causes one is simply
distractions<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.140> changing<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> radio

were three to four inches tall we would

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.979 
were three to four inches tall we would
have<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> real<00:02:10.979> problem<00:02:11.250> because<00:02:11.610> once<00:02:12.599> we<00:02:12.810> run

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
have a real problem because once we run

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.360 
driving down the road and you do run off
the<00:02:25.980> road<00:02:26.450> your<00:02:27.450> natural<00:02:27.930> instinct<00:02:28.620> will<00:02:29.220> be

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
the road your natural instinct will be

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.630 
the road your natural instinct will be
to<00:02:29.610> quickly<00:02:29.940> steer<00:02:30.420> back<00:02:30.660> onto<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.230> road<00:02:31.640> this

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
to quickly steer back onto the road this

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.450 
to quickly steer back onto the road this
decision<00:02:33.300> can<00:02:33.510> change<00:02:33.570> your<00:02:34.110> life<00:02:34.460> what

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
decision can change your life what

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.390 
decision can change your life what
happens<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.660> when<00:02:37.020> your<00:02:37.260> tire<00:02:37.560> runs<00:02:38.040> into

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
happens is that when your tire runs into

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.030 
happens is that when your tire runs into
that<00:02:38.430> edge<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.270> will<00:02:39.810> block<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.560> can

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
that edge it will block it and can

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.540 
that edge it will block it and can
ultimately<00:02:41.250> flip<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.150> car<00:02:42.420> end<00:02:42.750> over<00:02:43.230> end

let's<00:02:44.550> watch<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.090> video<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:46.050> get<00:02:46.170> an<00:02:46.320> idea<00:02:46.740> as

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
let's watch this video to get an idea as

00:02:46.980 --> 00:03:03.400 
let's watch this video to get an idea as
to<00:02:47.040> what<00:02:47.910> happens

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.370 

now<00:03:04.410> here<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.640> solution<00:03:06.210> if<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.840> run<00:03:07.230> off

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
now here is the solution if you run off

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.150 
now here is the solution if you run off
the<00:03:07.590> road<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:08.370> has<00:03:08.670> an<00:03:08.910> edge<00:03:09.290> burst<00:03:10.290> do<00:03:10.980> not

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
the road that has an edge burst do not

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.210 
the road that has an edge burst do not
hit<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.430> brakes<00:03:11.820> suddenly<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.510> hard<00:03:13.220> slowing

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
hit the brakes suddenly and hard slowing

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.070 
hit the brakes suddenly and hard slowing
down<00:03:14.430> should<00:03:14.820> happen<00:03:15.150> by<00:03:15.300> taking<00:03:15.720> your<00:03:15.810> foot

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
down should happen by taking your foot

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.100 
down should happen by taking your foot
off<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.950> accelerator<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:18.110> softly

straight expect the steering wheel to

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.170 
straight expect the steering wheel to
want<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.260> move<00:03:28.500> around<00:03:28.830> because<00:03:29.160> your<00:03:29.580> car<00:03:29.880> is

want to move around because your car is

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.210 
want to move around because your car is

now off the road on an uneven surface

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.700 
now off the road on an uneven surface
now<00:03:35.220> by<00:03:35.700> steering<00:03:36.120> straight<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.870> slowing

now by steering straight and slowing
down<00:03:37.890> before<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.460> try<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.700> re-enter<00:03:39.270> the<00:03:39.300> road

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
down before you try to re-enter the road

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.730 
down before you try to re-enter the road
you<00:03:40.560> should<00:03:40.920> be<00:03:41.130> under<00:03:41.520> control<00:03:42.380> once<00:03:43.380> under

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
you should be under control once under

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.310 
you should be under control once under
control<00:03:44.190> take<00:03:44.850> your<00:03:45.060> car<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.630> right<00:03:45.930> and

then<00:03:46.800> try<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.040> get<00:03:47.340> back<00:03:47.400> over<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:48.270> edge<00:03:48.660> so

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
then try to get back over that edge so

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.680 
then try to get back over that edge so
that<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.710> tread<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.310> tire<00:03:50.460> meets<00:03:51.450> the

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
factor that makes running off the road

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.960 
factor that makes running off the road
so<00:04:02.520> dangerous<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.210> the<00:04:03.930> Lawson<00:04:04.440> traction<00:04:04.980> some

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
so dangerous is the Lawson traction some

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.750 
so dangerous is the Lawson traction some
road<00:04:06.240> surfaces<00:04:06.930> have<00:04:07.170> great<00:04:07.500> traction<00:04:07.890> so

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
road surfaces have great traction so

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.699 
road surfaces have great traction so
they<00:04:08.880> respond<00:04:09.300> quickly<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:10.020> efficiently<00:04:10.350> to

it is this difference that makes running

it is this difference that makes running
