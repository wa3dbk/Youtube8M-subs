00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
the simulation for the big cards i might

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.880 
the simulation for the big cards i might
not<00:02:28.420> do<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.690> smaller<00:02:28.960> cards<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.380> video<00:02:29.590> i

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
not do the smaller cards that video i

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.710 
not do the smaller cards that video i
did

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
did

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.170 
did
or<00:02:30.810> Donald<00:02:31.320> Cerrone<00:02:31.710> Jim<00:02:32.520> Miller<00:02:32.700> didn't<00:02:33.060> do

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
or Donald Cerrone Jim Miller didn't do

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.380 
or Donald Cerrone Jim Miller didn't do
so<00:02:33.360> well<00:02:33.390> compared<00:02:33.960> to<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.460> UFC<00:02:36.030> one

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
so well compared to the the UFC one

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.970 
so well compared to the the UFC one
whatever<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.900> fuck<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.230> was<00:02:37.260> Ronda<00:02:37.620> Rousey

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
whatever the fuck it was Ronda Rousey

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.430 
whatever the fuck it was Ronda Rousey
and<00:02:38.160> Alexis<00:02:38.880> Davis<00:02:39.240> fight<00:02:39.690> those<00:02:39.900> close<00:02:40.290> to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
and Alexis Davis fight those close to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.560 
and Alexis Davis fight those close to
ones<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:40.980> did<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.280> big<00:02:41.520> card<00:02:41.880> got<00:02:42.420> almost

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
ones I did for that big card got almost

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.700 
ones I did for that big card got almost
a<00:02:42.690> thousand<00:02:43.050> use<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.260> other<00:02:43.320> one<00:02:43.470> got<00:02:43.590> like

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
a thousand use the other one got like

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.060 
a thousand use the other one got like
200<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.640> might<00:02:44.820> not<00:02:44.910> do<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.180> smaller<00:02:45.420> cards

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
200 so I might not do the smaller cards

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.260 
200 so I might not do the smaller cards
but<00:02:47.070> as<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.280> see<00:02:47.400> here<00:02:47.490> Mike<00:02:47.640> Tyson's<00:02:48.000> make<00:02:48.150> it
