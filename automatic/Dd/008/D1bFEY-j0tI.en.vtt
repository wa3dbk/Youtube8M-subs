00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
have to realize that just because I made

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.589 
have to realize that just because I made
one<00:03:46.950> big<00:03:47.130> mistake<00:03:47.190> doesn't<00:03:48.180> mean<00:03:48.299> that<00:03:48.450> it

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
one big mistake doesn't mean that it

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.940 
one big mistake doesn't mean that it
throws<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:49.019> entire<00:03:49.139> thing<00:03:49.590> out<00:03:49.799> of<00:03:49.829> the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
window and it's manageable and then when

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.379 
window and it's manageable and then when
you're<00:03:52.560> on<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.709> recovery<00:03:53.280> like<00:03:53.489> this<00:03:53.819> you're
