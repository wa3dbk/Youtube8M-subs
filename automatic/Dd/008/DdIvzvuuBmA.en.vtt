00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
is but what why don't we just you know

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.840 
is but what why don't we just you know
in<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.620> internet<00:01:00.010> with<00:01:00.250> with<00:01:00.610> all<00:01:00.700> the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
in the internet with with all the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.340 
in the internet with with all the
millions<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:01.270> choices<00:01:01.540> that<00:01:01.900> people<00:01:01.960> have

millions of choices that people have

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.960 
millions of choices that people have
let's<00:01:02.980> just<00:01:03.040> why<00:01:03.370> don't<00:01:03.490> we<00:01:03.550> just<00:01:03.580> make<00:01:03.820> the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
let's just why don't we just make the

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.609 
let's just why don't we just make the
things<00:01:04.210> if<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.510> things<00:01:04.720> can<00:01:04.960> communicate<00:01:05.439> the

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
things if the things can communicate the

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:06.899 
things if the things can communicate the
things<00:01:05.829> that<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.039> ads<00:01:06.189> did<00:01:06.429> before<00:01:06.729> then

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
things that the ads did before then

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.029 
things that the ads did before then
maybe<00:01:07.090> it's<00:01:07.240> better<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.539> do<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.750> things

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
maybe it's better to do the things

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.069 
maybe it's better to do the things
because<00:01:09.539> because<00:01:10.539> they<00:01:10.659> have<00:01:10.840> their<00:01:10.990> own

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
because because they have their own

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.929 
because because they have their own
gravity<00:01:11.530> people<00:01:11.859> come<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.219> the<00:01:12.310> things<00:01:12.549> so<00:01:12.820> if

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
gravity people come to the things so if

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.399 
gravity people come to the things so if
you<00:01:13.090> have<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.390> message<00:01:13.659> in<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.899> things<00:01:14.140> then

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
you have the message in the things then

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.730 
you have the message in the things then
do<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.770> thing<00:01:14.979> I<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.810> I<00:01:16.869> believe<00:01:17.109> all<00:01:17.320> these
