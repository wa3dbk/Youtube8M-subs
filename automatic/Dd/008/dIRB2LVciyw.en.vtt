time<00:00:23.950> the<00:00:24.040> script<00:00:24.310> came<00:00:24.490> I<00:00:24.760> found<00:00:25.420> it<00:00:25.600> very

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
time the script came I found it very

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.250 
time the script came I found it very
shallow<00:00:26.770> I<00:00:27.130> felt<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:27.760> action<00:00:28.600> was<00:00:28.750> there<00:00:28.810> I

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
shallow I felt the action was there I

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.200 
shallow I felt the action was there I
felt<00:00:29.650> the<00:00:30.010> storyline<00:00:30.700> was<00:00:30.820> there<00:00:31.030> the

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
felt the storyline was there the

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.069 
felt the storyline was there the
development<00:00:31.960> of<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.079> character<00:00:33.960> he<00:00:34.960> was

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
development of the character he was

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.840 
development of the character he was
almost<00:00:35.230> humanoid<00:00:35.829> rather<00:00:36.100> than<00:00:36.250> being<00:00:36.430> human

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
almost humanoid rather than being human

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.240 
almost humanoid rather than being human
and<00:00:36.970> they<00:00:37.210> said<00:00:37.390> well<00:00:37.600> talk<00:00:38.230> to<00:00:38.380> us<00:00:38.500> and<00:00:38.800> that's

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
and they said well talk to us and that's

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.760 
and they said well talk to us and that's
and<00:00:39.730> we<00:00:39.850> basically<00:00:40.000> rebuilt<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:41.290> bit<00:00:41.440> of<00:00:41.560> Sam's

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
and we basically rebuilt a bit of Sam's
