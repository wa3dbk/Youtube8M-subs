 very comfortable management is great 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.080
 review excellent accuracy and 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.380
 armor penetration of water allows

 waters and dowdy down to level eight 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.890

 exact gun with high stoke pluses 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.219
 can be attributed to a large margin of safety 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.730
 and also about your urban armor but to the minuses 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.300
 heroic display 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.510
 score and big sizes you're bad 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.230
 the mobility of the most armor sides of the feed and 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.380
 roofs 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.500
 many weak spots in the head are large 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.370
 dimensions and with the days of the transmission that's it 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.370
 main disadvantage 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.510
 armor sides and poop even thinner times

 this allows the beaver to change direction 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.670
 attacks and return to the base did not shy away 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.360
