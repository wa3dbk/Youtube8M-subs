00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
repeat to the other side and then we'll

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.070 
repeat to the other side and then we'll
move<00:05:28.800> on<00:05:29.030> now<00:05:30.030> using<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.449> same<00:05:30.660> technique

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
move on now using the same technique

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.600 
move on now using the same technique
that<00:05:31.260> we<00:05:31.350> used<00:05:31.560> to<00:05:31.680> create<00:05:31.800> this<00:05:31.949> French<00:05:32.370> seam

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610

down<00:05:32.789> here<00:05:33.120> we're<00:05:33.300> going<00:05:33.389> to<00:05:33.449> do<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:33.720> same

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
down here we're going to do the same

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.140 
down here we're going to do the same
thing<00:05:34.139> along<00:05:34.260> the<00:05:34.500> side<00:05:34.740> seams<00:05:35.039> so<00:05:35.789> here<00:05:36.030> I'm

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
thing along the side seams so here I'm

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.510
