00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:08.690
 favor world agricultural production has increased the constant rate and 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.960
 relatively fast since the 1960s following a different rhythm according to the 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.390
 characteristics of the performance of the economy of each country 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.990
 if the factors that to a greater or lesser extent contribute to the growth and 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.560
 strengthening of the poultry industry are these conditions of production 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.320
 government policies such as health legislation development 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.080
 of the support industry and corporate strategies such as 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.900
 business and market structure 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.120
 in the most poultry production appointment 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.220
 we can take pieces of the substitutes as the one to face in which the 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.600

 hoyer price on coin came to the air 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.620
 I think it's funny 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.620
 This process is the use of waste generated in the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.200
 egg production by which we take advantage of the chicken manure 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.020
 we mix it with a mate in carbon 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.440
 which we think of a process that calls composting that is a biological process 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.730
 in which we inject aviation 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.550
 We achieved that the microorganisms that are present in the chicken manure 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.310
 the temperatures between 60 and 70 degrees Celsius which he killed 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.780
 autonomic organisms that are harmful to plants and to humans 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.920
 creating a product that is a soil conditioner which is very 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.880
 used in key 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.080
 in the agriculture 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.240
 collía this loan avaya and thus nothing between which to throw in the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.060
 farming 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.189
 this compost 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.070
 it's a floor conditioner 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.230
 what it does is improve the structure of the soil 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.490
 per cent improving the ideation 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.690
 the current lyrical poetry the ground 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.970
 and also you 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.659
 the one that improves the conditions that are said 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.850

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.320
 takes advantage of the nutrients that are raised in the soil, in addition the product has 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.649
 microorganisms 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.649
 that improves soil microbiology 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.920
 if we came to mind the holy hen 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.769
 without any process like the one done in the field 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.779
 what negative consequences we could have 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.659

 the two products are two of them again 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.990
 percent among them stands out is the main product 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.789
 we hope the pasteurized racing car 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.499
