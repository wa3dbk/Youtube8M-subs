00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.710
 hello androids here is the first video 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.610
 of 2014 as you can notice I have a 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.850
 new avatar 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.369
 xd and more tutorials are coming and what 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.860
 in two although I will also use my voice to 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 some videos by the time we enter 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.730
 full with a tutorial on how 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.820
 pass applications to memory 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.650
 external this serves in case your cell phone does not 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.009
 has the option to move the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.079
 applications to external memory serves 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.700
 of much for those who have a samsung 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:42.060
 galaxy s3 s3 mini os4 but also serves 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.030
 with other cell phones the requirements is 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.740
 have your terminal surrounded 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.740
 ok let's go to the tutorial 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.260
 first we are going to give him play and 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.960
 we write mobile folder 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.559
 I remind you that it only works if you have 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.070
 rooted your cell phone and downloaded it 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.070
 we install 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.750
 after we download it we proceed 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.120
 to open it as you can see I already have two 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.869
 past games to the sb that are more 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.869
 FaltÃ³n hold San Andreas we will play the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.259
 more to add an application we 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.540
 will show three options the first where 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.000
 you can put the name of the game the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.330
 second for the game folder and the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.050
 third the destination folder of the game yo 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.790
 for example use the asphalt game 8 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.149
 we touch on the second option and we search 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.570
 the source folder in my case is in 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.570
 android 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.659
 job 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.940
 and here I will look for the game folder by 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.180
 last we only select the popcorn 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.280
 to validate after the third option 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.210
 we will not use it because it is created 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.310
 automatically after that we play 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.640
 the tack until it turns green 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.910
 to activate the game and ready the game 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.610
 It will be passed to the external memory them 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.180
 I will show an example of the game gta san 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.180
 andreas 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.519
 now finally I will show you what serves 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.519
 showing my applications 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.690
 Y 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.220
 as you can see I have many 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.220
 some too heavy applications 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.480
 ah 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.120

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.920
