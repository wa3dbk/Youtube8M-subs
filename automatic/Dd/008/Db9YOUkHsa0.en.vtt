00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 Hello everyone, I have Irina with you 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:14.670
 such one interesting orchid which 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:16.710
 they gave me a year ago, she was a year not bloomed well, 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.430
 what is the most interesting whole year for me 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.650
 she is also not 32 so I did not do it 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:29.250
 does not want to bloom but we are increasing 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:34.230
 Colossally, I havenâ€™t already transplanted her 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.480
 from an ordinary pot to a bigger pot 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.140
 we see what happens with us that is 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:45.989
 how much we are taller than our pot 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.149
 I see that the plant is already enough 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.890
 so old and 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.370
 I want to try 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.870
 this orchid rejuvenate how do 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:03.270
 dividing the bush here 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.270
 root and everything is increasing and increasing and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.630
 we grow leaves no more 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:16.210
 do there is such an interesting one for me 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:21.810
 Orchid abalone under the root and the form below 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:27.750
 there is root growth very active 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:32.289
 orhideyka soot din roots we see on 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.180
 all over the pot grow enormously 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.550
 that is, it was literally transplanted 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.270
 two weeks ago and we see that we have 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.030
 going on with the roots 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.950
 so that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.299
 I think that in the next video we will be with 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.540
 try to divide you somehow 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.180
 this bush rejuvenate it and we will 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.390
 try to do so from orchid 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.259
