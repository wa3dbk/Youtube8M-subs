I'm making Ragi Porridge

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:43.330
What are the ingredients for Ragi Porridge?
Just Ragi powder and some water

00:00:44.693 --> 00:01:01.545
This is specially made. First, we need to soak the finger millets and let them sprout.
Then sun dry them before grinding into a powder.

00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:20.103
Boil some water

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:33.070
Add 2 tsp of ragi powder into a bowl of water

00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:26.299
Mix the powder well without any lumps

00:02:36.653 --> 00:02:41.702
Add the mixed ragi water into the boiling water

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.176
We need to be careful when cleaning the finger millets/ragi.

00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:24.895
If needed add a little jaggery but never add sugar
 as it is not safe for infants

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:58.853
Take it into a serving bowl
