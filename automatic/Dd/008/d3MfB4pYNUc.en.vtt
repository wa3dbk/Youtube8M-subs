good<00:00:32.160> tip<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> speed<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> maximum

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
good tip is the speed and the maximum

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.590 
good tip is the speed and the maximum
speed<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.649> 51<00:00:35.250> miles<00:00:35.520> per<00:00:35.700> hour<00:00:35.940> however<00:00:36.570> I

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
speed is 51 miles per hour however I

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.119 
speed is 51 miles per hour however I
will<00:00:36.930> say<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.559> feel<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:37.980> you're

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
will say that you do feel like you're

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.010 
will say that you do feel like you're
going<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.550> bit<00:00:38.730> faster<00:00:39.270> than<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.600> because

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
going a bit faster than that because

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.500 
going a bit faster than that because
this<00:00:40.320> coaster<00:00:40.649> winds<00:00:41.070> around<00:00:41.190> itself<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:41.910> much

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
this coaster winds around itself so much

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.389 
this coaster winds around itself so much
that<00:00:43.020> definitely<00:00:43.350> has<00:00:43.500> an<00:00:43.680> impact<00:00:44.100> but

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
that definitely has an impact but

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.369 
that definitely has an impact but
nonetheless<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:45.059> will<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.329> receiving<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.899> 5<00:00:46.170> out

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
nonetheless it will be receiving a 5 out

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
nonetheless it will be receiving a 5 out
of<00:00:46.410> 10<00:00:46.620> not<00:00:46.739> bad<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.579> total<00:00:47.879> height<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.210> this

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
of 10 not bad the total height for this

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.900 
of 10 not bad the total height for this
coaster<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.660> 92<00:00:49.289> feet<00:00:49.649> tall<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.489> not<00:00:50.700> very

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
coaster is 92 feet tall it's not very

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.029 
coaster is 92 feet tall it's not very
tall<00:00:51.149> however<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.930> pretty<00:00:52.379> average<00:00:52.710> for

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
tall however that is pretty average for

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.400 
tall however that is pretty average for
most<00:00:53.309> wooden<00:00:53.969> roller<00:00:54.180> coasters<00:00:54.660> but<00:00:54.899> for

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
most wooden roller coasters but for

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.959 
most wooden roller coasters but for
roller<00:00:55.680> coasters<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.070> general<00:00:56.730> that's

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
roller coasters in general that's

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.180 
roller coasters in general that's
actually<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.960> shorter<00:00:58.440> side<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:58.710> we'll<00:00:59.010> be

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
actually on the shorter side so we'll be

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.549 
actually on the shorter side so we'll be
receiving<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.789> 4<00:01:00.120> however<00:01:00.780> 4<00:01:01.020> coasters<00:01:01.379> like

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
receiving a 4 however 4 coasters like

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.070 
receiving a 4 however 4 coasters like
this<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.190> doesn't<00:01:02.579> really<00:01:02.730> need<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.390> super

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
this it doesn't really need to be super

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.870 
this it doesn't really need to be super
tall<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.650> personally<00:01:05.189> don't<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.519> problem

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
tall I personally don't have a problem

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.460 
tall I personally don't have a problem

smoother<00:01:18.900> wooden<00:01:19.259> roller<00:01:19.470> coasters<00:01:19.920> however

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
smoother wooden roller coasters however

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.370 
smoother wooden roller coasters however
it<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.850> pretty<00:01:21.210> good<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.080> will<00:01:22.229> be

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
it is pretty good and it will be

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380 
it is pretty good and it will be
receiving<00:01:22.860> another<00:01:22.950> 7<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> drop

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
receiving another 7 for the drop

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.870 
receiving another 7 for the drop
category<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.590> how<00:01:25.710> good<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.400> drop<00:01:26.640> is

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
category this is how good the drop is

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.819 
category this is how good the drop is
and<00:01:27.090> what's<00:01:27.270> cool<00:01:27.509> about<00:01:27.540> these<00:01:27.960> 2<00:01:28.229> drops<00:01:28.560> is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
and what's cool about these 2 drops is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.130 
and what's cool about these 2 drops is
that<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.790> two<00:01:29.970> lifts<00:01:30.210> tails<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.540> running<00:01:30.960> up

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
that the two lifts tails are running up

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350 
that the two lifts tails are running up
against<00:01:31.680> each<00:01:31.829> other<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.250> they<00:01:32.610> both<00:01:32.880> curve

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
against each other and they both curve

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.300 
against each other and they both curve
to<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> side<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> major

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
to the side and so one of the major

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.980 
to the side and so one of the major
aspects<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.180> coaster<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
aspects with this coaster is that you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.929 
aspects with this coaster is that you
are<00:01:37.110> dueling<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> other<00:01:37.860> train<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
are dueling the other train and that

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.179 
are dueling the other train and that
definitely<00:01:39.210> makes<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> drop<00:01:40.049> more<00:01:40.320> fun<00:01:40.710> when

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
definitely makes the drop more fun when

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.130 
definitely makes the drop more fun when
speaking<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> intensity<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.659> coaster

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
speaking of the intensity this coaster

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.960 
speaking of the intensity this coaster
