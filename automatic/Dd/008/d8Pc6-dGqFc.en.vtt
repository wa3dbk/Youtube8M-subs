00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.269
 the injectors are located in the intake manifold 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:18.310
 the injector consists of a much needed in olite 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.519
 of a I got it in the valves of abuse 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.650
 When the solenoid coil is energized the plunger and the valve 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.649
 water move up to open the insect 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.040
 the ps m receives the signal from the sensors located around the motor 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.030
 and it determines the opening time of any convenient sector for the 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.030
 engine conditions 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.740
 in other words 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.010
 the volume of the fuel injected is determined by the time of injection 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.990
 and this could be appreciated by reading current data in the jalisco 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.550
 field 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.550
 The following are several way to check in the sector 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.630
 checking injector resistance 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.260
 checking operation sound 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.100
 checking with a test lamp 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.660
 checking the inspector's wave 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.240
 checking the injection with the current data in the country field 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.340
 for checking resistance resistance life directly 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.240
 after removing the insect connector 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.700
 This form will check the condition of the indec coil 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.540
 To check the operation sound of the indec tor, use the 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.540
 stethoscope with a screwdriver with the motor on 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.480
 in this way proven the sound of the operation of time what not some 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.479
 of abuse 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.530
 to check the indec thor operation with a test lamp 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.950
 I connected one end of the preval lamp to the positive end of the battery 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.310
 and connect the other end on the side of cierval the injector provided by the s 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:15.389
 Then turn on the engine or keep dobrev valentine to check that the 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:17.079
 lamp part 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.189
 in this way we buy and the one that is controlling the undefeated if there is 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.189
 some damage in the wiring 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.079
 bush 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.840
 for checking the wave of the director of topics with letter of the silos 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:39.529
 frozen control of the ccma 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:43.419
 the wave of the inspector should look like on that screen when you're 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.669
 starting the engine or when we are worth 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.799
 In the injector probes the voltage should be equal to the voltage of 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.509
 battery before and after the injection 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.939
 otherwise, it would mean that there is a problem in the power supply 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.559
 from the positive terminal of the matter to the terminal of undefeated 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:06.019
 on the same side the voltage should be close to zero volts as 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.319
 Show the screen 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.279
 while the indec doreste in full operation 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:14.460
 otherwise, it would mean that there is a problem with which to fill 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.460
 or the wiring of the national institute of the dc 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.450
 to check the injection condition of the currency injector 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.719
 Engine inspector that installs it in the nozzle tester 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.399
 thus check the injection while powering the injector 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:36.289
 in this way we can check if there is any obstruction inside the insect 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.609
 the injection duration of the current data is a value calculated by the 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.609
 psn to control the undefeated 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.569
 use this value as a reference because the duration of the actual undefeated 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.919
 could be different from current data
