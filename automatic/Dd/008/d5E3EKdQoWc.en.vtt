00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello hello that such today I come with a top 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.150
 10 of creatures heads of the survival 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.980
 horror that I have after making some 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.160
 how many internet surveys 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.620
 here are creatures to my mind clear 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.509
 it's good I do not take any more time 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.660
 with this talk and it will be better than 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.789
 start number 10 here we go 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.550
 starting the top with a creature that 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.320
 appears in the origins of his saga 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.269
 we talk about the video game butcher 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.920
 silent hill origins 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.219
 before continuing I would like to give a brief 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.140
 introduces the game to which it belongs 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.149
 silent hill origins speaks as it says 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.120
 name of the origins of the later 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.250
 silent hill 1 in this installment is revealed 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.260
 a few secrets of the saga like the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.510
 of osf laurus so that it does not hurt 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.660
 both the head but still remains 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.610
 one of the most mysterious rohr animals 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.350
 good recovering the subject the butcher is 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.870
 a creature similar to the head 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.210
 pyramidal owns a big machete of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.000
 butcher and an apron stained with blood 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.190
 unlike pyramidal head this one 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.900
 It has a kind of diamond that covers the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.940
 half of his face 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.520
 they tell us that it is the past of the head 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.800
 pyramidal makes its first appearance in 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.350
 the butchery impaling with his huge 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.540
 machete to a nurse mannequin according to 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.310
 we see in the game this creature is a 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.560
 little bloodier than the head 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.600
 pyramidal passing scenes where it looks 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.460
 annihilating with ease the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.370
 creatures that you take so much work 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.200
 kill them as a method of intimidation 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.210
 when at the end of the game you take the final 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.940
 bad travis becomes the next 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.820
 butcher that would be the later head 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.320
 pyramidal as to draw the bad ending 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.900
 You need to kill countless 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.060
 creatures it is possible that the butcher 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.820
 be the representation of masochism in 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.420
 the village of silent hill good is just 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.790
 a hypothesis has put me number 9 of 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.150
 video game dino crisis 2 comes walking 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.520
 the gigantosaurus dino crisis 2 deals with 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.680
 the continuation of the 1 obviously haha 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.630
 and with the help of the doctor's technology 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.910
 kill travel in time to bring 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.790
 They say another third energy disc 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.530
 but since they are such assholes they end up 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.269
 going to the future instead of the past 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.050
 time which is infested of 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.940
 dinosaur 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.850
 where then you will have to find out the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.800
 origin and survive as always good 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.080
 the gigantosaurus is a creature of 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.030
 approximately 6 meters high with 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.860
 a great force in the jaw since 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.660
 near the end of the game you see that 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.330
 eliminates the tiger c's from an attack of 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.100
 Jaw and is easily eaten good 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.140
 some will tell me why I put this 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.380
 creature in this top if it's easier 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.730
 kill him and his attacks do not take away much 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.190
 well that would say the loops that 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.380
 they spent playing 300 thousand times worthy 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.960
 Crisis' 2 in easy way without changing 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.970
 level since in normal or difficult mode 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.300
 drastically change the difficulty 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.190
 example a hit of the gigantosaurus in 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.260
 Easy mode takes away less from the octave 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.600
 part of life and a blow the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.580
 gigantosaurus in difficult mode takes away 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.680
 as the fourth part of porrazo also 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.960
 that leaves you in hemorrhage and a 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.330
 Gigantosaurus in a single attack makes you 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.040
 like three punches with the jawbone there 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.680
 you just take the account what is the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.210
 approaching fuck until your scream te 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.780
 throw against the wall leaving you 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.430
 unconscious for a few seconds 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.640
 this is the reason why the 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.910
 gigantosaurus is in this position 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.400
 number 8 william birkin my character 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.430
 favorite would have put it number 1 but 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.130
 it does not occupy position 8 thanks to one of 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.930
 the greatest deeds that he did 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.120
 right he created the virus but also 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.130
 because his story is somewhat ironic already 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.080
 which is this one who helps spencer to 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.540
 get rid of marcus to pick up the 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.670
 sample of the virus and it is this that controls 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.220
 kill virgin to collect the sample 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.989
 the virus that consequently it is 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.239
 injected the virus sample that 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.880
 had in his possession and using his little 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.380
 use of reason I had at that time 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.870
 annihilated the entire mercenary team 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.390
 of central umbrella also for its 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.239
 obsession with the virus and multiple mutations 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.310
 occupies this position it simply does 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.519
 one of the most formidable creatures in 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.970
 the saga along with wesker and alexia put 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.730
 number 7 canon mount or cannon head 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.160
 this creature appears in the video game 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.750
 hybrid parasite if you lived 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.209
 you talk about a time where 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.000
 mitochondria has its own intelligence and 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.730
 can control the being 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.710
 but this only happened in animals but 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.680
 now it is in humans and it is your duty 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.570
 get to the bottom of all this good canon 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.600
 would mount one of the creatures more 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.330
 difficult if it's your first time clear without 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.250
 see guides or the same trucks on youtube 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.170
 I put in this position since it is one of the 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.150
 main requirements to get the 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.460
 final good but that's the most annoying 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.740
 since to do that you must kill him in 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.410
 less than three minutes or if you will not leave 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.780
 cash and leaving everything destroyed besides that 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.669
 the dog dies and his scream is a bit 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.500
 annoying and you also have to have 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.720
 certain fish awakened to finish 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.000
 with him easily and if you get to 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.730
 play in nightmare mode in one fell swoop 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.430
 you could leave already laid 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.930
 number 6 here comes a creature that 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.090
 has to do a lot in all 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.000
 deliveries of his saga yes yes already what 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.860
 they guessed that is samuel or also 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.470
 called in the Japanese version as 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.630
 incubus this creature makes its appearance 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.720
 in the first installment of silent hill 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.730
 dalÃ­ account as I saw them do silent hill 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.770
 it's a town that has been consumed by 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.600
 the shadows as a result of the 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.360
 dark rituals he performed 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.310
 a religious sect in silent hill more 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.770
 later it is known that it is called the wing 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.770
 kudus is the representation of the assumption 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.870
 god that represented that sect were going to 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.090
 use that daughter from the head of the 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.360
 sect that would be to bring sam to him 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.130
 to the outside world as an intermediary 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.200
 but travis ruins dahlia plans 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.330
 and it makes the soul of alessa divide 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.030
 in two so that he can not leave samael 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.520
 later when samael is released 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.440
 she was willing to try 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.620
 control the creature but this one 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.630
 ends up killing her samael or even has 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.910
 the appearance of a goat male with 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.190
 Incubus wings is one of the main 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.100
 Why the people of silent 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.660
 hill is in the darkness this creature 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.790
 is the one that makes all the 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.950
 thoughts and fears of all those 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.260
 that go to the unfortunate village as well as 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.970
 the little one to that one apparently has 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.820
 certain influence on the baltc and the 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.490
 pyramidal head as sent creatures 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.930
 for this one maybe this creature is a 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.360
 of the weakest of the survival 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.430
 horror but occupies this position thanks to 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.169
 his omnipresence in all the silent 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.810
 hill 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.479
 good friends until here comes the first 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.819
 part do not forget to comment score 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:43.819
 and subscribe and then I do the second 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.819
 part until later and good luck chao
