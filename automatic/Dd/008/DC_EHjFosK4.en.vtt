00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.360 
generation ipod touch it's tethered
which<00:04:01.080> means<00:04:01.350> you<00:04:01.470> have<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.650> do<00:04:01.860> this<00:04:01.890> every

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
which means you have to do this every

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.440 
which means you have to do this every
time<00:04:02.550> you<00:04:03.420> turn<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:03.959> which<00:04:04.620> kind<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.130> sucks

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
time you turn it on which kind of sucks

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.730 
time you turn it on which kind of sucks
okay<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:06.510> once<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.930> do<00:04:07.020> this<00:04:07.170> you'll<00:04:07.440> get

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
okay so once you do this you'll get

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.640 
okay so once you do this you'll get
black<00:04:08.130> rain<00:04:08.750> hopefully<00:04:09.750> y'all<00:04:10.170> might<00:04:10.440> be<00:04:10.470> able

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650
