00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.100
 Accurate time measurement stabs modern cutting-edge technology 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.159
 It will be a battle to measure space 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.159
 Support the development of today's information society 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.070
 National Institute of Information and Communications Technology 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.679
 New Generation Network Research Center 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.609
 In the light bamboo standard break and also lacking in the ultimate watch 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.300
 Work on research and development aiming at the hall according to the new era 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.300
 Is out 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.470
 In Japan 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.270
 The time that everyone can use in common 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.270
 Japan Standard Time 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.470
 With Japan Standard Time child 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.700
 In the regional headquarters of Koganei City, Tokyo 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.350
 How long is the current time 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.450
 In the 1960s 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.760
 There is no problem with itself adopted by the International Conference on Weights and Measures 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.940
 Mental age April 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.240
 I'm bullied 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.200
 Create Japanese Standard Time 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
 70 points by promotion of 70 next 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.350
 Add more 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.800
 Started 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.090
 Patrol ship died + cvt frequency 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.780
 It basically enables the most faithful search 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.820
 Well 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.870
 Even if it continued to move for 15 million years 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.230
 I went forward with an accuracy of about a second 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.110
 in this way 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.200
 Standard person who makes an exact round of Geneva 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.090
 Long-term continuous unavailability and combination of communication technology and experience 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.070
 Create a highly significant chairmanship by 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.780
 can do 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.690
 Junji Honcho in the same city is a coordinated universal time used as a global standard 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.410
 Answer 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.410
 It is exactly the difference in time 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.979
 Weight approximately 300 units same 34 degrees low 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.010
 As a result of searching for quality using satellites 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.010
 I'm looking at bie 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.259
 Going to the same period last year at Kensuke Office 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:22.529
 Sequel 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.689
 Coordinated Universal Time has been decided 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.780
 Japan is the point where it cooperates 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.519
 Revised city planning decision 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.749
 It is positive for the time limit of Coordinated Universal Time 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:39.370
 Japan Standard Time was created in this way 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.919
 In a few days 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.119
 It was delivered to all over Japan in various ways 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:51.659
 The phase that the radio clock receives is the standard radio 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.369
 It seems that there will be no impact on Europe supplying Fukushima Prefecture. 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:01.619
 Sent 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.279
 I understood 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.879
 Flower donation at the site achieving 50 million units 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.189
 The principal sent from Fukuoka receives a standard radio wave 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:13.629
 others 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.999
 Full of broadcasters and spirit 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.579
 We will launch this time newly by not using in-house 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.579
 Japan's politics say 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.879
 Using the internet 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.559
 Provides a public ntp service that can be used to adjust the time on a PC 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:32.519
 doing 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.989
 Time stamp function used in e-commerce etc. 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.279
 This time cdna 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:42.419
 Used by Japan Standard Time provided as a national time stamper 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.799
 It has been 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.029
 By precise time continuation 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:51.029
 It is said that the village using satellites is not standing 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:54.279
 In the cold wave 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:55.739
 Fukushima first character 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.419
 I can buy it now 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.389
 We can measure time with precision of one billionth of a second 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:07.139
 Currently positioning system 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.139
 Because it is rice gps and record 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.389
 I don't want to cut my own quasi-zenith satellite in Japan 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.029
 This fall 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.029
 I will do it in that 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.430
 Will measure the air force position 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.300
 Kashima Space Technology Center 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.990
 Two or more large antennas in the storefront of the view of Christmas 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.289
 Receive at 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.639
 Determine a part of the antenna with an accuracy of a few millimeters 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:41.569
 Is 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.539
 You can find out on the road side of the opening ceremony with a large grain 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.289
 From the measurement up to 30 days 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.559
 It is one of the world's markets 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:54.619
 An international global reference coordinate system has been established 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.309
 In addition, one meter is easy to understand central meeting 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:06.079
 The price reduction of 199 9 8 783 383 is real 

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:09.079
 I am carrying 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.520
 These disappeared 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.430
 1 hit 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.430
 I tell the story that the process of participating in the expedition is based on now 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.360
 is 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.779
 While continuing to beat content 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.369
 Renovate the people still keeping accurate time 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.219
 We made 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:33.269
 Research institutes around the world including niche 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.490
 Popular for seeking more accuracy 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.379
 The current attention is reversed in eight times 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.300
 For accurate time search 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.300
 Needs various technological developments 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:52.249
 Is it a higher vibration verification? 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:53.650
 Prefecture at Foreign Ministers Meeting 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.650
 It was one of the powerful methods 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.300
 But it is one of the conditions 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.280
 I also used calcium ions 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.110
 Fun to people 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.120
 The leading technology of Japan top is used 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:11.509
 And 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.449
 Use for practicing team practice 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.509
 But I want this way 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.669
 Many strontium 90 yen 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.379
 Even to keep directx10 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.990
 It is turning around in practice to conclude the laser weapon prohibition law 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.990
 I use the technology called dental technician 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.029
 I do not have a cheerful voice for the red group chairperson 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.990
 Current product quality is not functional but correctness complete 

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:39.119
 Owns 

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:42.269
 Inverted to 8 times using cutting-edge technology 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:46.969
 Next generation vedbiya 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:49.999
 A day without voice by satellite positioning 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.099
 By integrating these into a de facto standard 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.099
 Evolve to the next stage 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.169
 Explore the area with the ultimate accuracy 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:06.939
 Open a new world 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:10.189
 Our study group 

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:11.209
 Big applause
