00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:14.720
 The dividend also seems to be black on the evening 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:20.039
 Oh , this time in the game called Minecraft 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:23.449
 I think that I want to do the ice mass of Filo 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.449
 It is no good 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.010
 You might say this door 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.829
 Kedomo I think I want to introduce this time I think that can be seen Well at this 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.040
 Simply put 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.750
 It can be done simply by pressing the button that can be easily erased and put on 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.190
 It is a nether gate 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.950
 Anyway, let's try it anyway. 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.940
 It feels like 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.930
 Have in 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.930
 Of course 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.550
 I feel like this 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.790
 Because it is heavy 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.790
 I did 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.390
 In kicking or pressing the Pochitsu big time the button this 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.390
 Oh it is said 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.640
 Something like this 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:15.229
 Kyle has always been like this 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.250
 I think it has become quite compact for myself, but what about 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.120
 I suppose 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.120
 Something like this 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.219
 Like this 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.220
 Well, if you do something about what you are doing 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.310
 In this part 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:42.770
 First of all it is a here we are doing the same thing as this 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:45.220
 This has sent a selfish to say you and the most shortest 7 days of the over power are doing 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.220
 You are buying Do 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.870
 I like it send the power to say, 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.440
 And next is this, but Red Stone block is far away 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.180
 It is state to say 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.180
 This is to say that the pressure-sensitive adhesive piston 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.430
 right 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:12.130
 It is possible to attach a bellock and impose a mango, though 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.130
 There is only a few features with this 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.940
 Although it is here, for example 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.940
 If such Fu to do in the ordinary 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:27.040
 in this way 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.370
 Also the Tteyuu future particular Sakura speed Kedomo I repeated as a moving as moving 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.640
 If you early or 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.640
 this 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.110
 OK 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.310
 I'm Agareru It is like this 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.170
 We went over there to be using the same 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.020
 So this is maa 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.930
 This is why you are creating an early guy with this 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.880
 That 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:58.650
 Well we do the same thing here 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.650
 You are switching the power with this 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.370
 I am allowed to pass through it like this 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.550
 And 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:15.010
 This is well connected here as it is 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.010
 This is when you say and what you are doing 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:23.670
 First of all , this is water in the dispenser, but this is also a feature of this 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:27.590
 I guess I do have to say 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.590
 For example Kedomo is a dispenser 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.490
 There is water in this 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.060
 If you only send the power once , it 's like the water is out 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.060
 Meaning not 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.840
 It is just before 5 came out 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.420
 Yes 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.270
 Such feeling 0 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:50.560
 If it disappears by sending power one more time now 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:54.960
 That in it Kedomo I like this feeling 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:59.810
 If you only bought one power, it means that water will be left 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.810
 If so, water will keep coming out of here and it will be positive 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.630
 Well still people are good but 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.630
 The fact that not may be doubled 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:14.660
 here we have 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:21.140
 I also use 9 days and take it out for at least 7 days 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:24.090
 At first we send power one time here and let's delay for a while and send effort one more time 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.650
 It is erased by 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:33.790
 That 's why I am sending 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:35.710
 Well I try to make it once, first it is obsidian, if it is shaky, it is Showa 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.780
 Feeling 0 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.110
 Yes 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.110
 Right? 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.729
 I feel like this 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.510
 And the dispenser here with the country 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.900
 Keep button 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.250
 And here 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.250
 Make a hole in the ground 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:01.180
 First of all here in this place Red Stone 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:06.060
 Well here also but what is 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:10.770
 I used sand on the circuit of the mushroom, but it's an ordinary piste 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.970
 It is possible to use an adhesive piston if you say why this is the case . 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.970
 The same thing 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.710
 If it is an adhesion piston, it will work even if it is not a block where the top falls like sand 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:26.350
 It was not now 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.350
 A place where I will make a list though 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.590
 Although it was a piston , even if it is not an adhesion piston 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.230
 eh 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:50.440
 Oh , I can do it even with a sand block on the piston zest 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:55.500
 If you give it well, it will be a reduction of slime ball, so this time we will use sand 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.969
 Cage will separate adhesive piston is a person who says Takusan'a Rutte 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.139
 Separately 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:03.600
 I don't care if I have a shacha and I'll repeat here 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.320
 Yes like this 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.320
 Something like this 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:14.030
 And like this to the end of this child's repeater 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.490
 Red stone north 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.969
 And in this place powder here 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.310
 Like this 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:26.130
 With a mistake 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.130
 It's like this and here with the repeat 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:34.270
 And Place repeater Mase here also I with I'm here. 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:39.990
 It 's connected if you turn here into powder 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.990
 I will drink and do the same thing as I did earlier 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.719
 Right? 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:53.409
 And I will tell you the power here 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:53.409
 Already 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:00.499
 Kew 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.969
 I wonder if you'll do 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.539
 It was like a tie 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:07.539
 I see 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.180
 Oh 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.420
 And 9 blocks 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.420
 Or prevent from being connected to it 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.750
 Next to a man 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.750
 And a little delay 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:33.860
 Do I mean 1 is I 1 of the Kanami Hen' 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:36.100
 It can be said that it can be attacked 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.190
 It works properly 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.900
 later 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.900
 It blooms pretty well 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:51.529
 The other is the water bucket on one side x way 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:55.299
 11 Put the money on this side 

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:55.299
 Turn on the water bucket in mouth 

00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:07.390
 If you can buy it like this because it is easy 

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:10.110
 I think it's pretty easy 

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:16.340
 Maa like this 

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:16.340
 Thank you very much for watching you want to end this introduction for now
