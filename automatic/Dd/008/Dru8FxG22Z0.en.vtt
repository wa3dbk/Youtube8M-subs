if I take them to a friend's house or

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.139 
if I take them to a friend's house or
something<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:37.440> can<00:00:37.590> tell<00:00:37.770> apart<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.460> Lucy

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
something we can tell apart this is Lucy

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.410 
something we can tell apart this is Lucy
the<00:00:39.360> peace<00:00:39.570> puppy<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.730> when<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> got<00:00:42.000> her<00:00:42.239> I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the peace puppy and when I got her I

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.869 
the peace puppy and when I got her I
thought<00:00:42.600> her<00:00:42.899> ears<00:00:43.200> were<00:00:43.410> wrong<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> cut<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
thought her ears were wrong so I cut and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.529 
thought her ears were wrong so I cut and
sewed<00:00:45.120> them<00:00:45.360> back<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.420> they<00:00:48.420> are

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
sewed them back on like this so they are

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.500 
sewed them back on like this so they are
facing<00:00:48.809> forward<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:50.219> unique<00:00:50.940> piece<00:00:51.120> puppy<00:00:51.480> I

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
facing forward so a unique piece puppy I

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.290 
facing forward so a unique piece puppy I
guess<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.860> her<00:00:52.980> w<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.579> when<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> was
