00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:03.460
 Hello friends 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.040
 the baby in the big bath 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.040
 it's in the frame 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:12.879
 nanterre 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.579
 today 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.390
 I'm done doing his first rounds of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.759
 Belgium is not doing well at all 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.759
 there I am the friend power 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.559
 it's the web and responds perfectly when the security provided to the 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.310
 rudder to 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.310
 in reverse saying that he had asked for marriage 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.140
 we do the rudders that 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.340
 he's kind enough to watch when the house has been rushing more and more 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.340
 very well where the bride 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
 yielding about two kilos 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.640
 we made a beautiful French sailboat 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.620
 it goes back 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.579
 he is really very bad at big 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.579
 announced at the end of March 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.519
 for which brussels 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.849
 in the middle of trees and mud one meter behind 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.029
 gibson edge of the precipice 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:04.799
 the normal tuesday 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.799
 behind him it was you who got for all 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.139
 it really is 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.569
 as for herself 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:34.929
 for the country 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:37.929
 he imposes himself 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.789
 that match for me 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:42.929
 mass effect weight of words 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:45.929
 ps slowed since the public on the rights 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.499
 bitchy in the wind 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.279
 this is called a round in the water at the wheel for swimming pools 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:56.279
 38 was really a big happiness 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:01.589
 I see the plume slightly touched 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.459
 why here are the friends it's really not necessarily obvious to lose 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.490
 gold to the next a job well
