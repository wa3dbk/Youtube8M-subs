00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.909
 salmon stew from norway to chile 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.119
 salmon from norway the fish ideal for the party 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.130
 it allows you to make varied recipes it is original for all 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.619
 great opportunities alas it's a great opportunity 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.980
 so I started among 40 higher and higher 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.400
 moncler carrots at first I'll marry her 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.260
 and then that I'm going to cut it up next door for cooking 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.700
 prepared a saucepan with chicken broth 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.030
 more than 300 films will be shown in due course 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.320
 it will be fast for cooking 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.950
 your edge to the button poultry and ready what is good is that we will use 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.080
 just now this chicken broth so the extra 40% tyloo at 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.080
 less than 48 hours I'll be able to take care of salmon 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.350
 so here I'm net 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.060
 then we will see in Switzerland entered perfect 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.740
 well what interested me was the thickness I'm going to check in a 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.010
 first time 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.330
 but more 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.920
 so I pass my finger 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.690
 if we still had some 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.580
 the small step it stops 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.450
 placebo 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.040
 a little earlier 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.520
 then 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.850
 I block this skin 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.730
 I will go along with my knife in very parallel ways so as to 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.030
 recover 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.330
 the morning of flesh 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.830
 it should be noted that norway salmon 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.960
 benefits from a system of traceability and control 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.920
 along the production stages 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.130
 hatchery 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.220
 at the point of sale 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.220
 which guarantees you a fresh and quality product 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.000
 I want detailed 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.650
 in cubes 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.460
 so here I am heating a nonstick skillet without 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.490
 fat 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.690
 Finally, I do not think it's about the same size cyclism'actu 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.420
 still a little swollen 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.150
 before I pass the tip I'm going 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.890
 but this year 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.820
 ultra fast cooking 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.140
 I position them serves as this game is that the first 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.790
 have been asked 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.979
 things start to do 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.329
 the small circle 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.329
 so here I'll be able to start drilling the first 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.969
 to have been positioned it was here 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.099
 the rescue charge 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.160
 for me this is the salmon during this mark on a pass 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.139
 we have time for all this promises 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.020
 already 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.989
 start again removed 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.919
 the next first round 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.959
 the closer we are to everything I can still do tonight almost raw 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.139
 this is from his sony laptop something well colored the iron is 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.949
 still dared this package 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:46.559
 back on the more effect for me the meaning I hear well watered 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.609
 I looked together carrots 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.609
 mauresmo is perfectly cooked then at that time 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.419
 as I looked at my job, I see them 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.809
 with a skimmer they will join dressed in dark we have to 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.979
 to make good stew sauce finally this stew sauce 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:11.979
 it is very close to a deschanel this very close week a bÃ©chamel 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:17.199
 so I heat a saucepan in this pan I'll add some edge 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:22.109
 to achieve a week nothing more simple it's proportions yet between 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.009
 happiness and flour so there I was on guard remain more 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.909
 performing 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.339
 directly take the flour trucks as soon as my happiness how 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:32.530
 it's monstrous flour in progress 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.059
 and there I mix 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:36.079
 it makes me a kind of patrollers of 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.489
 so now add the vehicle 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.579
 so the flight conditions I also have the liquid cream 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.559
 I started to add a little cream 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.559
 so do not worry at first thickens 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:52.769
 we add stormy 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.929
 during this time 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:58.179
 cream 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:01.449
 in fact you're trying to get the consistency we're going to say bad about a 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.239
 custard 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.239
 a bribe 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.849
 you have to be consistent Sainte-Marie with the spoon 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.919
 so here I really have something that both 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.919
 do not bring now we will not go in the morning this sauce 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.999
 so that's the slightly exotic side 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.669
 I opted for chili 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.379
 it will bring color 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:25.490
 in addition the chili gets married very very well 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.099
 with salmon 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.099
 now if you want on a slightly less exotic basis 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.669
 you can replace chili with a year 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.270
 same time the old it works too very well 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.980
 I will also greet a little bit 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.790
 I'm suspicious of salt because I have my chicken broth coming in 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.449
 greet 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.830
 I will be able to start pouring my sauce 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.830
 on my salmon mycube carrots 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.939
 the other objects 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:55.090
 Dressage I went back to a small casserole I will fill 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.680
 with my preparation 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.080
 the new prefect of lactic acid 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.600
 and now here are four of his marriage 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.600
 chili sauce 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:09.499
