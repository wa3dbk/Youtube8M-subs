treats to train your rabbit with because

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.320 
treats to train your rabbit with because
really<00:00:54.830> without<00:00:55.040> treats<00:00:55.640> your<00:00:55.879> rabbit<00:00:56.210> will

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
really without treats your rabbit will

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.850 
really without treats your rabbit will
not<00:00:56.540> learn<00:00:56.750> how<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:56.960> do<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.320> trick

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
not learn how to do the trick

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.130 
not learn how to do the trick
now<00:00:58.280> after<00:00:58.519> your<00:00:58.790> rabbits<00:00:59.210> fully<00:00:59.509> trained<00:00:59.930> you

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
now after your rabbits fully trained you

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.380 
now after your rabbits fully trained you
can<00:01:00.290> stop<00:01:00.589> giving<00:01:00.979> them<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:01.250> trees<00:01:01.580> and<00:01:01.879> let

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
can stop giving them the trees and let

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.119 
can stop giving them the trees and let
them<00:01:02.570> do<00:01:02.780> their<00:01:02.930> trick<00:01:03.259> without<00:01:03.379> any<00:01:03.799> treats

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
them do their trick without any treats

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.499 
them do their trick without any treats
but<00:01:04.369> when<00:01:04.699> you're<00:01:04.850> training<00:01:05.089> them<00:01:05.299> you're

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
but when you're training them you're

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:06.760 
but when you're training them you're
definitely<00:01:05.750> going<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.080> have<00:01:06.259> plenty<00:01:06.650> of

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
definitely going to have plenty of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.980 
definitely going to have plenty of
treats<00:01:07.009> on<00:01:07.189> hand<00:01:07.520> it's<00:01:08.030> best<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:08.450> use<00:01:08.540> hard

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
treats on hand it's best to use hard

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.080 
treats on hand it's best to use hard
treats<00:01:09.409> like<00:01:09.530> they<00:01:09.860> use<00:01:10.100> instead<00:01:10.759> of<00:01:10.880> using

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
treats like they use instead of using

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.390 
treats like they use instead of using
something<00:01:11.390> like<00:01:11.600> fruit<00:01:12.140> because<00:01:12.829> fruit<00:01:13.159> takes

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
something like fruit because fruit takes

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.670 
something like fruit because fruit takes
longer<00:01:13.790> for<00:01:13.820> them<00:01:14.119> to<00:01:14.240> chew<00:01:14.479> up<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:14.960> if<00:01:15.200> they

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
longer for them to chew up and if they

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.319 
longer for them to chew up and if they
eat<00:01:15.890> something<00:01:16.250> for<00:01:16.430> too<00:01:16.579> long<00:01:16.820> they'll<00:01:17.119> kind

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
eat something for too long they'll kind

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:18.580 
eat something for too long they'll kind
of<00:01:17.420> forget<00:01:17.810> what<00:01:18.020> they're<00:01:18.200> being<00:01:18.380> rewarded

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
of forget what they're being rewarded

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.069 
of forget what they're being rewarded
for<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:19.640> they'll<00:01:20.299> just<00:01:20.329> forget<00:01:20.750> how<00:01:20.869> to<00:01:20.930> do

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
for and they'll just forget how to do

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.660 
for and they'll just forget how to do
the<00:01:21.229> trick<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:21.740> make<00:01:21.950> sure<00:01:21.979> your<00:01:22.310> treats<00:01:22.549> are

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
the trick so make sure your treats are

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.020 
the trick so make sure your treats are
very<00:01:22.939> small<00:01:23.299> only<00:01:23.689> about<00:01:23.869> this<00:01:24.170> big<00:01:24.229> or<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.460> so

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
very small only about this big or so so

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.279 
very small only about this big or so so
they'll<00:01:26.359> remember<00:01:26.749> what<00:01:27.049> they're<00:01:27.200> being

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
they'll remember what they're being

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.349 
they'll remember what they're being
rewarded<00:01:27.560> for<00:01:27.859> and<00:01:28.189> only<00:01:28.549> take<00:01:28.729> them<00:01:28.909> a<00:01:28.939> second

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
rewarded for and only take them a second

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.239 
rewarded for and only take them a second
to<00:01:29.479> eat<00:01:29.689> if<00:01:30.350> you're<00:01:30.499> going<00:01:30.679> to<00:01:30.799> be<00:01:30.890> teaching

for<00:02:21.870> them<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.110> learn<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:22.560> it's<00:02:22.710> still<00:02:22.920> pretty

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
for them to learn but it's still pretty

he just spun around in a circle
sprinkles<00:02:55.290> demonstrate<00:02:56.160> again<00:02:56.480> spin<00:02:57.560> what<00:02:58.560> a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
sprinkles demonstrate again spin what a
