part<00:05:35.580> here<00:05:35.940> let<00:05:36.270> you<00:05:36.450> probably<00:05:36.870> may<00:05:37.050> not

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
part here let you probably may not

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.010

notice<00:05:37.590> very<00:05:37.890> well<00:05:38.160> since<00:05:38.940> it's<00:05:39.300> black

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
notice very well since it's black

elements<00:05:40.729> so<00:05:41.729> that's<00:05:42.240> a<00:05:42.419> motor<00:05:42.690> part<00:05:43.080> like

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
elements so that's a motor part like

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.190 
elements so that's a motor part like
goes<00:05:44.130> under<00:05:44.550> so<00:05:45.540> yeah<00:05:46.010> and<00:05:47.090> I<00:05:48.090> guess<00:05:48.360> that<00:05:48.780> kind

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
goes under so yeah and I guess that kind

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.370 
goes under so yeah and I guess that kind
of<00:05:49.320> wraps<00:05:49.500> it<00:05:49.740> up<00:05:49.830> so<00:05:50.840> that's<00:05:51.840> pretty<00:05:52.169> much<00:05:52.320> it
