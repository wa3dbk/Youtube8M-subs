00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.170
 hello girls I hope everyone is super 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.630
 well I do not know if you have been aware of my 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.190
 facebook and youtube and had them 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.049
 commented that I had made a change 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.049
 of look or good I went back to my natural color 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.909
 that if you can see a change and you 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.470
 I asked if they wanted me to make a video to 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:19.090
 regarding this topic because I know that 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.850
 It can be very important for many 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.220
 women I prepared a very quick guide to 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.380
 how to organize what changes or what kind of 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.380
 cut and color go well with your races 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.480
 the first is because you feel that you are 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.640
 boring that state a long time 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.770
 Seeing you the same and you need a change of 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.510
 blog this is the first option the 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.820
 second because you saw a haircut 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.980
 a color that every time you see it in a 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.140
 magazine or you see it on the street or in the 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.910
 tele you say I really love that 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.769
 I want to try it is also a very good 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.680
 action for you to try it and the third 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.059
 it can be a station for example if in 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.070
 summer you like to be with blonde hair 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.360
 you can do it without winter you want 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.790
 try to be with dark hair too 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.430
 you can do it and it depends on your tastes 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.110
 and what your availability is if you go to 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.900
 have time to be recommended 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.270
 Wicks or dye and everything depends on you 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.890
 what your things are sure to see 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.380
 times you're going to do something in the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.750
 hair that is not going to be the best look 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.060
 that you have had in all your life but of 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.100
 That is what one has to change 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.409
 that experience has to prove things 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.270
 new new colors new cuts 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.670
 because if you do not 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.469
 to know how it is sold and does not mean that 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.329
 if you make a cut or you have to make but 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.369
 long you look ugly or you look bad 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.619
 you're just going to look different and if 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.539
 you want to try or not you afraid 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.399
 be afraid of criticism and how 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.799
 still also the people what more 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.659
 it matters what you think of you like that 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:46.009
 that gives proof to make that change the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:48.350
 look or you want to change the color of 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.209
 hair the most important thing is that 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.459
 start from little to little as well as 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.439
 says I seem to be the rayitos or 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.299
 there are also some dyes that 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.520
 is washed out with as a bath 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.289
 color that will clarify we have courses of 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.810
 hair depends on the tonality that you 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.759
 choose and if you did not like in a month 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.619
 or two months you will leave and with the 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.299
 rayitos is usually to clarify the 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.519
 hair I think it's not a very change 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.380
 radical but if you do it more and more 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.540
 and more and more a tonality can arrive 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.730
 clearer and like the champion is not going to 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.860
 be very strong in my opinion there is nothing 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.049
 better than price the colors on yourself 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.940
 in your hair in physical to know how 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.290
 they will stay because sometimes you can not 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.840
 see how the k such 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.950
 where are the hair fibers with 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.959
 the dyes but I do not think that 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.390
 It can work as well as it works 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.129
 in your hair we all have different 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.420
 pigmentations different shades and 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.329
 will not always react from the same 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.549
 way so it's best that you try on 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.319
 you and if you have no idea what color 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.750
 put and simply want to change 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.340
 color I found an application or is more 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.840
 that nothing a smaller web page and the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.000
 paris I will also leave the link in the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.500
 description of this video where I have a 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.599
 lots of questions for example like that 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.120
 would you have once a month would be 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.950
 willing to invest so much money and a 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.139
 a lot of weird questions that have to 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.000
 see with the hair and in the end they will 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.579
 they are going to suggest a color then that 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.980
 It seemed a very cool option in itself 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.930
 you are totally lost in this subject and 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.790
 have more or less some orientation of 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.790
 what color could be better with you 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.709
 if you're not round the best 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.709
 you can do is wear straight hair 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.650
 just as I have it now without volume for 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.810
 nothing because what we want is to try 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.760
 stretch your face and have 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.160
 visually or imaginatively 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.430
 lines that take you down that are 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.980
 very flat so that your face that is 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.890
 half round it does not look very compact 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.799
 if we make ourselves wavy hair and 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.810
 very compact up and short of the 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.360
 advance much more to know even more 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.040
 round then if you do not like to carry 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.349
 super straight hair but what do you 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.599
 it would be better honestly you can 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.239
 make you very open waves very 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.069
 light without much volume and good this 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.590
 it would be the second option if you have the 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.019
 face with a square shape means 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.560
 that some lines or some features go 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.150
 to be a bit like that you stand very hard 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.120
 and what we have to do is soften 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.400
 the then hairstyles with many waves 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.840
 with a lot of volume, a lot of texture will 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.970
 look great because what they are going to 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.000
 do 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.700
 take this as a square frame that 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.860
 we have and they are going to soften them they are going to 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.360
 give shapes and you will notice much less 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.970
 that's the idea as I try to 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.310
 balance and return those straight lines 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.740
 more organic if you have a face 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.030
 side as well as I have it the best that 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.460
 you can do is to wear the hair 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.080
 medium or long good I in this case not 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.540
 I have medium because in recently I 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.430
 I cut it and use it at the same time 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.400
 to give you a little more balance 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.680
 face and more shape and you can also use 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.260
 You can use waves as smooth as you want 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.260
 what will depend most is the part of 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.730
 here also some girls and me 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.070
 I want to attract to do it but I still have 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.620
 a little scary is to cut your fringe 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.180
 but not a fringe that is totally 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.040
 straight because what he's going to do is 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.930
 cut your face and that if I do not get off I'll 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.100
 to be for nothing is to make a fringe 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.800
 that is very like delgadito those that are 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.690
 well aired media 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.819
 that 's going to look very good to 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.199
 I would stay and maybe maybe in a 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.300
 time if I'm going to try and I'm going to 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.639
 encourage stop if your face 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.919
 diamond or heart shapes that 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.050
 means that this part is much more 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.199
 wide than the chin and chin 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.240
 by itself is very in tune you can use the 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.800
 hair at shoulder height I 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.840
 seen many actresses who have this 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.150
 kind of face and bring your hair here 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.430
 they are beautiful then I have seen that 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.409
 they also use the stripe of your state very 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.889
 pronounced as that very sought after them 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:50.229
 it looks spectacular and also very waves 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.509
 light not so pronounced but yes 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.280
 light to give it shape and can 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:58.110
 also balance between the chin 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.110
 and between the forehead 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.499
 I have several shades of 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.749
 extensions I have natural color I have 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:08.029
 lighter darker and for example to 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:10.939
 I like to use the lightest ones for 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:12.710
 put me below only in the part of 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.389
 down not a lot at the top and 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.309
 what you are going to do is an effect of wicks 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.619
 Californian without having to paint me the 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:20.240
 hair or maybe and you put several 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:22.009
 strands of lighter extensions by 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.599
 all the hair is going to combine and it's going 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.189
 to see a lighter shade attracting the 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:27.860
 extensions is obviously do your 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:30.439
 Longer hair the most advisable is 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.389
 that you do not add so much volume not so many 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:35.300
 bandages and do not focus on the part of 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:38.120
 back so that when you part it for 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:41.059
 half do not put it here see a 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.879
 long proportional and that does not look so 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:45.559
 fake good girls I hope this video 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:47.990
 and this little guide that he has made for 

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:49.459
 you have inspired them and they have 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.349
 removed the fear of changing the look 

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:53.479
 make a change of look is very 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.249
 recommended if you feel like you're going 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:57.800
 for a difficult moment and you want 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:59.780
 start from scratch as it is smiling and there 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.510
 something that bothers you but you do not know what 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.430
 or you just want to change light 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.139
 because you want to try new things 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.270
 do it really that is going to help you 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.460
 very much when I make a change of 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.230
 look that is a bit radical and I feel 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.690
 as another successful person that I have 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.310
 want to do new things if you really 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.560
 It helps you a lot to change your 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.120
 personality as a positive way so 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.130
 that I recommend them totally not 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.960
 be afraid and if they do let me 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.000
 know send me your photos I would love 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.310
 know how it has been so you already know 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.050
 this process starts with a change for 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.730
 outside but little by little it's going 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.390
 changing inside we see ourselves in the 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.390
 next video
