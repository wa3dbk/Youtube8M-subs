00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.080
 and then rafael digão and kaká not liking 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:19.300
 You're a business I could do. 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.750
 opera with two engines was not 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.640
 To tell the truth, I was so sorry. 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.679
 some time since you will not put your 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.929
 monitor employee had and monitoring 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:38.110
 old is that his model is the one 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:40.559
 monitor and face I really wanted there is a 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.879
 Good time to put both of them to work. 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.430
 yes, let's go to you because 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.770
 exactly and really the reason why 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.090
 because I wanted two monitors 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.890
 the u2 will also work to live and 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.269
 while wando and will say that I have with 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:03.250
 an open game and neighborhood in two games 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:05.860
 here I found of 2 and portal with two 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:17.310
 games and I noticed in my case of the fight 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:17.310
 the camera light looks better 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:39.720
 the game is open to 2 and the other side everything 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:44.140
 what personal comments to this there inas 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.240
 will minimize the game that side the game 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.259
 but let's just say the comments from the galley 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.740
 What are you going to keep showing up here? 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.460
 in this land for me and the game will stay 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.759
 on here 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.340
 so it's very good to be able to make mine 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.780
 lives here is playing here is a game 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.780
 half life 2 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.110
 the commenting staff can read on the hour 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.110
 that the staff comments responding to the 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.150
 night that was not here and answer the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.400
 who was there entered the game and arrived 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.560
 with all that is small 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.689
 there it while playing then I spoke 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.549
 I used to play the game. 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.439
 things so now I can do everything 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.140
 so it's very cool, that's what 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.549
 stage of 2008 they play together no no 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.409
 I intend to do this is not worth it already 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.900
 with the motors 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.390
 Do you know that picture, I want to show it? 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.250
 for you here is something else 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:39.400
 When I'm going to edit videos, I want to find 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:43.930
 here but the girl that the windows of my 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.290
 desktop that is galaxies 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:57.670
 really like the friend said so come 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:58.959
 Shaq, my darling for me is beauty before I 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.310
 had to look at the little window that 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.560
 believed that the colors and that had 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.970
 I was in the little window and I was 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.709
 running things well in the game where 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.329
 he gave his father some details of the 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.730
 game that could comment because it had 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.099
 already is not little that is online and 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.139
 edit the video such that the deal ends 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.620
 and so on 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:20.290
 it's a very complicated thing that was bad 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.680
 because I had to get a team 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.680
 small 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.389
 now if you want mental size of the 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.849
 online business and such 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:34.419
 and look here on the side here is the video 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:37.989
 I was running O thereto 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:41.739
 This part you can see here is 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.449
 here in full screen to heldon in have by 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.859
 example I can see exactly what 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.049
 It's happening over there. 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.650
 Look how nice each type is very good. 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.459
 she will edit video online only does 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.650
 whatever you want 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.359
 but my goal is this guy now 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.690
 to be able to dictate it is very good here 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.799
 it was very very good and this dream side 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.810
 good as you can often see the 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.220
 gambiarra made in a box and put 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.819
 very stay in time to stay with 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.090
 Lower and this gambiarra that I did 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.829
 there to get the 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.359
 mentors what I wanted was then it is 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.639
 very cool because we light in 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.109
 next nine leave I'll go 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.340
 talk to you and respond to the 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.859
 asks of you in getting the 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.560
 details and stay stopping the game for it 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.700
 That was very good, so I guess. 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.060
 that this will help a lot to be 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.280
 my blog yes there 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.900
 I'm doing today to show you 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.930
 there it is 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.730
 just out of curiosity my keyboard and my 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.110
 sound business mouse is the handset and has more 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:45.340
 something that has more for you want 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:48.980
 How do I look at something? 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.730
 What was my day today for in the afternoon? 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:59.600
 It's late today, you went to study everything about 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:02.240
 vectors again I did not have this in the 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.990
 high school did not come to ours here and 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.560
 now I have applied physics from 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.979
 and I did not know anything about 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.870
 vectors so I had to start from 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.180
 zero study all over again for the 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.280
 internet's why here the dollar 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.560
 on that channel also show you 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.940
 there on facebook on facebook, I 'll leave it 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.440
 channel then you get interesting 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.270
 channel saves me, I think it's very good because 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.080
 There are several hours, everything is a thing. 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.360
 worth it 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.200
 so this is it is that you liked that 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:36.530
 It's only I liked it, it was joãozinho 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.610
 just for you, the things of my 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.650
 Praça 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.750
 according to that force and face 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.970
 today probably will get there and saw yes 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.419
 around seven eight hours of the night 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.120
 it was 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.070
 I do not promise anything but is capable of a 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.390
 neighbor for 7 o'clock in the evening until 9 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.950
 little back playing there if you do not 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.120
 slight detail that she would not be 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.520
 do a tilling who knows the type of 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.900
 whole and to turn defendant was champion 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.150
 a slam of 2011 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.550
 maybe we'll see and also have my 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.169

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.770

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:11.770
 A hug is more, it 's a moon
