00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 were initially eight aircraft 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.640
 military personnel who entered the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.389
 after flying over the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.889
 started to be followed by f16 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.889
 and then the country 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.340
 they went back two they continued a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.369
 bombing tupolev 95 and outer ones and the x 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.500
 78 for refueling flew space 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.539
 control the championship without 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.490
 notice and shall not have 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.450
 responded to attempts to contact and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.700
 wrong 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.890
 from north to south were followed 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.830
 by British fighters who in their turn 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.570
 passed the mission to portugal two f-16 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.350
 stationed at the monte real airbase 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.760
 went to meet the two Russian planes 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.250
 keep the two aircraft 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.830
 within 15 minutes of flowing for 24 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.640
 hours per day seven days per week 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:54.370
 there they are armed with 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.270
 to deal with the level of threat that is 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:20.110
 ok is designed predictable situation 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:22.509
 our hero about 100 miles from 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.340
 peniche international airspace under 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.920
 Portuguese jurisdiction the two airplanes 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.680
 the Russian military have turned around before 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.810
 even if they are settled by 10 16 of the 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.390
 the Portuguese Air Force armed for 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.539
 any occurrence a cannon came with 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.119
 links to six thousand fans per minute we have 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.270
 in that there in the form of fiction 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.740
 capacity produced heat sources 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.810
 by other aircraft 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.990
 and we also have missiles and radars that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.590
 following contact are able to follow 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:57.970
 chip that detects the plane and 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.740
 conveys all by clean date 2009 have 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.720
 to be taken 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.240
 we train we always say train 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.319
 how we fight in the sense that the train 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.420
 should be the closest to reality 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.520
 positive for pilots to be 3d 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.560
 prepared when necessary 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.450
 the Portuguese F-16 accompanied the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.910
 Russian military planes north to 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.680
 to the limit of the fuel autonomy 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.050
 as afterwards the British Air Force and 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.540
 listening in the reverse direction in the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.950
 return to base of Russian aircraft 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.690
 operation took particular account of the risk 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.730
 for air traffic the Russian airplanes 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.690
 flying at commercial flights altitude 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.150
 as you imagine in a European airspace 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.310
 finding injury is unsustainable 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.010
 It's complicated to have a mere clinic. 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.840
 detected was generated is born three 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.850
 similar occurrences in other parts of 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.950
 europe and less than 24 hours 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.210
 adding up to more than 100 already registered 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.190
 this year 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.720
 since the Cold War Air Force 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.880
 does not have any operation of the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.430
 genre but inspections are common 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.240
 suspicious ships or difficulties 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.240
 off the Portuguese coast
