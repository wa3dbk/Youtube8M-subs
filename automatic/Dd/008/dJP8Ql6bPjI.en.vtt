00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
called a three-to-one dough it's three

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.100 
called a three-to-one dough it's three
parts<00:00:09.549> flour<00:00:09.820> and<00:00:10.209> this<00:00:10.330> is<00:00:10.480> all-purpose

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
parts flour and this is all-purpose

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.709 
parts flour and this is all-purpose
flour<00:00:11.260> and<00:00:11.620> it's<00:00:11.980> two<00:00:12.280> parts<00:00:12.580> butter<00:00:12.820> and<00:00:13.120> this

flour and it's two parts butter and this
butter<00:00:13.990> has<00:00:14.200> actually<00:00:14.530> been<00:00:14.650> I<00:00:14.920> cut<00:00:15.160> it<00:00:15.250> up<00:00:15.339> and

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
butter has actually been I cut it up and

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.769 
butter has actually been I cut it up and
put<00:00:15.610> it<00:00:15.700> in<00:00:15.730> the<00:00:15.820> fridge<00:00:16.090> so<00:00:16.119> that<00:00:16.450> it's<00:00:16.630> going

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779 
put it in the fridge so that it's going

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.519 
put it in the fridge so that it's going
to<00:00:16.900> get<00:00:17.680> incorporated<00:00:18.040> really<00:00:18.910> nicely<00:00:19.529> at

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
to get incorporated really nicely at

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.350 
to get incorporated really nicely at
this<00:00:20.740> point<00:00:21.040> all<00:00:21.250> you<00:00:21.489> do<00:00:21.640> is<00:00:21.759> combine<00:00:22.060> these

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
this point all you do is combine these

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.620 
this point all you do is combine these
two<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:24.340> is<00:00:24.489> called<00:00:24.700> the<00:00:24.849> rubbing<00:00:25.270> method

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
two this is called the rubbing method

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.120 
two this is called the rubbing method
because<00:00:26.050> as<00:00:26.259> you<00:00:26.380> can<00:00:26.529> see<00:00:26.680> I'm<00:00:26.770> rubbing

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
because as you can see I'm rubbing

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.450 
because as you can see I'm rubbing
together<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:28.029> butter<00:00:28.239> in<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:28.570> flour<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.340> now

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
together the butter in the flour so now

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.920 
together the butter in the flour so now
you're<00:00:30.610> going<00:00:30.730> to<00:00:30.790> form<00:00:31.029> a<00:00:31.090> bit<00:00:31.270> of<00:00:31.390> a<00:00:31.540> well

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
you're going to form a bit of a well

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.479 
you're going to form a bit of a well
right<00:00:32.259> in<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.469> middle<00:00:32.680> of<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.860> dough<00:00:33.040> and<00:00:33.340> add

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
right in the middle of the dough and add

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.430 
right in the middle of the dough and add
in<00:00:33.640> your<00:00:33.790> water<00:00:34.030> and<00:00:34.360> that's<00:00:34.660> about<00:00:34.840> four

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
in your water and that's about four

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.770 
in your water and that's about four
tablespoons<00:00:35.800> or<00:00:36.370> this<00:00:36.489> recipe<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:37.510> a<00:00:37.629> nice

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
tablespoons or this recipe and a nice

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.590 
tablespoons or this recipe and a nice
pinch<00:00:38.140> of<00:00:38.379> salt<00:00:38.649> because<00:00:39.070> that's<00:00:40.030> going<00:00:40.420> to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
pinch of salt because that's going to

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.540 
pinch of salt because that's going to
really<00:00:40.839> balance<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:41.469> flavors<00:00:41.829> it's<00:00:42.250> really

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
really balance the flavors it's really

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.919 
really balance the flavors it's really
starting<00:00:42.730> to<00:00:42.910> come<00:00:42.999> together<00:00:43.239> now<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.870> you

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
starting to come together now and you

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:45.509 
starting to come together now and you
don't<00:00:44.170> want<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.379> overwork<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.129> dough<00:00:45.160> you're

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
don't want to overwork the dough you're

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.189 
don't want to overwork the dough you're
going<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.730> actually<00:00:46.059> make<00:00:46.179> it<00:00:46.359> into<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.749> disc

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
going to actually make it into a disc

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.869 
going to actually make it into a disc
and<00:00:47.559> that<00:00:47.589> disc<00:00:47.920> is<00:00:48.100> gonna<00:00:48.280> go<00:00:48.429> into<00:00:48.699> the

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
and that disc is gonna go into the

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.380 
and that disc is gonna go into the
refrigerator<00:00:49.469> for<00:00:50.469> 30<00:00:50.829> minutes<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:52.210> is

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
refrigerator for 30 minutes this is

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.509 
refrigerator for 30 minutes this is
really<00:00:52.600> important<00:00:53.079> because<00:00:53.199> you<00:00:54.039> need<00:00:54.249> the

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
really important because you need the

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:55.979 
really important because you need the
gluten<00:00:55.030> strands<00:00:55.390> that<00:00:55.570> you've<00:00:55.690> been<00:00:55.809> working

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
gluten strands that you've been working

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.020 
gluten strands that you've been working
with<00:00:56.230> while<00:00:56.499> you're<00:00:56.649> doing<00:00:56.859> this<00:00:57.039> to<00:00:57.670> relax

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
with while you're doing this to relax

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.459 
with while you're doing this to relax
otherwise<00:00:58.600> you're<00:00:58.780> gonna<00:00:58.839> get<00:00:59.050> this<00:00:59.140> really

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
otherwise you're gonna get this really

otherwise you're gonna get this really
tough<00:00:59.819> overworked<00:01:00.819> dough<00:01:01.059> and<00:01:01.359> if<00:01:01.510> you<00:01:01.659> want<00:01:01.839> a

tender crust you need to let it relax
I've<00:01:04.839> got<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.409> disc<00:01:06.010> that's<00:01:06.250> been<00:01:06.460> in<00:01:06.760> the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
I've got the disc that's been in the

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.040 
I've got the disc that's been in the
refrigerator<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:10.450> it's<00:01:10.660> ready<00:01:10.870> to<00:01:10.930> be

refrigerator and now it's ready to be

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.110 
refrigerator and now it's ready to be
rolled<00:01:11.350> starts<00:01:12.250> in<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.400> middle<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.790> go<00:01:13.030> away

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
rolled starts in the middle and go away

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.510 
rolled starts in the middle and go away
start<00:01:13.630> from<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.810> middle<00:01:13.870> and<00:01:14.080> go<00:01:14.260> away<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
start from the middle and go away and

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.950 
start from the middle and go away and
all<00:01:15.610> four<00:01:15.880> directions<00:01:15.970> give<00:01:16.660> it<00:01:16.780> a<00:01:16.810> nice

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
all four directions give it a nice

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.810 
all four directions give it a nice
90-degree<00:01:17.350> turn<00:01:17.830> and<00:01:17.860> just<00:01:18.250> keep<00:01:18.400> doing<00:01:18.430> this

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
90-degree turn and just keep doing this

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.300 
90-degree turn and just keep doing this
what<00:01:19.450> we're<00:01:19.600> going<00:01:19.900> for<00:01:20.140> is<00:01:21.360> about<00:01:22.650> 1/8<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.980> 1/4

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
what we're going for is about 1/8 to 1/4

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.520 
what we're going for is about 1/8 to 1/4
inch<00:01:24.460> thickness<00:01:24.940> I<00:01:25.420> like<00:01:25.840> about<00:01:25.960> an<00:01:26.170> eighth<00:01:26.380> of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
inch thickness I like about an eighth of

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.430 
inch thickness I like about an eighth of
an<00:01:26.650> inch<00:01:26.830> now<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.610> trick<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.150> this<00:01:28.270> is<00:01:28.570> don't

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
an inch now the trick to this is don't

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.590 
an inch now the trick to this is don't
work<00:01:29.620> next<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.160> warm<00:01:30.670> stove<00:01:30.970> because<00:01:31.510> you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
work next to a warm stove because you

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.710 
work next to a warm stove because you
don't<00:01:31.780> want<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:33.310> your<00:01:33.610> crust<00:01:34.210> all<00:01:34.360> upset

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
don't want to get your crust all upset

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.470 
don't want to get your crust all upset
don't<00:01:35.560> work<00:01:35.860> on<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.130> hot<00:01:36.490> day<00:01:36.730> and<00:01:36.970> then<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.330> can

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
don't work on a hot day and then you can

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.090 
don't work on a hot day and then you can
curl<00:01:37.720> it<00:01:37.750> roll<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.050> up<00:01:38.140> like<00:01:38.230> this<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.860> now<00:01:39.070> I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
curl it roll it up like this and now I

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.000 
curl it roll it up like this and now I
can<00:01:39.400> carry<00:01:39.610> this<00:01:39.760> wherever<00:01:40.240> I<00:01:40.390> want<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.350> then

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
can carry this wherever I want and then

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.840 
can carry this wherever I want and then
you<00:01:42.100> unroll<00:01:42.460> it<00:01:42.520> on<00:01:42.820> top<00:01:43.150> of<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.260> tin<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.670> just

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
you unroll it on top of the tin so just

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.010 
you unroll it on top of the tin so just
lightly<00:01:46.210> kind<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.780> set<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.080> in<00:01:47.170> here<00:01:47.500> gently

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
lightly kind of set it in here gently

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.260 
lightly kind of set it in here gently
cut<00:01:50.020> away<00:01:50.200> some<00:01:50.260> of<00:01:50.500> this<00:01:50.620> extra<00:01:51.010> stuff<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:54.460> you

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
cut away some of this extra stuff if you

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.600 
cut away some of this extra stuff if you
have<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.990> palette<00:01:56.710> knife<00:01:56.740> like<00:01:57.070> this<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:57.490> could

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
have a palette knife like this you could

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.420 
have a palette knife like this you could
kind<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:57.910> use<00:01:58.360> this<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:59.020> carve<00:01:59.350> away<00:01:59.500> at<00:01:59.680> it<00:01:59.830> but

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
kind of use this to carve away at it but

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.250 
kind of use this to carve away at it but
it's<00:02:00.700> not<00:02:00.850> necessary<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.480> paring<00:02:01.870> knife<00:02:02.020> works

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
it's not necessary a paring knife works

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.200 
it's not necessary a paring knife works
flying<00:02:02.530> at<00:02:02.650> this<00:02:02.770> as<00:02:02.920> well<00:02:03.070> with<00:02:03.790> all<00:02:04.060> this

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
flying at this as well with all this

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.320 
flying at this as well with all this
extra<00:02:04.450> dough<00:02:05.250> we're<00:02:06.250> going<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.670> kind<00:02:06.880> of<00:02:06.940> push

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
extra dough we're going to kind of push

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.509 
extra dough we're going to kind of push
in<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:08.700> crust<00:02:09.700> into<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.360> form<00:02:10.629> even<00:02:11.110> more<00:02:11.519> so

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
in the crust into the form even more so

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.190 
in the crust into the form even more so
I<00:02:12.550> usually<00:02:12.730> go<00:02:12.999> around<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.299> edge<00:02:13.450> like<00:02:13.689> that<00:02:13.900> I

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
I usually go around the edge like that I

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.410 
I usually go around the edge like that I
go<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.799> make<00:02:15.280> sure<00:02:15.459> that<00:02:15.609> this<00:02:15.819> crease<00:02:16.239> right

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
go and make sure that this crease right

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.330 
go and make sure that this crease right
in<00:02:16.689> here<00:02:17.019> is<00:02:17.170> getting<00:02:17.439> a<00:02:17.499> lot<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.650> attention

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.670 

now<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.670> see<00:02:21.909> that<00:02:22.629> that's<00:02:22.810> pushed<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.439> I

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
now I can see that that's pushed in I

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.380 
now I can see that that's pushed in I
kind<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.950> do<00:02:24.099> that<00:02:24.250> at<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.519> bottom<00:02:24.939> and<00:02:25.180> then

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
kind of do that at the bottom and then

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.569 
kind of do that at the bottom and then
the<00:02:25.480> edge<00:02:25.629> just<00:02:25.900> one<00:02:26.109> more<00:02:26.260> time<00:02:26.469> just<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.459> be

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
the edge just one more time just to be

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:28.130 
the edge just one more time just to be
sure

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
sure

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.959 
sure
again<00:02:29.140> don't<00:02:29.379> overwork<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.159> so<00:02:30.640> that's<00:02:30.819> your

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:30.969 
again don't overwork it so that's your

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.899 
again don't overwork it so that's your
pie<00:02:31.150> crust<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.780> at<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.349> point<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:33.579> fill<00:02:33.790> it

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
pie crust and at this point you fill it

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.610 
pie crust and at this point you fill it
with<00:02:33.939> whatever<00:02:34.480> filling<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:34.989> want<00:02:35.109> or<00:02:35.349> you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
with whatever filling you want or you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.280 
with whatever filling you want or you
bought<00:02:35.829> blind<00:02:36.370> bake<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.450> what<00:02:37.629> that<00:02:37.659> is<00:02:38.019> is

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
bought blind bake it and what that is is

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.199 
bought blind bake it and what that is is
that<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.889> would<00:02:39.099> actually<00:02:39.129> take<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.879> and

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
that you would actually take this and

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.479 
that you would actually take this and
poke<00:02:40.810> holes<00:02:41.109> in<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.319> bottom<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:41.920> then<00:02:42.400> you

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
poke holes in the bottom and then you

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.160 
poke holes in the bottom and then you
throw<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.849> in<00:02:42.969> your<00:02:43.090> oven<00:02:43.329> and<00:02:43.719> that<00:02:43.780> would<00:02:44.019> be

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
throw it in your oven and that would be

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.640 
throw it in your oven and that would be
for<00:02:44.379> more<00:02:44.530> moist<00:02:45.459> filling<00:02:46.439> then<00:02:47.439> you<00:02:47.530> would

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
for more moist filling then you would

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.170 
for more moist filling then you would
bring<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:47.920> back<00:02:48.069> out<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.549> would<00:02:48.700> be<00:02:48.849> a<00:02:48.879> little

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
bring it back out it would be a little

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.819 
bring it back out it would be a little
bit<00:02:49.269> browned<00:02:49.599> and<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.079> way<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.319> could<00:02:50.470> hold

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
bit browned and that way it could hold

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.649 
bit browned and that way it could hold
the<00:02:51.129> moist<00:02:51.310> feeling<00:02:51.519> and<00:02:51.760> not<00:02:51.819> get<00:02:52.030> soggy<00:02:52.329> so

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
the moist feeling and not get soggy so

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:53.789 
the moist feeling and not get soggy so
if<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:52.840> ever<00:02:52.959> have<00:02:53.079> soggy<00:02:53.319> crust

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
if you ever have soggy crust

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.949 
if you ever have soggy crust
that<00:02:54.189> might<00:02:54.370> be<00:02:54.459> your<00:02:54.549> problem<00:02:54.609> if<00:02:55.269> however

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
that might be your problem if however

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.809 
that might be your problem if however
you're<00:02:56.290> doing<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.680> filling<00:02:57.040> that's<00:02:57.459> already

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
you're doing a filling that's already

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.970 
you're doing a filling that's already
relatively<00:02:58.269> dry<00:02:58.599> you<00:02:58.870> can<00:02:58.900> just<00:02:59.319> go<00:02:59.680> ahead<00:02:59.769> and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
relatively dry you can just go ahead and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.470 
relatively dry you can just go ahead and
put<00:03:00.069> it<00:03:00.159> right<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.430> here<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.909> put<00:03:01.269> it<00:03:01.359> in<00:03:01.419> the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
put it right in here and put it in the

put it right in here and put it in the
oven<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.930> then<00:03:02.139> you've<00:03:02.290> got<00:03:02.500> tender<00:03:03.159> perfect

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
oven and then you've got tender perfect

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.509 
oven and then you've got tender perfect
pie<00:03:04.569> crust<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.379> is<00:03:05.530> really<00:03:05.829> quite<00:03:06.069> simple<00:03:06.430> to

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
pie crust that is really quite simple to

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.669 
pie crust that is really quite simple to
make
