all right guys recently I've had to

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.180 
all right guys recently I've had to
format<00:00:06.690> my<00:00:06.750> ps3<00:00:07.170> because<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:09.889> don't<00:00:10.889> know<00:00:10.980> why

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
format my ps3 because I don't know why

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.749 
format my ps3 because I don't know why
but<00:00:11.690> it's<00:00:12.690> been<00:00:12.900> acting<00:00:13.259> very<00:00:13.290> strange<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.460> I

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
but it's been acting very strange so I

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.640 
but it's been acting very strange so I
called<00:00:15.150> sony<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.719> they<00:00:15.839> made<00:00:16.020> me<00:00:16.139> format<00:00:16.470> it

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
called sony and they made me format it

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.490 
called sony and they made me format it
and<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.520> all<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> other<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.720> this

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
and do all the other and this

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.470 
and do all the other and this
is<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> farthest<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.490> I've<00:00:20.580> gotten<00:00:21.000> ever

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
is the farthest that I've gotten ever

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.500 
is the farthest that I've gotten ever
since<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.990> formatted<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:23.090> normally<00:00:24.090> I'm<00:00:24.180> stuck

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
since I formatted it normally I'm stuck

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.109 
since I formatted it normally I'm stuck
on<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> XMB<00:00:25.320> screen<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.699> doesn't<00:00:26.939> let<00:00:27.029> me

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
on the XMB screen and it doesn't let me

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.690 
on the XMB screen and it doesn't let me
go<00:00:27.269> anywhere<00:00:29.390> what<00:00:30.390> happened<00:00:31.019> was<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.460> just

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
go anywhere what happened was it's just

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.420 
go anywhere what happened was it's just
having<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.059> very<00:00:33.510> slow<00:00:34.170> processing<00:00:34.860> time<00:00:35.070> if

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
having a very slow processing time if

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.819 
having a very slow processing time if
you<00:00:35.969> do<00:00:36.390> anything<00:00:36.690> too<00:00:37.050> fast<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.530> right<00:00:37.710> now

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
you do anything too fast like right now

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.670 
you do anything too fast like right now
if<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.070> went<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> XMB<00:00:39.210> menu<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.530> would

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
if I went to the XMB menu it would

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.770 
if I went to the XMB menu it would
probably<00:00:41.070> freeze<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.790> me<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.090> I'm<00:00:42.149> not<00:00:42.329> give<00:00:42.629> it

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
probably freeze on me so I'm not give it

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.389 
probably freeze on me so I'm not give it
considering<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> farthest<00:00:44.190> i've

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
considering this is the farthest i've

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.860 
considering this is the farthest i've
gone<00:00:45.260> i'm<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> try<00:00:46.680> reinstalling<00:00:47.340> this

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
gone i'm going to try reinstalling this

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.069 
gone i'm going to try reinstalling this
the<00:00:48.870> last<00:00:49.050> time<00:00:49.200> i<00:00:49.320> got<00:00:49.530> here<00:00:49.940> i<00:00:50.940> don't<00:00:51.750> know<00:00:51.989> if

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the last time i got here i don't know if

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.840 
the last time i got here i don't know if
you<00:00:52.170> guys<00:00:52.260> know<00:00:52.500> with<00:00:52.649> these<00:00:52.770> lights<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
you guys know with these lights on the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.600 
you guys know with these lights on the
bottom<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.239> your<00:00:54.270> ps3<00:00:54.629> mean<00:00:55.110> put<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.129> orange

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
bottom of your ps3 mean put the orange

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.490 
bottom of your ps3 mean put the orange
one<00:00:57.000> signifies<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.629> hard<00:00:57.989> drive<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
one signifies the hard drive and the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.529 
one signifies the hard drive and the
green<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.430> wireless<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.940> last<00:01:03.149> time<00:01:03.390> I

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
green one is wireless so the last time I

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.440 
green one is wireless so the last time I
was<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:03.719> after<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:04.409> twelve<00:01:04.830> percent<00:01:05.450> I'm

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
was here after about twelve percent I'm

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.289 
was here after about twelve percent I'm
at<00:01:06.689> six<00:01:06.900> percent<00:01:07.260> right<00:01:07.409> now<00:01:07.909> that<00:01:08.909> light

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
at six percent right now that light

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.550 
at six percent right now that light
turned<00:01:09.750> off<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.650> hard<00:01:10.950> drive<00:01:11.130> light<00:01:12.140> but<00:01:13.140> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
turned off the hard drive light but it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.820 
turned off the hard drive light but it
didn't<00:01:14.010> freeze<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:15.659> graphics<00:01:16.140> were<00:01:16.350> still

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
didn't freeze the graphics were still

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.210 
didn't freeze the graphics were still
being<00:01:17.400> animated<00:01:18.290> lettering<00:01:19.290> stopped<00:01:19.710> going

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
being animated lettering stopped going

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.760 
being animated lettering stopped going
to<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> screen<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.330> snake<00:01:21.770> smoking

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to the screen it was just snake smoking

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.760 
to the screen it was just snake smoking
a<00:01:22.830> cigarette<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.960> percent<00:01:28.470> stayed

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
a cigarette and the percent stayed

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.999 
a cigarette and the percent stayed
exactly<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.310> same<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:31.380> I'm<00:01:31.530> going<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.890> record

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
exactly the same so I'm going to record

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.359 
exactly the same so I'm going to record
so<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.729> guys<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.090> see<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.990> possibly<00:01:34.650> help<00:01:35.100> me

so you guys can see and possibly help me

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.539 
so you guys can see and possibly help me
if<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.000> does<00:01:36.180> freeze<00:01:36.540> again<00:01:36.829> because<00:01:37.829> I'm<00:01:38.159> just

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
if it does freeze again because I'm just

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.280 
if it does freeze again because I'm just
trying<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> figure<00:01:38.939> out<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
trying to figure out if it's the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.830 
trying to figure out if it's the
processor<00:01:41.040> central<00:01:41.700> processing<00:01:42.270> unit<00:01:42.659> that's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
processor central processing unit that's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.389 
processor central processing unit that's
freezing<00:01:43.140> or<00:01:43.970> it's<00:01:44.970> overheating<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:46.399> maybe

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
freezing or it's overheating or maybe

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.990 
freezing or it's overheating or maybe
it's<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> hard<00:01:48.030> drive<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.659> don't<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.079> but

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
it's the hard drive I don't know but

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.030 
it's the hard drive I don't know but
obviously<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.210> works<00:01:51.450> some<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> time<00:01:52.560> so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
obviously it works some of the time so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.460 
obviously it works some of the time so
something<00:01:53.490> isn't<00:01:53.909> completely<00:01:54.630> broken<00:01:55.049> it's

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
something isn't completely broken it's

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.830 
something isn't completely broken it's
just<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.369> breaks<00:01:56.759> after<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.149> certain<00:01:57.420> amount<00:01:57.600> of

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
just it breaks after a certain amount of

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.760 
just it breaks after a certain amount of
time<00:01:58.049> or<00:01:58.409> maybe<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.310> gets<00:01:59.399> too<00:01:59.640> hot<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.770> don't

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
time or maybe it gets too hot I don't

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.499 
time or maybe it gets too hot I don't
know<00:02:01.860> but<00:02:02.130> right<00:02:02.460> now<00:02:02.579> I'm<00:02:02.759> seventeen<00:02:03.390> percent

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
know but right now I'm seventeen percent

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.959 
know but right now I'm seventeen percent
and<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.140> still<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.680> an<00:02:04.770> orange<00:02:05.009> light<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.790> I'm

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
and I still have an orange light so I'm

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.419 
and I still have an orange light so I'm
guessing<00:02:06.270> that's<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.780> good<00:02:06.960> sign

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
guessing that's a good sign

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.309 
guessing that's a good sign
hopefully<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.459> don't<00:02:09.729> have<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.300> reinstall<00:02:10.990> the

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
hopefully I don't have to reinstall the

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.710 
hopefully I don't have to reinstall the
updates<00:02:11.680> as<00:02:12.130> i'm<00:02:12.430> pretty<00:02:12.790> sure<00:02:13.300> i'm<00:02:13.450> going<00:02:13.660> to

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
updates as i'm pretty sure i'm going to

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.740 
updates as i'm pretty sure i'm going to
have<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:13.959> but<00:02:14.530> for<00:02:14.980> metal<00:02:15.220> gear<00:02:15.370> online<00:02:15.750> that

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
have to but for metal gear online that
