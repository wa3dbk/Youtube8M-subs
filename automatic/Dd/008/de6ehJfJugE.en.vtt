00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.270
 Do you know that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.060
 that you practice with the violin and also with 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.340
 very simple things with the time 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.320
 my left hand feel that way 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.340
 this somehow feels twisted 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.189
 tense 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.390
 somehow my fingers do not want to 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.640
 really join in 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.910
 yes that is actually a problem with 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:45.059
 the violin the attitude here of the left 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.620
 arms that is not necessarily anatomical 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.250
 a very pleasant story seems 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.199
 you would play flute before yes 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.780
 making it much more enjoyable 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.920
 yes, because the hand is easy in her 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.019
 natural orientation 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.420
 while at the violin now this 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.450
 twisting of the arm enters without 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.630
 Service now was just going 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.759
 but do not worry this is not a real one 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.539
 problem can be found when you have it 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:20.570
 Well, yes, I want you today 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.869
 show a way like this 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.960
 possibility to get in hand 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.289
 by making the voltage too low 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.340
 possible if they are the 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.539
 approach instrumental attitude 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.560
 This is done first of all as follows 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:41.240
 is that grab on the violin or that 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.920
 find the first terms always very 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.289
 just when you stretch that one 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.649
 guitar attitude is yes I would have been afraid 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.060
 already the shoulder is about mine 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.340
 shoulder is about at the height of 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.539
 the snail from the violin so i hold 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.369
 the instrument now and if I am now 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:00.170
 here with my hand on the instrument 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.899
 then that does not feel right 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.739
 so awfully twisted or 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.069
 it is not so tense 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:06.110
 wild 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.509
 you certainly know that first one 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.640
 grabbed the violin at the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.709
 we reach the one where we put the 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.329
 third finger to the point of the octave 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:21.980
 over the empty page so that's the one 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:24.410
 normal the normal point at the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.450
 Third finger is always yes and yes 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.980
 Now I'm doing one as possible 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.900
 no tension in the hand too 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.750
 may or may have excessive voltage 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.430
 I'll just leave these three fingers here 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.940
 Seen is very close to each other 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:44.239
 we just stand together like that and 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.160
 touch the root of the index finger 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.459
 I content very easily then I am 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.049
 already in my position for the violin 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.109
 Next, I'll do the following 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.209
 Next, I pull the first finger 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.829
 slightly backwards so that I can in mine 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.650
 First come inside 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.180
 you know that a very good distance 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.950
 from a blank page to the first finger 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.049
 then a great distance to 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.180
 second finger and a half tone to 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.980
 third finger and the last 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.500
 amtshandlung is the fourth finger of the 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.900
 I now again in one in one 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.890
 quite the distance from the third bring so 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.379
 this thing now looks out of the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.159
 perspective 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:27.019
 yes, that's called the first grip art 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.610
 are they now in this guitar 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.810
 attitude then it is a matter 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.340
 which is relatively pleasant so it works 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.939
 a little further away, so that you better 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.060
 to be able to see 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:40.819
 now let us fiddle entertainment 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.610
 approach on the shoulder and do it 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.219
 Let's start with the american 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.189
 Winchester attitude So go my gun 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:51.230
 on stop be already there by must 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.760
 I now put my arm in something more 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.069
 Direction to bring this game performance 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.959
 and turns a bit more 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.610
 then I bring the church something else 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.100
 further forward that they are in front of the neck 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:05.550
 lies and in the end I bring that 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.000
 moment on the shoulder like that and now 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.430
 should I possibly feel that they are with 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.170
 my fingers not strong on it 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.150
 hit the page as it was before 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.640
 but that's the same way 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.280
 as easy as before the page 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.920
 new on the fretboard back so 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.230
 now then can sound a tone 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.700
 Let's repeat that again first 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.880
 Once we go from the guitar 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.060
 Keeping it off then I go one level 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.530
 Continue to bring the instrument in stages 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.650
 always on the shoulder 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.650
 until now it stands on my attitude 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.120
 the violin will be yes 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.750
 initially held for two due to 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.420
 One can take you to the child on the 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.090
 on the chin holder and shoulder 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.590
 So support without ever holding the hand 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.300
 to wear 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.990
 On the other hand, you can also go here 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.460
 relieve and carry by hand 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.260
 Of course, both take place 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.270
 but now if I have my four fingers 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.610
 bring to it and touch emotionally 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.370
 Of course I do not want to 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.800
 spend a lot of it on that 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.690
 instrument to wear but I have to 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.670
 already here with a child on the 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.420
 childhood berlin with it's fingers 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.040
 really only the strength they spend 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.520
 need to down the side 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.530
 to swallow 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.300
 that is a very sensitive thing 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.530
 You really have to keep up with the times 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:37.230
 get out more yes but just the way 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.430
 from the relatively relaxed guitars 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:44.010
 attitude on this shoulder 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.470
 brings them these successful men so 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.930
 Now they can see if they are now 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.880
 Turn your thumb because the hand 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.750
 Now you can get out of this attitude 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.730
 Then knock with your thumb 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.070
 take turns the different fingers 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.730
 then on the fingerboard years again 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:06.110
 with your thumb so that you notice how 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:09.000
 moving your fingers while doing so are one 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.430
 further possibility in the lightness 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.730
 To get this grip is to get it 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.160
 that with her violin to one 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.160
 wall where they just go at times 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.490
 one against the wall in your room or 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.830
 a door to protect your violin 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.840
 you can put a cloth in between and 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.620
 then they support themselves 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.199
 with her body and the violin at the 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.000
 wall needs now so what do you need 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.530
 So no more energy to spend around the 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.860
 to drive the violin out of this attitude 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.150
 Incidentally, it can simulate as from yes 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.729
 Because of this attitude she can deal with the 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:47.870
 hand on the fingertips, so to speak 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:52.190
 hang side and have them now 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.510
 also a nice possibility in the arm 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.570
 felt in it and sometimes really 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:59.560
 to get out what force I have to 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.560
 spend at all 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:06.919
 this exercise with which you slowly the 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.960
 Honestly I would always grab them 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.270
 apply when it gets difficult then 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.910
 of course you can do that at the 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:17.330
 Do the very first exercise if you 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.860
 First of all, your grasp on 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.490
 find the violin but you can too 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.169
 later, again and again when she's on 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.100
 a piece are where you notice but 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:28.370
 unpleasant 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:31.550
 then they will remember each other again 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.110
 how easy it is on the violin 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.320
 to hold the hand 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.580
 I do not have to tense up and 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.940
 I myself with my own 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.789
 Studied studies you have to be hundreds 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.700
 I'll go back to the simplest 

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:47.880
 conditions 

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:50.640
 then really remember them 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:55.050
 implement the practice and wish it 

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:56.250
 i wish you much success and all the best and 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.070
 maybe we'll see each other 

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.580
 next chapter here in this blog 

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.320
 again 

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.320
 and by then all the best
