00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
these rows of trees so we have the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.149 
these rows of trees so we have the
beautiful<00:01:09.240> converging<00:01:10.229> parallels<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.890> trees

beautiful converging parallels of trees

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.850 
beautiful converging parallels of trees
here<00:01:11.430> combined<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.930> model<00:01:13.560> that's<00:01:13.740> going

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
here combined with a model that's going

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.690 
here combined with a model that's going
to<00:01:14.189> create<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.420> idea<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.170> center<00:01:16.890> interest

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
to create the idea of center interest

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760 
to create the idea of center interest
and<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.479> turn<00:01:18.689> makes<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.290> photograph

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and that in turn makes this photograph

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.770 
and that in turn makes this photograph
far<00:01:20.159> more<00:01:20.369> successful<00:01:21.000> than<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
far more successful than just the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.289 
far more successful than just the
picture<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> trees<00:01:22.530> let's<00:01:23.250> watch<00:01:23.580> now<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.119> see
