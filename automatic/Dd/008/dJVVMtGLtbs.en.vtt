00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
it to test and it recorded it in mp3

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.650

format<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:19.610> i<00:01:19.670> end<00:01:19.820> up<00:01:19.880> with<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:20.090> file<00:01:20.390> called

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
format so i end up with a file called

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.350 
format so i end up with a file called
test<00:01:21.190> mp3<00:01:23.410> now<00:01:24.410> what<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:24.620> have<00:01:24.650> to<00:01:24.920> do<00:01:25.100> is

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
test mp3 now what you have to do is

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.840 
test mp3 now what you have to do is
embed<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.930> code<00:01:27.170> into<00:01:27.530> your<00:01:27.590> website<00:01:27.850> so

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
embed the code in actually I'll just do

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.890 
embed the code in actually I'll just do
it<00:01:34.070> on<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.310> blank<00:01:34.880> page<00:01:35.120> and<00:01:35.420> just<00:01:35.540> show<00:01:35.690> you<00:01:35.750> how

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
call it page HTML but you would just

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.009 
call it page HTML but you would just
save<00:03:34.070> you<00:03:34.970> would<00:03:35.090> probably<00:03:35.390> just<00:03:35.510> do<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:35.690> save

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
just created a simple web page here now

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.050 
just created a simple web page here now
let's<00:03:40.790> open<00:03:41.000> this<00:03:42.640> open<00:03:43.640> with<00:03:43.670> firefox<00:03:46.060> okay

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
let's open this open with firefox okay

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.810 
let's open this open with firefox okay
so<00:03:47.120> there<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:47.870> is<00:03:47.930> there's<00:03:48.920> a<00:03:49.010> simple<00:03:49.640> little

so there it is there's a simple little

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.270 
so there it is there's a simple little
code<00:03:50.239> i<00:03:50.420> put<00:03:50.630> in<00:03:50.750> there<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.110> here's<00:03:51.739> our<00:03:51.859> embed

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
code i put in there and here's our embed

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.420 
code i put in there and here's our embed
code<00:03:52.549> now<00:03:52.760> when<00:03:52.940> we<00:03:53.060> press<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.450> play<00:03:53.630> button

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
code now when we press the play button

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.090 
code now when we press the play button
it<00:03:55.430> is<00:03:56.180> now<00:03:56.359> playing<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:57.049> audio<00:03:57.200> and<00:04:00.100> it
