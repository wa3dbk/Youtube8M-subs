00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
selected area and I could drag it around

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.200 
selected area and I could drag it around
and<00:01:15.720> resize<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.009> easily<00:01:17.460> maybe<00:01:17.790> even

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and resize it for easily maybe even
