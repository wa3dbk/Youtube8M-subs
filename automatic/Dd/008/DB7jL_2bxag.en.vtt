00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.700
 Small statues like these are a little magnetic 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.133
 It makes you come closer 

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:19.100
 You like it and make you imagine things about it 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.133
 It is a total of three males 

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:28.734
 From about 1340 BC, the Amarna period. It is a period that is known naturally. 

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:32.467
 You can see it in bodies and gestures 

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:35.834
 The man in the middle put his hand around 

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:39.667
 The boy as if he would draw him near him and kind of protect him 

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:43.233
 And the two men have hands. Which is 

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:49.367
 Two beautiful hands, with one man holding the other man's hand 

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:57.767
 Each face is different. The man on the left has a heavy and planned face. The corners of his mouth drooping. 

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:02.000
 The man in the middle seems more serene and calm 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.634
 And the boy has a small mouth. I began to say who they are and what their personalities are 

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:13.600
 We actually know that these statues were used in local contexts 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.634
 In the shrines of small houses, to show loyalty to the great grandfather and continuity 

00:01:18.634 --> 00:01:24.100
 In asking for their protection in life, after spending their time with her, I think 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.533
 It is the man in the middle who gives us his idea of ​​what is going on 

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:36.700
 The man on the right may be the grandparent and he has a wig 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.400
 He has very complex clothes 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.133
 And 

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.367
 And a napkin carrying it, from the side 

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:46.333
 Which she sees as a broad step 

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:50.767
 On the right, I imagine that this is the man's middle son. 

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:54.734
 He wants that child to receive that blessed 

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:58.200
 It occurs as a result of its attention to the larger. It is possible to stand 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.500
 In the man's house in the middle and then can be kept in the boy's family 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.967
 you know . They inherit and take different identities over time 

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:10.667
 It's a story, but it's like that 

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:14.266
 It really is a gorgeous statue which puts all 

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:17.634
 The questions in your face, you sympathize, you want to 

00:02:17.634 --> 00:02:22.600
 You understand, that reminds me 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.600
 By the way we get old family clips 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.400
 We cherish them 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.133
 And we discover some evidence and threads 

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:35.567
 Which draws us near these people
