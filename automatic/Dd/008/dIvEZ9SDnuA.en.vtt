00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.870
 and good condition, that is, a reading is 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.150
 commenting and I followed with another of the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.290
 new maps of the downhill map the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.809
 times that he added that he missed 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.360
 that is, 5 long snow maps style 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.099
 and others but well I think that what 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.529
 best of all is that this map for the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.900
 game modes like team duel or 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.550
 against everyone and everything is going to be crazy 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.740
 because let's say they're going to last a lot 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.539
 games because that goes quite a lot 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.060
 long but nevertheless for the modes of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.070
 game by objectives is the best because 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.720
 because they are long roads but 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.520
 it's just those trucks that is not 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.990
 It is an open field because it can 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.340
 with the world but that is two or three 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.530
 roads as it has been in 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.320
 all the maps and in fact good I tell you 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.750
 let him breathe there when we were 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.280
 yesterday playing and others said yes 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.900
 it may be that the crazy people make us a 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.140
 way of other eye to the cable car can 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.120
 climb you can go up because climbing does not kill you 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.170
 then he said that what can be that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.430
 we are going to look very big very 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.020
 small but that after all 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.750
 it always ends up being the same, that is to say 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.400
 so you can always find yourself with 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.630
 the enemies in one area and in another I have 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.770
 put in domain game mode like 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.120
 you are seeing because in the center 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.979
 justly 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.140
 is all the action there is a window and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.490
 two aisles there are two other windows and 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.920
 other spaces that come from each point 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.570
 of the map that as you can see the map can be 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 It looks great in fact it is but 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.590
 It is not something as abysmal as it is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.080
 root then afghan that we had in the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.050
 experts module and as I tell you it is not 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.520
 something so huge and for the modes of 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.140
 objective game as I tell you is going to be a 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.270
 last for us not so much because 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.440
 I know there are going to be people that even 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.119
 us when we are playing that to 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.100
 all people that we are going to kill to kill 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.229
 killing cost us to finish the game 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.060
 let's say in less than 10 minutes 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.320
 imagine to try to play with people 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.479
 normal or people who do not have any 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.270
 interest in killing or nothing simply 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.340
 he wants to be there, not because there is not a 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.170
 level map of these people like 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.030
 take it seriously and nothing like I say 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.380
 it's a map that learning looks great 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.390
 but the game modes by objectives 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.220
 those who play domain and harpo and about 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.600
 everything that is a pass and even 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.759
 demolition like to the world also in this 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.409
 map but above all domain you are going to 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.509
 realize that it is quickly a map 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.640
 in which you do massacres because 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.409
 because as once again everything is 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.720
 practically outdoors take out with 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.940
 helicopter that pulls a pair means 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.200
 raze completely so 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.730
 this has been all I hope has been 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.830
 liked this gameplays that is going up 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.580
 more you have it here below if not now 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.580
 same simply by clicking 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.150
 yes
