00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.930
 Brazil has today the largest commercial herd of beef cattle and the world 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.999
 is the world's second largest producer 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.420
 and in 2003 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.420
 took the lead in international trade 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.660
 the health of herds and the quality of products 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.320
 contribute to the strengthening of both the domestic and international markets. 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.220
 but to meet the demand of these markets 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.480
 suppliers should delight in quality control protocols 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.030
 about the products offered 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.110
 in response to this stringent quality control trend 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.420
 embrapa and partner entities have launched 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.579
 the program of good agricultural practices for beef cattle 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.710
 the program of 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.630
 good agricultural practices 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.300
 we are not in an implementation phase 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.180
 close to completion 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.320
 where we abort we approach a number of aspects 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.110
 in the matter 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.920
 herd control 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.980
 with the money 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.110
 was our main focus on the control part 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.850
 It's where it does not exist 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.210
 the police the attacks so worthy of registration and we do not understand that it had 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.220
 great importance then we understand that this value would be very proud of 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.750
 usefulness to us 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.980
 in the years adepts some adjustments in the facilities of the etar team coral 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.010
 the didi ramp access to the trucks man 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.860
 is the training of employees how much when arrived come play 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.500
 with tranquility 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.180
 it's not a matter of money 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.299
 to control 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.310
 the identification of animals the collection of numbers 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.100
 in this to are documents 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.550
 forwarding to the refrigerator 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.049
 in addition to increasing profitability 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.370
 and competitiveness of productive systems 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.860
 the program is important to ensure the provision of safe food 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.880
 from sustainable production systems 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.039
 and which respect the welfare of animals 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:12.980
 it is also necessary 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.099
 that rural properties are in conformity with 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.010
 environmental 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.599

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.979
 with respect to the natural resources existing in 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.150
 it is necessary for producers to comply with environmental laws 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.099
 and recommended techniques for soil conservation 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:10.430
 and water resources 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.419
 and biodiversity 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.759
 social responsibility is also a component to be observed 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:21.289
 to ensure the well-being of the employee and his family 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:26.829
 rural facilities must be adequate not to cause damage to the 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.839
 carcasses and the worship of animals and should also ensure the safety of staff 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:34.839
 responsible for the management of these animals 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.029
 coral should not have 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.089
 tapes of nails 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.529
 screws or buff black panthers 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:46.839
 the side walls of the containment of the syringe and the dock 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.609
 must be planned and closed 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.770
 the dock 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.849
 should have a slight slope of 20 degrees 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.199
 with the last bid and horizontally 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.379
 to reduce the damage caused during the match 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.069
 fences and corridors 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.480
 preferably of aranzubia 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.139
 vilaÃ§a affirmed Luis 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:11.089
 shall not weigh lynx which may cause damage to said animals' leather 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:13.809
 for drinking fountains 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:17.440
 preference should be given to artificial 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.609
 which can easily be victimized 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.050
 they got so much water 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.169
 and good quality 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.770
 courses for the supply of concentrated and bulky minerals should ensure 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.740
 the access of animals 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.050
 without competition for space 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.840
 and protected to avoid losses 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.849
 storage sheds 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.680
 should rather be spit on fans 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.950
 with moisture-resistant walls and floors 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.180
 and closed 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.499
 to prevent the entry of animals and children 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:56.219
 it is important to keep emergency and safety equipment visible 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.259
 identified 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.259
 the archaeologists of agrochemicals 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:06.089
 should be kept separate from the feed shed and food supplements 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:11.849
 the sacks should stand on the traces of wood 'and away from the wall 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.639
 to avoid unity 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.770
 and corrosion of packaging 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.849
 I did not forget the visual identification of each mossul group 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.080
 and in the control of the entrance and exit these insults
