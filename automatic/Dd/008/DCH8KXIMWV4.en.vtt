00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.449

yep he lost his MCV I'm sorry his
armored<00:00:15.730> facility<00:00:16.209> that<00:00:16.570> is<00:00:16.600> a<00:00:16.810> quite

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
armored facility that is a quite

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.040 
armored facility that is a quite
considerable<00:00:17.619> loss<00:00:17.830> at<00:00:18.009> this<00:00:18.550> point<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.990> looks

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
considerable loss at this point it looks

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.620 
considerable loss at this point it looks
like<00:00:20.289> matey's<00:00:20.619> has<00:00:21.150> taken<00:00:22.150> him<00:00:22.300> by<00:00:22.420> surprise

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
like matey's has taken him by surprise

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.060 
like matey's has taken him by surprise
basically<00:00:23.820> because<00:00:24.820> I<00:00:25.570> guess<00:00:26.529> what<00:00:26.769> happened

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
basically because I guess what happened

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.070 
basically because I guess what happened
was<00:00:27.250> that<00:00:27.300> soccer<00:00:28.300> tried<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.720> push<00:00:28.900> in<00:00:28.990> the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
was that soccer tried to push in the

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.769 
was that soccer tried to push in the
middle<00:00:29.349> it<00:00:29.470> did<00:00:29.650> not<00:00:29.679> succeed<00:00:30.429> and<00:00:31.419> this<00:00:31.599> means

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
middle it did not succeed and this means

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.569 
middle it did not succeed and this means
now<00:00:32.079> that<00:00:32.380> matey's<00:00:32.860> has<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.160> advantage

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
now that matey's has the advantage

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.370 
now that matey's has the advantage
because<00:00:33.850> he<00:00:34.090> has<00:00:34.180> not<00:00:34.390> lost<00:00:34.630> all<00:00:34.840> his<00:00:34.990> money<00:00:35.050> to

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
because he has not lost all his money to

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.020 
because he has not lost all his money to
building<00:00:35.710> turrets<00:00:36.070> trying<00:00:36.520> to<00:00:36.580> target<00:00:36.760> push

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
building turrets trying to target push

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.510 
building turrets trying to target push
some<00:00:37.990> ities<00:00:38.260> has<00:00:38.500> definitely<00:00:38.830> got<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.190> mobile

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
some ities has definitely got the mobile

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.080 
some ities has definitely got the mobile
advantage<00:00:39.970> he's<00:00:40.180> able<00:00:40.330> to<00:00:40.570> use<00:00:40.840> his<00:00:41.140> units<00:00:42.090> by

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
advantage he's able to use his units by

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.730 
advantage he's able to use his units by
moving<00:00:43.390> them<00:00:43.630> around<00:00:43.660> because<00:00:44.380> you<00:00:44.530> can't

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
moving them around because you can't

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.450 
moving them around because you can't
move<00:00:44.860> a<00:00:44.920> turret<00:00:45.280> unfortunately<00:00:46.290> that<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:48.430> not

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
move a turret unfortunately that is not

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.190 
move a turret unfortunately that is not
possible<00:00:48.880> but<00:00:49.360> it<00:00:49.630> looks<00:00:49.810> like<00:00:50.520> his<00:00:52.200> soccer

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
possible but it looks like his soccer

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.140 
possible but it looks like his soccer
trying<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.830> yeah<00:00:54.250> soccer<00:00:54.610> is<00:00:54.850> trying<00:00:55.060> to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
trying to yeah soccer is trying to

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.000 
trying to yeah soccer is trying to
counter<00:00:55.480> this<00:00:55.630> by<00:00:55.690> attacking<00:00:56.170> Matisse's<00:00:56.740> main

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
counter this by attacking Matisse's main

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.650 
counter this by attacking Matisse's main
base<00:00:57.250> now<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.840> that<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.850> sorry<00:01:00.850> that<00:01:01.060> is<00:01:01.210> quite

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
base now and that is sorry that is quite

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.550 
base now and that is sorry that is quite
surprising<00:01:03.479> question<00:01:04.479> is<00:01:04.629> is<00:01:04.809> can<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:05.379> take

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
surprising question is is can you take

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.070 
surprising question is is can you take
anything<00:01:05.830> of<00:01:06.160> this<00:01:06.600> geez<00:01:07.600> pumped<00:01:07.900> out<00:01:07.930> our

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
anything of this geez pumped out our

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.780 
anything of this geez pumped out our
hammer<00:01:08.290> tank<00:01:08.620> but<00:01:09.280> against<00:01:09.490> these<00:01:09.700> jazz<00:01:11.790> most

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
hammer tank but against these jazz most

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.280 
hammer tank but against these jazz most
like<00:01:12.880> Matisse<00:01:13.150> is<00:01:13.270> retreating<00:01:13.630> his<00:01:13.870> army<00:01:14.140> now

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
like Matisse is retreating his army now

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.149 
like Matisse is retreating his army now
and<00:01:15.600> these<00:01:16.600> jabs<00:01:17.080> are<00:01:17.290> going<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.620> lock<00:01:17.950> onto

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
and these jabs are going to lock onto

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.130 
and these jabs are going to lock onto
this<00:01:18.460> war<00:01:18.700> factory<00:01:19.120> and<00:01:19.240> it<00:01:19.420> is<00:01:19.570> going<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:19.990> go

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
this war factory and it is going to go

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.460 
this war factory and it is going to go
down<00:01:20.170> fast<00:01:20.830> unless<00:01:21.400> Metis<00:01:21.700> can<00:01:21.850> do<00:01:21.970> something

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
down fast unless Metis can do something

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.690 
down fast unless Metis can do something
he's<00:01:23.470> going<00:01:23.620> to<00:01:23.680> try<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:23.890> trample<00:01:24.370> over<00:01:24.430> the

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
he's going to try and trample over the

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.030 
he's going to try and trample over the
jabs<00:01:24.970> I<00:01:25.120> think<00:01:25.390> if<00:01:26.110> he<00:01:26.290> is<00:01:26.409> can<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.800> take<00:01:26.950> it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
jabs I think if he is can you take it

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.950 
jabs I think if he is can you take it
out<00:01:27.159> of<00:01:27.190> time<00:01:27.370> Oh

Matty<00:02:13.280> still<00:02:13.520> has<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.850> advantage<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.510> all

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
Matty still has the advantage and all

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.820 
Matty still has the advantage and all
mom<00:02:17.480> thinking<00:02:17.840> he's<00:02:17.990> not<00:02:18.140> strapping<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.590> lot<00:02:18.710> of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
mom thinking he's not strapping a lot of

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.520 
mom thinking he's not strapping a lot of
cash<00:02:19.010> soccer<00:02:19.370> he<00:02:19.940> can<00:02:20.090> only<00:02:20.150> build<00:02:20.530> he's

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
cash soccer he can only build he's

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.710 
cash soccer he can only build he's
building<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.920> horrifying<00:02:23.170> yeah<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.680> is<00:02:24.980> and

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
building a horrifying yeah that is and

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.630 
building a horrifying yeah that is and
turret<00:02:26.830> okay<00:02:27.830> so<00:02:27.890> he's<00:02:28.100> going<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.250> tart<00:02:28.460> push

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
turret okay so he's going to tart push

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.880 
turret okay so he's going to tart push
again<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:28.970> guess<00:02:29.120> into<00:02:29.570> Matisse's<00:02:30.050> base<00:02:30.290> to

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
again I guess into Matisse's base to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.800 
again I guess into Matisse's base to
tease<00:02:31.220> his<00:02:31.340> expansion<00:02:31.730> oh<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.510> nice

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
tease his expansion oh that is a nice

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.290 
tease his expansion oh that is a nice
freeze<00:02:36.260> ray<00:02:36.560> look<00:02:37.070> at<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.370> he<00:02:38.180> had<00:02:38.270> a

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
freeze ray look at that he had a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.240 
freeze ray look at that he had a
vindicator<00:02:38.780> he<00:02:38.960> could<00:02:39.140> seriously<00:02:39.830> cripple

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
vindicator he could seriously cripple

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.780 
vindicator he could seriously cripple
matey's<00:02:40.610> because<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.030> crusher<00:02:41.240> crane

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
matey's because of the crusher crane

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.590 
matey's because of the crusher crane
unfortunately<00:02:44.170> there<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.350> no<00:02:45.590> air<00:02:45.770> base<00:02:46.600> that

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
unfortunately there is no air base that

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.710 
unfortunately there is no air base that
is<00:02:47.870> such<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.350> nice<00:02:48.590> freeze<00:02:49.520> right<00:02:49.850> there<00:02:49.910> take

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
is such a nice freeze right there take

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.930 
is such a nice freeze right there take
it<00:02:50.840> down<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.140> power<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.740> crusher<00:02:52.610> frame

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
it down the power and the crusher frame

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.190 
it down the power and the crusher frame
with<00:02:53.360> one<00:02:54.020> or<00:02:54.200> two<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.440> indicators<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.810> let's

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
with one or two of indicators so let's

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.500 
with one or two of indicators so let's
see<00:02:57.410> that<00:02:57.590> action<00:02:58.010> now<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.850> another<00:02:59.120> turret

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
see that action now is is another turret

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.400 
see that action now is is another turret
push<00:03:00.040> pie<00:03:01.040> soccer<00:03:01.430> he's<00:03:01.640> not<00:03:01.850> giving<00:03:02.030> up

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
soccer is not giving up he is made of

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.390 
soccer is not giving up he is made of
stern<00:03:06.530> stuff<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:08.110> he<00:03:09.110> just<00:03:09.380> wants<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:09.980> keep<00:03:10.190> on

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400

playing and he is doing quite a good job

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.260 
playing and he is doing quite a good job
of<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:12.770> tart<00:03:12.980> bush<00:03:13.190> because<00:03:13.520> I<00:03:14.000> think

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
of this tart bush because I think

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.729 
of this tart bush because I think
matey's<00:03:14.540> is<00:03:14.660> about<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:14.989> lose<00:03:15.140> his<00:03:15.230> naval<00:03:15.560> yard

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
matey's is about to lose his naval yard

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.790 
matey's is about to lose his naval yard
before<00:03:15.890> he<00:03:16.160> can<00:03:16.310> pump<00:03:16.520> out<00:03:16.610> at<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.880> cooler<00:03:17.090> sub

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
before he can pump out at a cooler sub

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.560 
before he can pump out at a cooler sub
but<00:03:18.800> I<00:03:19.220> don't<00:03:19.730> know<00:03:19.790> in<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:19.910> long<00:03:20.120> run<00:03:20.180> because

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
but I don't know in the long run because

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.780 
but I don't know in the long run because
matey's<00:03:21.050> does<00:03:21.470> have<00:03:21.830> a<00:03:21.860> economic<00:03:22.370> advantage

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
matey's does have a economic advantage

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.960 
matey's does have a economic advantage
so<00:03:22.940> he<00:03:23.060> can't<00:03:23.300> afford<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.660> lose<00:03:24.670> his<00:03:25.670> naval

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
so he can't afford to lose his naval

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.100 
so he can't afford to lose his naval
yard<00:03:26.180> he<00:03:26.270> can<00:03:26.390> just<00:03:26.510> reconstruct<00:03:26.900> it

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
yard he can just reconstruct it

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.300 
yard he can just reconstruct it
many<00:03:28.800> many<00:03:29.010> times<00:03:29.250> over<00:03:29.450> while<00:03:31.040> soccer<00:03:32.040> only

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
many many times over while soccer only

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.580 
many many times over while soccer only
has<00:03:32.460> is<00:03:32.700> one<00:03:33.150> refinement<00:03:33.720> left<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.110> this<00:03:34.320> game

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
has is one refinement left so this game

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.890 
has is one refinement left so this game
is<00:03:34.800> pretty<00:03:35.280> much<00:03:35.550> wrapped<00:03:35.850> up<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.300> would<00:03:36.840> say

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
is pretty much wrapped up I would say

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.030 
is pretty much wrapped up I would say
yeah<00:03:39.900> some<00:03:40.170> booties<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.500> rebuilding<00:03:40.890> his

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
yeah some booties is rebuilding his

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.910 
yeah some booties is rebuilding his
naval<00:03:41.340> yard<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:42.860> in<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.040> interest<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.430> time

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
naval yard and in the interest of time

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.800 
naval yard and in the interest of time
like<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:47.040> think<00:03:47.360> it's<00:03:48.360> pretty<00:03:48.630> much<00:03:48.840> Gigi<00:03:50.810> so

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
like I think it's pretty much Gigi so

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.060 
like I think it's pretty much Gigi so
I'm<00:03:51.930> going<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.230> fast<00:03:52.500> forward<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.830> little<00:03:52.950> bit

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
I'm going to fast forward a little bit

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.980 
I'm going to fast forward a little bit
here<00:03:53.340> not<00:03:53.760> too<00:03:53.910> much<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.360> can<00:03:54.540> still<00:03:54.660> see<00:03:54.810> the

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
here not too much I can still see the

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.140 
here not too much I can still see the
ending<00:03:55.260> but<00:03:55.980> this<00:03:56.160> is<00:03:56.340> basically<00:03:56.670> just<00:03:56.790> start

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
ending but this is basically just start

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.480 
ending but this is basically just start
pushing

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.200 

as<00:04:04.030> we<00:04:04.270> can<00:04:04.420> see<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:04.960> teases<00:04:05.560> on<00:04:05.710> his<00:04:06.210> like

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
as we can see that teases on his like

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.740 
as we can see that teases on his like
fourth<00:04:07.630> or<00:04:07.810> fifth<00:04:08.080> naval<00:04:08.410> yard<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:09.000> basically

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.810 

soccer<00:04:13.750> soccer<00:04:14.650> sorry<00:04:15.040> there<00:04:15.430> it<00:04:15.520> happened

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
soccer soccer sorry there it happened

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.440 
soccer soccer sorry there it happened
soccer<00:04:16.540> is<00:04:16.830> tart<00:04:17.830> pushing<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.970> matey's

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
soccer is tart pushing and the matey's

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.729 
soccer is tart pushing and the matey's
cannot<00:04:19.720> build<00:04:19.900> on<00:04:20.020> water<00:04:20.230> because<00:04:20.620> this

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
cannot build on water because this

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.610 
cannot build on water because this
crusher<00:04:21.100> crane<00:04:21.280> does<00:04:21.400> not<00:04:21.520> have<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.790> range<00:04:22.620> so

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
crusher crane does not have the range so

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.680 
crusher crane does not have the range so
he's<00:04:23.860> he's<00:04:24.370> only<00:04:24.550> got<00:04:24.760> this<00:04:24.940> little<00:04:25.180> area<00:04:25.450> to

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
he's he's only got this little area to

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.350 
he's he's only got this little area to
build<00:04:25.840> his<00:04:26.020> naval<00:04:26.350> yards<00:04:26.590> on<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:26.980> so<00:04:27.640> really

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.940 
nice strategy by his offer he forced so
the<00:04:30.970> four<00:04:31.330> saw<00:04:31.510> this<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:31.930> that's<00:04:32.620> why<00:04:32.770> he's

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
the four saw this and that's why he's

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.040 
the four saw this and that's why he's
just<00:04:33.160> pushing<00:04:33.340> towards<00:04:34.300> basically<00:04:34.720> but<00:04:34.870> he's

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
just pushing towards basically but he's

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.030 
just pushing towards basically but he's
got<00:04:36.000> only<00:04:37.000> one<00:04:37.300> refinery<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.170> when<00:04:38.440> he<00:04:38.710> finds

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
got only one refinery and when he finds

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.420 
got only one refinery and when he finds
it<00:04:39.280> I'm<00:04:39.520> thinking<00:04:40.050> it's<00:04:41.050> going<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:41.410> go<00:04:41.650> down<00:04:41.680> so

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
it I'm thinking it's going to go down so

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.590 
it I'm thinking it's going to go down so
fast

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.800 

another<00:04:49.470> turrets<00:04:49.980> oh<00:04:50.190> yeah<00:04:51.150> Matty's<00:04:51.570> is

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
another turrets oh yeah Matty's is

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.720 
another turrets oh yeah Matty's is
definitely<00:04:52.470> get<00:04:52.770> encountered<00:04:53.100> very<00:04:53.520> well

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
definitely get encountered very well

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.440 
definitely get encountered very well
here<00:04:55.160> but<00:04:56.160> I'm<00:04:56.280> guessing<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.760> he<00:04:57.000> can<00:04:57.120> easily

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
here but I'm guessing that he can easily

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.150 
here but I'm guessing that he can easily
counter<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:57.960> tarts<00:05:00.350> so<00:05:01.350> another<00:05:01.830> fast

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
counter the tarts so another fast

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.700 
counter the tarts so another fast
forward<00:05:02.520> i<00:05:02.610> think<00:05:02.820> is<00:05:03.000> required

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.950 

here<00:05:07.370> Matisse's<00:05:07.880> hammer<00:05:08.090> tanks<00:05:08.450> are<00:05:08.600> slowly

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
here Matisse's hammer tanks are slowly

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.720 
here Matisse's hammer tanks are slowly
but<00:05:09.320> steadily<00:05:09.560> greening<00:05:10.100> out<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.370> life<00:05:10.550> of

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
but steadily greening out the life of

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:17.610 
but steadily greening out the life of
the<00:05:10.820> Seaport<00:05:13.450> okay<00:05:14.450> so

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.890 

looks<00:05:18.160> like<00:05:18.340> matey's<00:05:19.090> got<00:05:19.300> squeezed<00:05:19.660> one

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
looks like matey's got squeezed one

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.240 
looks like matey's got squeezed one
akula<00:05:20.169> stuff<00:05:20.410> out<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.680> that's<00:05:20.770> ripping<00:05:21.070> apart

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
akula stuff out and that's ripping apart

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.610 
akula stuff out and that's ripping apart
this<00:05:21.550> Riptide<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.780> Riptide<00:05:23.110> is<00:05:23.229> trying<00:05:23.530> to

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
this Riptide the Riptide is trying to

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.100 
this Riptide the Riptide is trying to
take<00:05:23.770> this<00:05:24.010> naval<00:05:24.430> yard<00:05:24.639> down<00:05:24.820> but<00:05:25.210> I<00:05:25.449> don't

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
take this naval yard down but I don't

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.879 
take this naval yard down but I don't
think<00:05:26.260> he's<00:05:26.470> going<00:05:26.680> to<00:05:26.800> be<00:05:26.919> able<00:05:27.040> to<00:05:27.250> make<00:05:27.280> it

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
think he's going to be able to make it

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.370 
think he's going to be able to make it
yep<00:05:29.889> the<00:05:30.220> rip<00:05:30.370> tide<00:05:30.400> goes<00:05:30.699> down<00:05:31.260> and<00:05:32.260> the

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
yep the rip tide goes down and the

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.050 
yep the rip tide goes down and the
seaport<00:05:32.860> is<00:05:32.919> about<00:05:33.220> to<00:05:33.400> go<00:05:33.520> down<00:05:33.699> and<00:05:34.470> well<00:05:36.060> his

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
seaport is about to go down and well his

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.790 
seaport is about to go down and well his
refineries<00:05:37.600> about<00:05:37.750> to<00:05:37.870> go<00:05:37.960> down<00:05:38.139> so<00:05:38.380> I<00:05:38.410> was<00:05:38.530> GG

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800

I do not expect soccer to to survive as

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.530 
I do not expect soccer to to survive as
well<00:05:46.690> as<00:05:47.050> well<00:05:47.290> as<00:05:47.440> he<00:05:47.500> did<00:05:47.680> with<00:05:47.800> so<00:05:48.130> little<00:05:48.540> he

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
unfortunately for him but if it had been

another<00:06:09.130> game<00:06:10.260> but<00:06:11.260> definitely<00:06:12.250> some

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
another game but definitely some

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.330 
another game but definitely some
interesting<00:06:13.240> strategies<00:06:13.720> which<00:06:14.169> I<00:06:14.289> think<00:06:14.530> any

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
interesting strategies which I think any

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.290 
interesting strategies which I think any
allied<00:06:15.880> player<00:06:16.150> can<00:06:16.389> a<00:06:16.419> can<00:06:17.050> employ<00:06:18.300> because

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
allied player can a can employ because

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.690 
allied player can a can employ because
hard<00:06:20.229> pushing<00:06:20.470> I<00:06:20.800> haven't<00:06:21.039> seen<00:06:21.220> much<00:06:21.340> of<00:06:21.400> it

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
hard pushing I haven't seen much of it

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.159 
hard pushing I haven't seen much of it
this<00:06:21.880> is<00:06:22.030> probably<00:06:22.240> the<00:06:22.479> first<00:06:22.570> game<00:06:22.960> oh<00:06:22.990> I've

seen it and that's it's just very very

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.760 
seen it and that's it's just very very
effective<00:06:26.740> if<00:06:26.860> you<00:06:27.010> should<00:06:27.160> do<00:06:27.250> it<00:06:27.340> properly

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
effective if you should do it properly
