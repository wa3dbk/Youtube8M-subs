how's<00:00:00.240> it<00:00:00.420> gone<00:00:00.599> this<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.840> Trevor<00:00:01.110> Lambton<00:00:01.560> and

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
how's it gone this is Trevor Lambton and

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:02.899 
how's it gone this is Trevor Lambton and
today<00:00:02.100> we're<00:00:02.190> going<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.340> be<00:00:02.429> looking<00:00:02.490> at<00:00:02.760> the

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
today we're going to be looking at the

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.460 
today we're going to be looking at the
evolution<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.629> skateboarding<00:00:04.170> from<00:00:04.380> an

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
evolution of skateboarding from an

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.320 
evolution of skateboarding from an
engineering<00:00:04.890> standpoint<00:00:05.220> we're<00:00:06.060> going<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.240> be

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
engineering standpoint we're going to be

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.150 
engineering standpoint we're going to be
looking<00:00:06.750> at<00:00:07.020> three<00:00:07.170> boards<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.710> taking<00:00:08.040> them

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
looking at three boards and taking them

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.799 
looking at three boards and taking them
to<00:00:08.280> different<00:00:08.429> areas<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.970> testing<00:00:09.480> out<00:00:09.599> and

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
to different areas and testing out and

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.720 
to different areas and testing out and
skating<00:00:10.170> up<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.800> see<00:00:11.370> where<00:00:11.519> one's

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
skating up and just a see where one's

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.940 
skating up and just a see where one's
drive<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.330> where<00:00:12.450> one's<00:00:12.660> fail<00:00:12.929> all<00:00:13.740> right<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
drive and where one's fail all right the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.490 
drive and where one's fail all right the
first<00:00:14.160> board<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.610> gotta<00:00:14.790> look<00:00:14.910> out<00:00:15.089> here<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
first board we gotta look out here is a

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.050 
first board we gotta look out here is a
board<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.560> came<00:00:16.890> roughly<00:00:17.279> around<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.580> 60s

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
board that came roughly around the 60s

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.870 
board that came roughly around the 60s
and<00:00:18.210> upwards<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.660> 70s<00:00:19.170> it's<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
and upwards of the 70s it's a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.340 
and upwards of the 70s it's a
banana-shaped<00:00:20.880> board<00:00:21.449> we've<00:00:21.810> upgraded<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
banana-shaped board we've upgraded the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.630 
banana-shaped board we've upgraded the
wheels<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.859> bearings<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.279> stuff<00:00:23.460> but

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
wheels and bearings and stuff but

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.310 
wheels and bearings and stuff but
otherwise<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:24.180> got<00:00:24.330> normal<00:00:24.600> steel<00:00:24.930> trucks

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
otherwise it's got normal steel trucks

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.589 
otherwise it's got normal steel trucks
and<00:00:25.619> they're<00:00:26.369> smaller<00:00:26.730> base<00:00:27.000> which<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.300> like

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and they're smaller base which was like

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.689 
and they're smaller base which was like
the<00:00:27.960> style<00:00:28.260> back<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.650> day<00:00:28.800> all<00:00:29.490> right<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the style back in the day all right the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.580 
the style back in the day all right the
next<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.119> got<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.539> one<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.470> came

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
next one we got is a one that came

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.500 
next one we got is a one that came
shortly<00:00:31.949> after<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.489> as<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.180> tell<00:00:33.239> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
shortly after that as you can tell the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.299 
shortly after that as you can tell the
board's<00:00:33.750> much<00:00:33.989> water<00:00:34.260> much<00:00:34.770> more<00:00:34.950> room<00:00:35.130> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
board's much water much more room to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.060 
board's much water much more room to
stand<00:00:35.489> easier<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.270> skate<00:00:36.540> much<00:00:37.350> larger<00:00:37.710> trucks

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
stand easier to skate much larger trucks

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.740 
stand easier to skate much larger trucks
different<00:00:38.579> wheels<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> everything<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
different wheels and everything it's a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.200 
different wheels and everything it's a
the<00:00:40.500> second<00:00:40.950> board<00:00:41.129> will<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.430> testing<00:00:42.000> out<00:00:42.059> of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the second board will be testing out of

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.420 
the second board will be testing out of
places<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.660> stuff<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.950> third<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.280> final

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
places and stuff and the third and final

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.869 
places and stuff and the third and final
board<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.629> normal<00:00:46.350> board<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.610> time

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
board is the normal board for this time

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.520 
board is the normal board for this time
era<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> board<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.020> ride<00:00:49.320> all

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
era this is the board that I ride all

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.040 
era this is the board that I ride all
the<00:00:49.620> time<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.420> present-day<00:00:51.420> skateboard

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the time it's a present-day skateboard

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.630 
the time it's a present-day skateboard
only<00:00:52.590> things<00:00:52.770> different<00:00:53.039> about<00:00:53.129> these<00:00:53.309> words

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
only things different about these words

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.729 
only things different about these words
it's<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.910> kind<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> middle<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.379> mean<00:00:55.620> this

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it's a kind of in the middle I mean this

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.880 
it's a kind of in the middle I mean this
shape<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.460> perfect<00:00:56.660> it's<00:00:57.660> got<00:00:57.809> concave<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
shape is perfect it's got concave and a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.520 
shape is perfect it's got concave and a
pop<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> news<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.730> tail<00:01:00.149> which<00:01:00.989> allows

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
pop on the news and tail which allows

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.889 
pop on the news and tail which allows
you<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:01.980> more<00:01:02.280> present<00:01:03.059> tricks<00:01:03.300> enough<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
you to do more present tricks enough I

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.210 
you to do more present tricks enough I
mean<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> many<00:01:05.010> ways

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
mean that's just one of the many ways

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.980 
mean that's just one of the many ways
Engineering<00:01:05.820> has<00:01:05.850> helped<00:01:06.180> skateboarding

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
Engineering has helped skateboarding

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.710 
Engineering has helped skateboarding
evolve<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.070> uh<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.909> let's<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.540> all

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
evolve but uh so let's get on to all

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.570 
evolve but uh so let's get on to all
trying<00:01:10.080> these<00:01:10.200> boards<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.159> first<00:01:11.369> thing

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
trying these boards in the first thing

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.070 
trying these boards in the first thing
we<00:01:11.700> notice<00:01:11.970> about<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.270> board<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.930> has<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
we notice about this board is it has a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.170 
we notice about this board is it has a
tiny<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.590> tail<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.880> really

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
tiny little tail on it and a really

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.030 
tiny little tail on it and a really
small<00:01:15.420> nose<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.710> meant<00:01:16.979> for

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
small nose it's not really meant for

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
small nose it's not really meant for
skating<00:01:17.340> halfpipes<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.119> tell<00:01:18.330> you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
skating halfpipes as you can tell you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.999 
skating halfpipes as you can tell you
don't<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.020> much<00:01:19.200> room<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> stand<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.799> here

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
don't have much room to stand up here

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.219 
don't have much room to stand up here
but<00:01:20.670> we're<00:01:20.759> gonna<00:01:20.850> try<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.180> anyway<00:01:21.299> but

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
but we're gonna try it anyway but

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.420 
but we're gonna try it anyway but
remember<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> always<00:01:22.860> got<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.280> your

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
remember you always got to have your

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.789 
remember you always got to have your
helmet<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.630> uh<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.439> what<00:01:25.560> you're<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
helmet on but uh so what you're going to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.560 
helmet on but uh so what you're going to
see<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.280> how<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.520> can't<00:01:26.790> really<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.150> airs<00:01:27.360> on

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
see is how you can't really do airs on

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.929 
see is how you can't really do airs on
this<00:01:27.689> board<00:01:27.960> cuz<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.350> has<00:01:28.560> no<00:01:28.829> nose<00:01:29.040> because

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
this board cuz it has no nose because

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.039 
this board cuz it has no nose because
when<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.210> slide<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.600> foot<00:01:30.750> up<00:01:30.869> there's

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
when you slide your foot up there's

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.060 
when you slide your foot up there's
nothing<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> catch<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:31.799> I'll<00:01:31.920> just

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
nothing to catch it there I'll just

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.410 
nothing to catch it there I'll just
it'll<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.369> come<00:01:32.640> off<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:33.090> gonna<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.299> really

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it'll just come off it's gonna be really

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.149 
it'll just come off it's gonna be really
difficult<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:34.049> uh<00:01:34.079> we're<00:01:34.770> getting<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.009> up<00:01:35.070> in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
difficult but uh we're getting it up in

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.060 
difficult but uh we're getting it up in
a<00:01:35.189> world<00:01:35.400> anyway<00:01:36.200> all<00:01:37.200> right<00:01:37.320> here<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:37.710> make

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
a world anyway all right here we go make

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.289 
a world anyway all right here we go make
sure<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.430> your<00:01:38.460> helmet<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.090> know<00:01:39.210> what

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.750 

but<00:01:56.870> you<00:01:57.170> can<00:01:57.320> tell<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.860> won't<00:01:58.130> lock<00:01:58.370> into<00:01:58.640> the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
but you can tell it won't lock into the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.100 
but you can tell it won't lock into the
coping<00:01:59.120> really<00:01:59.330> well<00:01:59.510> because<00:01:59.750> there's<00:01:59.990> not

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
coping really well because there's not

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.750 
coping really well because there's not
enough<00:02:00.350> trucks<00:02:00.770> it's<00:02:01.130> not<00:02:01.340> meant<00:02:01.610> for

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
enough trucks it's not meant for

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.440 
enough trucks it's not meant for
grinding<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.540> uh<00:02:03.080> it<00:02:03.760> handles<00:02:04.760> really<00:02:04.850> bad<00:02:05.270> in

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
grinding it uh it handles really bad in

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.870 
grinding it uh it handles really bad in
transition<00:02:06.020> it's<00:02:06.200> really<00:02:06.560> wobbly<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.190> we're

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
transition it's really wobbly and we're

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.430 
transition it's really wobbly and we're
going<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.030> move<00:02:08.210> on<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.720> next<00:02:08.750> board<00:02:09.200> which

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
going to move on to the next board which

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.250 
going to move on to the next board which
is<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.619> step<00:02:10.130> up<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.580> actually<00:02:10.930> semi<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:12.050> meant

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
is a step up and actually semi I meant

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.140 
is a step up and actually semi I meant
for<00:02:12.440> this<00:02:12.560> train<00:02:12.890> alright<00:02:13.580> let's<00:02:13.790> get<00:02:13.910> on<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
for this train alright let's get on the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.330 
for this train alright let's get on the
second<00:02:14.540> word<00:02:14.720> we<00:02:14.870> got<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.350> from<00:02:15.920> around<00:02:16.190> the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
second word we got is from around the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.120 
second word we got is from around the
70s<00:02:16.820> now<00:02:16.970> these<00:02:17.120> boards<00:02:17.480> came<00:02:17.660> into<00:02:17.840> play<00:02:18.130> when

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
70s now these boards came into play when

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
70s now these boards came into play when
they're<00:02:19.310> started<00:02:19.610> being<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.820> lot<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.060> people

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
they're started being a lot of people

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.360 
they're started being a lot of people
skating<00:02:20.480> pools<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.170> homemade<00:02:21.830> ramp<00:02:22.070> started

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
skating pools and homemade ramp started

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.070 
skating pools and homemade ramp started
coming<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.640> play<00:02:22.760> kind<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:23.000> like<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.270> one<00:02:23.420> as

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
coming to play kind of like this one as

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.350 
coming to play kind of like this one as
you<00:02:24.260> can<00:02:24.320> tell<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:24.620> board<00:02:24.890> has<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.360> much

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
you can tell this board has a much

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.080 
you can tell this board has a much
larger<00:02:26.900> truck<00:02:27.170> base<00:02:27.410> much<00:02:28.220> wider<00:02:28.490> it<00:02:28.820> locks

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
larger truck base much wider it locks

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.600 
larger truck base much wider it locks
into<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.390> coping<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:30.110> lot<00:02:30.920> better<00:02:31.130> it's<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.460> lot

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
into the coping a lot better it's a lot

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.330 
into the coping a lot better it's a lot
easier<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:32.000> do<00:02:32.210> RapFix<00:02:33.140> on<00:02:33.290> it's<00:02:33.950> got<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> much

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
easier to do RapFix on it's got a much

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.450 
easier to do RapFix on it's got a much
wider<00:02:34.580> tail<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.570> still<00:02:35.810> lacks<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.200> nose

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
wider tail but it still lacks the nose

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.160 
wider tail but it still lacks the nose
and<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.490> concave<00:02:38.270> on<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.570> nose<00:02:38.750> which<00:02:39.050> you

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
and the concave on the nose which you

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.380 
and the concave on the nose which you
can<00:02:39.290> do<00:02:39.380> airs<00:02:39.590> on<00:02:39.830> it's<00:02:40.520> going<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.060> be<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.210> little

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
can do airs on it's going to be a little

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.240 
can do airs on it's going to be a little
more<00:02:41.510> difficult<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:42.080> skate<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.950> normal

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
more difficult to skate and a normal

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.830 
more difficult to skate and a normal
board<00:02:43.460> but<00:02:43.640> way<00:02:43.910> easier<00:02:44.270> than<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.450> last<00:02:44.570> would

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
board but way easier than the last would

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.950 
board but way easier than the last would
all<00:02:45.770> right<00:02:45.890> let's<00:02:46.100> give<00:02:46.250> this<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.400> whirl<00:02:46.960> make

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
all right let's give this a whirl make

00:02:47.960 --> 00:03:05.509 
all right let's give this a whirl make
sure<00:02:47.990> you<00:02:48.230> always<00:02:48.350> got<00:02:48.590> your<00:02:48.740> helmet<00:02:48.890> on

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.309 

see<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:06.730> board<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.150> can<00:03:07.269> do<00:03:07.390> tricks<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.079> tail

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
see this board you can do tricks to tail

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.920 
see this board you can do tricks to tail
like<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.769> last<00:03:08.980> one<00:03:09.189> and<00:03:09.549> it's<00:03:10.510> easier<00:03:10.840> to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
like that last one and it's easier to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.259 
like that last one and it's easier to
skate<00:03:11.170> locks<00:03:11.439> into<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.739> coping<00:03:12.129> and<00:03:13.090> now

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
skate locks into the coping and now

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.000 
skate locks into the coping and now
we're<00:03:13.420> going<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.569> test<00:03:13.840> our<00:03:14.109> last<00:03:14.379> board<00:03:14.739> on

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
we're going to test our last board on

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.160 
we're going to test our last board on
this<00:03:15.250> terrain<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.909> that<00:03:16.719> one<00:03:16.870> should<00:03:17.019> be<00:03:17.049> the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
this terrain and that one should be the

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.020 
this terrain and that one should be the
best<00:03:17.349> okay<00:03:17.620> now<00:03:17.799> our<00:03:17.950> third<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.459> final<00:03:18.489> board

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
best okay now our third and final board

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.240 
best okay now our third and final board
is<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.810> most<00:03:19.989> press<00:03:20.230> before<00:03:20.379> they<00:03:20.739> make<00:03:20.920> um

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
is the most press before they make um

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.880 
is the most press before they make um
it's<00:03:22.090> got<00:03:22.299> seven<00:03:22.930> normal<00:03:23.170> plies<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.769> other

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
it's got seven normal plies the other

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.470 
it's got seven normal plies the other
boards<00:03:24.250> got<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.519> same<00:03:24.700> amount<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.970> flies<00:03:25.150> and

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
boards got the same amount of flies and

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.270 
boards got the same amount of flies and
it's<00:03:25.599> pleasing<00:03:25.959> strong<00:03:26.349> but<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:27.099> main

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
it's pleasing strong but the main

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.589 
it's pleasing strong but the main
difference<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.790> like<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.150> nose<00:03:28.329> and<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.540> tail

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
difference is like the nose and the tail

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.199 
difference is like the nose and the tail
if<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.379> look<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:30.129> nerves<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.489> curved<00:03:30.760> up<00:03:30.969> and

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
if you look the nerves is curved up and

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.629 
if you look the nerves is curved up and
so<00:03:31.359> is<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.569> tail<00:03:31.780> there's<00:03:32.500> concave<00:03:33.069> it's<00:03:33.430> so

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
so is the tail there's concave it's so

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.460 
so is the tail there's concave it's so
that<00:03:33.730> when<00:03:33.879> you<00:03:33.970> do<00:03:34.090> an<00:03:34.209> ollie<00:03:34.389> you<00:03:35.139> press<00:03:35.439> down

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
that when you do an ollie you press down

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.559 
that when you do an ollie you press down
on<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:35.799> tail<00:03:36.099> and<00:03:36.129> your<00:03:36.489> foot<00:03:36.700> slides<00:03:37.060> up<00:03:37.329> and

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
on the tail and your foot slides up and

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.809 
on the tail and your foot slides up and
it'll<00:03:38.139> catch<00:03:38.379> this<00:03:38.560> area<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.430> i'll<00:03:39.579> bring<00:03:39.760> the

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
it'll catch this area and i'll bring the

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.809 
it'll catch this area and i'll bring the
board<00:03:40.150> up<00:03:40.239> in<00:03:40.359> the<00:03:40.450> air<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:41.650> got<00:03:41.859> a<00:03:41.889> perfect
