going<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.750> give<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.110> volume<00:01:58.320> at<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.800> bottom

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
going to give you volume at the bottom

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.130 
going to give you volume at the bottom
of<00:01:59.220> your<00:01:59.340> hair<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.820> repeat<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.660> same<00:02:00.900> thing

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
of your hair and repeat the same thing

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:10.070 
of your hair and repeat the same thing
on<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.380> other<00:02:01.410> side<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.360> cut<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.899> right

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
on the other side so if you cut it right

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.630 
on the other side so if you cut it right
it<00:02:10.290> should<00:02:10.320> look<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.610> course

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it should look like this and of course

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.100 
it should look like this and of course
the<00:02:12.030> back<00:02:12.209> will<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.570> little<00:02:12.840> bit<00:02:12.930> longer

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the back will be a little bit longer

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.750 
the back will be a little bit longer
just<00:02:13.380> because<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.800> way<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:13.980> cut<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.370> you

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
just because of the way you cut it you

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.790 
just because of the way you cut it you
can<00:02:14.940> always<00:02:15.120> go<00:02:15.390> back<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.810> touch<00:02:15.959> up<00:02:16.230> by<00:02:16.440> just

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
can always go back and touch up by just

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:25.520 
can always go back and touch up by just
clipping<00:02:17.070> off<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.520> extra<00:02:17.970> pieces<00:02:24.350> because<00:02:25.350> we

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
clipping off of extra pieces because we

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.979 
clipping off of extra pieces because we
want<00:02:25.739> more<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.100> sleek<00:02:26.459> wavy<00:02:26.850> messy<00:02:27.750> look

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
want more of a sleek wavy messy look

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.810 
want more of a sleek wavy messy look
we're<00:02:28.170> going<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.440> use<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> flat<00:02:29.100> iron<00:02:29.370> today

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
we're going to use a flat iron today

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.080 
we're going to use a flat iron today
instead<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.600> curling<00:02:31.020> on<00:02:31.260> two<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.430> take<00:02:32.940> your

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
hair and take sections of it and just

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.190 
hair and take sections of it and just
bend<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.610> hair<00:02:35.850> mostly<00:02:36.239> at<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.450> ends<00:02:36.840> focus

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
bend the hair mostly at the ends focus

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.320 
bend the hair mostly at the ends focus
on<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.440> ends<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:37.920> focus<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.430> not<00:02:38.700> curling<00:02:39.180> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
hair but more so of just creating

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.970 
hair but more so of just creating
different<00:02:42.660> bins<00:02:42.959> here<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.560> there<00:02:43.770> I'm

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
different bins here and there I'm

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.800 
different bins here and there I'm
curling<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.580> hair<00:02:44.610> toward<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.360> face<00:02:45.570> and

curling the hair toward the face and
away<00:02:46.020> from<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.320> face<00:02:56.750> take<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.810> few<00:02:58.140> random

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
away from the face take a few random

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.170 
away from the face take a few random
sections<00:02:59.010> from<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.190> top<00:02:59.519> and<00:02:59.760> make<00:02:59.880> sure<00:03:00.030> to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
sections from the top and make sure to

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.580 
sections from the top and make sure to
bend<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.510> ends<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:01.230> going<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.470> add

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
bend the ends and this is going to add

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.870 
bend the ends and this is going to add
volume<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> ends<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.790> hair<00:03:04.640> spray<00:03:05.640> it

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
volume to the ends of the hair spray it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.640 
volume to the ends of the hair spray it
with<00:03:06.060> some<00:03:06.209> hairspray<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.870> repeat<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.440> same

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.900 

we<00:03:53.620> will<00:03:53.740> begin<00:03:53.890> working<00:03:54.340> with<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.730> bank

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
we will begin working with the bank

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.420 
we will begin working with the bank
section<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.600> just<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:56.080> second<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:57.010> first<00:03:57.250> thing

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
section in just a second the first thing

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.610 
section in just a second the first thing
you<00:03:57.610> want<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:57.850> do<00:03:58.090> before<00:03:58.360> you<00:03:58.930> start<00:03:59.410> working

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
you want to do before you start working

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.440 
you want to do before you start working
with<00:03:59.740> your<00:03:59.950> bearing<00:04:00.250> area<00:04:00.550> of<00:04:00.640> course<00:04:00.910> or<00:04:01.180> you

with your bearing area of course or you
can<00:04:01.600> do<00:04:01.720> this<00:04:01.870> step<00:04:02.080> less<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.620> to<00:04:02.860> go<00:04:03.040> ahead<00:04:03.160> and

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
can do this step less is to go ahead and

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.449 
can do this step less is to go ahead and
just<00:04:03.730> shake<00:04:04.000> out<00:04:04.150> your<00:04:04.180> hair<00:04:04.690> I<00:04:05.160> choose<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:06.340> do

just shake out your hair I choose to do
this<00:04:06.490> step<00:04:06.940> before<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.480> actually<00:04:07.900> work<00:04:08.500> with<00:04:08.680> my

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
this step before I actually work with my

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.680 
this step before I actually work with my
bank<00:04:09.160> areas<00:04:09.459> so<00:04:09.610> I<00:04:09.640> won't<00:04:09.940> mess<00:04:10.120> up<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.420> style

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
bank areas so I won't mess up the style

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.110 
bank areas so I won't mess up the style
of<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.959> bank<00:04:11.170> once<00:04:11.500> it's<00:04:11.709> complete<00:04:12.120> we'll

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
of the bank once it's complete we'll

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.550 
of the bank once it's complete we'll
just<00:04:13.330> use<00:04:13.480> your<00:04:13.660> finger<00:04:13.959> and<00:04:14.140> kind<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.380> pick

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
just use your finger and kind of pick

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.740 
just use your finger and kind of pick
apart<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:15.070> curls<00:04:15.670> at<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.910> bottom<00:04:16.269> and<00:04:16.480> fluff

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
apart the curls at the bottom and fluff

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.120 
apart the curls at the bottom and fluff
it<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.959> little<00:04:17.170> bit<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.470> make<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.739> hair<00:04:17.950> more

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
it a little bit to make the hair more

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:26.850 
it a little bit to make the hair more
volume<00:04:18.190> eyes<00:04:18.730> at<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.120> ends<00:04:19.390> of<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.570> hair

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.429 

so<00:04:27.849> now<00:04:28.030> for<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.419> bang<00:04:28.629> we're<00:04:28.900> going<00:04:29.139> to<00:04:29.289> go

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:29.439 
so now for the bang we're going to go

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:30.719 
so now for the bang we're going to go
ahead<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:29.770> comb<00:04:29.949> that<00:04:30.159> out

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
ahead and comb that out

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.790 
ahead and comb that out
you<00:04:31.030> always<00:04:31.240> want<00:04:31.629> this<00:04:31.810> bang<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.349> be<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.530> little

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
you always want this bang to be a little

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.860 
you always want this bang to be a little
bit<00:04:33.069> shorter<00:04:33.669> than<00:04:33.939> the<00:04:34.150> actual<00:04:34.419> length<00:04:34.689> of

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
bit shorter than the actual length of

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.050 
bit shorter than the actual length of
the<00:04:34.960> hair<00:04:35.199> but<00:04:35.710> we're<00:04:35.919> not<00:04:36.129> creating<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.759> really

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
the hair but we're not creating a really

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.029 
the hair but we're not creating a really
short<00:04:37.240> bang<00:04:37.479> either<00:04:37.719> because<00:04:38.169> Kim's<00:04:38.500> bang<00:04:38.830> is

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
short bang either because Kim's bang is

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.279 
short bang either because Kim's bang is
not<00:04:39.250> really<00:04:39.550> short<00:04:39.849> begin<00:04:40.569> by<00:04:40.719> cutting<00:04:41.050> the

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
not really short begin by cutting the
