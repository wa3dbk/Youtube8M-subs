so<00:02:27.220> comparing<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.520> video<00:02:29.180> game<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:30.130> playing

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
so comparing a video game to playing

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.330 
so comparing a video game to playing
video<00:02:31.490> games<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:32.630> drug<00:02:33.020> use<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:34.160> actually

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
video games to drug use and it actually

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.190 
video games to drug use and it actually
makes<00:02:35.060> perfect<00:02:35.510> sense<00:02:35.690> if<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.930> think<00:02:35.960> about

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
makes perfect sense if you think about

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.690 
makes perfect sense if you think about
it<00:02:36.380> because<00:02:37.270> let's<00:02:38.270> take<00:02:38.660> marijuana<00:02:39.590> right<00:02:39.980> so

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
it because let's take marijuana right so

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.380 
it because let's take marijuana right so
it<00:02:41.630> starts<00:02:42.290> off<00:02:42.470> with<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:43.250> just<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:44.060> doing

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
it starts off with you just you doing

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.570 
it starts off with you just you doing
marijuana<00:02:44.750> because<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.950> either<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.430> see

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
marijuana because you either you see

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.250 
marijuana because you either you see
other<00:02:46.700> people<00:02:47.030> doing<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.450> are<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.630> curious<00:02:48.080> or

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
other people doing it are you curious or

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.980 
other people doing it are you curious or

whatever then you play or you smoke or
whatever<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.500> then<00:02:51.830> if<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.490> continue<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.360> do

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
whatever and then if you continue to do

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
and I think it's an interesting

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.030 
and I think it's an interesting
correlation<00:04:11.030> that<00:04:11.360> this<00:04:12.170> this<00:04:12.530> gentleman<00:04:12.950> the

exploiting the the similarities you know

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.580 
exploiting the the similarities you know
like<00:04:18.290> it<00:04:19.040> just<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.669> makes<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.720> lot<00:04:20.900> of<00:04:20.930> sense<00:04:21.080> and

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
like it just it makes a lot of sense and

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.320 
like it just it makes a lot of sense and
in<00:04:21.830> a<00:04:21.950> way<00:04:22.160> let's<00:04:22.700> say<00:04:22.850> if<00:04:22.940> I'm<00:04:23.060> talking<00:04:23.300> about

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
in a way let's say if I'm talking about

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.350 
in a way let's say if I'm talking about
ecology<00:04:23.690> black<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.140> I'm<00:04:24.200> not<00:04:24.350> feeling<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:25.360> it's

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
ecology black so I'm not feeling it it's

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.719 
ecology black so I'm not feeling it it's
just<00:04:26.570> because<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:26.930> wasn't<00:04:27.560> getting<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.160> same

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
just because I wasn't getting the same

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.090 
just because I wasn't getting the same
high

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
high

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.310 
high
that<00:04:30.310> i<00:04:30.340> got<00:04:30.700> from<00:04:31.270> when<00:04:31.570> i<00:04:31.900> was<00:04:31.930> playing

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
that i got from when i was playing

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.130 
that i got from when i was playing
modern<00:04:32.680> warfare<00:04:32.710> 2<00:04:33.190> or<00:04:33.520> black<00:04:34.240> ops<00:04:34.510> that's

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
modern warfare 2 or black ops that's

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.290 
modern warfare 2 or black ops that's
that's<00:04:35.500> all<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.770> was<00:04:35.920> it's<00:04:36.310> just<00:04:36.490> like<00:04:36.670> the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
that's all it was it's just like the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.450 
that's all it was it's just like the
amount<00:04:37.720> of<00:04:37.810> time<00:04:38.440> and<00:04:38.680> energy<00:04:38.800> that<00:04:39.250> i<00:04:39.280> would

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
amount of time and energy that i would

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.710 
amount of time and energy that i would
put<00:04:39.610> into<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.910> games<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.270> I<00:04:40.300> wasn't<00:04:40.480> enjoying

put into the games and I wasn't enjoying

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.380 
put into the games and I wasn't enjoying
it<00:04:41.230> is<00:04:41.410> it<00:04:42.130> making<00:04:42.340> sense<00:04:42.700> for<00:04:42.910> me<00:04:43.000> that's<00:04:43.180> like

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
it is it making sense for me that's like

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.870 
it is it making sense for me that's like
that<00:04:44.320> be<00:04:44.500> like<00:04:44.820> basically<00:04:45.870> buying<00:04:46.870> up<00:04:47.880> buying

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
that be like basically buying up buying

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.600 
that be like basically buying up buying
a<00:04:49.150> big-ass<00:04:49.540> bag<00:04:49.900> of<00:04:50.080> weed<00:04:50.200> from<00:04:50.560> your<00:04:50.800> from

and then keep on smoking it and thinking

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.610 
and then keep on smoking it and thinking
that<00:04:57.400> like<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.300> definition<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:58.840> insanity<00:04:59.020> is

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
that like the definition of insanity is

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.070 
that like the definition of insanity is
to<00:05:00.490> continually<00:05:01.270> do<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.600> same<00:05:01.780> thing<00:05:01.930> over

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
to continually do the same thing over

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.270 
to continually do the same thing over
and<00:05:02.230> over<00:05:02.350> again<00:05:02.500> expecting<00:05:02.920> a<00:05:03.220> different

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
and over again expecting a different

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.520 
and over again expecting a different
result<00:05:03.670> and<00:05:04.120> so<00:05:04.810> that's<00:05:04.930> what<00:05:05.110> these<00:05:05.230> video

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
result and so that's what these video

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.790 
result and so that's what these video
games<00:05:05.560> kind<00:05:05.950> of<00:05:06.040> doing<00:05:06.490> it's<00:05:07.390> just<00:05:07.660> man<00:05:07.930> now
