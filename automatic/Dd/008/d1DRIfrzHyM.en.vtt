00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 in the morning and welcome to 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.130
 a new little unboxing video and 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.500
 This time I have one of the children 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.230
 Surprise eggs in this special 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.880
 Christmas ethical the front half 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.730
 of the oil is almost newly designed and it 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.310
 is also something to attach and that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.080
 up here a kind of little bend there 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.300
 you can see them now so you could do that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.929
 whole beautiful hanging on the Christmas tree 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.369
 advised to come up with something and 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.190
 that's what it looks like and I'm really excited 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.020
 what is in here and yes of the motive he 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.690
 I just wanted to show you that 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.160
 is there now three new passes the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.620
 others will of course still follow it 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.500
 give me another blue and 1 in green me 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.170
 right now remember here is now 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.110
 Red and Santa Claus is in front 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.840
 Well, as I said, it is quite nice 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.610
 attach and also christmas 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.050
 I do not know if it is here 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.489
 Smurfs are in it or you look at yourself 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.449
 For this also something else devised 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:10.890
 has and yes we pack the whole time 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:13.080
 As usual, only once the shakes it yes 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.790
 you will now be a little bit what that means 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.040
 probably that the yellow one in there 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.180
 on the chocolate is firmly melted 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.180
 good look in and out 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.369
 here you can see now the imprint these 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.939
 hs was stuck and could not 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.200
 fold 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.049
 Now let's have a look 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.619
 again but also that does not work 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.630
 shake as I want 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.020
 and yes what did I last with 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.299
 Gargamel was very pretty tight 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.830
 packed that did not work out and yes 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.229
 otherwise it is not possible to do that 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.759
 otherwise again na yes I would only say 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:01.920
 Look at it, I'll keep it all in 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:05.750
 not too long and packaged why 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.899
 that does not work now, I do not know 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:15.150
 I really like what I have here 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:18.750
 here in front of beyblade I have to 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:26.040
 first time at blade and although it is 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:29.310
 so yes guru blade already quite a lot 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.989
 Something special is moderately that one can 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.140
 Assemble see what all the times 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:39.870
 At first you take the lower part 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.200
 there I put each of these now 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.880
 dinger pressure 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.900
 they are all the same probably make 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.900
 I 'll just do it this way 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.130
 then the other part comes out from the top 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.860
 had to and pay attention to the distances and 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.570
 then that suits the blue things 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.810
 will no longer be able to move you 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.670
 can turn it on here 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.440
 Now you can see these things here 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.290
 I would build wings on it 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:24.550
 suspect 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:35.010
 and how exactly does that work 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:35.010
 Things should be in the corners 12 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:54.010
 and numero three, that's how it all looks 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:58.980
 and the whole thing is supposed to be spinning 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.980
 really nice and 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:09.940
 but what the whole thing should be I know 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:11.349
 yet do not know if that's what you mean 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.180
 it should not fly that too but me 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.489
 think this is what it is 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.790
 what should be on the table someday 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.940
 has turned the end also gives 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.510
 24 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:28.350
 but unfortunately nothing is written here 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.550
 no game manual or something 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.360
 that's why I would guess because 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:41.260
 Here we only once since the animals 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.970
 88 and it rotates late night alumni 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.979
 It is to triumph on this 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.389
 silver part shows he has then stop 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.940
 I have no idea 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.669
 well that was a real one now 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.729
 video from this google beyblade like 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:57.280
 I had not said that yet 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.720
 So much, well, I do not know anything yet 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.880
 maybe I'll start 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.530
 googling times look proof and well 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.740
 that was first of me from this video 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.050
 Until next time 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.680
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:15.660
