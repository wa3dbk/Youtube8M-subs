00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello guys in came from don da 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.340
 tutorial in this new tutorial vi 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.710
 I will show in a very short manner how 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.290
 draw with photoshop or to transfer 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.770
 a drawing scanned on the computer 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.750
 without doing with the wand tool 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.060
 magic clear the white edges then 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.660
 let us stay board and but right there 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.240
 passing it to the computer with the mouse or 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.189
 so no graphics tablet for me 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.510
 one thing we have once 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.290
 set our drawing in photoshop 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:39.629
 we have to create are the levels above the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.450
 our true level 2 design on the level 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.399
 1 level 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.640
 this would be what we see here 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.530
 it would have been for dancing or revealed one you must 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.559
 take the bucket tool e 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.039
 fill it all with white centralize 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.609
 1 in the return 2 excuse me is the one where 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:07.189
 we are going to do the signs as you see I have 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.590
 already started tracing the image 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:15.090
 then always following the selected 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.689
 level 2 that is, this is where we take it 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.869
 pen tool and making zug where 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.030
 we have to go and draw it 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.159
 let's go to draw then 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.680
 we'll see what we do here 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.000
 and we do right click track 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.670
 track ok 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.200
 then limina traced as you see 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.380
 he did this to me here then 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.079
 I will go to serial levels 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.590
 select as you see here has made it 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:54.670
 this sign is the same we will have to do 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:57.399
 for all the others the other drawings 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.020
 that we have on our image 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:06.899
 remember ahead to always do 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:06.899
 eliminate kicked I do nothing but 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:25.700
 you saw it drew me too 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.939
 obviously you have to go to change the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.560
 brush settings to have 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.709
 this effect here or that wins more 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.760
 thin wide cleaning in the meantime going on 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.870
 okay 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.970
 let's make some other signs to do 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.760
 see a little how to use the pen though 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.760
 you want to try because a little difficult 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.290
 remember to track 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.120
 track should do without two 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:18.489
 touch with the penalty or more than two 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:22.299
 lines with the pen because you see if 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:27.280
 I want to do this track here and do it 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:31.900
 so I don't get tracked 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.730
 to make a single line should do 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.099
 this thing here once done fifth 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.390
 the line you have to click on again 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.040
 pallino so you make track is 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.170
 that they obviously do because you have 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.170
 made two iron touches 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.790
 here 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:00.530
 the perfect facade this should 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.280
 be an invitation quite short 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.340
 it's fast 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.710
 I hope you have been helpful in the 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.770
 next video tutorial in photoshop 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.600
 we will see how to color our design 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.490
 which we brought to the computer because 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.620
 as it has many open spaces 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.410
 I want to see in color like colored 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.580
 I hope I have been useful to you and to the 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.580
 next guys hello
