00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.719 
shimmer but it gives off like a glow so
that's<00:05:35.300> nice<00:05:35.889> it<00:05:36.889> kind<00:05:37.160> of<00:05:37.250> like<00:05:37.460> a<00:05:37.490> little

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
that's nice it kind of like a little

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:38.950 
that's nice it kind of like a little
highlighter<00:05:38.180> I<00:05:38.300> think<00:05:38.570> but<00:05:38.780> it's<00:05:38.930> not

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
highlighter I think but it's not

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.320 
highlighter I think but it's not
shimmery<00:05:39.650> at<00:05:39.889> all<00:05:40.250> they're<00:05:40.460> super<00:05:40.970> matte<00:05:41.120> it

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
shimmery at all they're super matte it

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.180 
shimmery at all they're super matte it
said<00:05:41.509> it<00:05:41.630> on<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:41.810> packaging<00:05:42.289> that<00:05:42.440> they're

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
said it on the packaging that they're

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.890 
said it on the packaging that they're
matte<00:05:43.400> so<00:05:43.729> I<00:05:43.759> think<00:05:43.970> these<00:05:44.449> are<00:05:44.509> like<00:05:44.630> the

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
matte so I think these are like the

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.939 
matte so I think these are like the
first<00:05:45.259> um<00:05:46.330> Matt<00:05:47.330> baked<00:05:47.900> blushes<00:05:48.440> that<00:05:48.650> moolah

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
first um Matt baked blushes that moolah

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:50.860 
first um Matt baked blushes that moolah
