and<00:02:51.590> that's<00:02:51.980> going<00:02:52.099> to<00:02:52.190> finish<00:02:52.400> the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
and that's going to finish the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.289 
and that's going to finish the
installation<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:55.400> now<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.610> can<00:02:55.849> close<00:02:56.060> this

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
installation and so now I can close this

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.039 
installation and so now I can close this

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:36.320 

the<00:04:08.090> fee<00:04:08.480> under

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.570 

and<00:04:36.900> there<00:04:37.139> you<00:04:37.229> go<00:04:37.620> there<00:04:37.949> is<00:04:40.550> Debian<00:04:41.550> Linux

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
and there you go there is Debian Linux

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.770 
and there you go there is Debian Linux
running<00:04:42.300> on<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:43.080> nokia<00:04:43.770> n810

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
running on the nokia n810

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:53.390 
running on the nokia n810
we<00:04:45.780> have<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.940> clock<00:04:47.940> down<00:04:48.270> here<00:04:48.659> and<00:04:49.699> I<00:04:50.699> can<00:04:52.400> go

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
we have the clock down here and I can go

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.760 
we have the clock down here and I can go
to<00:04:53.460> programs<00:04:55.970> application<00:04:57.199> and<00:04:58.199> then<00:04:58.470> let's

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
to programs application and then let's

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.350 
to programs application and then let's
try

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.520 

here's<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.310> open<00:05:07.310> every<00:05:07.699> word<00:05:07.879> in<00:05:08.720> here

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.470 

so<00:05:13.130> obviously<00:05:13.880> it's<00:05:14.030> going<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.210> be<00:05:14.270> really

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
so obviously it's going to be really

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.280 
so obviously it's going to be really
really<00:05:14.600> slow<00:05:15.140> the<00:05:16.120> nokia<00:05:17.120> n810<00:05:17.360> s<00:05:17.660> processor

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
really slow the nokia n810 s processor

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.780 
really slow the nokia n810 s processor
is<00:05:18.440> basically<00:05:18.980> equivalent<00:05:19.160> to<00:05:19.640> like<00:05:19.730> a

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
is basically equivalent to like a

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.600 
is basically equivalent to like a
Pentium<00:05:20.210> 2<00:05:20.470> so<00:05:21.470> it's<00:05:21.740> going<00:05:21.800> to<00:05:21.920> take<00:05:22.160> quite<00:05:22.190> a

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
Pentium 2 so it's going to take quite a

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:31.520 
Pentium 2 so it's going to take quite a
while<00:05:23.680> but<00:05:24.680> it's<00:05:25.100> still<00:05:25.280> kind<00:05:25.490> of<00:05:25.550> neat

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:48.029 

so<00:05:32.100> here's<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.820> splash<00:05:33.210> screen

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.459 

and<00:05:48.369> it's<00:05:48.849> going<00:05:48.999> to<00:05:49.089> take<00:05:49.300> a<00:05:49.330> while<00:05:49.629> but<00:05:50.229> we'll

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:50.469 
and it's going to take a while but we'll

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:52.379 
and it's going to take a while but we'll
just<00:05:50.710> show<00:05:51.069> you<00:05:51.129> this<00:05:51.309> one<00:05:51.369> application<00:05:52.180> and

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
just show you this one application and

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.100 
just show you this one application and
then<00:05:53.580> let<00:05:54.580> you<00:05:54.789> go<00:05:55.300> ahead<00:05:55.389> and<00:05:55.569> do<00:05:55.659> it<00:05:55.719> yourself

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
then let you go ahead and do it yourself

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.359 
then let you go ahead and do it yourself
so<00:05:57.180> here<00:05:58.180> we<00:05:58.300> go<00:05:58.360> I<00:05:58.419> can<00:05:58.539> open<00:05:59.099> another<00:06:00.099> the

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:00.369 
so here we go I can open another the

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:03.209 
so here we go I can open another the
presentation<00:06:01.059> wizard<00:06:01.589> -<00:06:02.589> open<00:06:02.919> an<00:06:02.979> empty

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219 
presentation wizard - open an empty

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:10.980 
presentation wizard - open an empty
presentation<00:06:05.279> and<00:06:06.279> in<00:06:06.430> heavy<00:06:06.699> word<00:06:09.119> so<00:06:10.119> as<00:06:10.659> you

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
presentation and in heavy word so as you

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.339 
presentation and in heavy word so as you
can<00:06:11.110> see<00:06:11.169> it<00:06:11.409> works<00:06:11.649> it's<00:06:11.949> incredibly<00:06:12.639> slow

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
can see it works it's incredibly slow

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:16.409 
can see it works it's incredibly slow
but<00:06:14.349> it<00:06:14.830> takes<00:06:14.979> about<00:06:15.129> two<00:06:15.460> and<00:06:15.789> a<00:06:15.849> half<00:06:16.029> hours

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
but it takes about two and a half hours

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:22.549 
but it takes about two and a half hours
to<00:06:16.449> do<00:06:16.960> the<00:06:17.080> full<00:06:17.289> install<00:06:17.770> and<00:06:19.889> then<00:06:20.889> you<00:06:21.399> can

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:22.559 
to do the full install and then you can

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:26.909 
to do the full install and then you can
I<00:06:24.749> mean<00:06:25.749> you<00:06:25.779> can<00:06:26.020> fully<00:06:26.199> use<00:06:26.379> it<00:06:26.559> it<00:06:26.680> works

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
I mean you can fully use it it works

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.309 
I mean you can fully use it it works
