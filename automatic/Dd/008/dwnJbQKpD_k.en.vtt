what I could do since I'm finding them

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.330 
what I could do since I'm finding them
here<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> could<00:00:48.780> keep<00:00:48.989> traipsing<00:00:49.920> around<00:00:50.010> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
here I could keep traipsing around this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.360 
here I could keep traipsing around this
area<00:00:50.610> looking<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.539> good<00:00:51.780> size<00:00:52.020> morels<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:53.100> I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
area looking for a good size morels or I

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.939 
area looking for a good size morels or I
could<00:00:53.670> pick<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> little<00:00:54.270> ones<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.750> I'd<00:00:55.710> have

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
could pick the little ones and I'd have

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.970 
could pick the little ones and I'd have
some<00:00:56.190> morels<00:00:56.719> but<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.989> got<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> better<00:00:58.590> plan

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
some morels but I got a better plan

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
to find these kind of spots I've already

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.109 
to find these kind of spots I've already
showed<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.350> Prior<00:01:07.680> videos<00:01:07.920> how<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.640> find<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
showed in Prior videos how to find a

I<00:01:21.650> got<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> nice<00:01:22.979> southern<00:01:23.670> exposure<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.570> right

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I got a nice southern exposure I'm right

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.830 
I got a nice southern exposure I'm right
at<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.229> edge<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.680> woods<00:01:26.420> now<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> haven't

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
at the edge of the woods now I haven't

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.710 
at the edge of the woods now I haven't
been<00:01:27.960> out<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.680> don't<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.250> sure

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
been out here and I don't know for sure

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.450 
been out here and I don't know for sure
that<00:01:30.720> there<00:01:30.930> are<00:01:31.110> morels<00:01:31.590> fruiting<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.189> here

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
that there are morels fruiting in here

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.249 
that there are morels fruiting in here
they<00:01:32.670> maybe<00:01:32.909> smile<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> other<00:01:33.869> ones<00:01:34.079> but

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
they maybe smile like the other ones but

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.910 
they maybe smile like the other ones but
I<00:01:34.320> got<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> good<00:01:35.420> inclination<00:01:36.680> that<00:01:37.680> there's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
I got a good inclination that there's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.069 
I got a good inclination that there's
going<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.159> some<00:01:38.490> big<00:01:38.759> juicy<00:01:39.360> yellow<00:01:39.869> and

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
going to be some big juicy yellow and

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.020 
going to be some big juicy yellow and
rails<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.799> because<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> lot<00:01:42.000> more

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
rails in here because we have a lot more

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.359 
rails in here because we have a lot more
Sun<00:01:42.540> coming<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.110> warming<00:01:43.560> up<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.799> ground<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
Sun coming in warming up the ground and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.179 
Sun coming in warming up the ground and
that's<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.880> trick<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.780> finding<00:01:46.200> early<00:01:46.649> season

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
that's the trick to finding early season

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.289 
that's the trick to finding early season
yellow<00:01:47.700> morels

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
yellow morels

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.410 
yellow morels
so<00:01:49.259> let's<00:01:49.409> go<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.240> see<00:01:51.240> if<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.420> find<00:01:51.450> any

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.890 

now<00:01:56.420> there's<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.720> nice<00:01:56.900> Elm<00:01:57.290> but<00:01:57.800> it's<00:01:57.950> alive

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
now there's a nice Elm but it's alive

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.930 
now there's a nice Elm but it's alive
but<00:01:59.900> right<00:02:00.110> back<00:02:00.320> there's<00:02:00.650> a<00:02:00.770> nice<00:02:01.400> dead

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
but right back there's a nice dead

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.030 
but right back there's a nice dead
morale<00:02:02.330> or<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.630> dead<00:02:02.990> elm<00:02:03.260> I<00:02:03.560> mean<00:02:05.320> so<00:02:06.320> let's<00:02:06.530> go

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
morale or a dead elm I mean so let's go

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.510 
morale or a dead elm I mean so let's go
see<00:02:07.430> if<00:02:07.580> there's<00:02:07.790> any<00:02:07.970> morels<00:02:09.250> growing<00:02:10.250> around

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
see if there's any morels growing around

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
better than the other ones I was finding

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.860 
better than the other ones I was finding
I<00:03:05.680> bet<00:03:06.680> there's<00:03:06.890> more<00:03:06.950> around<00:03:07.310> here<00:03:07.580> too<00:03:07.870> I'm

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
I bet there's more around here too I'm

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.780 
I bet there's more around here too I'm
gonna<00:03:09.110> set<00:03:09.560> them<00:03:09.650> side<00:03:09.890> by<00:03:09.920> side<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.520> give<00:03:10.670> you

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
gonna set them side by side and give you

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.090 
gonna set them side by side and give you
a<00:03:10.820> size<00:03:11.209> comparison<00:03:11.239> now<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:12.410> think<00:03:12.739> I<00:03:13.040> know

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
a size comparison now I think I know

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.780 
a size comparison now I think I know
which<00:03:13.400> one<00:03:13.459> I'd<00:03:13.820> rather<00:03:14.030> have<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:16.280> was<00:03:16.550> that

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
which one I'd rather have this was that

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.940 
which one I'd rather have this was that
largest<00:03:17.450> one<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:17.660> showed<00:03:18.080> you<00:03:18.110> growing<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.860> the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
largest one I showed you growing in the

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.120 
largest one I showed you growing in the
other<00:03:19.100> spot<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:19.840> now<00:03:20.840> I'm<00:03:21.080> less<00:03:21.380> than<00:03:21.800> 1/8<00:03:22.100> a

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
other spot and now I'm less than 1/8 a

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.270 
other spot and now I'm less than 1/8 a
mile<00:03:22.580> away<00:03:22.730> from<00:03:22.880> this<00:03:23.300> location<00:03:24.280> only

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
mile away from this location only

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.949 
mile away from this location only
difference<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:25.880> I<00:03:26.060> have<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.269> good<00:03:26.600> southern

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
difference is I have a good southern

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.830 
difference is I have a good southern
exposure<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:29.030> look<00:03:29.330> what<00:03:29.480> I'm<00:03:29.600> finding

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
exposure and look what I'm finding

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.470 
exposure and look what I'm finding

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
morels that are actually worth picking

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.060
