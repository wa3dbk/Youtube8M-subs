beginners flour is one really important
ingredient<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.610> all<00:00:17.910> recipes<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.800> it's<00:00:19.800> very

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
ingredient in all recipes and it's very

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.220 
ingredient in all recipes and it's very
important<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.240> use<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.750> right<00:00:21.779> amount

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
important that we use the right amount

important that we use the right amount
and<00:00:22.619> right<00:00:22.980> measure<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.460> flour<00:00:24.000> which<00:00:24.930> the

and cookies may end up being dry and

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.470 
and cookies may end up being dry and
tough<00:00:30.930> so<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.590> always<00:00:32.070> best<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.120> weigh

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
tough so it's always best that you weigh

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.410 
tough so it's always best that you weigh
your<00:00:33.690> ingredients<00:00:34.380> including<00:00:35.250> flour<00:00:35.520> but

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
your ingredients including flour but

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.680 
your ingredients including flour but
then<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:37.649> case<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.190> do<00:00:38.310> not<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:39.059> set<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
then in case you do not have your set of

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.320 
then in case you do not have your set of
weighing<00:00:39.930> scales<00:00:40.350> yet<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.610> may<00:00:41.790> want<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> know

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
weighing scales yet you may want to know

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.740 
weighing scales yet you may want to know
how<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.630> measure<00:00:42.960> flour<00:00:43.860> correctly<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.750> again

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
how to measure flour correctly and again

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.920 
how to measure flour correctly and again
those<00:00:46.050> rare<00:00:46.350> instances<00:00:47.040> where<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.730> are

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
those rare instances where you are

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.540 
those rare instances where you are
kitchen<00:00:48.930> scales<00:00:49.260> decide<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.830> throw<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.070> tantrum

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
kitchen scales decide to throw a tantrum

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.070 
kitchen scales decide to throw a tantrum
and<00:00:50.760> then<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.120> don't<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.540> to<00:00:51.690> do

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
and then you don't know what to do

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.620 
and then you don't know what to do
so<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.740> times<00:00:53.040> like<00:00:53.310> that<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.700> really<00:00:54.210> helps<00:00:54.570> to

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
so at times like that it really helps to

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.690 
so at times like that it really helps to
know<00:00:54.900> how<00:00:55.230> flour<00:00:55.740> is<00:00:55.950> measured<00:00:56.460> correctly

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
know how flour is measured correctly

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.880 
know how flour is measured correctly
there<00:00:57.420> are<00:00:57.450> broadly<00:00:57.780> two<00:00:58.050> ways<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.470> which<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
there are broadly two ways in which a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.340 
there are broadly two ways in which a
flat<00:00:59.220> can<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.550> measured<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.150> one<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
flat can be measured and one is the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.429 
flat can be measured and one is the
spoon<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.280> level<00:01:02.579> method<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:04.019> other<00:01:04.199> one

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
spoon and level method and the other one

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.810 
spoon and level method and the other one
is<00:01:04.589> called<00:01:04.829> as<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.189> dip<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.670> scoop<00:01:06.090> method<00:01:10.820> so

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
is called as the dip and scoop method so

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.319 
is called as the dip and scoop method so
this<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.960> how<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.399> measure<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:14.700> flour<00:01:14.909> using

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
this is how we measure the flour using

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.870 
this is how we measure the flour using
the<00:01:15.689> spoon<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.170> level<00:01:16.499> method<00:01:19.609> you<00:01:20.609> place

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the spoon and level method you place

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.690 
the spoon and level method you place
your<00:01:21.289> standard<00:01:22.289> measuring<00:01:22.590> cup<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.130> your<00:01:23.189> flat

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
your standard measuring cup on your flat

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.469 
your standard measuring cup on your flat
surface<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.630> your<00:01:25.229> kitchen<00:01:25.409> counter<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
surface like your kitchen counter and

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.620 
surface like your kitchen counter and
then<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:29.130> want<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.670> lightly<00:01:29.909> fluff<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
then you want to just lightly fluff the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.989 
then you want to just lightly fluff the
flour<00:01:31.289> in<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> container<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.700> really

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
flour in the container this is really

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:36.770 
flour in the container this is really
important<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.490> then<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.969> lightly

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
important and then you just lightly

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.459 
important and then you just lightly
spoon<00:01:37.319> this<00:01:37.590> flour<00:01:38.159> into<00:01:38.429> the<00:01:38.579> measuring<00:01:39.389> cup

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.980 

and<00:01:43.469> you<00:01:43.649> want<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.890> all<00:01:44.130> fill<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.990> then

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and you want to all fill this and then

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.779 
and you want to all fill this and then
take<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.270> knife<00:01:48.270> or<00:01:48.689> anything<00:01:49.429> flat<00:01:50.429> like<00:01:50.759> a

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
take a knife or anything flat like a

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.700 
take a knife or anything flat like a
scale<00:01:51.149> perhaps<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:52.289> you<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:54.469> level<00:01:55.469> it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
scale perhaps and then you just level it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.460 
scale perhaps and then you just level it
like<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.720> one<00:01:57.750> cup<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
like this so that you have one cup of

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.460 
like this so that you have one cup of
flour<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.250> now<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.509> cup<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.929> flour<00:02:01.140> will

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
flour and now this cup of flour will

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.179 
flour and now this cup of flour will
weigh<00:02:02.130> approximately<00:02:02.659> 130<00:02:03.659> grams<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.679> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
weigh approximately 130 grams so the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.169 
weigh approximately 130 grams so the
operative<00:02:05.700> word<00:02:05.909> being<00:02:06.210> approximately<00:02:07.020> so

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
operative word being approximately so

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.940 
operative word being approximately so
weighing<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.360> always<00:02:09.720> best<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.319> when<00:02:10.769> you<00:02:10.890> are

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
weighing is always best and when you are

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.360 
weighing is always best and when you are
filling<00:02:11.250> your<00:02:11.280> cup<00:02:12.239> with<00:02:12.450> flour<00:02:13.160> remember<00:02:14.160> not

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
filling your cup with flour remember not

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.030 
filling your cup with flour remember not
to<00:02:14.640> tap<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.480> against<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.930> counter<00:02:16.110> do<00:02:16.650> not<00:02:16.830> do

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
to tap it against the counter do not do

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.550 
to tap it against the counter do not do
this<00:02:17.250> as<00:02:17.519> this<00:02:18.209> will<00:02:18.420> compact<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.989> flour<00:02:19.260> and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
this as this will compact the flour and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.460 
this as this will compact the flour and
give<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.430> more<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.940> flood<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.450> each<00:02:21.690> cup<00:02:22.019> so

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
give you more of flood in each cup so

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.860 
give you more of flood in each cup so
which<00:02:22.829> is<00:02:22.980> not<00:02:23.190> what<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.489> want<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.480> do<00:02:24.750> not

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
which is not what you want so you do not

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.539 
which is not what you want so you do not
need<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.290> do<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.890> shouldn't<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.400> doing

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
need to do that you shouldn't be doing

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.360 
need to do that you shouldn't be doing
that<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.660> spoon<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.200> level<00:02:28.530> method<00:02:28.890> was<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
that the spoon and level method was the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.940 
that the spoon and level method was the
method<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:29.910> would<00:02:29.970> use<00:02:30.420> before<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.349> got<00:02:31.680> my

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
method I would use before I got my

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.390 
method I would use before I got my
weighing<00:02:32.700> scales<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.900> even<00:02:34.319> now<00:02:34.349> if<00:02:34.829> I<00:02:35.010> had<00:02:35.370> to

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
weighing scales so even now if I had to

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.479 
weighing scales so even now if I had to
bake<00:02:36.299> elsewhere<00:02:36.810> not<00:02:37.410> at<00:02:37.590> my<00:02:37.769> home<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.430> do

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
bake elsewhere not at my home and I do

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.670 
bake elsewhere not at my home and I do
not<00:02:38.700> have<00:02:38.880> paying<00:02:39.630> scales<00:02:39.989> then<00:02:40.319> this<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
not have paying scales then this is the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.250 
not have paying scales then this is the
method<00:02:40.799> I<00:02:41.040> follow

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.620 

and<00:02:46.190> then<00:02:46.430> we<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:46.819> this<00:02:47.030> other<00:02:47.270> method

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
and then we have this other method

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.990 
and then we have this other method
called<00:02:48.050> as<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.410> dip<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.860> scoop<00:02:49.010> method<00:02:49.550> are

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
called as the dip and scoop method are

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.270 
called as the dip and scoop method are
also<00:02:50.270> followed<00:02:50.750> by<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.900> lot<00:02:51.050> of<00:02:51.170> Baker's<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:52.100> the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
also followed by a lot of Baker's in the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.920 
also followed by a lot of Baker's in the
dip<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.610> scoop<00:02:52.730> method<00:02:53.240> as<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.780> name

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
dip and scoop method as the name

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.170 
dip and scoop method as the name
specifies<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:55.130> cup<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.550> directly<00:02:55.880> dipped

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
specifies the cup is directly dipped

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.440 
specifies the cup is directly dipped
into<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:57.010> container<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.190> flour<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:58.760> then<00:02:59.330> you

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
into the container of flour and then you

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.180 
into the container of flour and then you
scoop<00:02:59.840> it<00:02:59.959> up<00:03:00.110> like<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.250> then<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:03.800> level

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
scoop it up like this and then you level

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.120 
scoop it up like this and then you level
it<00:03:04.280> like<00:03:04.520> this<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:06.200> method<00:03:06.680> gives<00:03:06.709> you

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
it like this and this method gives you

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.790 
it like this and this method gives you
approximately<00:03:07.340> about<00:03:08.120> 140<00:03:08.900> grams<00:03:09.140> of<00:03:09.380> flour

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
approximately about 140 grams of flour

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.880 
approximately about 140 grams of flour
per<00:03:10.220> cup<00:03:10.600> so<00:03:11.600> as<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:11.959> can<00:03:12.080> see<00:03:12.290> there's<00:03:12.530> almost

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
per cup so as you can see there's almost

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.110 
per cup so as you can see there's almost
10<00:03:13.220> grams<00:03:13.459> more<00:03:13.850> of<00:03:14.180> flour<00:03:14.600> in<00:03:14.900> each<00:03:15.230> cup<00:03:15.530> and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
10 grams more of flour in each cup and

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.820 
10 grams more of flour in each cup and
that<00:03:17.120> would<00:03:17.390> make<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.050> difference<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.650> your

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
that would make a difference to your

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.270 
that would make a difference to your
cookies<00:03:19.820> for<00:03:20.060> your<00:03:20.360> cakes<00:03:20.950> again<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.100> would

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
cookies for your cakes again I would

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.370 
cookies for your cakes again I would
like<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.520> specify<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.060> it's<00:03:23.510> always<00:03:23.780> best<00:03:24.230> to

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
like to specify that it's always best to

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.520 
like to specify that it's always best to
away<00:03:25.190> your<00:03:25.400> ingredients<00:03:26.230> including<00:03:27.230> flour

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
away your ingredients including flour

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.190 
away your ingredients including flour
and<00:03:27.830> but<00:03:28.790> then<00:03:28.970> it's<00:03:29.239> always<00:03:29.480> good<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.930> know

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
and but then it's always good to know

all these small things which can make a

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.660 
all these small things which can make a
lot<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.510> difference<00:03:33.019> if<00:03:33.260> ever<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:34.220> need<00:03:34.430> to

lot of difference if ever you need to

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.610 
lot of difference if ever you need to
measure<00:03:35.180> your<00:03:35.360> flour<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.080> not<00:03:36.230> weigh<00:03:36.590> it
