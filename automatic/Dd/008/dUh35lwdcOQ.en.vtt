00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.820
 Hello everyone in this review, we will tell 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.290
 perhaps the most exciting home 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.129
 action on the pope of our time 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.129
 final 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.750
 There is little about the history of the game world 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.390
 known and hardly in such games 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.050
 kind of like cenaine is to have a special 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.930
 value 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.280
 one thing is for sure 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.110
 there is good and evil, and most likely 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.540
 depending on quests and branches 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.120
 development of your character in the future 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.920
 take one side or the other on the basis of 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.180
 this we will try to talk about the look 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.180
 as we see it ourselves 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.640
 the company and our games spent about 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.250
 three years to develop shinai and they have 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.430
 came out truly a masterpiece in the world of online gaming 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.230
 cenaine has awesome graphics 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.030
 distinguished by its system and non-linear 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.380
 storyline own game engine 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.020
 strikes with colorful battle scenes 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.190
 years on the environment after all the development 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.500
 The best 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.500
 to get bored just do not have to 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.850
 breaking all stereotypes m arpg cenaine 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.549
 choose a race is not available 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.920
 possible cancer for 1 korean 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.780
 but there is a very impressive editor 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.570
 characters that kind of big 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.079
 A rarity to choose from is given 4 classes 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.880
 fighter hunter shaman and witch and then it was worth 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.420
 would decide which class is closer to you 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.030
 Total 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.700
 so how unique is every shinai on 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.009
 first place if you're in a game of this kind 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.140
 for the first time you will be somewhat difficult 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:53.479
 master the skills and abilities of the hero from 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:55.009
 of whom cenaine is unknown to you 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.340
 is another representative 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.709
 fighting system but he is so battle 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.990
 go in the style of standard fighting games and 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.670
 slasher need to aim and water 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.479
 a series of crushing enemies 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.399
 combo attacks 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.170
 One of the chips of the game is 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.329
 possibility of using some 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.970
 improvised items scared by monsters 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:16.090
 For example, you can throw a box or a stone 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.190
 lying on the ground right by your enemy 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.140
 the living system is astounding sensation 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.510
 full control over the character run 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.859
 straight goose bumps to deal with 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.780
 the game in the initial stages 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.859
 you just need to press on the keyboard from 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.870
 three to five buttons 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.959
 and of course the book class in mode 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.959
 non-stop 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.600
 however, as your character grows 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.680
 will have to master more complex 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.470
 button combinations 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.180
 for example if you were beaten in this 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.110
 case with a simple combination 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.690
 keys 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.880
 your character will be able to the newest people even 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.890
 wallowing on the ground 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.260
 one thing drench monsters instances 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.720
 another thing is pizza with real players and 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.450
 it just plays a huge role your 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.620
 straight hand if you are not capable 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.320
 respond promptly to this or that 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.700
 the action of the enemy in pvp mode you 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.010
 will be very hard 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.000
 for pvp is one of the highlights 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.000
 shinai 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.490
 variety of tactics opportunity 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.430
 performing a deadly flop with a kick 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.920
 such jumps on the ground and drive 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.430
 group duel that's all there is 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.430
 action packed 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.750
 actually the final provided 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.550
 many positive emotions as soon as 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.670
 You will be taken to the next instant the 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.620
 comprehension 10 or 15 minutes 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.690
 you can't get off the monitor a 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.640
 watch the colorful special effects 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.530
 the whorls of your hero and the horn 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.830
 defeated corpse delivers a lot 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.830
 pleasures 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.379
 the arsenal chart is worth a separate 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:09.620
 attention thanks to the graphics engine 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.260
 mode 1 we will observe quite 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.329
 worthy and colorful one more 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.850
 nice moment is helping everyone 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.190
 players including beginners for example 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.410
 navigation path just click on the name 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.930
 denominations and before you there will be a chain 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.650
 red arrows go for them and you are definitely not 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.660
 will lose 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.940
 during battles dungeon all 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.039
 there are practically also arrows and 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.910
 the yellow dots on the minimap will lead you to 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.910
 Right place 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.670
 finally we want to say that cenaine 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.320
 real worthy of your attention 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.390
 After looking at the review, you will say yes to 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.360
 so we all saw it in the dragon nest and 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.580
 vindictus but kenneth xiannan at all 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.040
 another game is the only thing that connects 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.710
 these games are instances of the system 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.960
 non-target and again as they say 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.910
 itâ€™s better to break the skull once 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.470
 personally than to watch a thousand 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.470
 dare reviews
