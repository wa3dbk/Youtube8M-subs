when<00:00:54.300> you're<00:00:54.420> good<00:00:54.510> being<00:00:54.719> bored<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.110> all

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
when you're good being bored and do all

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.950 
when you're good being bored and do all
that<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:58.230> some<00:00:58.530> other<00:00:58.739> trucks<00:00:59.960> like

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that and this for some other trucks like

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.630 
that and this for some other trucks like
I<00:01:01.199> think<00:01:01.469> crux<00:01:01.739> does<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.579> just

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
I think crux does it that it's not just

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.570 
I think crux does it that it's not just
a<00:01:02.910> standard<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.619> kingpin<00:01:04.619> bull<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.250> actually
