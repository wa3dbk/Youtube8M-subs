00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.910
 good two questions the first one is easy 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.490
 how are you and the second I imagine that 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.990
 what has happened in the race 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.700
 what you have cut the championship is 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.629
 I miss seeing the luck you've 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.820
 had in that accident if I'm well a 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.880
 little pain in the back for that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.610
 they took to the medical center to do 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.770
 some checkup but hey, he had nothing 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:31.460
 bad is just a pain of the blow itself 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.830
 and nothing more after the race like you 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.110
 you say regardless of the result 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.489
 what would have been later on seeing the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.770
 images because you can not spend 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.960
 car by the head not by the hands or 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.390
 something and it would have been much worse because 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.150
 we were spinning at that moment so 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.460
 good in the bad luck of the 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.739
 I abandon the good luck of being inside 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.739
 of five days in the car rides 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.760
 good is prompt in the sight of 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.320
 recent obviously that yes it has 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.670
 gone through the head after all 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.869
 this once you are calm 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.040
 after the same thing nothing was known 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.630
 very well what had happened when 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.810
 I was in the medical center coming in 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.090
 the bike to here so expect to see it 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.770
 on TV to see exactly who 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.890
 who had passed behind not why 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.619
 it had been a strong blow and it seems 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.780
 difficult to imagine how he had come to 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.960
 someone seemed unchecked because 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.340
 it seemed like bowling so 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.490
 well then after watching the replay 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.850
 I saw that they played golds gianni and hamilton 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.539
 and they did not have a chance to stop 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.209
 surely seeing the images had 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.530
 Good luck because nothing happens to you 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:46.140
 a few centimeters you think that security 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.390
 of the cars is appropriate or up to 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.620
 that something really serious does not happen 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.320
 will change 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.060
 I think that what was adequate is more 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.550
 It is better than what everyone 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.130
 he imagines not since good even with 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.650
 with large accidents never happens 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.740
 nothing and the car I think it is 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.330
 in that sense perfectly not 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.390
 find security what you have to 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.340
 change is a bit the way to do 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.860
 the outputs of 12 outputs I think in 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.660
 seven euros has not been touched and it is a 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.910
 too high percentage is not a little 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.030
 the culture of gp2 we have also seen 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.940
 here in gp2 and in the gp3 accidents 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.310
 strong and all the guys who are 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.980
 coming from those categories they have 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.660
 is this trend if fernando now the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.700
 championship in the second of vettel and 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.050
 everything does not fit a little bit more because 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.510
 it said 124 points 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.730
 and now change your season a bit or 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.680
 you go to monza and singapore if it's what 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.620
 same as the same thing you had in mind 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.510
 Exactly the same thing I think it has not 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.690
 changed nothing they follow are still 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.790
 rivals all very strong right now 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.210
 I think the car or the best car is the 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.520
 mclaren therefore have second to vettel 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.090
 it worries like that but it worries a little less 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.120
 and good 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.849
 our mistakes or team mistakes 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.050
 piloting reliability we continue without 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.569
 have therefore I think that in these 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.860
 last eight races that are missing this 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.490
 Once it has touched us poor 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.980
 luck 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.510
 and from here to the end vettel or our 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.770
 rivals are not going to end 8 does not 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.880
 therefore what we have lost today what 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.370
 we will surely win in the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.350
 next fernando said this week that 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.150
 I was very excited to match and even 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.190
 surpass michael's record that at 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.320
 final has stayed there for her the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.720
 accident happened if if you get a little 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.430
 of grief and yesterday on twitter put in 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.810
 reference to gp2 and the gp3 to the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.670
 accidents that we had that had bad 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.170
 sensations 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.550
 a sensation but there were accidents 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.069
 strong pilots went 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.730
 circuit we did not have much information 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.830
 today also in gp2 asia they threw it out to 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.130
 the grass on top of Russian and it's going to 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.840
 stay perpendicular on the asphalt 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.610
 someone would have gone through it 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.560
 half so therefore a weekend a 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.080
 little weird as to find that 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.410
 sense in terms of behavior 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:12.459
 our own from the pilots and good 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.470
 it has been like that the record surely 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.310
 Yes, it is exciting because it is something 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.980
 of reliability a thing of consistency 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.109
 we have 35 grand prizes of 36 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.710
 finished just because of the accident with 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.180
 button this time it has been this this 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.840
 fact that the departure that we have 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.820
 rammed but good we will try to follow 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.820
 in the next 24 try to get
