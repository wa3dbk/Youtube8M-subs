00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
safety if we're to I look especially we

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.040 
safety if we're to I look especially we
really<00:00:39.700> only<00:00:39.760> get<00:00:39.910> that<00:00:40.060> safety<00:00:40.390> jumping<00:00:40.900> down

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
really only get that safety jumping down

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.890 
really only get that safety jumping down
over<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.040> route<00:00:42.520> right<00:00:42.730> there<00:00:43.000> and<00:00:43.810> then

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
over that route right there and then

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.729 
over that route right there and then
we're<00:00:44.020> going<00:00:44.110> to<00:00:44.170> break<00:00:44.350> it<00:00:44.470> off<00:00:44.560> to<00:00:44.710> the

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739
