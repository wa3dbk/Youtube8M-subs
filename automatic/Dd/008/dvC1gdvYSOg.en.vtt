we<00:00:51.170> have<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.530> complete<00:00:52.010> all<00:00:52.310> the<00:00:52.580> petals<00:00:53.530> by

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
we have to complete all the petals by

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:03.360 
we have to complete all the petals by
filling<00:00:55.010> with<00:00:55.330> these<00:00:56.980> loops<00:01:01.780> only<00:01:02.780> thing<00:01:03.050> is

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
filling with these loops only thing is

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.920 
filling with these loops only thing is
again<00:01:04.370> I<00:01:04.400> would<00:01:04.670> like<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:05.030> say<00:01:05.270> this<00:01:05.650> patients

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
again I would like to say this patients

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.240 
again I would like to say this patients
actually<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:09.530> complete<00:01:10.010> these<00:01:10.310> three<00:01:10.700> petals

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
actually to complete these three petals

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.840 
actually to complete these three petals
it<00:01:13.250> took<00:01:13.460> three<00:01:13.790> days<00:01:14.170> I<00:01:15.170> spent<00:01:16.100> nearly<00:01:16.370> maybe

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
it took three days I spent nearly maybe

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.370 
it took three days I spent nearly maybe
one<00:01:17.660> hour<00:01:17.960> for<00:01:18.290> a<00:01:19.479> petal<00:01:20.479> I'm<00:01:20.660> not<00:01:20.840> really<00:01:21.020> sure

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
one hour for a petal I'm not really sure

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.230 
one hour for a petal I'm not really sure
of<00:01:21.410> fight<00:01:22.130> iguana<00:01:23.680> sort<00:01:24.680> of<00:01:24.800> maybe<00:01:25.670> one<00:01:25.970> art

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
of fight iguana sort of maybe one art

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:35.069 
of fight iguana sort of maybe one art
are<00:01:26.479> better

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.580 

once<00:01:35.680> you<00:01:35.920> get<00:01:36.130> how<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.460> make<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.359> loop<00:01:37.600> it's

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
once you get how to make the loop it's

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.630 
once you get how to make the loop it's
not<00:01:38.890> that<00:01:39.130> difficult<00:01:41.369> making<00:01:42.369> Lupus<00:01:43.289> easier

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
not that difficult making Lupus easier

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.029 
not that difficult making Lupus easier
like<00:01:45.640> only<00:01:46.090> mixing<00:01:47.049> of<00:01:47.200> colors<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.710> takes

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
like only mixing of colors that takes

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.899 
like only mixing of colors that takes
really<00:01:51.429> some<00:01:52.060> time<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:54.130> mix<00:01:54.399> some<00:01:54.490> color

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
really some time like you mix some color

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.059 
really some time like you mix some color
then<00:01:55.420> wipe<00:01:55.659> your<00:01:55.929> hand<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.709> again<00:01:56.890> some<00:01:57.459> color

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
then wipe your hand and again some color

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.090 
then wipe your hand and again some color
that<00:02:00.069> takes<00:02:00.399> time<00:02:01.140> we<00:02:02.140> can<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.590> loop<00:02:02.799> doesn't

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
that takes time we can the loop doesn't

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.539 
that takes time we can the loop doesn't
take<00:02:03.490> much<00:02:03.759> time<00:02:04.090> once<00:02:04.450> you<00:02:04.630> get<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:05.530> know<00:02:05.709> the

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
take much time once you get to know the

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.430 
take much time once you get to know the
method<00:02:07.030> right<00:02:07.270> Miguel<00:02:07.810> now<00:02:08.110> we<00:02:08.170> have

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
method right Miguel now we have

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.460 
method right Miguel now we have
completed<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.310> flower<00:02:09.750> let's<00:02:10.750> start<00:02:11.140> doing

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
completed the flower let's start doing

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.630 
completed the flower let's start doing
the<00:02:11.680> leaves<00:02:12.510> we<00:02:13.510> are<00:02:13.569> going<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.930> use<00:02:14.640> evening

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
the leaves we are going to use evening

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.550 
the leaves we are going to use evening
for<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:18.640> looks<00:02:18.940> very<00:02:19.690> much<00:02:19.959> like<00:02:20.019> our

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
for this it looks very much like our

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:30.040 
for this it looks very much like our
ordinary<00:02:21.220> pen<00:02:21.579> nib<00:02:22.079> take<00:02:23.079> a<00:02:23.110> brush

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.540 

until<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.100> little<00:02:31.850> bit<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.320> green

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550

but trying to have the paint are thick

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.449 
but trying to have the paint are thick
enough<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:53.569> you<00:02:54.569> give<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.810> very<00:02:55.109> good<00:02:55.459> rain

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459
