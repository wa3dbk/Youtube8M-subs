it'll start up and run any better than I
did<00:01:05.519> before<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:07.100> before<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> would<00:01:08.369> hardly

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
did before so before it would hardly

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.570 
did before so before it would hardly
stay<00:01:08.970> running<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.450> also<00:01:10.010> basically<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.400> can

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
stay running it also basically if I can

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.510
