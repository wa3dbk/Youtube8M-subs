from behind so that's what we're going

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:36.440 
from behind so that's what we're going
to<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.640> today<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:35.000> you<00:00:36.000> need<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.239> keep<00:00:36.390> your

leg<00:00:36.840> obviously<00:00:37.469> at<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.829> 90<00:00:38.190> degree<00:00:38.309> angle<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
leg obviously at the 90 degree angle and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.520 
leg obviously at the 90 degree angle and
you<00:00:39.149> want<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.420> pushing<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.930> your<00:00:40.079> heel<00:00:40.350> and

you want to be pushing to your heel and
really<00:00:41.489> really<00:00:41.820> squeezing<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.540> come<00:00:42.750> up

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
really really squeezing as you come up

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.360 
really really squeezing as you come up
and<00:00:43.050> controlling<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.739> movement<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.160> whole

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and controlling the movement the whole

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:56.930 
and controlling the movement the whole
time

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.810 

this<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.840> really<00:00:58.350> amazing<00:00:58.680> isolating<00:00:59.640> those

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
this is really amazing isolating those

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.880 
this is really amazing isolating those
of<00:01:00.059> those<00:01:00.210> hamstrings<00:01:06.020> but<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.110> do<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.409> nice<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
of those hamstrings but I do is nice and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.070 
of those hamstrings but I do is nice and
slow<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.610> controlled<00:01:08.759> and<00:01:09.420> when<00:01:09.630> I'm<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
slow and controlled and when I'm at the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.170 
slow and controlled and when I'm at the
top<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.650> movement<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.580> hold<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
top of the movement that hold it for a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.999 
top of the movement that hold it for a
couple<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.450> seconds<00:01:12.960> before<00:01:13.140> releasing<00:01:13.649> back

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
couple of seconds before releasing back

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.219 
couple of seconds before releasing back
down<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.940> requires<00:01:15.360> maybe<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.899> have<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> bit

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
down this requires maybe to have a bit

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.190 
down this requires maybe to have a bit
of<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.380> lighter<00:01:16.619> weight<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.990> instead<00:01:18.990> even

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
of a lighter weight and instead even

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.680 
of a lighter weight and instead even
though<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.920> ration<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.420> flash<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
though but the ration it flash in the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.600 
though but the ration it flash in the
movement<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.440> requires<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.950> lighter<00:01:23.220> weight

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
movement it requires a lighter weight

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.700 
movement it requires a lighter weight
but<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.479> selects<00:01:24.869> those<00:01:25.049> muscles<00:01:25.500> better

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
but if I selects those muscles better

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:35.590 
but if I selects those muscles better
their<00:01:25.979> coursework

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.560 

these<00:01:36.170> are<00:01:36.560> amazing<00:01:37.189> we'll<00:01:37.729> get<00:01:37.850> in<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.330> glute

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
these are amazing we'll get in the glute

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.609 
these are amazing we'll get in the glute
and<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.560> hamstring<00:01:39.650> tie<00:01:40.580> in<00:01:40.640> which<00:01:41.330> is<00:01:41.619> you're

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
and the hamstring tie in which is you're

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.010 
and the hamstring tie in which is you're
the<00:01:43.159> kind<00:01:43.490> of<00:01:43.580> wider<00:01:43.850> than<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.150> normal<00:01:44.270> squat<00:01:44.720> so

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
the kind of wider than a normal squat so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.980 
the kind of wider than a normal squat so
the<00:01:45.110> wider<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:45.710> angle<00:01:46.070> your<00:01:46.220> feet<00:01:46.400> out

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
the wider and you angle your feet out

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.810 
the wider and you angle your feet out
and<00:01:47.990> on<00:01:48.140> these<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.770> come<00:01:48.950> as<00:01:49.100> low<00:01:49.340> as<00:01:49.399> you<00:01:49.610> can

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
and on these you come as low as you can

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.060 
and on these you come as low as you can
with<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.060> quite<00:01:50.570> heavy<00:01:50.840> dumbbell<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.890> then

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
with a quite heavy dumbbell and then

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.460 
with a quite heavy dumbbell and then
when<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:52.310> come<00:01:52.490> back<00:01:52.549> up<00:01:53.030> really<00:01:53.840> squeeze<00:01:54.170> an

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
when you come back up really squeeze an

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.109 
when you come back up really squeeze an
efficient<00:01:54.890> hits<00:01:55.100> board<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.549> squeezing<00:01:56.000> those

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
efficient hits board and squeezing those

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:03.649 
efficient hits board and squeezing those
boots<00:01:56.420> again<00:01:56.570> at<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.869> top<00:01:57.049> of<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.229> movement

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.040 

with<00:02:04.659> this<00:02:04.869> spot<00:02:05.200> as<00:02:05.380> well<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:06.270> again<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.630> the

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
with this spot as well and again the the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.540 
with this spot as well and again the the
weight<00:02:08.259> i'm<00:02:08.500> going<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.770> use<00:02:08.920> is<00:02:09.130> slightly

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
weight i'm going to use is slightly

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.850 
weight i'm going to use is slightly
lighter<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.539> then<00:02:10.989> this<00:02:11.110> is<00:02:11.319> so<00:02:11.470> i<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:11.590> go

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
lighter and then this is so i can go

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.610 
lighter and then this is so i can go
deeper<00:02:12.370> with<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.610> movement<00:02:12.970> as<00:02:13.330> well<00:02:13.620> to

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
deeper with that movement as well to

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.530 
deeper with that movement as well to
really<00:02:14.890> feel<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.190> glutes<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.790> hamstrings<00:02:16.300> a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
really feel the glutes and hamstrings a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.420 
really feel the glutes and hamstrings a
lot<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.810> people<00:02:16.959> they<00:02:17.230> think<00:02:17.260> well<00:02:17.680> i<00:02:17.950> can

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
lot of people they think well i can

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.190 
lot of people they think well i can
squat<00:02:18.670> hundred<00:02:19.000> kilos<00:02:19.330> but<00:02:19.599> actually<00:02:19.900> they're

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
squat hundred kilos but actually they're

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.380 
squat hundred kilos but actually they're
not<00:02:20.290> going<00:02:20.500> down<00:02:20.830> as<00:02:21.580> low<00:02:21.790> as<00:02:21.910> they<00:02:22.030> could<00:02:22.060> be

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
not going down as low as they could be

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.089 
not going down as low as they could be
they<00:02:22.660> just<00:02:22.840> took<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.080> weight<00:02:23.349> off<00:02:23.380> like<00:02:23.890> this

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
they just took the weight off like this

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.680 
they just took the weight off like this
and<00:02:24.550> weight<00:02:24.730> lower<00:02:24.940> they<00:02:25.150> would<00:02:25.269> get<00:02:25.420> much

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
and weight lower they would get much

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:38.220 
and weight lower they would get much
more<00:02:25.930> out<00:02:36.299> so<00:02:37.299> this<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.480> your<00:02:37.720> standard

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
more out so this is your standard
