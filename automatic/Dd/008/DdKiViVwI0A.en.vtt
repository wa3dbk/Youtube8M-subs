00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
flick it up there as you can see over

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.650

the<00:02:32.130> defender<00:02:32.550> Quetta<00:02:32.850> Shura<00:02:32.970> away<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.420> week

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
the defender Quetta Shura away this week

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.449 
the defender Quetta Shura away this week
foot<00:02:33.900> once<00:02:34.140> again<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.440> school<00:02:34.709> keepers<00:02:35.040> save<00:02:35.250> it

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
foot once again a school keepers save it

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.699 
foot once again a school keepers save it
and<00:02:35.580> then<00:02:36.120> just<00:02:36.150> look<00:02:36.510> at<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.050> many<00:02:37.319> shots

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
and then just look at this so many shots

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.710 
and then just look at this so many shots
on-target<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.340> his<00:02:38.610> goalkeeper<00:02:39.180> pretty<00:02:39.540> much

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
on-target but his goalkeeper pretty much

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.110 
on-target but his goalkeeper pretty much
saved<00:02:39.989> every<00:02:40.500> single<00:02:40.530> shot<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.430> yeah<00:02:41.850> probably

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
saved every single shot so yeah probably

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.250 
saved every single shot so yeah probably
you<00:02:42.269> probably<00:02:42.330> should<00:02:42.750> have<00:02:42.840> scored<00:02:43.080> there

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
you probably should have scored there

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.199 
you probably should have scored there
but<00:02:43.739> then<00:02:43.860> just<00:02:44.160> before<00:02:44.310> half-time<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
but then just before half-time it's the

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.090 
but then just before half-time it's the
pie<00:02:45.390> once<00:02:45.720> again<00:02:45.989> with<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> chip<00:02:46.500> shot<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.950> make

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
very good tackle there as you can see

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.660 
very good tackle there as you can see
then<00:03:07.230> he<00:03:07.290> goes<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.650> counter-attack<00:03:08.010> we'd

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
then he goes on the counter-attack we'd

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.250 
then he goes on the counter-attack we'd
burn<00:03:08.819> off<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.090> place<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.480> off<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.600> Remy<00:03:09.959> who<00:03:10.110> was

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
burn off a place it off to Remy who was

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.199 
burn off a place it off to Remy who was
completely<00:03:10.799> free<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:11.100> then<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.790> happened

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
completely free and then this happened

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.330 
completely free and then this happened
he<00:03:12.360> lost<00:03:12.750> his<00:03:12.930> connection<00:03:13.410> at<00:03:13.530> least<00:03:13.739> that's

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
he lost his connection at least that's

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.890 
he lost his connection at least that's
what<00:03:14.489> I'm<00:03:14.610> thinking<00:03:15.000> because<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.420> game<00:03:15.660> was<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
what I'm thinking because the game was a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.570 
what I'm thinking because the game was a
little<00:03:16.350> bit<00:03:16.440> leggy<00:03:16.650> at<00:03:16.830> times<00:03:17.040> as<00:03:17.220> well<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.549> I

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
little bit leggy at times as well so I

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.699 
little bit leggy at times as well so I
think<00:03:17.700> he<00:03:17.970> lost<00:03:18.090> his<00:03:18.269> connection<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.320> um<00:03:19.530> yeah

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
think he lost his connection so um yeah

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.680 
think he lost his connection so um yeah
we<00:03:19.859> won<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.070> game<00:03:20.340> with<00:03:20.640> two<00:03:20.970> nil<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.420> we

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
we won that game with two nil and we

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.449 
we won that game with two nil and we
pick<00:03:21.840> up<00:03:21.959> our<00:03:22.049> first<00:03:22.320> rage<00:03:22.590> quit<00:03:22.799> basically<00:03:23.280> so

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
pick up our first rage quit basically so

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.039 
pick up our first rage quit basically so
we<00:03:23.579> go<00:03:23.700> into<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.970> third<00:03:24.209> game<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.690> episode

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
we go into the third game of the episode

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.660 
we go into the third game of the episode
and<00:03:25.230> once<00:03:25.829> again<00:03:25.980> we<00:03:26.220> come<00:03:26.310> up<00:03:26.400> against

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
and once again we come up against

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.430 
and once again we come up against
another<00:03:26.730> skill<00:03:27.450> team<00:03:27.690> as<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.959> can<00:03:28.079> see<00:03:28.260> that

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
another skill team as you can see that

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.229 
another skill team as you can see that
would<00:03:28.560> feel<00:03:28.769> Martinez<00:03:29.310> as<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.579> left<00:03:29.820> wing<00:03:30.030> and

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
would feel Martinez as the left wing and

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.479 
would feel Martinez as the left wing and
nany<00:03:30.540> as<00:03:30.780> his<00:03:30.930> right<00:03:31.170> wing<00:03:31.470> at<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.739> 25<00:03:32.190> starts

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
nany as his right wing at the 25 starts

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.680 
nany as his right wing at the 25 starts
killers<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.030> now<00:03:33.120> we<00:03:33.209> get<00:03:33.329> things<00:03:33.450> all<00:03:33.660> over

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
killers and now we get things all over

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.229 
killers and now we get things all over
with<00:03:34.049> Quincy<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:35.010> 32nd<00:03:35.820> minute<00:03:35.910> where<00:03:36.150> we

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
with Quincy in the 32nd minute where we

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.849 
with Quincy in the 32nd minute where we
tried<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.600> cut<00:03:36.810> inside<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.200> box<00:03:37.350> but<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.560> very

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
tried to cut inside the box but a very

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.800 
tried to cut inside the box but a very
very<00:03:38.130> good<00:03:38.310> tackler<00:03:38.700> from<00:03:38.970> my<00:03:39.150> opponent<00:03:39.750> and

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
very good tackler from my opponent and

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.660 
very good tackler from my opponent and
that<00:03:40.530> was<00:03:40.650> pretty<00:03:40.769> much<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.010> first<00:03:41.130> off<00:03:41.519> as

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
that was pretty much the first off as

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.069 
that was pretty much the first off as
you<00:03:41.760> can<00:03:41.880> see<00:03:42.060> we<00:03:42.299> didn't<00:03:42.540> really<00:03:42.630> create<00:03:42.870> that

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
you can see we didn't really create that

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.410 
you can see we didn't really create that
many<00:03:43.500> many<00:03:43.890> chances<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.549> my<00:03:44.640> opponent<00:03:45.090> at<00:03:45.180> 0

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
many many chances and my opponent at 0

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.970
