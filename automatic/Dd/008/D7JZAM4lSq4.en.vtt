00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
second half scoreless it would make

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.220 
second half scoreless it would make
sense<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:45.120> defender<00:00:45.690> would<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.079> help

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
sense that a defender would just help

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.080 
sense that a defender would just help
decide<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.550> looks<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.789> that's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
decide this one and it looks like that's

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.150 
decide this one and it looks like that's
gonna<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> case<00:00:48.809> here<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.320> sophomore
