Wright movie I would say it's a an Edgar
Wright<00:02:28.739> genre<00:02:29.250> film<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.670> camera<00:02:29.880> movements

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
Wright genre film the camera movements

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.910 
Wright genre film the camera movements
and<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.599> cinematography<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.709> very

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
and the cinematography it if it very

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.040 
and the cinematography it if it very
much<00:02:32.160> felt<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:33.300> kind<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.599> movie<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:33.989> if

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
much felt like that kind of movie so if

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.510 
much felt like that kind of movie so if
you<00:02:34.170> like<00:02:34.349> Shaun<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.770> Dead<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.340> like

you like Shaun of the Dead you like

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.430 
you like Shaun of the Dead you like
Scott<00:02:36.000> Pilgrim<00:02:36.209> you'll<00:02:36.660> probably<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.260> this

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
Scott Pilgrim you'll probably like this

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.899 
Scott Pilgrim you'll probably like this
too<00:02:37.680> but<00:02:37.920> it's<00:02:38.069> different<00:02:38.310> enough<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.819> if

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
too but it's different enough that if

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.459

you're<00:02:39.120> not<00:02:39.150> into<00:02:39.599> Edgar<00:02:39.870> Wright<00:02:40.019> movies<00:02:40.349> I

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
you're not into Edgar Wright movies I

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:41.839 
you're not into Edgar Wright movies I
think<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.709> might<00:02:40.860> still<00:02:41.040> very<00:02:41.340> much<00:02:41.519> enjoy

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
attack the block I love that they took

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.930 
attack the block I love that they took
the<00:02:44.490> classic<00:02:45.050> sci-fi<00:02:46.070> alien<00:02:47.070> space<00:02:47.430> invaders

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
the classic sci-fi alien space invaders

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.770 
the classic sci-fi alien space invaders
and<00:02:48.240> then<00:02:48.840> they<00:02:48.960> threw<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:50.310> like<00:02:50.850> London

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
and then they threw in the like London

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.670 
and then they threw in the like London
Street<00:02:52.140> thugs

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
Street thugs

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.800 
Street thugs
I<00:02:52.770> also<00:02:52.950> like<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.250> realism<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.240> thought

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
I also like the realism of it I thought

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.930 
I also like the realism of it I thought
that<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.680> probably<00:02:56.040> more<00:02:56.220> likely<00:02:56.460> how<00:02:56.700> an

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
that this is probably more likely how an

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.370 
that this is probably more likely how an
alien<00:02:57.090> invasion<00:02:57.540> would<00:02:57.780> happen<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.290> it

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
alien invasion would happen that it

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.750 
alien invasion would happen that it
would<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.590> be<00:02:58.770> like<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.950> rumor<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.490> people

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
would just be like a rumor and people

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.070 
would just be like a rumor and people
wouldn't<00:02:59.970> believe<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.630> there'd<00:03:01.020> be

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
wouldn't believe you and there'd be

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.320 
wouldn't believe you and there'd be
confusion<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.920> because<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.370> know<00:03:02.460> usually

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
confusion and because you know usually

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.250 
confusion and because you know usually
in<00:03:03.420> movies<00:03:03.720> there's<00:03:03.900> like<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.050> big

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
in movies there's like a big

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.990 
in movies there's like a big
announcement<00:03:04.710> on<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.160> news<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.760> everyone

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
announcement on the news and everyone

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.030 
announcement on the news and everyone
can<00:03:06.120> brace<00:03:06.360> themselves<00:03:06.660> but<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:07.710> was<00:03:07.860> done

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
can brace themselves but this was done

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.410 
can brace themselves but this was done
it<00:03:08.250> was<00:03:08.340> very<00:03:08.580> cool<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.000> way<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.090> was<00:03:09.270> done

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
it was very cool the way it was done

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.860 
it was very cool the way it was done
there<00:03:09.660> no<00:03:09.780> just<00:03:10.020> random<00:03:10.680> side<00:03:10.890> plots<00:03:11.280> or<00:03:11.870> just

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
there no just random side plots or just

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.870 
there no just random side plots or just
scenes<00:03:13.830> that<00:03:14.010> don't<00:03:14.190> make<00:03:14.310> any<00:03:14.370> sense

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
scenes that don't make any sense

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.490 
scenes that don't make any sense
everything<00:03:15.270> is<00:03:15.420> very<00:03:15.630> straight<00:03:15.930> forward<00:03:15.960> it

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
everything is very straight forward it

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.770 
everything is very straight forward it
has<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.680> purpose<00:03:17.220> it's<00:03:17.730> very<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.210> point<00:03:18.330> and

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
has a purpose it's very to the point and

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.600 
has a purpose it's very to the point and
the<00:03:19.170> pacing<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.680> very<00:03:19.890> good<00:03:20.160> nobody<00:03:20.520> give

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
the pacing is very good nobody give

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.160 
the pacing is very good nobody give
anything<00:03:20.790> away<00:03:20.910> but<00:03:21.060> I'm<00:03:21.420> not<00:03:21.660> quite<00:03:21.900> sure<00:03:21.930> how

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
anything away but I'm not quite sure how

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.390 
anything away but I'm not quite sure how
I<00:03:22.200> still<00:03:22.500> feel<00:03:22.650> about<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.920> ending<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.310> was

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
I still feel about the ending it was

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.730 
I still feel about the ending it was
kind<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.610> ambiguous<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.900> right<00:03:25.320> you're<00:03:25.470> right

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
kind of ambiguous so right you're right

about the ending I thought that the

about the ending I thought that the
special<00:03:28.560> effects<00:03:28.740> were<00:03:28.860> definitely<00:03:29.190> really

I<00:03:42.780> love<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.140> creature<00:03:43.380> design<00:03:43.830> I<00:03:44.100> thought

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
I love the creature design I thought

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.980 
I love the creature design I thought
that<00:03:44.520> was<00:03:44.610> really<00:03:44.790> cool<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.420> way<00:03:45.510> they<00:03:45.690> had<00:03:45.870> it

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
that was really cool the way they had it

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.530 
that was really cool the way they had it
all<00:03:46.110> thought<00:03:46.140> out<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.830> just<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.580> design<00:03:48.360> of

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
all thought out and just the design of

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.030 
all thought out and just the design of
it<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.810> saw<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.380> trailer<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.739> thought<00:03:49.950> it

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
it I saw it in the trailer I thought it

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.320 
it I saw it in the trailer I thought it
was<00:03:50.130> kind<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.400> stupid<00:03:50.730> but<00:03:50.850> actually<00:03:51.180> seeing

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
was kind of stupid but actually seeing

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.060 
was kind of stupid but actually seeing
it<00:03:51.480> in<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.630> movie<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.470> was<00:03:52.620> really<00:03:52.830> nice

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
it in the movie it was really nice

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.070 
it in the movie it was really nice
suspense<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> movie<00:03:54.390> was<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:54.720> well<00:03:54.900> done

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
suspense in the movie was so well done

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.470 
suspense in the movie was so well done
it<00:03:55.230> was<00:03:55.320> genuinely<00:03:55.800> scary<00:03:56.250> using<00:03:57.060> like<00:03:57.239> just

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
it was genuinely scary using like just

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.140 
it was genuinely scary using like just
things<00:03:57.690> like<00:03:57.840> smoke<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.850> darkness<00:03:59.850> and

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
things like smoke and darkness and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.030 
things like smoke and darkness and
lights<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:00.660> mean<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:00.989> they<00:04:01.200> use<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.440> building

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
lights I mean and they use that building

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.280 
lights I mean and they use that building
so<00:04:02.340> well<00:04:02.910> they<00:04:03.180> use<00:04:03.390> like<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.810> projects

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
so well they use like the projects

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.660 
so well they use like the projects
building<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:04.709> this<00:04:04.830> whole<00:04:05.190> story<00:04:05.310> takes

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
building that this whole story takes

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.580 
building that this whole story takes
place<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:06.090> in<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.239> in<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.600> environment<00:04:06.630> like

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
place in in the in the environment like

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.110 
place in in the in the environment like
really<00:04:08.130> well<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.550> don't<00:04:08.700> know<00:04:08.760> if<00:04:08.880> it's<00:04:08.970> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
really well I don't know if it's the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.300 
really well I don't know if it's the
kind<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.420> movie<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:09.750> would<00:04:09.959> get<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.130> same

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
kind of movie you would get the same

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.150 
kind of movie you would get the same
scare<00:04:11.760> from<00:04:12.209> watching<00:04:12.660> on<00:04:12.750> TV<00:04:12.959> but<00:04:13.950> it

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
scare from watching on TV but it

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.400 
scare from watching on TV but it
definitely<00:04:14.400> that's<00:04:15.030> one<00:04:15.330> thing<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.080> go<00:04:16.200> see

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
definitely that's one thing to go see

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.199 
definitely that's one thing to go see
for<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.100> theater<00:04:17.400> so<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.669> big<00:04:17.880> thing<00:04:18.090> in

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
for the theater so a big thing in

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.550 
for the theater so a big thing in
Hollywood<00:04:18.630> right<00:04:18.660> now<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:19.140> that<00:04:19.260> there<00:04:19.380> aren't

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
Hollywood right now is that there aren't

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.510 
Hollywood right now is that there aren't
a<00:04:19.650> lot<00:04:19.680> of<00:04:19.799> great<00:04:20.100> roles<00:04:20.989> diverse<00:04:21.989> roles<00:04:22.520> for

a lot of great roles diverse roles for
african-americans<00:04:24.480> for<00:04:25.050> women<00:04:25.710> for

african-americans for women for
everybody<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.430> think<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:26.880> that's<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.390> big

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
everybody I think that that's a big

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.360 
everybody I think that that's a big
problem<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.470> think<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:28.800> this<00:04:29.040> movie<00:04:29.340> was

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
problem and I think that this movie was

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.100 
problem and I think that this movie was
very<00:04:29.669> cool<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.120> all<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.419> roles<00:04:30.630> were<00:04:30.840> very

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
very cool that all the roles were very

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.720 
very cool that all the roles were very
well<00:04:31.350> done<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.650> very<00:04:31.770> well<00:04:32.040> realized<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.700> think

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
well done and very well realized I think

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.580 
well done and very well realized I think
this<00:04:32.940> was<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.090> great<00:04:33.270> opportunity<00:04:34.020> for<00:04:34.230> the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
this was a great opportunity for the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.200 
this was a great opportunity for the
actors<00:04:34.950> involved<00:04:35.250> in<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.520> project<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.150> thought

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
actors involved in the project I thought

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.050 
actors involved in the project I thought
the<00:04:36.360> acting<00:04:36.720> was<00:04:36.840> fantastic<00:04:37.880> there's<00:04:38.880> always

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
the acting was fantastic there's always

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.370 
the acting was fantastic there's always
the<00:04:39.210> bonus<00:04:39.510> of<00:04:39.630> working<00:04:39.750> with<00:04:39.990> unknowns

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
the bonus of working with unknowns

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.830 
the bonus of working with unknowns
because<00:04:41.280> they<00:04:41.970> always<00:04:42.480> seemed<00:04:42.660> more

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
because they always seemed more

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.120 
because they always seemed more
believable<00:04:43.169> to<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.620> because<00:04:43.800> you've<00:04:43.919> never

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
believable to you because you've never

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.470 
believable to you because you've never
seen<00:04:44.340> them<00:04:44.460> anywhere<00:04:44.580> else<00:04:44.910> it's<00:04:45.150> like<00:04:45.270> whoa

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
seen them anywhere else it's like whoa

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.750 
seen them anywhere else it's like whoa
these<00:04:45.720> people<00:04:46.020> just<00:04:46.169> came<00:04:46.260> out<00:04:46.410> of<00:04:46.440> nowhere

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
these people just came out of nowhere

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.190 
these people just came out of nowhere
and<00:04:47.760> they<00:04:47.850> all<00:04:48.000> did<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.210> fantastic<00:04:48.240> job<00:04:48.810> I

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
and they all did a fantastic job I

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.110 
and they all did a fantastic job I
thought<00:04:49.350> this<00:04:49.500> film<00:04:49.770> had<00:04:49.950> like<00:04:50.160> underlying

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
thought this film had like underlying

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.360 
thought this film had like underlying
social<00:04:51.510> commentary<00:04:52.110> but<00:04:52.890> I<00:04:52.919> think<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:53.250> was

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
social commentary but I think it was

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.920 
social commentary but I think it was
flirting<00:04:53.820> with<00:04:53.850> that<00:04:54.120> because<00:04:54.479> then<00:04:54.600> it<00:04:54.720> would

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
flirting with that because then it would

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.500 
flirting with that because then it would
kind<00:04:55.050> of<00:04:55.169> sometimes<00:04:55.350> make<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.680> statement<00:04:56.070> and

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
kind of sometimes make a statement and

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.860 
kind of sometimes make a statement and
back-to-back<00:04:57.020> pedal<00:04:57.560> on<00:04:57.680> it<00:04:58.030> which<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.210> watch<00:04:59.750> I

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
back-to-back pedal on it which I watch I

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.000 
back-to-back pedal on it which I watch I
would<00:04:59.930> have<00:05:00.110> prefered<00:05:00.470> they<00:05:00.620> would<00:05:00.770> have<00:05:00.860> just

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
would have prefered they would have just

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.740 
would have prefered they would have just
stuck<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.250> their<00:05:01.490> guns<00:05:01.520> on<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.030> district<00:05:02.570> nine

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
stuck to their guns on it district nine

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.160 
stuck to their guns on it district nine
and<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:02.990> think<00:05:03.230> would<00:05:03.380> be<00:05:03.470> an<00:05:03.560> apt<00:05:03.800> comparison

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
and I think would be an apt comparison

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:12.100 
and I think would be an apt comparison
both<00:05:06.170> deal<00:05:06.440> with<00:05:08.590> difficult<00:05:10.930> political<00:05:11.930> and

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
both deal with difficult political and

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.070 
both deal with difficult political and
social<00:05:12.380> situations<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:13.580> I<00:05:14.330> think<00:05:14.750> what

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
social situations and I think what

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.390 
social situations and I think what

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
what I feel is going on I don't know if

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.310 
what I feel is going on I don't know if
it's<00:05:25.100> worth<00:05:25.250> seeing<00:05:25.520> in<00:05:25.730> theaters<00:05:26.110> but<00:05:27.110> it's

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
it's worth seeing in theaters but it's

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.230 
it's worth seeing in theaters but it's
definitely<00:05:27.500> worth<00:05:27.920> a<00:05:28.070> watch<00:05:28.100> give<00:05:28.850> it<00:05:28.940> a<00:05:29.000> shot

definitely worth a watch give it a shot
if<00:05:29.450> you<00:05:29.600> like<00:05:29.750> these<00:05:29.900> kind<00:05:30.140> of<00:05:30.230> movies<00:05:30.500> I<00:05:30.680> don't

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
if you like these kind of movies I don't

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.220 
if you like these kind of movies I don't
think<00:05:30.980> you<00:05:31.070> need<00:05:31.220> to<00:05:31.250> see<00:05:31.550> it<00:05:31.670> in<00:05:31.850> theaters<00:05:32.420> but

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
think you need to see it in theaters but

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.930 
think you need to see it in theaters but
I<00:05:33.290> would<00:05:33.770> definitely<00:05:34.190> recommend<00:05:34.310> seeing<00:05:34.820> it

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
I would definitely recommend seeing it

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.430 
I would definitely recommend seeing it
sometime<00:05:35.270> I<00:05:35.420> think<00:05:35.450> you<00:05:35.690> could<00:05:35.840> totally<00:05:36.050> rent

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
sometime I think you could totally rent

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.960 
sometime I think you could totally rent
it<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:36.770> you<00:05:36.890> wouldn't<00:05:37.160> be<00:05:37.400> missing<00:05:37.610> anything

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
it and you wouldn't be missing anything

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.150 
it and you wouldn't be missing anything
but<00:05:38.600> I<00:05:38.630> think<00:05:38.720> you<00:05:38.870> should<00:05:39.140> see<00:05:39.410> it<00:05:39.500> I<00:05:39.710> think

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
but I think you should see it I think

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.830 
but I think you should see it I think
this<00:05:40.250> has<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.430> makings<00:05:40.670> of<00:05:40.910> a<00:05:41.030> cult<00:05:41.240> classic
