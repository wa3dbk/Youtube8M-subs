they<00:05:55.210> don't<00:05:55.419> distort<00:05:55.930> very<00:05:56.530> much<00:05:56.770> at<00:05:57.009> high

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
they don't distort very much at high

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.399 
they don't distort very much at high
volume<00:05:57.639> here<00:05:57.970> a<00:05:58.180> little<00:05:58.990> bit<00:05:59.139> of<00:05:59.229> distortion

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
volume here a little bit of distortion

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.890 
volume here a little bit of distortion
but<00:06:00.280> it<00:06:00.370> doesn't<00:06:00.940> ruin<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:01.270> audio<00:06:01.479> experience

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
but it doesn't ruin the audio experience

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.580 
but it doesn't ruin the audio experience
at<00:06:02.050> all<00:06:02.520> so<00:06:03.520> the<00:06:04.449> audio<00:06:04.810> quality<00:06:05.080> is<00:06:05.500> good<00:06:05.919> the

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
at all so the audio quality is good the

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.649 
at all so the audio quality is good the
build<00:06:08.590> quality<00:06:08.800> is<00:06:09.130> good<00:06:09.550> it's<00:06:10.240> also<00:06:10.389> quite

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
build quality is good it's also quite

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.110 
build quality is good it's also quite
cheap<00:06:10.990> so<00:06:11.770> what<00:06:11.979> are<00:06:12.069> the<00:06:12.250> cons<00:06:12.580> that<00:06:12.759> I<00:06:12.909> can

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
cheap so what are the cons that I can

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.180 
cheap so what are the cons that I can
think<00:06:13.300> of<00:06:13.479> it<00:06:14.370> well<00:06:15.370> not<00:06:15.610> of<00:06:15.849> it<00:06:16.060> for<00:06:16.539> it<00:06:17.190> well

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
think of it well not of it for it well

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.370 
think of it well not of it for it well
the<00:06:18.340> only<00:06:18.460> con<00:06:18.849> is<00:06:19.180> that<00:06:19.210> I<00:06:19.539> wish<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:20.020> cable

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
the only con is that I wish the cable

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.529 
the only con is that I wish the cable
was<00:06:20.500> a<00:06:20.530> bit<00:06:20.770> longer<00:06:21.069> I<00:06:21.490> wish<00:06:21.639> they<00:06:21.909> included
