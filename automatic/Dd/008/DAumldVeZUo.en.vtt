that and I believe that's what we
happening<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.479> month<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.049> want<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> hear

what you guys think do you honestly

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.999 
what you guys think do you honestly
think<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.869> they<00:01:31.079> could<00:01:31.140> possibly<00:01:31.500> announce

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
think that they could possibly announce

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.280 
think that they could possibly announce
a<00:01:32.220> PS<00:01:32.490> vita<00:01:32.729> successor<00:01:33.240> only<00:01:33.689> three<00:01:34.020> years

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
a PS vita successor only three years

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.469 
a PS vita successor only three years
into<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> PlayStation<00:01:35.280> Vita's<00:01:35.549> life<00:01:35.759> now

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
into the PlayStation Vita's life now

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.230 
into the PlayStation Vita's life now
that<00:01:36.689> makes<00:01:36.930> no<00:01:37.200> sense<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.650> me<00:01:37.680> however<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that makes no sense to me however it

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.270 
that makes no sense to me however it
could<00:01:39.570> be<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> price<00:01:40.079> drop<00:01:40.259> or<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:41.070> could<00:01:41.250> be

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
could be a price drop or it could be

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.880 
could be a price drop or it could be
totally<00:01:41.880> unrelated<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> PlayStation

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
totally unrelated to the PlayStation

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.069 
totally unrelated to the PlayStation
Vita<00:01:44.130> however<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.329> don't<00:01:45.720> see<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:45.930> being

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
Vita however I just don't see that being

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.530 
Vita however I just don't see that being
very<00:01:46.470> likely<00:01:46.770> because<00:01:47.610> our<00:01:47.790> inside<00:01:48.149> sources

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
very likely because our inside sources

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.050 
very likely because our inside sources
say<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.649> mainly<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.430> PlayStation
