00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
also make a different recommendation for

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.740 
also make a different recommendation for
one<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.490> hammer<00:00:14.670> build<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.450> one<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.690> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
one of the hammer build so one of the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.720 
one of the hammer build so one of the
main<00:00:15.960> questions<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.619> got<00:00:16.830> was<00:00:17.039> how<00:00:17.310> bad<00:00:17.609> his

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
main questions I got was how bad his

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.210 
main questions I got was how bad his
sword<00:00:18.090> now<00:00:18.330> compared<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> mace<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> pets

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
sword now compared to mace for the pets

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.310 
sword now compared to mace for the pets
or<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.699> was<00:00:20.850> about<00:00:21.090> two<00:00:21.390> percent<00:00:21.539> better<00:00:21.990> at

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
or it was about two percent better at

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.290 
or it was about two percent better at
most<00:00:22.619> depending<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.279> your<00:00:23.490> build<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:24.119> you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
most depending on your build if you

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.089 
most depending on your build if you
change<00:00:24.570> at<00:00:24.720> six<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.230> zeal<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.859> was

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
change at six in the zeal it was

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.099 
change at six in the zeal it was
practically<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.000> same<00:00:27.240> which<00:00:27.720> you're<00:00:27.869> pretty

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
practically the same which you're pretty

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.990 
practically the same which you're pretty
much<00:00:28.140> forced<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.830> now<00:00:29.039> he<00:00:29.519> also<00:00:29.640> gets

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
much forced to do now he also gets

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.330 
much forced to do now he also gets
symbolic<00:00:30.510> Avenger<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.830> get<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.070> keep<00:00:32.189> in

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
symbolic Avenger and you get to keep in

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.430 
symbolic Avenger and you get to keep in
mind<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.730> torch<00:00:33.360> skills<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.170> use<00:00:34.410> for

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
mind that torch skills that you use for

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.709 
mind that torch skills that you use for
all<00:00:34.770> symbols<00:00:35.130> are<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.760> also<00:00:36.120> get<00:00:36.540> that

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
all symbols are up also get that

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.560 
all symbols are up also get that
multiplier<00:00:37.290> powerful<00:00:38.160> blaze<00:00:38.370> got<00:00:38.730> taken<00:00:39.300> out

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
multiplier powerful blaze got taken out

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.540 
multiplier powerful blaze got taken out
so<00:00:39.809> he<00:00:39.899> really<00:00:39.989> ten<00:00:40.530> percent<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> sword

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
so he really ten percent on the sword

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.610 
so he really ten percent on the sword
overall<00:00:42.239> ends<00:00:42.420> up<00:00:42.690> being<00:00:42.960> about<00:00:43.110> eight

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
overall ends up being about eight

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.819 
overall ends up being about eight
percent<00:00:43.829> difference<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:45.000> damage<00:00:45.719> over<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> 30

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
percent difference in damage over a 30

percent difference in damage over a 30
second<00:00:47.370> rotation<00:00:48.059> given<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.020> say

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
second rotation given that I say

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.500 
second rotation given that I say
definitely<00:00:49.980> ditch<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.760> sword<00:00:51.030> another

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
definitely ditch the sword another

definitely ditch the sword another
question<00:00:52.020> I'm<00:00:52.110> beginning<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.739> whether<00:00:53.309> or<00:00:53.460> not

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
question I'm beginning is whether or not

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.689 
question I'm beginning is whether or not
Conde<00:00:54.149> gear<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.600> good<00:00:54.899> over<00:00:55.620> zerker<00:00:56.039> gear<00:00:56.340> now

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
Conde gear is good over zerker gear now

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.000 
Conde gear is good over zerker gear now
that<00:00:56.910> burning<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.780> lot<00:00:57.989> better<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.649> still

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that burning is a lot better is still

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.610 
that burning is a lot better is still
one<00:00:59.219> full<00:00:59.879> zerker<00:01:00.300> gear<00:01:00.570> because<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.320> about

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
one full zerker gear because it's about

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.709 
one full zerker gear because it's about
fourteen<00:01:02.309> percent<00:01:02.550> better<00:01:03.030> without

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
fourteen percent better without

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.740 
fourteen percent better without
unscathed<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.640> once<00:01:05.909> gave<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.479> time

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
unscathed if you have once gave up time

unscathed if you have once gave up time
it<00:01:07.049> only<00:01:07.170> goes<00:01:07.470> up<00:01:07.680> higher<00:01:07.979> bearings

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it only goes up higher bearings

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.030 
it only goes up higher bearings
definitely<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.210> lot<00:01:09.450> better<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.140> direct

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
definitely a lot better but direct

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.250 
definitely a lot better but direct
damage<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.640> still<00:01:11.939> better<00:01:12.150> sure<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:13.049> get

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
volunteer symbols will be up more and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.690 
volunteer symbols will be up more and
you<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:49.079> empowering<00:01:49.560> might<00:01:49.890> given<00:01:50.460> that

you have empowering might given that

you have empowering might given that
you're<00:01:50.880> mainly<00:01:51.090> running<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.750> build<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.200> be

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
you're mainly running this build to be

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
you're mainly running this build to be
more<00:01:52.860> supportive<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.119> worthwhile

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
more supportive I think it's worthwhile

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.990 
more supportive I think it's worthwhile
we<00:01:54.990> ran<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> numbers<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.430> new<00:01:56.579> rotation

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
we ran the numbers with the new rotation

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.030 
we ran the numbers with the new rotation
and<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.689> was<00:01:57.899> slightly<00:01:58.140> better<00:01:58.469> than<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.920> was

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
and it was slightly better than it was

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.100 
and it was slightly better than it was
before<00:01:59.219> it's<00:02:00.149> only<00:02:00.360> about<00:02:00.450> seven<00:02:00.960> percent

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
before it's only about seven percent

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.499 
before it's only about seven percent
worse<00:02:01.560> than<00:02:01.890> taking<00:02:02.369> radians<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.329> don't

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
worse than taking radians if you don't

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.719 
worse than taking radians if you don't
need<00:02:03.689> virtues<00:02:04.229> then<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.040> should<00:02:05.250> still<00:02:05.549> be

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
need virtues then you should still be

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.730 
need virtues then you should still be
running<00:02:05.969> Zeile<00:02:06.479> gradients<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.469> honor

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
running Zeile gradients and honor

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.100 
running Zeile gradients and honor
together<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.759> build<00:02:09.060> those<00:02:09.330> quite<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.810> bit<00:02:09.989> of

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
together that build those quite a bit of

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.610 
together that build those quite a bit of
damage<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.679> quite<00:02:11.099> comparable<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:12.060> great<00:02:12.270> so

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
damage is quite comparable it great so

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.979 
damage is quite comparable it great so
mais<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:13.159> added<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.790> updated<00:02:14.269> rotation<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.930> I

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
mais I added the updated rotation that I

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.039 
mais I added the updated rotation that I
