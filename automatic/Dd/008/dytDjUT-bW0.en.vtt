00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
still work so let's go ahead and take a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.889 
still work so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:01:43.140> around<00:01:43.350> over<00:01:43.829> here<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.210> flap

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
look around over here we have the flap

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.109 
look around over here we have the flap
right<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.860> hinge<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> flak<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
right here or the hinge for the flak and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.910 
right here or the hinge for the flak and
let's<00:01:48.659> go<00:01:48.810> ahead<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.049> open<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.560> up<00:01:49.740> now

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
let's go ahead and open it up now

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.649 
let's go ahead and open it up now
there's<00:01:50.100> no<00:01:50.280> magnets<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.180> case<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.630> you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
there's no magnets in this case so you

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.080 
there's no magnets in this case so you
won't<00:01:51.899> see<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.200> ipad<00:01:52.320> mini<00:01:52.590> turn<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.340> when<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
won't see the ipad mini turn on when you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.600 
won't see the ipad mini turn on when you
open<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.570> up<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:55.470> still<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> nice<00:01:56.159> case

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
open it up but it's still a nice case

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.149 
open it up but it's still a nice case
over<00:01:57.060> all<00:01:57.240> over<00:01:57.509> here<00:01:58.229> we<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.619> two<00:01:58.890> little

over all over here we have two little

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.600 
over all over here we have two little
crevices<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.719> fold<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.740> ipad<00:02:02.130> mini<00:02:02.159> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
crevices so we can fold the ipad mini to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.490 
crevices so we can fold the ipad mini to
use<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> keyboard<00:02:03.659> or<00:02:03.810> anything<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.380> we
