it<00:02:00.299> over<00:02:00.390> very<00:02:00.630> quickly<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.969> don't<00:02:02.969> want<00:02:03.119> to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
it over very quickly I don't want to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.789 
it over very quickly I don't want to
fully<00:02:03.360> straighten<00:02:03.780> my<00:02:04.020> hair<00:02:04.200> because<00:02:04.439> then

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
fully straighten my hair because then

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.340 
fully straighten my hair because then
I'll<00:02:05.009> lose<00:02:05.219> all<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.060> volume<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
I'll lose all of the volume that the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.889 
I'll lose all of the volume that the
waves<00:02:07.560> give<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.879> don't<00:02:09.360> straighten

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
waves give it and so I don't straighten

and manageable at these sections into

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.180 
and manageable at these sections into
two<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.170> I'll<00:02:19.440> just<00:02:19.560> take<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.830> backbone

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
two and I'll just take the backbone

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.070 
two and I'll just take the backbone
first<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.670> show<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:20.940> not<00:02:21.330> from<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.630> root<00:02:21.810> but

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
first to show you not from the root but

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.980 
first to show you not from the root but
just<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.320> little<00:02:22.440> bit<00:02:22.590> further<00:02:22.740> down<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.990> twirl

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
just a little bit further down and twirl

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.690 
just a little bit further down and twirl
it<00:02:25.140> round<00:02:25.380> it's<00:02:25.770> almost<00:02:26.100> like<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.430> would<00:02:26.610> if

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
it round it's almost like you would if

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.920 
it round it's almost like you would if
you<00:02:26.730> were<00:02:26.880> curling<00:02:27.240> your<00:02:27.300> hair<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.750> don't

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
you were curling your hair but I don't

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.180 
you were curling your hair but I don't
hold<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.350> as<00:02:28.470> long<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:30.170> then<00:02:31.170> I'm<00:02:31.770> gonna<00:02:31.890> step

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
hold it as long and then I'm gonna step

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:40.820 
hold it as long and then I'm gonna step
in<00:02:32.370> as<00:02:32.490> well<00:02:38.240> okay<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.620> kind<00:02:40.800> of

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
in as well okay and so I just kind of

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.640 
in as well okay and so I just kind of
mess<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.340> up<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:42.390> kind<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.690> cools<00:02:42.930> down<00:02:43.230> I

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
mess that up as it kind of cools down I

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.550 
mess that up as it kind of cools down I
just<00:02:43.920> kind<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.160> play<00:02:44.400> around<00:02:44.430> there<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.560> it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
just kind of play around there and it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.500 
just kind of play around there and it
falls<00:02:46.860> falls<00:02:47.790> into<00:02:47.970> place<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.670> round<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.300> so

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
falls falls into place so I round it so

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.850 
falls falls into place so I round it so
that's<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.780> bottom<00:02:52.050> section<00:02:52.200> completely

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
that's the bottom section completely

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.949 
that's the bottom section completely
done<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.280> don't<00:02:53.730> tend<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.209> be<00:02:54.390> very<00:02:54.420> precise

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
done I don't tend to be very precise

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.240 
done I don't tend to be very precise
with<00:02:54.990> this<00:02:55.290> because<00:02:55.590> nobody's<00:02:55.890> really<00:02:56.010> going

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
with this because nobody's really going

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.100 
with this because nobody's really going
to<00:02:56.310> see<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.610> okay<00:02:56.820> now<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.300> top<00:02:57.510> section<00:02:57.720> is

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
to see it okay now the top section is

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.840

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
be a little bit straighter you can just

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.540 
be a little bit straighter you can just
