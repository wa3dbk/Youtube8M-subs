so tinkers construct i want to remove
this<00:01:42.299> workbench<00:01:43.229> working<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.159> crafting<00:01:44.549> table

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
this workbench working a crafting table

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.929 
this workbench working a crafting table
I<00:01:45.290> didn't<00:01:46.290> lose<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.500> that's<00:01:47.310> good<00:01:47.610> that's

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
I didn't lose it that's good that's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.649 
I didn't lose it that's good that's
great<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.770> construct<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.820> have

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
great so think is construct if you have

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.510 
great so think is construct if you have
to<00:01:51.869> gain<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> crafting<00:01:52.590> table<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:53.310> this

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to gain a crafting table you get this

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.649 
to gain a crafting table you get this
which<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> nice<00:01:55.259> table<00:01:55.799> kind<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.490> shape<00:01:56.790> but

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
which is a nice table kind of shape but

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.980 
which is a nice table kind of shape but
if<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.229> craft<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.890> again<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.939> get<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.540> half

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
if you craft it again you get a half

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.630 
if you craft it again you get a half
slab<00:02:02.210> crafting<00:02:03.210> table<00:02:03.570> mmm<00:02:04.290> nicer<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
slab crafting table mmm nicer that you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.240 
slab crafting table mmm nicer that you
can<00:02:05.790> put<00:02:05.939> over<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.390> now<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.320> want<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> remove
