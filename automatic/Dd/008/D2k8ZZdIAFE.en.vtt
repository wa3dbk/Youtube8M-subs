Defragmenter<00:00:38.570> now<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> know<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.020> was<00:00:40.170> kind<00:00:40.410> of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
Defragmenter now I know it was kind of

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.650 
Defragmenter now I know it was kind of
it<00:00:40.559> was<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> more<00:00:41.340> simpler<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.030> Windows<00:00:42.450> 7

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it was a more simpler on Windows 7

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.319 
it was a more simpler on Windows 7
actually<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.500> went<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.770> go<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.430> it's

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
actually I went to go do this and it's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.450 
actually I went to go do this and it's
way<00:00:45.539> more<00:00:45.570> simpler<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.230> Windows<00:00:46.469> 7<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:47.370> on

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
way more simpler in Windows 7 because on

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.310 
way more simpler in Windows 7 because on

box on the application don't run at
windows<00:05:58.290> startup<00:05:58.740> or<00:05:59.030> don't<00:06:00.030> run<00:06:00.240> in<00:06:00.360> the

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
windows startup or don't run in the

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.960 
windows startup or don't run in the
background<00:06:00.930> make<00:06:01.500> it<00:06:01.620> run<00:06:01.800> on<00:06:01.979> whenever<00:06:02.520> you

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
background make it run on whenever you

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.960 
background make it run on whenever you
use<00:06:03.210> the<00:06:03.390> application<00:06:04.020> so<00:06:04.710> by<00:06:05.190> doing<00:06:05.250> that<00:06:05.669> you

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
use the application so by doing that you

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.520 
use the application so by doing that you
will<00:06:06.000> speed<00:06:06.360> up<00:06:06.510> the<00:06:06.540> computer's<00:06:07.380> performance

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
will speed up the computer's performance

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.400 
will speed up the computer's performance
startup<00:06:08.520> times<00:06:08.820> and<00:06:09.210> loading<00:06:09.900> times<00:06:10.080> as<00:06:10.229> well

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
startup times and loading times as well

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.350 
startup times and loading times as well
so<00:06:10.680> it's<00:06:10.800> pretty<00:06:10.979> nice<00:06:11.160> and<00:06:11.910> there's<00:06:12.210> still

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
so it's pretty nice and there's still

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.240 
so it's pretty nice and there's still
one<00:06:12.419> more<00:06:12.810> tip<00:06:13.080> that<00:06:13.260> I<00:06:13.290> showed<00:06:13.590> you<00:06:13.710> not<00:06:14.040> many
