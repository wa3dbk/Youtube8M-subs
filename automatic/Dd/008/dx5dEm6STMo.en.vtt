there's<00:00:28.619> water<00:00:29.160> down<00:00:29.490> there<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:30.619> try<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> clean

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
there's water down there I try to clean

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.450 
there's water down there I try to clean
up<00:00:32.130> most<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:33.860> but<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.010> keeps<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.550> leaking

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
up most of it but it keeps on leaking

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
up most of it but it keeps on leaking
and<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:39.270> took<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> washout<00:00:40.530> apart<00:00:41.690> and<00:00:42.690> try<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and I took the washout apart and try to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.700 
and I took the washout apart and try to
figure<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.379> where<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.829> came<00:00:44.040> from<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:45.710> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
figure out where it came from and it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.690 
figure out where it came from and it
came<00:00:46.980> from<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.879> rubber<00:00:48.210> gasket<00:00:48.870> right<00:00:49.260> here

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
came from this rubber gasket right here

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.920 
came from this rubber gasket right here
and<00:00:52.190> mainly<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:54.230> found<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.649> hole<00:00:56.570> just<00:00:57.570> let<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and mainly I found a hole just let the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.060 
and mainly I found a hole just let the
tower<00:00:59.270> and<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.780> white<00:01:01.050> style<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.530> try<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.829> put

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
tower and this white style I try to put

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.350 
tower and this white style I try to put
sealant<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.989> so<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.019> wouldn't<00:01:04.379> leak<00:01:04.799> anymore

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
sealant on it so I wouldn't leak anymore

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.560 
sealant on it so I wouldn't leak anymore
and<00:01:06.360> there's<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.869> hole<00:01:08.150> can't<00:01:09.150> really<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.510> it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and there's a hole can't really see it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.780 
and there's a hole can't really see it
but<00:01:09.720> there's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.049> hole<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.250> gasket

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
but there's a hole right here the gasket

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.420 
but there's a hole right here the gasket
and<00:01:15.020> maybe<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.409> duped<00:01:16.680> because<00:01:17.009> there's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and maybe that was duped because there's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.240 
and maybe that was duped because there's
a<00:01:17.580> piece<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.150> sharp<00:01:18.450> plastic<00:01:18.630> behind<00:01:19.409> that

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
a piece of sharp plastic behind that

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.370 
a piece of sharp plastic behind that
