 the ashton absence who did a little 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.660
 preparing for this strict have done 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:44.090

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.489
 what have I done with their lot 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.699

 so enter there are the rules 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.390
 and what has won but you are his 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.570
 skin if you want to read 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.400
 here and you know and I want 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.770
 see the city so the date 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.390
 I fly it at 10 hours later I know 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.829
 not exactly what she's going but 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.860
 I'm trying 700 and you can 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:24.390
 to go out otherwise here the city is missing 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.799
 a little to discover force make up to 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.289
 inside it will change 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.009
 dark not put his personal touch so 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.539
 it's very likely to change 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.460
 you come back you dreamed so 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.340
 firstly we will go into the under 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.770
 soils in all this is more for the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.310
 plantations and mines and homes 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.810
 as there is a bit on the first floor so 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.429
 which is expensive but are still 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.929
 pretty big bacalan temaru 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:54.750
 so it's not so hot and if we go 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:58.470
 not also here there is a house to win 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.280
 during an event a huge house 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.929
 so to win during the sell 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.729
 do not miss it then we go back 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.739
 sisters are surely going to and grew up here at 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.180
 too many people if there are a lot of 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.670
 people without hesitation here we have the pnj 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:24.450
 who will sell all the merchant 6 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:26.760
 so here we have the houses here we have 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.440
 several houses of small and 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.650
 bigger 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.730
 so up there several years ago we 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.150
 drinks smaller 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.150
 62nd rank ago 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:49.150
 the prison here so will leggera actually for 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:50.950
 richert then we go up here we want here 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.359
 going to see the puck is so I'm doing a 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.829
 little visit the idea quickly so here 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:00.819
 on the screen throne god is right here we have 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.030
 his vault 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:08.340
 a year it's really very slow and bone 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.549
 we have a bed and balconies what 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.409
 then 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:18.090
 then in drawing we try to 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.090
 to place all the barriers 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:23.530
 I succeeded 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:27.879
 shit yes 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.250
 so we 're not going if the second floor 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.159
 reserved to the pile dwellings it 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.139
 there are two small houses one 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.299
 little bigger sense just like his 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.939
 intake in the middle that are a bit more 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.989
 small and mini mini mini his mutation 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.989
 between 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.980
 it will remain more navigation to payers to 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.600
 it's still better than nothing if we 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.430
 ascends to the third floor 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.830
 now you have a little more 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.140
 amenities 1 and 2 of the many 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.540
 several houses 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.910
 you can still of course but 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.640
 you can do more stuff in it 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:10.610
 what and finally to finish 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.150
 there was something there is nothing 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:18.639
 think yes yes to finish blogs from 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.780
 mode signal limitations and 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:26.560
 and the limits of 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.360
 to remain quiet that the pv not active 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.680
 that you can break blocks at all 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.110
 so here we go 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.060
 this is my first cigarette season of that 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.050
