00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:13.530
 online guys I bring you the first trick 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:16.120
 from 1.17 to be completely 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.160
 immortal so much for others 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.689
 players for the police we will not give ourselves 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.070
 damage in falls etc. and so on 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.800
 etc. let's be completely 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.210
 immune and immortal good guys before 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.160
 nothing to tell you please this trick 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.869
 use it cautiously use them in 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.609
 private rooms with your friends 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.320
 etcetera etcetera to do a little the 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.210
 goose shrimp and all those things because 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.190
 if you can not report and you can 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.050
 get to suffer some kind of ban 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.210
 agreement so please use it with 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.100
 good responsibility first thing all 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.780
 Credit eyes is a six-seater garage 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.860
 it is absolutely mandatory that it be of 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.720
 six seats 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.780
 You can buy it through here from 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.750
 the web page is of the destination mobile 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.030
 from dynasty dynasty 8 of the dynasty this one 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.740
 just what you have here you put in the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.390
 rising price and so you can start 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.170
 for the shorter ones and it seems to me that 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.989
 in 50 or 70 between 70 and it was 60 thousand dollars 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.090
 you can find one if you have cars in 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.450
 the garage nothing happens because they will remain 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.460
 souls 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.759
 in a thing they call store then what 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.890
 teach two of the goods and we put in a 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.570
 Pair of vitis in the part is in the rack 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.490
 of 20 and I will advise you to be 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.549
 that one that showed the croc cruiser or something 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.229
 well because it does not work properly with 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.909
 others agree avoid having both 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.159
 bicycles in the rack of bicycles 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.049
 and now we can simply do 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.100
 is to take out one of the cars according 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.170
 this is very important because if not 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.819
 trick will get us out we take out a car and 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.619
 we put it back simply I will 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.170
 I give to front and then back to 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.630
 give it right to the circulito is blue vale 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.069
 just once done this we 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.229
 we will automatically get off the car and 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.939
 we are going to ride the bike with the 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.799
 triangle according to the and in the case 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.720
 of xbox 360 not with the crosshead with the 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.909
 little button on the right with the little arrow 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.560
 to the right we just ride and 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.000
 we went down the moment we got together 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.709
 we want the camera a little bit and we 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.299
 we go down and move on to that we have to upload it 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.009
 with the triangle of agreement and we 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.020
 We are here wanted in good in my 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.759
 case this has been this, I simply 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.679
 I stayed here and worked for a while 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.720
 I was doing is to give everything the two 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.700
 buttons until in the end I got 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.370
 diverting me is simply good what 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.900
 I think what I've done is give the crosshead 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.489
 down to the little arrow 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.680
 try to send me to the characters 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.780
 campaign at the end has been diverted or 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.430
 has unlocked so to speak 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.290
 can you happen that may be 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.510
 just jce appear somewhere 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.040
 of the random map you might fall 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.659
 from very high they can be a lot of 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.640
 things can even kill us worth 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.530
 so as you can see here I'm fine 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.209
 fall not the result hurt a fall 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.280
 so now I'm going to check that I'm 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.019
 completely immortal immune to all 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.640
 Explosions to the police to others 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.549
 players I insist with the theme of doing it 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.260
 with friends like I said maybe 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.019
 happen for what I do to myself happens to me 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.549
 you wait a ratillo and it happens to you I 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.349
 it seems like it was a minute and a minute 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.989
 and half waiting for that to be removed 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.120
 I was completely stuck 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.489
 you appear somewhere on the map you can 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.170
 that appear flying and fall to the ground 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.030
 or can you conjure vale so if muricy 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.170
 a wall my mother if you die 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.370
 volvÃ©s simply do as 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.170
 you are watching here I am teaching the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.180
 mechanical, that's why in the 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.799
 cars that do not fit in the garage do not 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.510
 destroy or anything you do not lose them so 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.639
 do not worry if you have both 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.200
 garages full because you will not lose it 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.450
 the cars when you have space again 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.980
 in the garage they will simply turn 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.599
 to put in the ten-seater garage 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.830
 look guys 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.950

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.840
