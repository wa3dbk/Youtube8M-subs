00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
to be long enough and I'm going to start

to be long enough and I'm going to start
teaching<00:00:48.739> Ava<00:00:49.100> how<00:00:50.059> to<00:00:50.120> move<00:00:50.420> her<00:00:50.570> butt<00:00:50.750> over

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
teaching Ava how to move her butt over

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.619 
teaching Ava how to move her butt over
next<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.190> me<00:00:52.340> it's<00:00:52.760> always<00:00:53.000> interesting<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:53.539> me

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
next to me it's always interesting to me

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:54.939 
next to me it's always interesting to me
because<00:00:53.750> horses<00:00:54.079> want<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:54.500> turn<00:00:54.649> around<00:00:54.860> and

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
because horses want to turn around and

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.040 
because horses want to turn around and
face<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.390> which<00:00:56.390> at<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:56.629> point<00:00:56.930> I<00:00:56.989> guess

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
face you which at this point I guess

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.389 
face you which at this point I guess
makes<00:00:57.350> sense<00:00:57.620> because<00:00:57.860> I<00:00:57.890> have<00:00:58.129> been<00:00:58.280> teaching

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
makes sense because I have been teaching

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.220 
makes sense because I have been teaching
Ava<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:59.180> turn<00:00:59.359> around<00:00:59.480> and<00:00:59.660> give<00:00:59.750> me<00:00:59.780> two<00:01:00.050> eyes

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
Ava to turn around and give me two eyes

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.619 
Ava to turn around and give me two eyes
but<00:01:00.949> now<00:01:01.070> I<00:01:01.100> want<00:01:01.370> to<00:01:01.430> teach<00:01:01.640> her<00:01:01.910> that<00:01:02.390> if<00:01:02.510> I'm

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
but now I want to teach her that if I'm

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.479 
but now I want to teach her that if I'm
tapping<00:01:02.899> on<00:01:03.140> her<00:01:03.230> but<00:01:03.410> she<00:01:03.649> again<00:01:04.220> needs<00:01:04.430> to

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
tapping on her but she again needs to

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.639 
tapping on her but she again needs to
move<00:01:04.670> away<00:01:04.820> from<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.149> pressure<00:01:05.470> this<00:01:06.470> is<00:01:06.619> a

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
move away from the pressure this is a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.109 
move away from the pressure this is a
little<00:01:06.890> difficult<00:01:07.399> for<00:01:07.430> her<00:01:07.670> because<00:01:07.850> I'm

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
little difficult for her because I'm

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.570 
little difficult for her because I'm
asking<00:01:08.509> her<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.720> move<00:01:08.930> towards<00:01:09.710> me<00:01:09.920> she's

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
asking her to move towards me she's

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.400 
asking her to move towards me she's
pretty<00:01:10.880> used<00:01:11.149> to<00:01:11.270> when<00:01:11.539> I<00:01:11.630> tap<00:01:11.869> on<00:01:12.050> her<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.229> move

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
pretty used to when I tap on her to move

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.620 
pretty used to when I tap on her to move
away<00:01:12.590> from<00:01:12.800> me<00:01:13.250> but<00:01:13.759> she's<00:01:13.940> not<00:01:14.090> used<00:01:14.450> to

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
away from me but she's not used to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.529 
away from me but she's not used to
actually<00:01:14.810> moving<00:01:15.229> her<00:01:15.470> butt<00:01:15.679> towards<00:01:16.310> me<00:01:16.539> so

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
actually moving her butt towards me so

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.139 
actually moving her butt towards me so
there<00:01:17.660> she<00:01:17.840> gets<00:01:17.929> over<00:01:18.259> pretty<00:01:18.500> good<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:19.149> but

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
there she gets over pretty good and but

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:21.460 
there she gets over pretty good and but
when<00:01:20.240> I<00:01:20.270> asked<00:01:20.569> her<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.720> take<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:20.869> last<00:01:21.170> step

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
when I asked her to take that last step

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
up next to the fence then she wants to

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.240 
up next to the fence then she wants to
try<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.119> walk<00:01:23.300> forward<00:01:23.830> but<00:01:24.830> she<00:01:24.950> did<00:01:25.099> a<00:01:25.130> pretty

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
from it and see that this is a good

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.309 
from it and see that this is a good
thing<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.950> be<00:01:43.069> standing<00:01:43.910> up<00:01:44.030> next<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.360> me<00:01:44.479> and

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
thing to be standing up next to me and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:46.660 
thing to be standing up next to me and
even<00:01:45.560> though<00:01:45.679> that's<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.099> way<00:01:46.220> I'd<00:01:46.340> want<00:01:46.580> to

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
even though that's the way I'd want to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.729 
even though that's the way I'd want to
mount<00:01:46.849> her<00:01:47.030> I'm<00:01:47.270> going<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.479> teach<00:01:47.630> her<00:01:47.899> to<00:01:48.170> move

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:48.739 
mount her I'm going to teach her to move

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:50.710 
mount her I'm going to teach her to move
her<00:01:48.890> butt<00:01:49.039> over<00:01:49.220> back<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.789> forth<00:01:50.030> on<00:01:50.239> both

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
her butt over back and forth on both

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.510 
her butt over back and forth on both
sides<00:01:51.020> because<00:01:51.709> for<00:01:51.979> one<00:01:52.099> you<00:01:52.130> never<00:01:52.310> know

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
sides because for one you never know

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.650 
sides because for one you never know
which<00:01:52.640> side<00:01:52.849> you<00:01:52.970> might<00:01:53.119> need<00:01:53.239> to<00:01:53.360> be<00:01:53.420> able<00:01:53.479> get

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
which side you might need to be able get

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.419 
which side you might need to be able get
on<00:01:53.750> your<00:01:53.869> horse<00:01:54.110> and<00:01:54.319> then<00:01:54.979> we<00:01:55.069> always<00:01:55.220> want<00:01:55.369> to

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
on your horse and then we always want to

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.219 
on your horse and then we always want to
teach<00:01:55.580> them<00:01:55.789> everything<00:01:56.050> from<00:01:57.050> both

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
teach them everything from both

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.279 
teach them everything from both
directions<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:58.720> so<00:01:59.720> she<00:01:59.780> got<00:01:59.959> pretty<00:02:00.259> good

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
directions and so she got pretty good

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.050 
directions and so she got pretty good
but<00:02:00.739> right<00:02:00.950> when<00:02:01.069> I<00:02:01.130> asked<00:02:01.280> if<00:02:01.399> that<00:02:01.550> last<00:02:01.819> step

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
but right when I asked if that last step

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.660 
but right when I asked if that last step
next<00:02:02.300> defense<00:02:02.690> then<00:02:02.989> she<00:02:03.170> moves<00:02:03.379> away<00:02:03.670> because

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
next defense then she moves away because

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.499 
next defense then she moves away because
she's<00:02:04.849> got<00:02:05.060> just<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.330> little<00:02:05.360> bit

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
she's got just a little bit

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:06.940 
she's got just a little bit
uncomfortable<00:02:05.690> getting<00:02:06.289> that<00:02:06.379> close<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.830> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
uncomfortable getting that close to the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.190 
uncomfortable getting that close to the
fence<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.550> just<00:02:08.420> thinks<00:02:08.660> there<00:02:08.869> must<00:02:09.020> be

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
fence and just thinks there must be

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.290 
fence and just thinks there must be
something<00:02:09.590> else<00:02:09.679> that<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:09.920> want<00:02:10.129> her<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.310> do<00:02:10.459> so

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
something else that I want her to do so

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
here I went ahead and stopped one step

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.760 
here I went ahead and stopped one step
before<00:02:14.360> she<00:02:14.870> got<00:02:14.989> too<00:02:15.170> close<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.560> fence

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
before she got too close to the fence

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.960 
before she got too close to the fence
and<00:02:15.950> patted<00:02:16.220> her<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:16.460> that<00:02:16.490> she<00:02:16.760> knows<00:02:16.790> that

that<00:03:03.569> would<00:03:03.750> be<00:03:03.930> pretty<00:03:04.860> easy<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.489> do<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:06.299> see

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
that would be pretty easy to do you see

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.840 
that would be pretty easy to do you see
her<00:03:06.690> ears<00:03:06.989> are<00:03:07.110> back<00:03:07.290> listening<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.100> me<00:03:08.340> but

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
her ears are back listening to me but

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.660 
her ears are back listening to me but
she's<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.209> pretty<00:03:09.510> relaxed<00:03:10.019> spot<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.670> this

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
she's in a pretty relaxed spot and this

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.190 
she's in a pretty relaxed spot and this
is<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.850> very<00:03:12.150> good<00:03:12.299> stopping<00:03:12.569> point<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:13.019> this

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
is a very good stopping point for this

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.800 
is a very good stopping point for this
exercise<00:03:13.680> right<00:03:13.920> here

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.179 

now<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.989> Ava's<00:03:19.230> done<00:03:19.409> so<00:03:19.650> well<00:03:19.859> we<00:03:19.980> want<00:03:20.159> to

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:20.189 
now that Ava's done so well we want to

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:22.789 
now that Ava's done so well we want to
take<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.670> next<00:03:20.849> step<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:22.349> get<00:03:22.680> away

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
take it to the next step is to get away

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.800 
take it to the next step is to get away
from<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.280> fence<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.730> see<00:03:23.969> if<00:03:24.269> she<00:03:24.540> can<00:03:24.689> do

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
from the fence and see if she can do

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.569 
from the fence and see if she can do
this<00:03:24.900> exercise<00:03:25.109> while<00:03:25.950> I'm<00:03:26.129> standing<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:26.519> a

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
this exercise while I'm standing on a

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.099 
this exercise while I'm standing on a
mounting<00:03:26.969> block<00:03:27.090> I'm<00:03:27.540> not<00:03:27.719> going<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.900> have<00:03:27.989> the

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
mounting block I'm not going to have the

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.589 
mounting block I'm not going to have the
fence<00:03:28.349> to<00:03:28.530> help<00:03:28.769> me<00:03:29.150> explain<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.269> her<00:03:30.389> what<00:03:30.569> I

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
fence to help me explain to her what I

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.780 
fence to help me explain to her what I
need<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.829> they<00:03:31.980> got<00:03:32.159> one<00:03:32.310> thing<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.549> want<00:03:32.730> to

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790

need but they got one thing I want to
point<00:03:32.969> out<00:03:33.060> here<00:03:33.299> is<00:03:33.420> I'm<00:03:33.569> still<00:03:33.870> using<00:03:34.230> the

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
point out here is I'm still using the

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.559 
point out here is I'm still using the
lunge<00:03:34.560> whip<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.519> only<00:03:35.700> changed<00:03:36.269> one<00:03:36.540> thing

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
lunge whip so I only changed one thing

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.690 
lunge whip so I only changed one thing
you<00:03:37.560> know<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.709> just<00:03:37.859> moved<00:03:38.159> I<00:03:38.219> took<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.489> fence

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
you know I just moved I took the fence

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.280 
you know I just moved I took the fence
away<00:03:38.939> but<00:03:39.120> I'm<00:03:39.180> still<00:03:39.389> standing<00:03:39.750> up<00:03:39.900> above<00:03:40.139> her

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
away but I'm still standing up above her

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.709 
away but I'm still standing up above her
and<00:03:40.439> I'm<00:03:40.920> still<00:03:41.159> using<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.489> lunge<00:03:41.670> whip<00:03:41.879> so

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:42.719 
and I'm still using the lunge whip so

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.709 
and I'm still using the lunge whip so
it's<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.889> same<00:03:44.129> exercise<00:03:44.700> haven't<00:03:45.419> changed

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:45.719 
it's the same exercise haven't changed

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:47.539 
it's the same exercise haven't changed
too<00:03:45.870> many<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.139> parameters<00:03:46.650> the

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
too many of the parameters the

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.339 
too many of the parameters the
difference<00:03:48.389> is<00:03:48.569> that<00:03:48.599> she<00:03:48.959> just<00:03:49.079> had<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.230> little

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
difference is that she just had a little

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.429 
difference is that she just had a little
bit<00:03:49.560> more<00:03:49.769> room<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.159> move<00:03:50.310> around<00:03:50.489> in<00:03:50.879> and<00:03:51.439> she

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
bit more room to move around in and she

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:53.720 
bit more room to move around in and she
doesn't<00:03:52.560> have<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.739> landmark<00:03:53.189> about<00:03:53.489> how<00:03:53.669> to

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
doesn't have a landmark about how to

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.149 
doesn't have a landmark about how to
sidle<00:03:54.120> up<00:03:54.359> so<00:03:55.199> here<00:03:55.349> she<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.650> she's<00:03:55.919> getting

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
sidle up so here she is she's getting

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.369 
sidle up so here she is she's getting
closer<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.519> closer<00:03:56.790> with<00:03:57.150> her<00:03:57.239> head<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.689> then

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
closer and closer with her head and then

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.689 
closer and closer with her head and then
I'm<00:03:58.500> petting<00:03:58.739> her<00:03:58.919> because<00:03:59.159> she<00:03:59.310> did<00:03:59.489> take<00:03:59.669> a

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
I'm petting her because she did take a

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.509 
I'm petting her because she did take a
step<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.030> try<00:04:00.650> now<00:04:01.650> I'm<00:04:01.709> gonna<00:04:01.889> tap<00:04:02.159> and<00:04:02.370> ask

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
step and try now I'm gonna tap and ask

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.750 
step and try now I'm gonna tap and ask
her<00:04:02.669> to<00:04:02.760> move<00:04:02.879> her<00:04:03.000> but<00:04:03.180> again<00:04:04.489> this<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.639> the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
her to move her but again this is the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.610 
her to move her but again this is the
most<00:04:05.909> unnatural<00:04:06.329> as<00:04:06.719> I'm<00:04:07.109> she's<00:04:07.319> having<00:04:07.530> to

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
most unnatural as I'm she's having to

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.459 
most unnatural as I'm she's having to
move<00:04:07.769> towards<00:04:08.340> me<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:08.639> then<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.849> pet<00:04:09.120> her<00:04:09.469> so

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:10.469 
move towards me so then I pet her so

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.809 
move towards me so then I pet her so
again<00:04:10.680> it's<00:04:10.769> very<00:04:10.949> critical<00:04:11.129> you<00:04:11.340> see<00:04:11.609> that

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
again it's very critical you see that

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.699 
again it's very critical you see that
she's<00:04:12.030> not<00:04:12.209> learned<00:04:12.659> to<00:04:12.810> become<00:04:12.930> scared<00:04:13.530> of

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
she's not learned to become scared of

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.080 
she's not learned to become scared of
the<00:04:13.829> whip<00:04:14.040> she's<00:04:14.430> just<00:04:14.609> learning<00:04:14.939> that<00:04:15.000> the

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
the whip she's just learning that the

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.770 
the whip she's just learning that the
whip<00:04:15.269> as<00:04:15.449> a<00:04:15.480> tool<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.940> communicate<00:04:18.150> with<00:04:18.630> her

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
whip as a tool to communicate with her

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.140 
whip as a tool to communicate with her
there<00:04:19.650> she's<00:04:19.979> thought<00:04:20.430> about<00:04:20.459> taking<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.120> step

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
there she's thought about taking a step

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.180 
there she's thought about taking a step
I<00:04:21.630> wanted<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:21.959> take<00:04:22.139> a<00:04:22.169> good<00:04:22.409> try<00:04:22.680> there<00:04:22.979> she

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
I wanted to take a good try there she

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:30.310 
I wanted to take a good try there she
goes<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:26.570> want<00:04:27.570> her<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.810> settle<00:04:28.080> for<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.380> minute

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
goes I want her to settle for a minute

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.879 
good I'm doing she does quite a smart
horse<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.460> she<00:04:36.090> does<00:04:36.270> try<00:04:36.599> and<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:37.530> like<00:04:37.740> how

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
horse and she does try and I like how

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.010 
horse and she does try and I like how
she's<00:04:38.099> taking<00:04:38.580> small<00:04:39.300> steps<00:04:39.630> she's<00:04:39.870> not

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
she's taking small steps she's not

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.930 
she's taking small steps she's not
getting<00:04:40.259> super<00:04:40.590> excited<00:04:40.979> about<00:04:41.039> it<00:04:41.220> but

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
getting super excited about it but

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.279 
getting super excited about it but
that's<00:04:42.030> why<00:04:42.210> we<00:04:42.330> started<00:04:42.690> doing<00:04:42.750> this<00:04:43.080> up

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
that's why we started doing this up

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.320 
that's why we started doing this up
against<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.680> fence<00:04:43.919> so<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:44.639> becomes<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.150> more

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
against the fence so this becomes a more

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.649 
against the fence so this becomes a more
natural<00:04:45.720> progression<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:48.210> now<00:04:48.330> I'm<00:04:48.449> going<00:04:48.599> to

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
natural progression so now I'm going to

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.950 
natural progression so now I'm going to
ask<00:04:48.780> her<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.900> move<00:04:49.169> away<00:04:50.449> the<00:04:51.449> opposite<00:04:51.900> of

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
ask her to move away the opposite of

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.330 
ask her to move away the opposite of
what<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.139> would<00:04:52.229> want<00:04:52.440> her<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:52.680> do<00:04:52.800> for<00:04:52.830> mounting

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
what I would want her to do for mounting

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.010 
what I would want her to do for mounting
but<00:04:53.490> again<00:04:53.699> I<00:04:53.729> just<00:04:53.940> want<00:04:54.090> her<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.210> learn<00:04:54.449> also

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
but again I just want her to learn also

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.629 
but again I just want her to learn also
to<00:04:55.409> always<00:04:55.710> be<00:04:55.860> moving<00:04:56.190> away<00:04:56.280> from<00:04:56.430> the

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
to always be moving away from the

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.180 
to always be moving away from the
pressure<00:04:56.909> no<00:04:57.750> matter<00:04:57.900> where<00:04:58.199> it<00:04:58.320> is<00:04:58.409> so<00:04:59.070> there

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
pressure no matter where it is so there

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.589 
pressure no matter where it is so there
she<00:04:59.370> went<00:04:59.460> ahead<00:04:59.610> and<00:04:59.849> kept<00:05:00.000> moving<00:05:00.150> on<00:05:00.389> around

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
she went ahead and kept moving on around

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.510 
she went ahead and kept moving on around
much<00:05:00.840> farther<00:05:01.110> than<00:05:01.320> I<00:05:01.440> asked<00:05:01.919> but<00:05:02.310> that's

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
much farther than I asked but that's

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.909 
much farther than I asked but that's
okay<00:05:02.820> I'll<00:05:03.000> let<00:05:03.150> her<00:05:03.210> go<00:05:03.270> ahead<00:05:03.509> and<00:05:03.599> do<00:05:03.690> that

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
okay I'll let her go ahead and do that

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.050 
okay I'll let her go ahead and do that
and<00:05:04.919> I'm<00:05:05.039> gonna<00:05:05.130> push<00:05:05.370> her<00:05:05.490> back<00:05:05.699> the<00:05:05.909> other

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
and I'm gonna push her back the other

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.550 
and I'm gonna push her back the other
way<00:05:08.599> and<00:05:09.599> she's<00:05:09.930> starting<00:05:10.229> to<00:05:10.259> walk<00:05:10.469> around

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
way and she's starting to walk around

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.719

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
concerned about the whip I've moved it

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.260

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
kick-out was just kind of reaction and

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.350 
kick-out was just kind of reaction and
she's<00:05:34.980> getting<00:05:35.220> more<00:05:35.370> and<00:05:35.460> more<00:05:35.550> desensitized

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
she's getting more and more desensitized

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.450 
she's getting more and more desensitized
and<00:05:36.540> that's<00:05:37.290> not<00:05:37.470> really<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.919> reaction<00:05:38.190> that

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
and that's not really the reaction that

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.400 
and that's not really the reaction that
she<00:05:38.610> has<00:05:38.820> every<00:05:39.600> time<00:05:39.810> anymore
