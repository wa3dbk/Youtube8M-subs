00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
pretty much the exact same paint job as

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.400 
pretty much the exact same paint job as
what<00:00:29.750> I<00:00:29.779> used<00:00:30.380> on<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:31.820> battleship<00:00:32.410> same

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
what I used on the battleship same

what I used on the battleship same
colors<00:00:33.829> same<00:00:34.400> techniques<00:00:34.910> using<00:00:35.240> the<00:00:35.570> hair

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
colors same techniques using the hair

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
spray technique the only change that I

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.700 
spray technique the only change that I
made<00:00:40.100> to<00:00:40.130> this<00:00:40.520> one<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:41.720> the<00:00:41.840> only<00:00:41.960> tip<00:00:42.410> I

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
made to this one and the only tip I

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.050 
made to this one and the only tip I
would<00:00:43.370> give<00:00:43.730> is<00:00:44.380> to<00:00:45.380> do<00:00:45.620> these<00:00:45.920> lines<00:00:46.370> on<00:00:46.730> the

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
would give is to do these lines on the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.400 
would give is to do these lines on the
top<00:00:47.300> here<00:00:48.520> to<00:00:49.520> do<00:00:49.700> these<00:00:49.940> are<00:00:50.420> pretty<00:00:50.960> simple

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
top here to do these are pretty simple

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.560 
top here to do these are pretty simple
all<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.040> did<00:00:52.250> was<00:00:52.280> went<00:00:52.550> out<00:00:52.670> to<00:00:52.910> our<00:00:53.150> Bunnings

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
all I did was went out to our Bunnings

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.510 
all I did was went out to our Bunnings
which<00:00:53.780> is<00:00:53.930> a<00:00:54.050> local<00:00:54.500> hardware<00:00:54.680> store<00:00:55.250> here<00:00:55.490> in

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
which is a local hardware store here in

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.060 
which is a local hardware store here in
Australia<00:00:56.030> picked<00:00:56.720> up<00:00:56.900> some<00:00:57.350> masking<00:00:58.070> tape

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
Australia picked up some masking tape

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.310 
Australia picked up some masking tape
but<00:00:58.520> it's<00:00:58.640> a<00:00:58.700> specific<00:00:58.910> type<00:00:59.420> of<00:00:59.450> masking<00:01:00.080> tape

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
but it's a specific type of masking tape

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.280 
but it's a specific type of masking tape
and<00:01:00.500> I'll<00:01:01.040> just<00:01:01.220> grab<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:01.970> there<00:01:02.330> with<00:01:02.510> me<00:01:05.290> it's

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
and I'll just grab it there with me it's

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.380 
and I'll just grab it there with me it's
a<00:01:06.740> it's<00:01:07.009> made<00:01:07.939> by<00:01:08.150> 3m<00:01:09.010> scotch<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:11.000> it's<00:01:11.180> this

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
a it's made by 3m scotch and it's this

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.100 
a it's made by 3m scotch and it's this
stuff<00:01:11.690> here<00:01:13.270> basically<00:01:14.270> what<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:14.480> is<00:01:14.600> is<00:01:15.050> a

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
stuff here basically what it is is a

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.000 
stuff here basically what it is is a
really<00:01:15.830> fine<00:01:16.100> tape<00:01:16.580> with<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.740> not<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.770> very

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
really fine tape with a not a very

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.370 
really fine tape with a not a very
sticky<00:01:19.340> sort<00:01:19.760> of<00:01:19.820> side<00:01:20.060> to<00:01:20.360> it<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.659> it's<00:01:21.080> good

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
sticky sort of side to it and it's good

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.920 
sticky sort of side to it and it's good
for<00:01:21.409> up<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.860> three<00:01:22.190> days<00:01:22.310> on<00:01:22.970> sensitive<00:01:23.570> paint

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
for up to three days on sensitive paint

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.750 
for up to three days on sensitive paint
finishes<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:24.980> it<00:01:25.070> was<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:25.220> most<00:01:25.370> sensitive

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
finishes so it was the most sensitive

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.870 
finishes so it was the most sensitive
one<00:01:26.000> I<00:01:26.030> can<00:01:26.210> find<00:01:26.890> all<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:27.920> basically<00:01:28.250> did<00:01:28.670> for

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
one I can find all I basically did for

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.200 
one I can find all I basically did for
that<00:01:29.560> was<00:01:30.560> cut<00:01:31.070> out<00:01:31.190> two<00:01:31.430> slices<00:01:31.909> of<00:01:31.909> that

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
that was cut out two slices of that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.810 
that was cut out two slices of that
quite<00:01:32.600> thin<00:01:32.900> laid<00:01:33.710> them<00:01:33.890> down<00:01:33.920> either<00:01:34.430> side<00:01:34.580> of

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
quite thin laid them down either side of

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.140 
quite thin laid them down either side of
here<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.659> then<00:01:35.810> masked<00:01:36.110> off<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.590> ends<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.150> too

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
here and then masked off the ends so too

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.360 
here and then masked off the ends so too
thin<00:01:38.450> strips<00:01:38.780> down<00:01:38.960> like<00:01:39.229> that<00:01:39.440> then<00:01:39.950> dry

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
thin strips down like that then dry

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.050 
thin strips down like that then dry
brushed<00:01:40.760> with<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.870> ivory<00:01:42.560> white<00:01:42.850> along<00:01:43.850> those

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
brushed with a ivory white along those

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.430 
brushed with a ivory white along those
areas<00:01:44.479> now<00:01:44.630> there<00:01:44.750> isn't<00:01:44.870> why<00:01:44.990> I<00:01:45.050> did<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.260> dry

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
areas now there isn't why I did the dry

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.230 
areas now there isn't why I did the dry
brushing<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:45.950> could<00:01:46.100> paint<00:01:46.400> a<00:01:46.580> straight<00:01:47.000> line

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
brushing you could paint a straight line

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.990 
brushing you could paint a straight line
however<00:01:47.990> if<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.320> do<00:01:48.560> do<00:01:49.040> that<00:01:49.250> or<00:01:49.460> stand<00:01:49.790> out

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
however if you do do that or stand out

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.719 
however if you do do that or stand out
like<00:01:50.180> dogs<00:01:50.810> balls<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.460> won't<00:01:52.460> give<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.670> the

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
like dogs balls and won't give you the

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.250 
like dogs balls and won't give you the
effect<00:01:53.030> you're<00:01:53.180> after<00:01:53.360> particularly<00:01:54.110> not

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
tying it in with the rest of the model

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.030 
tying it in with the rest of the model
that<00:01:55.909> sir<00:01:56.150> that's<00:01:56.630> quite<00:01:56.840> weathered<00:01:57.380> as<00:01:57.530> you

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
that sir that's quite weathered as you

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.969 
that sir that's quite weathered as you
can<00:01:58.190> see<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:59.150> try<00:01:59.479> brushed<00:01:59.780> it<00:01:59.960> up<00:02:00.080> then<00:02:00.650> once<00:02:00.890> i

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
can see so try brushed it up then once i

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.710 
can see so try brushed it up then once i
was<00:02:01.070> finished<00:02:01.130> left<00:02:01.760> all<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.030> tape<00:02:02.270> on<00:02:02.479> there

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
was finished left all the tape on there

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.200 
was finished left all the tape on there
got<00:02:02.900> a<00:02:02.930> thin<00:02:03.229> brush<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:03.890> just<00:02:04.130> literally<00:02:04.549> went

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
got a thin brush and just literally went

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.690 
got a thin brush and just literally went
across<00:02:05.390> with<00:02:05.720> with<00:02:06.229> black<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:07.460> put<00:02:07.610> the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
across with with black to put the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.880 
across with with black to put the
various<00:02:08.000> lines<00:02:08.239> let<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:08.959> dry<00:02:09.170> pull<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.709> tape

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
various lines let it dry pull the tape

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.910 
various lines let it dry pull the tape
off<00:02:10.069> and<00:02:10.429> job<00:02:11.090> was<00:02:11.269> done<00:02:11.450> it's<00:02:12.140> probably<00:02:12.769> the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
off and job was done it's probably the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.129 
off and job was done it's probably the
easiest<00:02:13.279> way<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.579> get<00:02:13.849> nice<00:02:14.090> straight<00:02:14.540> lines<00:02:14.840> I

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:15.139 
easiest way to get nice straight lines I

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.160 
easiest way to get nice straight lines I
was<00:02:16.010> going<00:02:16.189> to<00:02:16.249> use<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.400> similar<00:02:16.670> tech

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
was going to use a similar tech

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.750 
was going to use a similar tech
make<00:02:17.260> for<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.500> lines<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.220> like<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.610> can

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
make for the lines and the like you can

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.120 
make for the lines and the like you can
see<00:02:18.910> on<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.150> hull<00:02:19.530> however<00:02:20.530> given<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.890> i<00:02:21.040> was

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
see on the hull however given that i was

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.710 
see on the hull however given that i was
going<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.340> whether<00:02:21.550> them<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.000> fatigue<00:02:22.450> them

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
going to whether them and fatigue them

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.380 
going to whether them and fatigue them
and<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.530> there<00:02:23.739> are<00:02:23.980> defined<00:02:24.610> lines<00:02:24.940> along

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
and that there are defined lines along

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.300 
and that there are defined lines along
the<00:02:25.569> side<00:02:25.810> i<00:02:25.840> didn't<00:02:26.380> use<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.739> technique<00:02:27.160> for

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
the side i didn't use that technique for

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.830 
the side i didn't use that technique for
that<00:02:27.459> just<00:02:27.640> free<00:02:27.880> handed<00:02:28.209> them<00:02:28.330> all<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.660> i

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
that just free handed them all on i

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.100 
that just free handed them all on i
think<00:02:29.319> it<00:02:29.500> came<00:02:29.650> out<00:02:29.950> pretty<00:02:30.190> effective

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
think it came out pretty effective

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.590 
think it came out pretty effective
anyway<00:02:32.110> that's<00:02:32.440> not<00:02:32.680> that's<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.069> carrier

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
anyway that's not that's the carrier

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.460 
anyway that's not that's the carrier
pretty<00:02:34.600> happy<00:02:34.750> with<00:02:34.870> how<00:02:34.959> it<00:02:35.080> turned<00:02:35.170> out

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
pretty happy with how it turned out

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.530 
pretty happy with how it turned out
again<00:02:35.890> pretty<00:02:36.489> quick<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:36.880> easy<00:02:37.000> paint<00:02:37.330> job

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
again pretty quick and easy paint job

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.470 
again pretty quick and easy paint job
didn't<00:02:37.959> take<00:02:38.050> too<00:02:38.230> long<00:02:38.489> all<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.670> best<00:02:39.819> thanks

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
didn't take too long all the best thanks

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.900
