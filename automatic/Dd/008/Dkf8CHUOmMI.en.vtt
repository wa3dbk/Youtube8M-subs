00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.560
 I 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.600
 to make known the name of you 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.899
 I'm just going to read the question so 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.880
 well let's go with the next one that says 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.969
 phantom doctor where I ask the girl 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.700
 I like to be my girlfriend this good 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.319
 it was pretty easy what you have to 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.079
 do depending on how old you are 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:45.020
 You can ask her to invite her to eat 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.990
 invite her out and you can ask her to 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.119
 be your girlfriend and there in a restaurant or 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.649
 it can be in a park 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.299
 you have to take into account that it is 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.520
 the place where you are going to ask this 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.729
 girl that you like to be your girlfriend 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.920
 will mark you for life 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.229
 there where are you going to ask whenever 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.770
 you pass as long as you already 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.690
 say that so after truth but if the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.429
 next time you go through there they go to 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.160
 say oh here was where I asked you to be 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.160
 my girlfriend you remember 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.010
 several days several months then 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.330
 that place will mark us enough to 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.250
 all of life so you have to have 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.980
 very careful to choose a place that 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.220
 be nice do not go pick it close 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.160
 where there is a dumpster or near 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.040
 somewhere like that as well as half ugly 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.770
 you will not say it near a cemetery 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.290
 then the best thing is that you invite him to 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.210
 eating does not have to be something expensive 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.000
 invite her to eat you can invite her to 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.880
 cinema after leaving the cinema you can 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.860
 invite her to eat an ice cream or something and there 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.350
 is where you can act to take advantage of 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.850
 ask him to be your girlfriend and in the case of 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.430
 women there are also women that 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.860
 they are the first to tell the guy 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.750
 that is her boyfriend then there is nothing 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.760
 bad that the lad asks you first 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.920
 the boy who is your boyfriend can choose 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.260
 a nice place where I do not recommend you 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.500
 that you do it is in a place where there 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.400
 a lot of noise where there is too much 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.260
 noise many cars a lot many things 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.750
 that can distract you because in that you 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.000
 you are there telling him saying atocha 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.690
 go look that I like a lot that I want 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.489
 that you are my girlfriend and then suddenly 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.640
 pass a trailer or something and doing 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.020
 too much noise then it will distract and 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.560
 will break the magic of the moment 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.590
 so be careful, do that in a 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.959
 place that is more or less romantic and a 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.120
 park a in the cinema can be in a 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.180
 restaurant can be in her house 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.209
 if you cheer in front of the dads 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.090
 then do it in a nice place 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:56.049
 better if you 're giving it a little detail 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.569
 I know a ring can be a bracelet and not 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:01.510
 it has to be from those gold rings or 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.440
 so golden bracelets expensive but there are 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.560
 of those pretty bracelets 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.920
 that they are as well as fabric others are 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.950
 so colors then they can be 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.350
 those bracelets or those like leather 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.060
 they have ornaments and pretty there are enough 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.340
 bracelets and pretty you can give 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.890
 so that at that moment you are not alone 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.170
 asking to be your girlfriend or your boyfriend 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:29.070
 but you are giving them something that 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.590
 every time you wear it you will think 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.830
 in you then I hope you have them 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.830
