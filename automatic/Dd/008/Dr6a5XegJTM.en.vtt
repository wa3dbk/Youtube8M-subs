00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
fact that this was implemented in the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.080 
fact that this was implemented in the
game<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> rocket<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.700> actually

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
entirely sure of how reliable as an

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.050 
entirely sure of how reliable as an
anti-vehicle<00:01:26.040> role<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.640> makes<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
engineer now just like the mana turrets

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.030 
engineer now just like the mana turrets
it<00:01:30.570> takes<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.930> little<00:01:31.020> while<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.409> set<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.799> turd

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
it takes a little while to set this turd

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.130 
it takes a little while to set this turd
up<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.700> there<00:01:33.150> are<00:01:33.270> places<00:01:33.540> where<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.930> can

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
up and there are places where you can

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.810 
up and there are places where you can
set<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:34.770> which<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.490> something

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
set it up at all which is something

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.429

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
assault has more options and more

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.469 
assault has more options and more
reliable<00:01:57.990> options<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.369> as<00:01:59.579> far<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.149> tell

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
reliable options so as far as I can tell

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.440 
reliable options so as far as I can tell
this<00:02:01.350> doesn't<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:02.040> make<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.729> big<00:02:02.850> change<00:02:03.030> in

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
this doesn't really make a big change in

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.749 
this doesn't really make a big change in
balance<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> game<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:05.250> think<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
balance of the game and I think that's a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.429 
balance of the game and I think that's a
basically<00:02:06.630> that's<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.840> good<00:02:07.020> thing<00:02:07.229> because

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
basically that's a good thing because

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.300 
basically that's a good thing because
obviously<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.700> heavy<00:02:09.030> assault<00:02:09.590> role<00:02:10.590> as<00:02:10.890> anti

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
obviously the heavy assault role as anti

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.550 
obviously the heavy assault role as anti
vehicle<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:12.270> not<00:02:12.390> being<00:02:12.780> diminished<00:02:13.110> by<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
vehicle is not being diminished by the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.740 
vehicle is not being diminished by the
this<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:14.099> engineer<00:02:14.580> class<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:15.000> still<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> sort

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
this the engineer class is still a sort

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.220 
this the engineer class is still a sort
of<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.930> support<00:02:16.410> rule<00:02:16.739> in<00:02:17.130> pleasure<00:02:17.520> too<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
of a support rule in pleasure too and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.449 
of a support rule in pleasure too and
I'm<00:02:19.230> pretty<00:02:19.440> sure<00:02:19.530> that's<00:02:19.830> how<00:02:19.980> they<00:02:20.130> want<00:02:20.310> it

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
I'm pretty sure that's how they want it

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.880 
I'm pretty sure that's how they want it
and<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.940> have<00:02:21.030> no<00:02:21.120> problem<00:02:21.270> with<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.569> myself

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
and I have no problem with that myself

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.680 
and I have no problem with that myself
so<00:02:22.890> we're<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> bunch<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.880> guys<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:24.300> up<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.569> the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
so we're a bunch of guys here up on the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.600 
so we're a bunch of guys here up on the
cliff<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:25.080> consortium<00:02:25.770> outfit<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.459> we're

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
cliff in consortium outfit and we're

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.780 
cliff in consortium outfit and we're
here<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.940> test<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:27.860> manna<00:02:28.860> turret<00:02:29.220> or<00:02:29.400> not

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
here to test this manna turret or not

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.270 
here to test this manna turret or not
matter<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.390> anti-vehicle<00:02:30.959> turret<00:02:31.380> but<00:02:32.160> we

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
matter this anti-vehicle turret but we

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.610 
matter this anti-vehicle turret but we
all<00:02:32.400> agree<00:02:32.700> that<00:02:32.840> we<00:02:33.840> might<00:02:34.019> as<00:02:34.110> well<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.470> to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
all agree that we might as well just to

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.309 
all agree that we might as well just to
stick<00:02:34.800> with<00:02:34.980> heavy<00:02:35.160> assault<00:02:35.459> for

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
stick with heavy assault for

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.759 
stick with heavy assault for
anti-vehicle<00:02:37.319> class<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.980> if<00:02:38.760> we<00:02:38.940> wanted<00:02:39.209> to

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
anti-vehicle class and if we wanted to

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.770 
anti-vehicle class and if we wanted to
just<00:02:40.769> stay<00:02:41.099> here<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.370> spam<00:02:41.970> rockets<00:02:42.390> down<00:02:42.569> on

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
just stay here and spam rockets down on

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.110 
just stay here and spam rockets down on
the<00:02:43.050> server<00:02:43.260> damn<00:02:43.440> station<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:44.459> could<00:02:44.730> do<00:02:44.910> this

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
the server damn station we could do this

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.960 
the server damn station we could do this
with<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.959> annihilators<00:02:46.620> just<00:02:46.950> as<00:02:47.040> well<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.640> it

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
with the annihilators just as well so it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.550 
with the annihilators just as well so it
doesn't<00:02:48.360> really<00:02:48.450> change<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:49.049> game<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.290> any

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
doesn't really change the game in any

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.400 
doesn't really change the game in any
way<00:02:49.739> but<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:50.850> definitely<00:02:51.030> fun<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.989> use<00:02:52.200> this

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
way but it is definitely fun to use this

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.850 
way but it is definitely fun to use this
turret<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.790> am<00:02:54.120> saving<00:02:54.450> up<00:02:54.660> for<00:02:54.860> thousands

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
turret and I am saving up for thousands

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.660 
turret and I am saving up for thousands
oats<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.250> buy<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.830> I'm<00:02:58.830> gonna<00:02:59.310> try<00:02:59.610> to

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
oats to buy it and I'm gonna try to

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.660 
oats to buy it and I'm gonna try to
learn<00:03:00.569> how<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.750> use<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.110> better<00:03:01.349> it<00:03:02.190> kind<00:03:02.580> of

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
learn how to use this better it kind of

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.110 
learn how to use this better it kind of
reminds<00:03:03.060> me<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.330> one<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.950> well<00:03:05.640> one<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:06.000> the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
reminds me of one of the well one of the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.300 
reminds me of one of the well one of the
only<00:03:06.390> rocket<00:03:06.959> launches<00:03:07.380> in<00:03:07.530> any<00:03:07.769> game<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.069> I

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
only rocket launches in any game that I

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.400 
only rocket launches in any game that I
have<00:03:08.519> actually<00:03:09.120> enjoyed<00:03:09.269> using<00:03:09.780> which<00:03:10.260> is

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
have actually enjoyed using which is

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.370 
have actually enjoyed using which is
called<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.709> 84<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:11.910> was<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.420> battlefield

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
called the 84 this was in battlefield

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.350 
called the 84 this was in battlefield
bad<00:03:13.560> company<00:03:13.769> 2<00:03:14.160> yeah<00:03:14.790> I'm<00:03:14.849> sure<00:03:15.030> you've<00:03:15.209> all

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
bad company 2 yeah I'm sure you've all

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.710 
bad company 2 yeah I'm sure you've all
heard<00:03:15.390> about<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:15.840> game<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:18.000> has<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.450> lot

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
heard about this game and it has a lot

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.199 
heard about this game and it has a lot
of<00:03:18.750> similarities<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.700> not<00:03:20.910> nearly

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
of similarities to that it is not nearly

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.990 
of similarities to that it is not nearly
as<00:03:21.390> effective<00:03:21.810> because<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.400> limitations

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
as effective because of the limitations

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.840 
as effective because of the limitations
of<00:03:24.120> having<00:03:24.570> this<00:03:24.690> on<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.900> stationary<00:03:25.850> turret

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
of having this on a stationary turret

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.580 
of having this on a stationary turret
but<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.180> am<00:03:27.480> definitely<00:03:27.660> going<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.140> get<00:03:28.230> this<00:03:28.440> to

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
but I am definitely going to get this to

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.030 
but I am definitely going to get this to
it<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:29.100> play<00:03:29.760> engineer<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.049> my<00:03:31.230> my

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
it I play engineer and this is my my

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.259 
it I play engineer and this is my my
role<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.150> as<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.900> now<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.700> yeah<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.120> the

role so as of now and yeah this is the

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.020 
role so as of now and yeah this is the
most<00:03:36.890> interesting<00:03:37.890> upgrade<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.700> I<00:03:38.819> can

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
most interesting upgrade that I can

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.280 
most interesting upgrade that I can
actually<00:03:39.180> think<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.630> right<00:03:39.810> now<00:03:39.840> for<00:03:40.170> my

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
actually think of right now for my

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.229 
actually think of right now for my
infantry<00:03:40.709> gameplay<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.609> anyway<00:03:42.060> people

infantry gameplay so anyway people

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.990 
infantry gameplay so anyway people
that's<00:03:42.600> all<00:03:42.840> there<00:03:43.319> would<00:03:43.560> be<00:03:43.590> more<00:03:44.370> gameplay

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
that's all there would be more gameplay

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.120 
that's all there would be more gameplay
with<00:03:45.359> this<00:03:45.510> turret<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.079> future<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:47.100> please

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
with this turret in the future so please

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.819 
with this turret in the future so please
stay<00:03:47.549> tuned<00:03:47.700> for<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.530> yeah<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.560> hope<00:03:49.680> you
