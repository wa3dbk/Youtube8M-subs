00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.020
Good morning!

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.990
You're full of energy.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.560
Good morning!

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.660
Did you sleep?

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.500
Yeah, I did!

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.230
Good morning then!

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.100
Good morning!
Good morning then!

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.900
I slept!

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.800
It's 6!

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.500
Yup!
It's 6!

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.140
You're full of energy...

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.740
Are you okay?

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.240
I slept well! But I'm super ugly without 
make-up so got up early to do it.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.440
You wanted to "girl up" a bit?

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.680
Exactly.
You wanted to "girl up" a bit?

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.810
The make-up's gonna wear off after a while.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.120
So I made sure to do it properly.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.920
First for 6 AM, we've got the breakfast dice.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.850
Yaay!
First for 6 AM, we've got the breakfast dice.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.460
This is our meal dice.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.160
I'm getting nervous for my first!

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.760
Do you know which one you want?

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.590
Sushiro!

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.430
Sushiro's actually not open yet...

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.870
So we'll have to think about how to handle that.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.900
But you're gonna do something about it right?

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.970
Coz I'm gonna get Sushiro!

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.410
Okay.
Coz I'm gonna get Sushiro!

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.210
Here I go!

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.080
Number 5!

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.180
Convenience store bento!
Convenience store bento!

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.080
That's a pretty decent one, no?

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.180
It is.
That's a pretty decent one, no?

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.620
Yaaaay!

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.520
What a start!

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.460
There's an explanation on the back, 
so please read it out.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.040
I just slept and woke up but,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.440
I'm super happy about this!

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.010
Convenience store bento!

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.810
I'm feeling very lucky!

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.480
Aren't I lucky that this is my first roll?

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.180
Definitely.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.910
Right?
Definitely.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.850
This is great!

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.720
Check this out.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.720
Look.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.550
This fish is...

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.320
It's just a normal bento!
This fish is...

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.220
This is all you get!

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.660
Why?

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.290
Oh, it's warm!

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.260
Here we go!

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.910
Rice sure is delicious!

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.910
I just remembered Megwin telling me

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.250
that it's difficult when you get something plain.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.220
He told me I'll start enjoying the tough ones.
