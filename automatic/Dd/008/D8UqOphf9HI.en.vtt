00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.620
 and very good to everyone here dragon suffers 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.120
 with a new video and this time I bring you 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.130
 how to enter the game 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.090
 hitman absolution for pc ok let's start 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.980
 first of all we go to the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.050
 description of the video and we download 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.970
 the torrent file 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.830
 Once downloaded, we execute it in the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.650
 luto rent and we wait for you to 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.289
 download the game 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.809
 ok when we have the game downloaded 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.940
 we go to the folder where it has been 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.840
 downloaded I left it in the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.820
 desk to have to facilitate 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.790
 things go go 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.699
 we open and assemble the only disc that 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.309
 have in a virtual unit I use 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.629
 daemon tools but you can use the 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.629
 Ultraism too if you want 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.980
 riding image 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.770
 and we give you to run set 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.420
 we choose the language 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.270
 next here we choose the destination 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.320
 where we want the game to be installed 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.420
 I leave it by default 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.700
 here 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.470
 when we look for it in the start bar 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.470
 what name to put 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.790
 but not even with the desk like this 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.310
 install 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.280
 ok surely 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.350
 you see a transition until it is 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.350
 about to finish installing 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.649
 good as you can see the game and it's 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.649
 about to finish the installation 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.720
 if it has taken you long enough not 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.720
 worry that me too 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.440
 good 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.620
 so we would finish the installation 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.970
 pretty simple 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.269
 I'm not going to run the game because with 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.150
 the singing would not tax me anymore, it was lived 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.909
 with a lot of sound but not the game in 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.069
 any case now I would put another recorder and 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.069
 I would teach you that the game works 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.160
 ok I tried it and it does not work because 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.340
 I have left one thing that is to put the 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.310
 crack 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:21.040
 and when I go to the team and open the unit 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.300
 where I have mounted the virtual disk 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.530
 green than a folder called ski 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.900
 draw 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.130
 I of you what I would do is 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.660
 eliminate it and since you examined it and 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.930
 folders that in principle would be the 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.120
 crack they have virus therefore I tried 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.720
 she that you have the file or is this 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.069
 folder but if not the first thing that you 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.030
 I would recommend doing is eliminate this 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:49.200
 folder is worth and we close this and 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:54.080
 we open team 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.080
 and we go to where we have installed the game 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.709
 and now we go 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.599
 to the description of the video and we 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.440
 we unload the crack that I will have left you 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.730
 there 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.730
 and it's fine 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.989
 Y 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:24.360
 as for this fact and good we copy 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:28.490
 this and we paste it here we give the typical 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.529
 to move replace continue 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:35.609
 then now I would be 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:37.139
 now I will change again from recorder and 

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:39.439
 I will show you that now the game does 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.439
 what not 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.060
 as you can see the game is already 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.050
 operative with the crack that I will have 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.050
 left in the description 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.680
 this video just so you can see that the 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.040
 game works since in some others 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.070
 tutorials people said no 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:13.270
 it worked so that they have a 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:16.790
 proof that if we do not leave the game 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:20.690
 since this is not a gameplay 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:23.840
 and now it is already a like a 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.350
 comment thank you very much and thank you 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.350
 goodbye
