are the benefits of upgrading your
community<00:01:27.990> using<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.470> command<00:01:28.800> line<00:01:28.860> well

there<00:01:30.179> are<00:01:30.209> two<00:01:30.300> one<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
there are two one if you have a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.699 
there are two one if you have a
community<00:01:32.880> with<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.119> huge<00:01:33.509> database<00:01:33.780> your

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
internet or server connection might

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.680 
internet or server connection might
disconnect<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.800> timeouts<00:01:38.580> may<00:01:38.789> occur<00:01:39.090> doing

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
disconnect and timeouts may occur doing

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.499 
disconnect and timeouts may occur doing
it<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.200> default<00:01:40.380> up<00:01:40.770> great<00:01:41.069> way<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:42.090> by<00:01:42.450> using

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
it the default up great way so by using

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.540 
it the default up great way so by using
the<00:01:42.929> command<00:01:43.319> line<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.920> process<00:01:44.399> of

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
the command line the process of

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.969 
the command line the process of
upgrading<00:01:44.819> will<00:01:45.390> remove<00:01:45.959> timeout<00:01:46.619> delays

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
upgrading will remove timeout delays

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.010 
upgrading will remove timeout delays
because<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.700> are<00:01:47.789> upgrading<00:01:48.030> directly<00:01:48.899> from

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
because you are upgrading directly from

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
because you are upgrading directly from
the<00:01:49.200> server<00:01:49.440> itself<00:01:49.890> not<00:01:50.789> through<00:01:51.090> your

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the server itself not through your

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.660 
the server itself not through your
internet<00:01:51.660> connection<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.310> will<00:01:53.520> be<00:01:53.550> a

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
internet connection so it will be a

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.930 
internet connection so it will be a
smoother<00:01:54.179> process<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:56.220> second<00:01:56.580> benefit

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
smoother process and the second benefit

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.880 
smoother process and the second benefit
is<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.119> there<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> faster<00:01:58.530> than<00:01:58.739> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
is that there is a faster than the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.580 
is that there is a faster than the
default<00:01:59.069> way<00:01:59.429> and<00:01:59.700> of<00:02:00.360> course<00:02:00.420> given<00:02:01.289> that<00:02:01.440> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
default way and of course given that you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.350 
default way and of course given that you
know<00:02:01.770> what<00:02:02.069> you<00:02:02.190> are<00:02:02.280> doing<00:02:02.550> this<00:02:03.030> will<00:02:03.239> be

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
know what you are doing this will be
