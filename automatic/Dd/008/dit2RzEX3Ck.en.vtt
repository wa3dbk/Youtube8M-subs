00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
to bed you're going to bed balance so I

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.260 
to bed you're going to bed balance so I
really<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.220> analogy<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.909> somebody

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
really like this analogy that somebody

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.440 
really like this analogy that somebody
gave<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.720> me<00:01:52.159> regarding<00:01:53.159> staying<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.880> plan<00:01:54.210> or

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
gave to me regarding staying on plan or

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.030 
gave to me regarding staying on plan or
when<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.689> fall<00:01:54.960> off<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.290> wagon<00:01:55.409> or<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:55.860> that

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
when you fall off the wagon or what that

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.910 
when you fall off the wagon or what that
is<00:01:56.219> well<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:57.090> told<00:01:57.299> me<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.799> to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
is well they told me that if you have to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.190 
is well they told me that if you have to
be<00:01:59.040> at<00:01:59.130> work<00:01:59.189> at<00:01:59.490> 8<00:01:59.640> o'clock<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.780> woke<00:02:00.960> up

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
be at work at 8 o'clock and you woke up

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.899 
be at work at 8 o'clock and you woke up
and<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.680> looked<00:02:01.920> at<00:02:02.009> your<00:02:02.159> clock<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.670> said

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and you looked at your clock and it said

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.719 
and you looked at your clock and it said
it's<00:02:03.299> 8:15<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.409> wouldn't<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.860> ah<00:02:05.009> forget

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
it's 8:15 you wouldn't be like ah forget

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.429 
it's 8:15 you wouldn't be like ah forget
the<00:02:05.880> rest<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.270> day<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.420> am<00:02:06.899> NOT<00:02:06.930> going<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the rest of the day I am NOT going to

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:07.710 
the rest of the day I am NOT going to
wear

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
wear

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.260 
wear
I've<00:02:08.020> already<00:02:08.350> screwed<00:02:08.740> up<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:09.010> day<00:02:09.160> no<00:02:09.790> you

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
I've already screwed up the day no you

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.300 
I've already screwed up the day no you
would<00:02:10.390> be<00:02:10.510> doing<00:02:10.780> everything<00:02:11.470> in<00:02:11.920> your<00:02:11.950> power

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
would be doing everything in your power

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.300 
would be doing everything in your power
to<00:02:12.730> hustle<00:02:13.660> your<00:02:13.750> behind<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.620> get<00:02:14.920> up<00:02:15.040> get

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
to hustle your behind to get up get

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.220 
to hustle your behind to get up get
going<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.790> get<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.150> work<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.540> be<00:02:16.660> apologetic

going and get to work and be apologetic

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.950 
going and get to work and be apologetic
the<00:02:17.530> rest<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> day<00:02:18.070> so<00:02:18.730> think<00:02:19.060> about<00:02:19.180> your

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
the rest of the day so think about your

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.800 
the rest of the day so think about your
progress<00:02:20.590> in<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.210> weight<00:02:22.360> loss<00:02:22.390> phase

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
progress in the in the weight loss phase

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.500 
progress in the in the weight loss phase
of<00:02:22.960> this<00:02:23.080> program<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.400> once<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.150> made<00:02:25.360> an

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
of this program so once that you made an

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.260 
of this program so once that you made an
off<00:02:25.660> plan<00:02:25.990> choice<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:27.070> get<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.550> get<00:02:27.730> back<00:02:28.000> on

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
off plan choice you get to get back on

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.630 
off plan choice you get to get back on
as<00:02:28.600> fast<00:02:29.140> as<00:02:29.490> possible

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
as fast as possible

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.480 
as fast as possible
because<00:02:31.150> knowing<00:02:31.740> what<00:02:32.740> most<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.160> us<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.400> are

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
because knowing what most of us that are

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.330 
because knowing what most of us that are
on<00:02:33.520> this<00:02:33.730> program<00:02:34.150> we<00:02:34.840> continually<00:02:35.830> made<00:02:36.130> bad

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
on this program we continually made bad

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.610 
on this program we continually made bad
choices<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:37.060> then<00:02:37.510> at<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.780> point<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.410> is

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
choices and then at that point that is

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.400 
choices and then at that point that is
why<00:02:38.800> we<00:02:39.280> found<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.090> program<00:02:40.330> because<00:02:40.900> we

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
why we found this program because we

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.590 
why we found this program because we
were<00:02:41.710> not<00:02:41.890> good<00:02:42.160> at<00:02:42.340> getting<00:02:42.640> back<00:02:43.030> on<00:02:43.300> the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
were not good at getting back on the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.350 
were not good at getting back on the
wagon<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.590> just<00:02:45.070> remember<00:02:45.370> if<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:46.060> ate<00:02:46.210> off

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
wagon so just remember if you ate off

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.270 
wagon so just remember if you ate off
plan<00:02:46.660> it's<00:02:46.930> just<00:02:47.170> like<00:02:47.320> waking<00:02:47.680> up<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.100> the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
plan it's just like waking up to the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.730 
plan it's just like waking up to the
alarm<00:02:48.610> clock<00:02:48.880> being<00:02:49.360> later<00:02:50.050> than<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.530> thought

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
alarm clock being later than you thought

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.740 
alarm clock being later than you thought
it<00:02:50.890> was<00:02:51.010> gonna<00:02:51.130> be<00:02:51.310> just<00:02:51.790> get<00:02:52.060> back<00:02:52.300> on<00:02:52.510> as<00:02:52.720> soon

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
it was gonna be just get back on as soon

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.960 
it was gonna be just get back on as soon
as<00:02:53.050> possible<00:02:53.680> because<00:02:54.220> this<00:02:54.490> gets<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.940> be

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
as possible because this gets to be

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.540 
as possible because this gets to be
about<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.570> rest<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:56.020> your<00:02:56.140> life<00:02:56.410> not<00:02:57.070> about

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
about the rest of your life not about

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.870 
about the rest of your life not about
tomorrow<00:02:58.510> morning<00:02:58.750> or<00:02:59.230> next<00:02:59.950> Monday<00:03:00.160> because

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
tomorrow morning or next Monday because

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.050 
tomorrow morning or next Monday because
you<00:03:01.270> deserve<00:03:01.960> it<00:03:01.990> to<00:03:02.530> be<00:03:02.680> bigger<00:03:03.010> than<00:03:03.550> your

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
you deserve it to be bigger than your

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.110 
you deserve it to be bigger than your
negative<00:03:04.510> choices<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.650> get<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.160> be<00:03:06.310> thin<00:03:06.640> or

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
negative choices you get to be thin or

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.570 
negative choices you get to be thin or
healthy<00:03:07.990> or<00:03:08.170> just<00:03:09.010> feeling<00:03:09.340> good<00:03:09.460> about

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
healthy or just feeling good about

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.600 
healthy or just feeling good about
yourself<00:03:09.820> whatever<00:03:10.570> your<00:03:11.080> reason<00:03:11.620> is<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.459> be

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
yourself whatever your reason is to be

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.390 
yourself whatever your reason is to be
doing<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.180> program<00:03:13.690> for<00:03:14.050> me<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.470> is<00:03:14.620> liking

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
doing this program for me it is liking

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.979 
doing this program for me it is liking
what<00:03:15.550> I<00:03:15.580> see<00:03:15.880> in<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.090> mirror<00:03:16.360> of<00:03:16.540> course<00:03:16.840> is

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
what I see in the mirror of course is

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.570 
what I see in the mirror of course is
the<00:03:17.080> easy<00:03:17.260> answer<00:03:17.680> but<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:17.950> second<00:03:18.370> is

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
the easy answer but the second is

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.520 
the easy answer but the second is
getting<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.390> run<00:03:19.540> around<00:03:19.690> with<00:03:19.959> my<00:03:20.110> children

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
getting to run around with my children

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.260 
getting to run around with my children
when<00:03:20.860> they're<00:03:21.100> playing<00:03:21.400> soccer<00:03:21.730> or<00:03:21.940> baseball
