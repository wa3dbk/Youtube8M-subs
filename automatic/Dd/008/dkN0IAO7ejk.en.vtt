00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.600
 someone show you how you 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.330
 because this stabilizer burned in the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.940
 stabilizer that died yesterday in 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.670
 arrival of an ointment 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.039
 if you notice are not being 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.210
 neighbor 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.820
 So you the first thing that is going to have 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.560
 that turning him around observes that 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.060
 Also here you will have to open open 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.470
 here for this part here on the side 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.460
 left 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.460
 you open it 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:56.059
 after you open it to you you will 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:59.059
 have to remove that small lamp 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.059
 hence 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.830
 After you've retired, you realize that I 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.509
 she is burned 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.200
 The burn will discard it, it does not go there. 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.810
 inside 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.890
 so this is just an exchange of 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.630
 lamp does not need you to throw away the 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.420
 other lamp reserve is here 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:33.430
 inside you're just gonna have to take it off 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:35.790
 carefully remove it carefully. 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.790
 do not break 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:55.440
 so you took this one is new 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.710
 the only thing you'll have to do 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:09.459
 here is fit here where it was old 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:11.680
 will fit well fit 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.760
 snaps tight as soon as you 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.910
 fitted 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.910
 You go there and you will put 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.580
 take a look 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:38.069
 is already on and off and one on 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.450
