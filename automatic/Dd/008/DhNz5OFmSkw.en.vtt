keyboard<00:00:33.440> alright<00:00:35.960> so<00:00:37.819> where<00:00:38.819> we<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.120> this

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
keyboard alright so where we have this

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.849 
keyboard alright so where we have this
working<00:00:39.839> is<00:00:40.670> this<00:00:41.670> regular<00:00:41.940> motorola<00:00:42.859> wall

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:43.859 
working is this regular motorola wall

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.529 
working is this regular motorola wall
charger<00:00:44.429> USB<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:46.370> we<00:00:47.370> got<00:00:47.519> some<00:00:47.699> USB<00:00:47.969> cable

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
charger USB and we got some USB cable

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.849 
charger USB and we got some USB cable
coming<00:00:48.749> down<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:51.030> comes<00:00:51.479> over<00:00:52.109> to<00:00:52.379> my

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
coming down and that comes over to my

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.639 
coming down and that comes over to my
sparkfun<00:00:53.519> breakout<00:00:54.299> board<00:00:54.569> for<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> micro<00:00:55.170> USB

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
sparkfun breakout board for a micro USB

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.879 
sparkfun breakout board for a micro USB
now<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.519> ID<00:00:56.729> pin<00:00:57.179> I<00:00:57.389> do<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.960> shorted<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.879 --> 00:00:58.889 
now the ID pin I do have shorted to

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:03.259 
now the ID pin I do have shorted to
ground<00:00:59.120> but<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.749> is<00:01:00.780> no<00:01:01.079> ID<00:01:01.609> pin<00:01:02.609> detection

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
ground but there is no ID pin detection

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.529 
ground but there is no ID pin detection
going<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.839> in<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> kernel<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.539> actually

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
going on in the kernel so it actually

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.219 
going on in the kernel so it actually
has<00:01:06.960> no<00:01:07.259> effect<00:01:07.590> whatsoever<00:01:08.750> but<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:10.020> is

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
has no effect whatsoever but this is

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.740 
has no effect whatsoever but this is
kind<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.500> performing<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.009> y<00:01:11.250> function<00:01:11.969> as<00:01:12.659> you

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
kind of performing a y function as you

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.429 
kind of performing a y function as you
can<00:01:12.899> see<00:01:13.110> we're<00:01:13.289> coming<00:01:13.560> off<00:01:13.909> to<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> female

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
can see we're coming off to a female

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.889 
can see we're coming off to a female
which<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.469> then<00:01:16.829> just<00:01:17.219> my<00:01:17.969> USB<00:01:18.420> keyboard

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
which is then just my USB keyboard

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:33.420 
which is then just my USB keyboard
plugged<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.880> now<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.450> up<00:01:26.149> and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.600 

hello<00:01:34.480> world<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.720> keyboard<00:01:39.710> is<00:01:39.890> actually

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
hello world so the keyboard is actually

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.400 
hello world so the keyboard is actually
working<00:01:40.820> an<00:01:41.450> unlock<00:01:42.520> so<00:01:43.520> now<00:01:44.510> what's<00:01:44.930> really

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
working an unlock so now what's really

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.560 
working an unlock so now what's really
strange<00:01:46.130> at<00:01:46.400> this<00:01:46.550> point<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:50.090> order<00:01:50.450> of

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
strange at this point is the order of

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.480 
strange at this point is the order of
operations<00:01:50.690> as<00:01:51.470> far<00:01:51.680> as<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:51.950> get<00:01:52.100> this<00:01:52.280> guy<00:01:52.460> to

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
operations as far as to get this guy to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.720 
operations as far as to get this guy to
turn<00:01:52.820> on<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.300> nut<00:01:53.450> in<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:54.440> nope<00:01:54.980> nut<00:01:55.220> I

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
turn on and nut in the nope nut I

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.270 
turn on and nut in the nope nut I
compiled<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.450> kernel<00:01:56.840> as<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.050> host<00:01:57.770> but<00:01:58.100> for

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
compiled the kernel as a host but for

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.910 
compiled the kernel as a host but for
some<00:01:58.490> reason<00:01:58.880> it'll<00:01:59.150> still<00:01:59.570> go<00:02:00.320> from<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.650> device

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
some reason it'll still go from a device

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.180 
some reason it'll still go from a device
to<00:02:00.950> be<00:02:01.340> device<00:02:01.670> if<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:03.380> kind<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.710> plug<00:02:03.920> things

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
to be device if you kind of plug things

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.280 
to be device if you kind of plug things
in<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.490> wrong<00:02:04.670> order<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.780> it's<00:02:05.990> kind<00:02:06.230> of

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
in the wrong order so it's kind of

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.410 
in the wrong order so it's kind of
finicky<00:02:06.590> as<00:02:06.860> far<00:02:07.070> as<00:02:07.190> that<00:02:07.310> goes<00:02:07.370> so<00:02:08.240> there's<00:02:08.390> a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
finicky as far as that goes so there's a

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.850 
finicky as far as that goes so there's a
lot<00:02:08.600> of<00:02:08.630> work<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.020> needs<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.260> be<00:02:09.350> done<00:02:09.590> there

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
lot of work that needs to be done there

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.920 
lot of work that needs to be done there
and<00:02:10.130> obviously<00:02:10.910> it's<00:02:11.210> plugged<00:02:11.420> into<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.750> wall

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
and obviously it's plugged into the wall

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.070 
and obviously it's plugged into the wall
don't<00:02:12.500> have<00:02:12.740> v<00:02:13.340> bus<00:02:13.580> working<00:02:14.510> able<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.960> be

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
don't have v bus working able to be

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.820 
don't have v bus working able to be
turned<00:02:15.350> on<00:02:15.560> at<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:15.980> point<00:02:16.420> once<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.680> get<00:02:18.680> it

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
turned on at this point once I get it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.110 
turned on at this point once I get it
working<00:02:19.220> chances<00:02:19.580> are<00:02:19.700> it's<00:02:19.850> going<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.030> be<00:02:20.090> a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
working chances are it's going to be a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.970 
working chances are it's going to be a
manual<00:02:20.570> thing<00:02:20.840> it's<00:02:21.020> not<00:02:21.170> going<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.380> be<00:02:21.530> again

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
manual thing it's not going to be again

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.430 
manual thing it's not going to be again
no<00:02:22.280> I<00:02:22.310> deep<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:23.000> sensing<00:02:23.570> actually<00:02:24.290> have<00:02:24.380> a

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
no I deep in sensing actually have a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.340 
no I deep in sensing actually have a
feeling<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.400> not<00:02:25.580> even<00:02:25.850> hooked<00:02:25.970> up<00:02:26.350> so

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
feeling that it's not even hooked up so

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.090 
feeling that it's not even hooked up so
that's<00:02:28.190> where<00:02:28.430> we're<00:02:28.610> at<00:02:28.700> right<00:02:29.030> now
