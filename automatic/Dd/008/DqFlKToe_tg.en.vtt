is Zack and in this video I'm gonna be

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.259 
is Zack and in this video I'm gonna be
building<00:00:06.730> a<00:00:07.150> gate<00:00:07.889> so<00:00:08.889> gates<00:00:09.339> are<00:00:09.669> a<00:00:09.999> little

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:10.269 
building a gate so gates are a little

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.850 
building a gate so gates are a little
tricky<00:00:10.570> as<00:00:10.839> you<00:00:10.929> can<00:00:11.080> see<00:00:11.230> I've<00:00:11.320> been<00:00:11.499> chopping

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
tricky as you can see I've been chopping

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.680 
tricky as you can see I've been chopping
up<00:00:11.950> a<00:00:12.039> bunch<00:00:12.280> of<00:00:12.429> wood<00:00:12.639> collected<00:00:13.150> more<00:00:13.360> trees

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
up a bunch of wood collected more trees

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.770 
up a bunch of wood collected more trees
and<00:00:13.900> all<00:00:14.019> of<00:00:14.169> that<00:00:14.200> now<00:00:15.099> over<00:00:15.849> here<00:00:15.879> is<00:00:16.480> where

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
and all of that now over here is where

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.140 
and all of that now over here is where
we<00:00:16.840> last<00:00:17.290> left<00:00:17.800> off<00:00:18.010> our<00:00:18.190> fans<00:00:18.550> and<00:00:18.730> as<00:00:18.880> you<00:00:19.000> can

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
we last left off our fans and as you can

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.150 
we last left off our fans and as you can
see<00:00:19.180> I<00:00:19.360> kind<00:00:20.170> of<00:00:20.260> extended<00:00:20.620> it<00:00:20.770> all<00:00:20.950> the<00:00:21.070> way

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
see I kind of extended it all the way

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.300 
see I kind of extended it all the way
around<00:00:21.250> there<00:00:21.700> so<00:00:21.940> you<00:00:22.030> can<00:00:22.330> see<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.890> gone

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
around there so you can see it's gone

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.730 
around there so you can see it's gone
all<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:24.580> way<00:00:24.610> around<00:00:24.730> my<00:00:25.090> crops<00:00:25.840> which<00:00:26.560> are

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
all the way around my crops which are

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.950 
all the way around my crops which are
growing<00:00:27.220> quite<00:00:27.460> nicely<00:00:27.700> but<00:00:28.330> now<00:00:28.510> we<00:00:28.570> want<00:00:28.870> to

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
growing quite nicely but now we want to

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.920 
growing quite nicely but now we want to
put<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.170> gate<00:00:29.560> now<00:00:30.040> what<00:00:30.400> some<00:00:30.760> people<00:00:31.090> usually

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
put a gate now what some people usually

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.169 
put a gate now what some people usually
do<00:00:32.379> is<00:00:32.559> if<00:00:32.710> you<00:00:32.829> only<00:00:33.010> want<00:00:33.190> one<00:00:33.519> gate<00:00:33.850> all<00:00:34.059> you

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:34.179 
do is if you only want one gate all you

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:35.700 
do is if you only want one gate all you
have<00:00:34.269> to<00:00:34.359> do<00:00:34.449> is<00:00:34.510> continue<00:00:34.960> extending<00:00:35.620> this

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
have to do is continue extending this

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.470 
have to do is continue extending this
all<00:00:35.949> the<00:00:36.070> way<00:00:36.100> around<00:00:36.280> until<00:00:36.670> you<00:00:37.089> reach<00:00:37.449> back

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
all the way around until you reach back

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.660 
all the way around until you reach back
to<00:00:37.899> your<00:00:38.019> starting<00:00:38.440> point<00:00:38.649> and<00:00:38.949> you<00:00:39.429> need<00:00:39.550> to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
to your starting point and you need to

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.450 
to your starting point and you need to
leave<00:00:39.820> a<00:00:40.210> gap<00:00:40.719> of<00:00:40.749> 2<00:00:41.140> squares<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:41.859> then<00:00:42.370> you

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
leave a gap of 2 squares and then you

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.610 
leave a gap of 2 squares and then you
can<00:00:42.579> build<00:00:42.760> a<00:00:42.850> gate<00:00:43.030> but<00:00:43.690> that's<00:00:44.109> only<00:00:44.350> if<00:00:44.530> you

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
can build a gate but that's only if you

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.349 
can build a gate but that's only if you
want<00:00:44.890> one<00:00:45.219> gate<00:00:45.579> what<00:00:45.789> happens<00:00:46.089> if<00:00:46.149> you<00:00:46.210> want

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
want one gate what happens if you want

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:47.970 
want one gate what happens if you want
another<00:00:46.600> gate<00:00:46.929> you<00:00:47.109> have<00:00:47.319> to<00:00:47.499> place<00:00:47.739> another

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
another gate you have to place another

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.430 
another gate you have to place another
starting<00:00:48.699> post<00:00:48.909> it's<00:00:49.480> a<00:00:49.569> little<00:00:49.690> more<00:00:49.929> costly

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
starting post it's a little more costly

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.610 
starting post it's a little more costly
because<00:00:50.530> starting<00:00:51.010> posts<00:00:51.429> are<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:53.260> takes<00:00:53.530> a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
because starting posts are it takes a

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.959 
because starting posts are it takes a
lot<00:00:53.739> more<00:00:53.769> wood<00:00:54.069> to<00:00:54.219> build<00:00:54.339> then<00:00:54.609> just<00:00:54.879> a

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
lot more wood to build then just a

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.229 
lot more wood to build then just a
corner<00:00:55.359> post<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:56.620> I<00:00:56.859> really<00:00:57.519> want<00:00:57.729> two<00:00:57.969> gates

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
corner post but I really want two gates

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.899 
corner post but I really want two gates
on<00:00:58.449> my<00:00:58.569> land<00:00:58.809> because<00:00:59.739> of<00:01:00.039> complications<00:01:00.429> i'll

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
on my land because of complications i'll

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.750 
on my land because of complications i'll
explain<00:01:01.269> in<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.510> bit<00:01:01.539> so<00:01:02.260> first<00:01:02.710> using<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.489> end

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
ahmad you know the end a client you have

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.910 
ahmad you know the end a client you have
to<00:01:06.280> press<00:01:06.460> ctrl<00:01:06.700> L<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.899> then<00:01:08.560> you<00:01:08.649> get<00:01:08.770> this

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
to press ctrl L and then you get this

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.330 
to press ctrl L and then you get this
area<00:01:09.490> selection<00:01:10.119> tool<00:01:10.360> so<00:01:11.200> when<00:01:11.680> this<00:01:12.009> says

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
area selection tool so when this says

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.539 
area selection tool so when this says
release<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:14.350> whenever<00:01:14.649> you<00:01:14.829> click<00:01:15.100> left

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
release you whenever you click left

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.120 
release you whenever you click left
click<00:01:15.670> on<00:01:15.939> the<00:01:16.030> ground<00:01:16.210> you<00:01:16.509> draw<00:01:16.899> or<00:01:17.229> you<00:01:17.560> put

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
click on the ground you draw or you put

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.539 
click on the ground you draw or you put
this<00:01:18.250> grid<00:01:18.610> where<00:01:19.180> it<00:01:19.420> shows<00:01:19.689> the<00:01:20.219> grid<00:01:21.219> of<00:01:21.399> the

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
this grid where it shows the grid of the

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.330 
this grid where it shows the grid of the
world<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:21.969> also<00:01:22.299> the<00:01:22.659> terrain<00:01:23.170> height<00:01:23.680> so<00:01:24.250> you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
world and also the terrain height so you

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.580 
world and also the terrain height so you
can<00:01:24.460> see<00:01:24.610> here<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:24.909> higher<00:01:25.119> in<00:01:25.149> years<00:01:25.479> lower<00:01:25.750> so

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
can see here is higher in years lower so

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.899 
can see here is higher in years lower so
that's<00:01:26.829> how<00:01:26.979> you<00:01:27.039> use<00:01:27.250> it<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.430> level<00:01:27.640> terrain

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
that's how you use it to level terrain

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.240 
that's how you use it to level terrain
but<00:01:28.299> right<00:01:28.539> now<00:01:28.719> we<00:01:28.780> just<00:01:28.990> want<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.380> see<00:01:29.710> where

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
but right now we just want to see where

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.969 
but right now we just want to see where
exactly<00:01:30.700> two<00:01:31.180> squares<00:01:31.600> are<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.049> where<00:01:32.859> we

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
exactly two squares are and where we

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.370 
exactly two squares are and where we
want<00:01:33.189> to<00:01:33.250> put<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.609> next<00:01:33.939> starting<00:01:34.359> post<00:01:34.570> so

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
want to put the next starting post so

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.099 
want to put the next starting post so
once<00:01:36.009> you've<00:01:36.609> selected<00:01:36.939> your<00:01:37.299> area<00:01:37.750> you<00:01:37.930> go

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
once you've selected your area you go

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.660 
once you've selected your area you go
ahead<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.500> click<00:01:38.649> this<00:01:38.799> button<00:01:39.009> so<00:01:39.490> that's

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
ahead and click this button so that's

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.179 
ahead and click this button so that's
going<00:01:39.789> to<00:01:39.880> hold<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.359> so<00:01:40.600> now<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:41.560> don't<00:01:41.590> change

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
going to hold it so now you don't change

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.090 
going to hold it so now you don't change
your<00:01:42.490> selection<00:01:43.170> now<00:01:44.170> we<00:01:44.229> want<00:01:44.679> to<00:01:44.799> put

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
your selection now we want to put

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.300 
your selection now we want to put
another<00:01:45.850> starting<00:01:46.420> post<00:01:46.600> right<00:01:46.929> here<00:01:46.960> so<00:01:47.710> it

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
another starting post right here so it

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.520 
another starting post right here so it
doesn't<00:01:48.490> have<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:48.880> be<00:01:48.909> pixel<00:01:49.570> perfect<00:01:49.840> but

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
doesn't have to be pixel perfect but

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.800 
doesn't have to be pixel perfect but
it's<00:01:51.100> gotta<00:01:51.460> be<00:01:51.549> as<00:01:52.090> aligned<00:01:52.929> as<00:01:53.429> it<00:01:54.429> can<00:01:54.729> be<00:01:55.030> so

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
it's gotta be as aligned as it can be so

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.010 
it's gotta be as aligned as it can be so
let's<00:01:56.079> go<00:01:56.229> ahead<00:01:56.259> and<00:01:56.380> build<00:01:57.869> buildings<00:01:58.869> and

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
let's go ahead and build buildings and

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.560 
let's go ahead and build buildings and
structures<00:01:59.259> claims<00:01:59.859> and<00:02:00.070> defenses

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
structures claims and defenses

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.709 
structures claims and defenses
split-rail<00:02:01.570> fence<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:03.219> let's<00:02:03.789> zoom<00:02:04.149> out<00:02:04.299> back

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
split-rail fence so let's zoom out back

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:05.969 
split-rail fence so let's zoom out back
this<00:02:04.929> way<00:02:05.109> so<00:02:05.170> we<00:02:05.320> can<00:02:05.380> have<00:02:05.710> more<00:02:05.740> of<00:02:05.920> a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
this way so we can have more of a

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.600 
this way so we can have more of a
top-down<00:02:06.460> view<00:02:06.719> ok<00:02:07.719> that<00:02:08.020> looks<00:02:08.440> perfect<00:02:09.009> I

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
top-down view ok that looks perfect I

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.059 
top-down view ok that looks perfect I
hope<00:02:09.909> this<00:02:10.149> works<00:02:10.390> because<00:02:10.989> if<00:02:11.260> this<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.739> wrong

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
hope this works because if this is wrong

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.840 
hope this works because if this is wrong
the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.040 
the
and<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.600> going<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.810> be<00:02:13.900> tough<00:02:14.380> removing<00:02:15.340> this

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
and it's going to be tough removing this

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.110 
and it's going to be tough removing this
fence<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:17.710> that<00:02:17.740> looks<00:02:18.100> good<00:02:18.310> now<00:02:18.910> i'm<00:02:18.970> going

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
fence so that looks good now i'm going

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.180 
fence so that looks good now i'm going
to<00:02:19.180> go<00:02:19.390> ahead<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.690> build<00:02:20.140> this<00:02:20.380> starting<00:02:20.950> post

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
to go ahead and build this starting post

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.340 
to go ahead and build this starting post
as<00:02:21.580> usual<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.390> takes<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.690> lot<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.870> wood<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.200> do

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
as usual it takes a lot of wood to do

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.790 
as usual it takes a lot of wood to do
this<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.400> give<00:02:24.580> me<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.730> second<00:02:25.120> here<00:02:25.180> okay

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
this so just give me a second here okay

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.320 
this so just give me a second here okay
as<00:02:26.800> you<00:02:26.920> can<00:02:26.950> see<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.430> really<00:02:27.850> does<00:02:28.030> drain

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
as you can see it really does drain

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.060 
as you can see it really does drain
phlegm<00:02:28.720> chopping<00:02:29.320> up<00:02:29.410> wood<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.740> building

phlegm chopping up wood and building

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.220 
phlegm chopping up wood and building
fences<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:30.940> make<00:02:31.180> sure<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:31.450> have<00:02:31.630> enough<00:02:31.840> food

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
fences so make sure you have enough food

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.260 
fences so make sure you have enough food
stockpiled<00:02:33.160> I'm<00:02:33.520> just<00:02:33.730> going<00:02:33.910> around<00:02:34.000> here

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
stockpiled I'm just going around here

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.330 
stockpiled I'm just going around here
collecting<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.750> bit<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.990> extra<00:02:35.470> food<00:02:35.740> because<00:02:36.130> I

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
collecting a bit of extra food because I

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.710 
collecting a bit of extra food because I
kind<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.180> need<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.420> let's<00:02:37.720> eat<00:02:37.870> some<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.110> these

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
kind of need it let's eat some of these

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.150 
kind of need it let's eat some of these
okay<00:02:40.720> we<00:02:40.840> now<00:02:40.990> have<00:02:41.170> enough<00:02:41.410> wood<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.740> build

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
okay we now have enough wood to build

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.980 
okay we now have enough wood to build
this<00:02:42.550> starting<00:02:43.150> post<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.510> let's<00:02:43.690> go<00:02:43.810> ahead<00:02:43.840> and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
this starting post so let's go ahead and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.090 
this starting post so let's go ahead and
build<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:46.410> luckily<00:02:47.410> we<00:02:47.620> do<00:02:47.740> have<00:02:47.920> enough

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
build that luckily we do have enough

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.930 
build that luckily we do have enough
phlegm<00:02:48.460> here<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:50.620> once<00:02:51.100> this<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.550> built<00:02:51.790> you

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
phlegm here now once this is built you

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.460 
phlegm here now once this is built you
should<00:02:52.150> be<00:02:52.270> able<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.510> right<00:02:52.780> click<00:02:53.050> one<00:02:53.440> of

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
should be able to right click one of

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.350 
should be able to right click one of
these<00:02:53.680> corner<00:02:54.220> posts<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.700> build<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.090> gate

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
these corner posts and build a gate

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.780 
these corner posts and build a gate
between<00:02:55.690> them<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:56.560> let's<00:02:56.800> hope<00:02:57.130> it<00:02:57.310> works<00:02:57.340> I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
between them so let's hope it works I

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.840 
between them so let's hope it works I
haven't<00:02:58.060> tried<00:02:58.210> this<00:02:58.540> before<00:02:59.520> okay<00:03:00.520> here<00:03:00.730> we

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
haven't tried this before okay here we

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.590 
haven't tried this before okay here we
go<00:03:00.880> and<00:03:01.300> we're<00:03:02.230> done<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:03.000> build<00:03:04.000> gate<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.570> the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
go and we're done and build gate to the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.860 
go and we're done and build gate to the
east<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:05.530> looks<00:03:05.740> fantastic<00:03:06.480> bill<00:03:07.480> gate<00:03:07.750> to

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
east that looks fantastic bill gate to

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.110 
east that looks fantastic bill gate to
the<00:03:07.930> west<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:08.800> I<00:03:09.040> think<00:03:09.490> I<00:03:09.580> have<00:03:09.730> enough<00:03:09.760> wood

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
the west so I think I have enough wood

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.720 
the west so I think I have enough wood
here<00:03:10.360> based<00:03:10.630> on<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.930> wiki<00:03:11.320> this<00:03:12.310> should<00:03:12.580> be

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
here based on the wiki this should be

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.280 
here based on the wiki this should be
correct<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.150> let's<00:03:13.360> go<00:03:13.510> ahead<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.690> build<00:03:14.080> a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
correct so let's go ahead and build a

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.080 
correct so let's go ahead and build a
gate<00:03:16.050> that's<00:03:17.640> looks<00:03:18.640> like<00:03:18.760> there's<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> bit<00:03:19.060> of

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
gate that's looks like there's a bit of

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.460 
gate that's looks like there's a bit of
movement<00:03:19.390> problem<00:03:20.050> here

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
movement problem here

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.360 
movement problem here
let's<00:03:22.100> try<00:03:22.220> from<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.580> other<00:03:22.700> side<00:03:24.160> okay<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:25.220> it

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
let's try from the other side okay so it

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.340 
let's try from the other side okay so it
turns<00:03:25.430> out<00:03:25.700> there's<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:26.030> glitch<00:03:26.510> where<00:03:26.990> a

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
turns out there's a glitch where a

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.590 
turns out there's a glitch where a
manually<00:03:28.100> placed<00:03:28.280> corner<00:03:28.850> post<00:03:29.120> even<00:03:29.510> though

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
manually placed corner post even though

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.690 
manually placed corner post even though
it<00:03:29.630> says<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.080> can<00:03:30.260> build<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.800> gate<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.400> just

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
it says you can build a gate it just

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.320 
it says you can build a gate it just
won't<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:32.570> what<00:03:33.380> I<00:03:33.530> tried<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.070> do<00:03:34.460> let's<00:03:35.090> hope

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
won't so what I tried to do let's hope

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.360 
won't so what I tried to do let's hope
this<00:03:35.510> works<00:03:35.720> is<00:03:35.990> I<00:03:36.350> built<00:03:36.560> all<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:37.100> way<00:03:37.220> around

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
this works is I built all the way around

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.610 
this works is I built all the way around
over<00:03:38.330> here<00:03:38.360> so<00:03:39.200> these<00:03:39.650> two<00:03:40.070> corner<00:03:40.520> posts<00:03:40.940> were

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
over here so these two corner posts were

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.780 
over here so these two corner posts were
extended<00:03:42.620> from<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:43.040> fence<00:03:43.310> they<00:03:43.580> weren't

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
extended from a fence they weren't

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.630 
extended from a fence they weren't
manually<00:03:44.480> placed<00:03:44.630> I<00:03:44.990> know<00:03:45.140> they<00:03:45.890> started<00:03:46.460> from

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
manually placed I know they started from

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.150 
manually placed I know they started from
two<00:03:46.910> different<00:03:47.480> manually<00:03:48.050> placed<00:03:48.200> corner

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
two different manually placed corner

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.210 
two different manually placed corner
posts<00:03:49.460> but<00:03:49.790> let's<00:03:50.690> hope<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.170> works<00:03:51.440> so<00:03:52.070> if<00:03:52.160> I

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
posts but let's hope this works so if I

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.130 
posts but let's hope this works so if I
right<00:03:52.400> click<00:03:52.430> here<00:03:52.820> i<00:03:52.910> can<00:03:53.060> see<00:03:53.090> build<00:03:53.630> gate<00:03:53.900> to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
right click here i can see build gate to

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.550 
right click here i can see build gate to
the<00:03:54.170> west<00:03:54.530> i<00:03:54.920> really<00:03:55.640> hope<00:03:55.670> this<00:03:55.910> works<00:03:56.170> no<00:03:57.170> it

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
the west i really hope this works no it

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.600 
the west i really hope this works no it
doesn't<00:03:58.100> so<00:03:59.170> it<00:04:00.170> turns<00:04:00.320> out<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:00.800> really<00:04:01.370> have

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
doesn't so it turns out you really have

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.520 
doesn't so it turns out you really have
to<00:04:01.850> have<00:04:02.830> very<00:04:03.830> precise<00:04:04.490> placing<00:04:05.150> all<00:04:05.530> you

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
to have very precise placing all you

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.770 
to have very precise placing all you
only<00:04:06.740> place<00:04:07.070> one<00:04:07.490> starting<00:04:08.060> post<00:04:08.300> and<00:04:08.600> build

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
only place one starting post and build

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.170 
only place one starting post and build
all<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.140> way<00:04:09.230> around<00:04:09.320> and<00:04:09.860> you<00:04:09.890> can<00:04:10.850> only<00:04:10.940> have

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
all the way around and you can only have

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.260 
all the way around and you can only have
one<00:04:11.240> gate<00:04:11.750> until<00:04:12.050> they<00:04:12.320> fix<00:04:12.560> this<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:12.980> mean<00:04:13.270> it

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
one gate until they fix this I mean it

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.270 
one gate until they fix this I mean it
should<00:04:14.630> work<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:15.110> mean<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:15.350> says<00:04:15.530> build<00:04:15.860> gate<00:04:16.130> to

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
should work I mean it says build gate to

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.220 
should work I mean it says build gate to
the<00:04:16.310> west<00:04:16.580> so<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:16.910> recognizes<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:17.540> this<00:04:17.930> is<00:04:18.169> a

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
the west so it recognizes that this is a

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.430 
the west so it recognizes that this is a
gate<00:04:18.650> setup<00:04:19.160> but<00:04:19.549> it<00:04:19.790> just<00:04:20.269> doesn't<00:04:20.720> work<00:04:21.019> as

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
gate setup but it just doesn't work as

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.500 
gate setup but it just doesn't work as
you<00:04:21.620> can<00:04:21.709> see<00:04:21.859> i<00:04:21.890> right<00:04:22.130> click<00:04:22.430> select<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.390> and

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
you can see i right click select it and

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.800 
you can see i right click select it and
it<00:04:23.840> just<00:04:23.870> doesn't<00:04:24.560> so<00:04:25.250> there's<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.390> keep

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
it just doesn't so there's that to keep

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.720 
it just doesn't so there's that to keep
in<00:04:26.960> mind<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.410> can<00:04:27.530> only<00:04:27.650> have<00:04:27.800> one<00:04:27.860> gate<00:04:28.370> for

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
in mind you can only have one gate for

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.350 
in mind you can only have one gate for
now<00:04:28.850> but<00:04:29.720> one<00:04:30.410> thing<00:04:30.710> i<00:04:30.919> will<00:04:31.040> end<00:04:31.700> by<00:04:32.000> telling

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
now but one thing i will end by telling

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.060 
now but one thing i will end by telling
you<00:04:32.480> is<00:04:32.600> as<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:32.900> can<00:04:32.930> see<00:04:33.080> i<00:04:33.260> built<00:04:33.590> my<00:04:33.710> fence

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
you is as you can see i built my fence

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.210 
you is as you can see i built my fence
right<00:04:34.430> at<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:34.760> edge<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.240> my<00:04:35.300> claim<00:04:35.750> now<00:04:36.590> this

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
right at the edge of my claim now this

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.610 
right at the edge of my claim now this
is<00:04:37.340> especially<00:04:37.460> important<00:04:38.419> if<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.930> have<00:04:38.960> only

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
is especially important if you have only

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.820 
is especially important if you have only
one<00:04:39.830> gate<00:04:41.020> what<00:04:42.020> some<00:04:42.290> people<00:04:42.620> have<00:04:42.800> been

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
one gate what some people have been

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
one gate what some people have been
doing<00:04:43.400> is<00:04:43.669> they<00:04:44.479> will<00:04:44.750> get<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.740> claim<00:04:46.190> stone<00:04:46.580> and

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
doing is they will get a claim stone and

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.240 
doing is they will get a claim stone and
they'll<00:04:47.360> actually<00:04:47.570> claim<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.320> land<00:04:48.500> right

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
they'll actually claim the land right

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.070 
they'll actually claim the land right
outside<00:04:49.430> your<00:04:49.700> gate<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.390> then<00:04:50.690> they'll<00:04:50.840> build

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
outside your gate and then they'll build

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.310 
outside your gate and then they'll build
their<00:04:51.320> gate<00:04:51.590> right<00:04:51.860> here<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.970> that's<00:04:53.510> not<00:04:54.050> a

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
their gate right here so that's not a

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.440 
their gate right here so that's not a
good<00:04:54.350> thing<00:04:54.979> because<00:04:55.280> then<00:04:55.669> they'll<00:04:55.880> trap<00:04:56.270> you

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
good thing because then they'll trap you

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.330 
good thing because then they'll trap you
inside<00:04:56.780> your<00:04:56.930> own<00:04:57.050> land<00:04:57.320> so<00:04:57.890> whenever<00:04:58.100> you

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
inside your own land so whenever you

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.969 
inside your own land so whenever you
build<00:04:58.550> a<00:04:58.700> fence<00:04:58.990> always<00:04:59.990> make<00:05:00.200> sure<00:05:00.229> that<00:05:00.440> your

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
build a fence always make sure that your

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.810 
build a fence always make sure that your
territory<00:05:01.660> extends<00:05:02.660> beyond<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:03.860> fence<00:05:04.070> by<00:05:04.700> at

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
territory extends beyond the fence by at

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.659 
territory extends beyond the fence by at
least<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:05.150> couple<00:05:05.330> squares<00:05:06.169> so<00:05:06.830> I<00:05:06.860> do<00:05:07.130> have<00:05:07.400> some

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
least a couple squares so I do have some

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.420 
least a couple squares so I do have some
money<00:05:07.850> saved<00:05:08.210> up<00:05:08.450> so<00:05:09.080> I'm<00:05:09.320> going<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:09.830> extend<00:05:10.280> my

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
money saved up so I'm going to extend my

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.780 
money saved up so I'm going to extend my
territory<00:05:11.360> in<00:05:11.660> each<00:05:12.380> direction<00:05:12.740> by<00:05:13.729> two

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
territory in each direction by two

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.620 
territory in each direction by two
squares<00:05:14.479> just<00:05:15.130> like<00:05:16.130> this<00:05:16.640> so<00:05:17.090> it's<00:05:17.270> a<00:05:17.330> little

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
squares just like this so it's a little

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.450 
squares just like this so it's a little
pricey<00:05:17.930> to<00:05:18.200> keep<00:05:18.650> on<00:05:18.800> expanding<00:05:19.250> your

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
pricey to keep on expanding your

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.430 
pricey to keep on expanding your
territory<00:05:19.910> like<00:05:20.030> this<00:05:20.240> but<00:05:20.810> you<00:05:20.990> need<00:05:21.229> this

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
territory like this but you need this

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.040 
territory like this but you need this
buffer<00:05:21.860> zone<00:05:22.040> so<00:05:22.250> you<00:05:22.340> can<00:05:22.490> see<00:05:22.729> people<00:05:23.720> can't

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
buffer zone so you can see people can't

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.030 
buffer zone so you can see people can't
really<00:05:24.890> easily<00:05:25.580> trap<00:05:26.000> you<00:05:26.180> in<00:05:26.330> with<00:05:26.890> just<00:05:27.890> some

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
really easily trap you in with just some

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.100 
really easily trap you in with just some
claim<00:05:28.340> stones<00:05:28.729> anymore<00:05:29.210> so<00:05:29.630> I'm<00:05:29.690> gonna<00:05:29.870> buy

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
claim stones anymore so I'm gonna buy

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.239 
claim stones anymore so I'm gonna buy
this

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:31.249 
this

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:35.979 
this
and<00:05:31.479> there<00:05:32.479> we<00:05:32.629> go<00:05:33.039> my<00:05:34.239> claim<00:05:35.239> is<00:05:35.299> a<00:05:35.539> lot<00:05:35.749> larger

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:35.989 
and there we go my claim is a lot larger

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:37.509 
and there we go my claim is a lot larger
now<00:05:36.379> so<00:05:36.589> I<00:05:36.619> have<00:05:36.769> some<00:05:36.919> space<00:05:37.159> to<00:05:37.309> work<00:05:37.459> with

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:37.519 
now so I have some space to work with

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:41.619 
now so I have some space to work with
outside<00:05:38.359> of<00:05:38.389> the<00:05:38.629> fence<00:05:38.829> but<00:05:40.089> in<00:05:41.089> terms<00:05:41.359> of<00:05:41.509> the

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:41.629 
outside of the fence but in terms of the

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:43.209 
outside of the fence but in terms of the
gates<00:05:41.929> I'm<00:05:42.139> not<00:05:42.379> sure<00:05:42.559> what<00:05:42.709> I'm<00:05:42.799> gonna<00:05:42.949> do<00:05:43.189> I

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
gates I'm not sure what I'm gonna do I

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.669 
gates I'm not sure what I'm gonna do I
can't<00:05:43.609> build<00:05:43.789> any<00:05:44.149> gates<00:05:44.599> here<00:05:44.869> so<00:05:45.379> I'm<00:05:45.469> not

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:45.679 
can't build any gates here so I'm not

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.949 
can't build any gates here so I'm not
really<00:05:45.859> protected<00:05:46.579> but<00:05:47.239> hey<00:05:47.419> at<00:05:47.629> least<00:05:47.659> it

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:47.959 
really protected but hey at least it

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:50.589 
really protected but hey at least it
looks<00:05:48.139> nice<00:05:48.639> okay<00:05:49.639> as<00:05:49.759> a<00:05:49.789> last<00:05:50.119> ditch<00:05:50.389> effort

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
looks nice okay as a last ditch effort

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.829 
looks nice okay as a last ditch effort
just<00:05:51.349> for<00:05:51.469> you<00:05:51.829> guys<00:05:52.129> I<00:05:52.609> decided<00:05:53.209> to<00:05:53.419> try<00:05:53.689> and

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:53.839 
just for you guys I decided to try and

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.949 
just for you guys I decided to try and
build<00:05:54.019> a<00:05:54.289> fence<00:05:54.799> all<00:05:55.129> the<00:05:55.189> way<00:05:55.459> around<00:05:55.639> my<00:05:56.539> farm

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:56.959 
build a fence all the way around my farm

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:59.799 
build a fence all the way around my farm
land<00:05:57.229> so<00:05:57.469> this<00:05:57.739> had<00:05:58.069> the<00:05:58.399> same<00:05:58.789> starting<00:05:59.569> post

00:05:59.799 --> 00:05:59.809 
land so this had the same starting post

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:02.529 
land so this had the same starting post
and<00:06:00.139> it<00:06:00.649> goes<00:06:00.799> all<00:06:00.829> the<00:06:01.039> way<00:06:01.279> around<00:06:01.399> and<00:06:01.819> also

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:02.539 
and it goes all the way around and also

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.049 
and it goes all the way around and also
this<00:06:02.809> is<00:06:02.989> facing<00:06:03.439> a<00:06:04.159> different<00:06:04.939> direction

00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:05.059 
this is facing a different direction

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:06.850 
this is facing a different direction
from<00:06:05.539> the<00:06:05.689> other<00:06:05.809> two<00:06:06.019> gates<00:06:06.289> in<00:06:06.469> case<00:06:06.649> it<00:06:06.769> was

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
from the other two gates in case it was

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.489 
from the other two gates in case it was
a<00:06:06.889> directional<00:06:07.549> problem<00:06:07.939> so<00:06:08.389> if<00:06:08.539> this<00:06:08.839> doesn't

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:09.499 
a directional problem so if this doesn't

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:13.179 
a directional problem so if this doesn't
build<00:06:09.739> a<00:06:09.889> gate<00:06:10.129> then<00:06:11.349> I'm<00:06:12.349> just<00:06:12.589> not<00:06:12.739> gonna<00:06:12.979> be

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:13.189 
build a gate then I'm just not gonna be

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:15.999 
build a gate then I'm just not gonna be
able<00:06:13.279> to<00:06:13.399> build<00:06:13.610> a<00:06:13.729> gate<00:06:13.999> so<00:06:14.329> let's<00:06:15.229> hope<00:06:15.769> this

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:16.009 
able to build a gate so let's hope this

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:20.039 
able to build a gate so let's hope this
works<00:06:16.219> build<00:06:17.089> gate<00:06:17.449> to<00:06:17.689> the<00:06:17.719> north<00:06:18.079> here<00:06:18.829> we<00:06:19.009> go

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:20.049 
works build gate to the north here we go

00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:24.489 
works build gate to the north here we go
yes<00:06:21.099> I<00:06:22.099> can<00:06:22.579> build<00:06:22.849> a<00:06:22.969> gate<00:06:23.209> so<00:06:23.659> I<00:06:23.959> don't<00:06:24.259> know

00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:24.499 
yes I can build a gate so I don't know

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:27.639 
yes I can build a gate so I don't know
exactly<00:06:25.039> what<00:06:25.639> was<00:06:26.479> stopping<00:06:27.319> me<00:06:27.529> from

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:27.649 
exactly what was stopping me from

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:29.289 
exactly what was stopping me from
building<00:06:28.099> a<00:06:28.159> gate<00:06:28.399> whether<00:06:28.879> it<00:06:29.119> was<00:06:29.269> the

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:29.299 
building a gate whether it was the

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:32.289 
building a gate whether it was the
direction<00:06:29.809> or<00:06:30.169> maybe<00:06:30.439> you<00:06:31.249> really<00:06:31.639> can't<00:06:31.999> have

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:32.299 
direction or maybe you really can't have

00:06:32.299 --> 00:06:36.279 
direction or maybe you really can't have
two<00:06:32.689> separate<00:06:33.439> starting<00:06:34.239> posts<00:06:35.289> but

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
two separate starting posts but

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.169 
two separate starting posts but
nevermind<00:06:36.709> I'm<00:06:36.949> just<00:06:37.189> gonna<00:06:37.309> go<00:06:37.519> chop<00:06:37.849> up<00:06:38.029> the

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:38.179 
nevermind I'm just gonna go chop up the

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:42.699 
nevermind I'm just gonna go chop up the
wood<00:06:38.360> and<00:06:38.679> finish<00:06:39.679> off<00:06:39.829> this<00:06:40.009> gate<00:06:41.469> okay<00:06:42.469> here

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:42.709 
wood and finish off this gate okay here

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:44.999 
wood and finish off this gate okay here
we<00:06:42.739> go<00:06:42.860> just<00:06:43.399> a<00:06:43.549> few<00:06:43.789> more<00:06:43.909> pieces<00:06:44.149> of<00:06:44.299> wood<00:06:44.629> and

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:45.009 
we go just a few more pieces of wood and

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.069 
we go just a few more pieces of wood and
let's<00:06:46.009> build<00:06:46.429> our<00:06:46.610> first-ever<00:06:47.179> gate<00:06:47.749> it's

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:48.079 
let's build our first-ever gate it's

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:51.219 
let's build our first-ever gate it's
about<00:06:48.259> time<00:06:49.009> ah<00:06:49.519> the<00:06:50.299> amount<00:06:50.539> of<00:06:50.659> effort<00:06:50.839> I<00:06:51.139> had

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:51.229 
about time ah the amount of effort I had

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:53.669 
about time ah the amount of effort I had
to<00:06:51.349> go<00:06:51.589> through<00:06:51.829> to<00:06:51.860> build<00:06:52.249> this<00:06:52.459> thing<00:06:52.519> man<00:06:53.029> oh

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:53.679 
to go through to build this thing man oh

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:59.679 
to go through to build this thing man oh
look<00:06:54.679> at<00:06:54.829> that<00:06:55.569> site<00:06:56.569> of<00:06:56.839> beauty<00:06:58.209> let's<00:06:59.209> I<00:06:59.389> open

00:06:59.679 --> 00:06:59.689 
look at that site of beauty let's I open

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:01.929 
look at that site of beauty let's I open
it<00:06:59.779> how<00:07:00.289> much<00:07:00.439> how<00:07:00.499> gates<00:07:00.889> work<00:07:01.099> ah<00:07:01.219> look<00:07:01.849> at

00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:01.939 
it how much how gates work ah look at

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:06.519 
it how much how gates work ah look at
that<00:07:01.999> it<00:07:02.360> opens<00:07:02.839> fine<00:07:03.399> clothes<00:07:04.399> is<00:07:04.610> fine<00:07:05.529> my

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:06.529 
that it opens fine clothes is fine my

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:08.589 
that it opens fine clothes is fine my
home<00:07:06.829> is<00:07:06.860> not<00:07:07.249> really<00:07:07.699> protected<00:07:08.299> but<00:07:08.479> at

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 
home is not really protected but at

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:12.399 
home is not really protected but at
least<00:07:08.749> my<00:07:08.869> three<00:07:09.319> cotton<00:07:09.769> fields<00:07:10.189> are<00:07:11.409> let's

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:12.409 
least my three cotton fields are let's

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:14.799 
least my three cotton fields are let's
turn<00:07:12.799> this<00:07:13.399> off<00:07:13.729> and<00:07:14.119> have<00:07:14.449> a<00:07:14.479> look<00:07:14.629> at<00:07:14.749> our

00:07:14.799 --> 00:07:14.809 
turn this off and have a look at our

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:17.889 
turn this off and have a look at our
land<00:07:15.139> now<00:07:15.499> ah<00:07:16.119> it's<00:07:17.119> starting<00:07:17.449> to<00:07:17.539> look<00:07:17.569> quite

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:17.899 
land now ah it's starting to look quite

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:20.079 
land now ah it's starting to look quite
nice<00:07:18.229> actually<00:07:18.589> I'm<00:07:19.069> pretty<00:07:19.610> impressed<00:07:19.759> with

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:20.089 
nice actually I'm pretty impressed with

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:21.519 
nice actually I'm pretty impressed with
my<00:07:20.299> land

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:21.529 
my land

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:24.849 
my land
and<00:07:21.649> of<00:07:22.369> course<00:07:22.509> let's<00:07:23.509> check<00:07:23.839> my<00:07:24.139> personal

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:24.859 
and of course let's check my personal

00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:28.749 
and of course let's check my personal
claim<00:07:25.069> and<00:07:25.309> that<00:07:25.909> is<00:07:26.689> it's<00:07:26.929> nice<00:07:27.289> and<00:07:27.529> big<00:07:27.769> all

right that's the end of this video
there's<00:07:31.879> the<00:07:32.269> gate<00:07:33.609> finally<00:07:34.609> happy<00:07:34.969> with<00:07:35.089> my

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:35.209 
there's the gate finally happy with my

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:51.220 
there's the gate finally happy with my
results<00:07:35.269> I'll<00:07:35.959> see<00:07:36.799> you<00:07:36.859> in<00:07:36.979> the<00:07:37.069> next<00:07:37.189> video
