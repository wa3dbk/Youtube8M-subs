00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.710 

I've<00:00:44.260> noticed<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.830> wily<00:00:45.310> fortress<00:00:45.760> stages<00:00:46.390> at

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
I've noticed the wily fortress stages at

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.300 
I've noticed the wily fortress stages at
least<00:00:47.080> in<00:00:47.230> this<00:00:47.350> hack<00:00:47.590> seem<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:48.010> be<00:00:48.130> a<00:00:48.160> bit

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
least in this hack seem to be a bit

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.570 
least in this hack seem to be a bit
easier<00:00:48.370> than<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.180> regular<00:00:49.810> stages<00:00:50.410> or<00:00:51.280> at

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
easier than the regular stages or at

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.970 
easier than the regular stages or at
least<00:00:51.850> easier<00:00:52.330> than<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.630> dock<00:00:52.900> robot<00:00:53.320> stages

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.070 

there's<00:00:56.980> a<00:00:57.040> couple<00:00:57.220> tricks<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:57.880> traps<00:00:58.120> okay

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
there's a couple tricks and traps okay

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.250 
there's a couple tricks and traps okay
what<00:01:00.840> holy<00:01:01.840> hell<00:01:03.720> there's<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.839> couple<00:01:04.960> tricks

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
what holy hell there's a couple tricks

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.970 
what holy hell there's a couple tricks
and<00:01:05.470> traps<00:01:05.650> but<00:01:05.920> it's<00:01:06.100> really<00:01:06.220> not<00:01:06.400> that<00:01:06.460> bad

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
and traps but it's really not that bad

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.900 
and traps but it's really not that bad
especially<00:01:08.980> if<00:01:09.070> you<00:01:09.190> can<00:01:09.310> predict<00:01:09.730> what's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
especially if you can predict what's

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.420 
especially if you can predict what's
coming<00:01:10.270> for<00:01:10.510> example<00:01:11.160> yeah<00:01:12.160> I<00:01:12.190> thought

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
coming for example yeah I thought

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.740 
coming for example yeah I thought
there'd<00:01:12.670> be<00:01:12.670> more<00:01:12.790> of<00:01:13.030> those<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.210> I<00:01:13.480> know<00:01:13.540> what

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
there'd be more of those and I know what

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.180 
there'd be more of those and I know what
their<00:01:13.870> weaknesses<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.740> no<00:01:14.860> big<00:01:15.040> deal

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.380 

oh<00:01:18.250> I<00:01:19.060> hate<00:01:19.420> this<00:01:19.600> area<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.230> I<00:01:21.070> do<00:01:21.130> very<00:01:21.520> barely

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
oh I hate this area and I do very barely

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.730

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
remember it from the original what

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.280
