00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.290
 you 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.950
 or the taxis friends of chats and guitar what 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.680
 you are like a good son of rock and 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.290
 roll let's play an acoustic one of a 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.200
 lord a rockabilly legend of the 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.880
 rock and roll called ricky nelson and that 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.880
 he played a song called halo 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.220
 as we are used to playing 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.680
 Simple sad things like a lot of ballad 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.840
 with the guitar because I encourage you to 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.860
 let's play happy things with a lot of rhythm 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.720
 a very interesting strumming and also you 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.570
 we leave the table so that you do not 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.830
 lose 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.240
 We're going over there 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.760
 we started with the daddy pam pam all the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.760
 sixth string 0024 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:26.250
 and now comes the strum that the key is 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.170
 this is this compass with nothing more than that 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.490
 understand this compass is enough what 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.729
 what we are doing is that I am 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.190
 playing the major with tonic of the sixth 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.040
 rope but partially so to say 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.050
 that the fifth free string that is one and 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.100
 I take advantage of only the first three strings 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.700
 the three finites 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.770
 so 6 5 5 and we do what 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.380
 next tonic strum down and up 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.450
 now I rest my hand on the ropes 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.420
 to cut sound to produce that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.490
 silence and now with your third finger I do 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.030
 a iron on the 7th fret of these 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:13.590
 three first strings and strum up 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.590
 and now the top I raise 655 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.060
 this last part above 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.060
 cold 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.299
 therefore everything would be 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.250
 that would be very well repeated 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.310
 and now change of chord is like a 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.760
 structure of the blues goes grade 1 now 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.769
 I'm going to grade 4 is worth the same but this 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.599
 I 'm going to a king, now I 'm going to re 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.959
 here with tonic the sixth string comes from 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.970
 here the good thing about the fifth guitar 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.580
 fourth free string as I speak I thought 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.940
 we always take advantage of the free network tonic 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.569
 and exactly the same 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.519
 down above rest silence and now 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.700
 ironed on the 12th fret always the 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.610
 ironing is how I agreed next 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.370
 it's worth then 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.370
 because as it joins the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.040
 with pretty tonic and start 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:39.590
 and so all the time therefore we have 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.590
 said we started in the 4 times 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.270
 32 times 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:59.600
 come back to the side now well a neither bigger nor 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:05.290
 here we are going to take advantage of only the 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:07.880
 back the rope 4 and the rope 3 2 1 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.500
 now that would come with the feature above 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.930
 well instead of ironing what 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.820
 we do is step on the 2nd fret of the 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:19.269
 second string that his sixth 16 is worth 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.269
 so much 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.770
 and go back to 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.600
 and now that a new part would come a 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.870
 new part all as very happy that I've 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:41.520
 sustained greater therefore tonic and 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:44.129
 ironed on the 66th fret 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:52.340
 prince held higher therefore by 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:52.340
 so and now I repeat 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:03.420
 tired and third rope 6 4 2 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.950
 and I continue with strumming that's a 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.450
 ironed on the 2 fret is like a 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.450
 new more sustained minor 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.870
 now a best 7 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:30.000
 there are 24 242 and to finish it is telling me 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:37.530
 second free fret 5 of the rope 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:43.620
 from the b7 and now the tan tan comes 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:46.070
 so so so there and it ended up just like 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.070
 start 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:56.910
 therefore everything would be 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.910
 nothing 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.210
 now 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.430
