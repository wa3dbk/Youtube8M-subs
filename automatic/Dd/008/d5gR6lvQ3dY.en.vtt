with the WD gain series i want to

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.990 
with the WD gain series i want to
present<00:00:10.469> something<00:00:10.920> called<00:00:11.370> intraday

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000

planetary<00:00:12.660> price<00:00:13.009> i've<00:00:14.009> had<00:00:14.450> quite<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> few

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
planetary price i've had quite a few

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.390 
planetary price i've had quite a few
inquiries<00:00:15.990> over<00:00:16.619> there<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> few<00:00:17.100> years<00:00:17.130> that

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
inquiries over there a few years that

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.040 
inquiries over there a few years that
I've<00:00:17.609> been<00:00:17.640> doing<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.300> whether<00:00:18.570> or<00:00:18.840> not

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
I've been doing this whether or not

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.150 
I've been doing this whether or not
again<00:00:19.980> Astro<00:00:20.490> technics<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.420> be<00:00:21.600> applied<00:00:21.960> to

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
again Astro technics can be applied to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.179 
again Astro technics can be applied to
intraday<00:00:23.810> trading<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.830> course<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
intraday trading and of course the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.670 
intraday trading and of course the
answer<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.699> yes<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.810> I'm<00:00:27.960> going<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.289> show<00:00:28.590> you

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
answer is yes and I'm going to show you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.650 
answer is yes and I'm going to show you
something<00:00:29.189> very<00:00:29.220> special<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:30.179> have<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.449> think

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
something very special we have to think

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.830 
something very special we have to think
about<00:00:30.720> time<00:00:31.260> like<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> 24<00:00:32.700> hours<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.480> in

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
about time like the 24 hours is in

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.170 
about time like the 24 hours is in
essence<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> same<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.250> year<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:35.790> happens

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
essence the same as a year what happens

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.450 
essence the same as a year what happens
in<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.750> day<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.260> same<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.829> happens

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
in one day is the same as have happens

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.540 
in one day is the same as have happens
in<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.730> year<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> Bible<00:00:40.829> says<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.520> day

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
in a year and as a Bible says one day

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.690 
in a year and as a Bible says one day
for<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> year<00:00:42.149> some<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.110> very<00:00:44.010> interesting<00:00:44.309> way

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
for a year some a very interesting way

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.020 
for a year some a very interesting way
to<00:00:44.730> look<00:00:45.000> at<00:00:45.210> things<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.020> let's<00:00:46.230> get<00:00:46.410> started

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.540 

for<00:00:51.030> example<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.050> Aussie<00:00:52.559> dollar<00:00:52.890> on

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
for example this is the Aussie dollar on

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.000 
for example this is the Aussie dollar on
a<00:00:53.610> 15-minute<00:00:54.270> chart<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.199> basically<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:55.980> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
a 15-minute chart and basically what I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.520 
a 15-minute chart and basically what I
have<00:00:56.250> done<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.120> plotted<00:00:57.899> planetary

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
have done here is plotted planetary

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.209 
have done here is plotted planetary
lines<00:00:58.910> on<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.239> chart<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:01.980> I've

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
lines on this chart and you can see I've

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.780 
lines on this chart and you can see I've
actually<00:01:02.640> marked<00:01:03.600> where<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> planets<00:01:04.470> are

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
actually marked where the planets are

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.280 
actually marked where the planets are
according<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.820> these<00:01:06.030> lines<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:07.020> see

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
according to these lines and you can see

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.730 
according to these lines and you can see
how<00:01:08.000> when<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> lot<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.390> them<00:01:09.570> cluster<00:01:10.020> together

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
how when a lot of them cluster together

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.310 
how when a lot of them cluster together
it<00:01:11.159> causes<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.700> boundary<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.510> resistance<00:01:13.200> and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
it causes a boundary of resistance and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
it causes a boundary of resistance and
support<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.010> sort<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.280> bounces<00:01:14.850> between<00:01:15.030> that

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
support and sort of bounces between that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.480 
support and sort of bounces between that
fence<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.250> where

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
fence if you like and this is where

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.700 
fence if you like and this is where
using<00:01:21.030> maybe<00:01:21.810> some<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.200> your<00:01:22.290> favorite

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
using maybe some of your favorite

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.700 
using maybe some of your favorite
indicators<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.640> see<00:01:23.909> where<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.900> going

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
indicators you can see where this going

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.280 
indicators you can see where this going
to<00:01:25.799> be<00:01:25.920> resistance<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:26.580> support<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.780> help<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
to be resistance or support and help you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.980 
to be resistance or support and help you
with<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.470> buy<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.009> sell<00:01:29.220> signals<00:01:29.840> well<00:01:30.840> what

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
with your buy and sell signals well what

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.200 
with your buy and sell signals well what
are<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.200> doing<00:01:31.560> what<00:01:31.740> we're<00:01:31.890> doing<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> daily

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
are we doing what we're doing on a daily

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.350 
are we doing what we're doing on a daily
basis<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.750> mimicking<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:35.400> Gann<00:01:35.700> was<00:01:35.970> doing

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
basis is mimicking what Gann was doing

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.230 
basis is mimicking what Gann was doing
for<00:01:37.079> example<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.829> his<00:01:37.979> May<00:01:38.220> soybeans<00:01:38.820> chart

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
for example in his May soybeans chart

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.080 
for example in his May soybeans chart
where<00:01:40.140> he's<00:01:40.290> actually<00:01:40.560> plotted<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.939> have

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
where he's actually plotted if you have

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.719 
where he's actually plotted if you have
a<00:01:42.119> look<00:01:42.360> at<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.630> line<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.549> that's<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
a look at that line there that's the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.760 
a look at that line there that's the
long<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.030> cheetah<00:01:45.390> Jupiter<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.530> that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
long the cheetah Jupiter that's that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.100 
long the cheetah Jupiter that's that
little<00:01:46.860> symbol<00:01:47.220> there<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.759> Jupiter<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.509> then

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
little symbol there is Jupiter and then

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.139 
little symbol there is Jupiter and then
we<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.829> little<00:01:49.950> symbol<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.460> Mars<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
we can see the little symbol of Mars and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.899 
we can see the little symbol of Mars and
you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.710> Mars<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.220> basically<00:01:53.640> when

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
you can see that Mars so basically when

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.920 
you can see that Mars so basically when
they<00:01:54.060> formed<00:01:54.770> actually<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.860> opposition<00:01:56.930> price

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
they formed actually in opposition price

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.210 
they formed actually in opposition price
started<00:01:58.409> pulling<00:01:58.590> away<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.040> those<00:01:59.549> reverse

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
started pulling away so those reverse

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.580 
started pulling away so those reverse
there<00:02:00.550> so<00:02:00.880> this<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.780> what<00:02:01.930> we're<00:02:02.110> doing<00:02:02.440> but

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
there so this is what we're doing but

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.760 
there so this is what we're doing but
we're<00:02:02.800> applying<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.880> same<00:02:04.170> concept<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.320> an

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
we're applying the same concept to an

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.920 
we're applying the same concept to an
intraday<00:02:06.670> chart<00:02:07.470> so<00:02:08.470> one<00:02:09.399> day<00:02:09.729> in<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.540> day<00:02:10.690> we

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
intraday chart so one day in the day we

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.370 
intraday chart so one day in the day we
have<00:02:11.880> 1440<00:02:12.880> minutes<00:02:13.030> which<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.510> 24<00:02:14.200> hours

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
have 1440 minutes which is 24 hours

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.590 
have 1440 minutes which is 24 hours
times<00:02:14.740> 60<00:02:14.950> minutes<00:02:15.190> when<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.210> divide<00:02:16.570> that

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
times 60 minutes when you divide that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.080 
times 60 minutes when you divide that
circle<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.560> whole<00:02:17.770> day<00:02:18.040> which<00:02:18.310> represents

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
circle the whole day which represents

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.520 
circle the whole day which represents
360<00:02:20.050> by<00:02:20.170> 24<00:02:20.710> we<00:02:20.860> have<00:02:21.040> 15<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.570> each<00:02:22.750> hour<00:02:23.080> takes

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
360 by 24 we have 15 so each hour takes

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.290 
360 by 24 we have 15 so each hour takes
15<00:02:24.010> degrees<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.550> ascension

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
15 degrees of ascension

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.540 
15 degrees of ascension
that's<00:02:25.480> astrological<00:02:26.380> ascension<00:02:26.980> okay<00:02:27.280> I

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
that's astrological ascension okay I

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.750 
that's astrological ascension okay I
like<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.900> like<00:02:29.350> using<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.860> 15<00:02:30.220> minute<00:02:30.490> chance

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
like I like using the 15 minute chance

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.020 
like I like using the 15 minute chance
because<00:02:31.270> of<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.600> natural<00:02:31.810> time<00:02:32.260> connection

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
because of the natural time connection

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.440 
because of the natural time connection
so<00:02:34.030> 60<00:02:34.510> minutes<00:02:34.540> divided<00:02:35.350> by<00:02:35.530> 15<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.070> 4<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.850> the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
so 60 minutes divided by 15 is 4 and the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.530 
so 60 minutes divided by 15 is 4 and the
total<00:02:37.840> number<00:02:38.080> of<00:02:38.110> bars<00:02:38.410> in<00:02:38.650> 24<00:02:39.160> hours<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.730> 96

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
total number of bars in 24 hours is 96

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.410 
total number of bars in 24 hours is 96
so<00:02:41.290> that's<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:41.709> something<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.340> work<00:02:43.000> with<00:02:43.030> if

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
so that's just something to work with if

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.880 
so that's just something to work with if
you're<00:02:43.600> interested<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:44.410> sort<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.680> thing

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
you're interested in this sort of thing

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.400 
you're interested in this sort of thing
so<00:02:45.150> let's<00:02:46.150> have<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.360> look<00:02:46.570> at<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.750> Ozzie<00:02:47.110> again

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
so let's have a look at the Ozzie again

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.760 
so let's have a look at the Ozzie again
now<00:02:47.620> why<00:02:48.420> we<00:02:49.420> have<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.660> ask<00:02:49.810> ourselves<00:02:50.110> why

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
now why we have to ask ourselves why

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.370 
now why we have to ask ourselves why
there's<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:51.580> particular<00:02:52.270> area<00:02:53.140> it's

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
there's this particular area it's

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.699 
there's this particular area it's
causing<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:54.100> much<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.820> terms<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.709> resistance

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
causing so much in terms of resistance

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.830 
causing so much in terms of resistance
and<00:02:57.340> support<00:02:57.760> as<00:02:57.910> well<00:02:58.120> but<00:02:58.270> it's<00:02:58.420> like<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.600> a

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
and support as well but it's like a a

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.530 
and support as well but it's like a a
major<00:02:59.140> boundary<00:02:59.890> okay<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:00.760> also<00:03:01.090> down<00:03:01.510> here

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
major boundary okay and also down here

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.290 
major boundary okay and also down here
if<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.930> went<00:03:02.170> back<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.950> past<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.610> provided

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
if I went back in the past it provided

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.110 
if I went back in the past it provided
support<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.500> what<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.100> why<00:03:06.580> we<00:03:06.850> have<00:03:07.000> to

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
support so what is it why we have to

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.420 
support so what is it why we have to
look<00:03:07.269> astrologically<00:03:08.200> at<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.440> moment<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.130> the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
look astrologically at the moment on the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.710 
look astrologically at the moment on the
1st<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:09.940> July<00:03:11.130> which<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.670> today<00:03:13.330> for<00:03:13.600> me

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
1st of July which is that today for me

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.479 
1st of July which is that today for me
in<00:03:13.840> Australia<00:03:14.380> but<00:03:14.769> tomorrow

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
in Australia but tomorrow

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.250 
in Australia but tomorrow
most<00:03:16.090> places<00:03:16.360> we<00:03:16.810> have<00:03:17.080> an<00:03:17.470> eclipse<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:19.260> that

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
most places we have an eclipse and that

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.530 
most places we have an eclipse and that
is<00:03:20.530> at<00:03:20.830> 9<00:03:21.160> degrees<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.820> cancer

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
is at 9 degrees of cancer

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.430 
is at 9 degrees of cancer
okay<00:03:23.290> now<00:03:23.620> have<00:03:24.610> a<00:03:24.670> look<00:03:24.880> at<00:03:25.030> this<00:03:25.209> now<00:03:25.900> will

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
okay now have a look at this now will

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.979 
okay now have a look at this now will
I've<00:03:26.680> taught<00:03:27.070> you<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:28.000> lot<00:03:28.180> of<00:03:28.209> these<00:03:28.570> videos

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
I've taught you in a lot of these videos

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.810 
I've taught you in a lot of these videos
and<00:03:29.019> also<00:03:29.440> my<00:03:29.650> lessons<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.250> look<00:03:30.430> at<00:03:30.640> these

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
and also my lessons to look at these

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.690 
and also my lessons to look at these
major<00:03:31.200> formations<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:33.070> easiest<00:03:33.340> ways<00:03:33.670> to

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
major formations and the easiest ways to

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.020 
major formations and the easiest ways to
see<00:03:34.420> these<00:03:35.260> crop<00:03:35.739> these<00:03:36.450> squares<00:03:38.760> from<00:03:39.760> we've

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
see these crop these squares from we've

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.199 
see these crop these squares from we've
got<00:03:40.209> one<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.510> Saturn<00:03:41.190> one<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.340> Pluto<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:42.820> once

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
got one to Saturn one to Pluto and once

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.870 
got one to Saturn one to Pluto and once
you're<00:03:43.420> honest<00:03:43.720> now<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:44.220> grants<00:03:45.220> where<00:03:45.670> it's

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
you're honest now that grants where it's

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.430 
you're honest now that grants where it's
a<00:03:46.000> cardinal<00:03:46.330> square<00:03:46.720> because<00:03:47.019> these<00:03:47.140> are<00:03:47.320> all

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
a cardinal square because these are all

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.240 
a cardinal square because these are all
cardinal<00:03:47.950> signs<00:03:48.250> it's<00:03:48.970> called<00:03:49.330> a<00:03:49.390> green<00:03:50.250> cross

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
cardinal signs it's called a green cross

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.610 
cardinal signs it's called a green cross
or<00:03:51.850> it's<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.030> cross<00:03:52.269> or<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.510> square<00:03:52.870> okay<00:03:53.260> and

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
or it's a cross or a square okay and

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.410 
or it's a cross or a square okay and
that's<00:03:53.950> part<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.310> Gans<00:03:54.580> emblem<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:55.209> what

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
that's part of Gans emblem so what

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.940 
that's part of Gans emblem so what
happens<00:03:55.750> is<00:03:55.870> when<00:03:56.110> we<00:03:56.410> know<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.830> what

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
happens is when we know that what

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.449 
happens is when we know that what
they're<00:03:57.250> forming<00:03:57.790> a<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:59.350> square<00:03:59.799> that's

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
they're forming a this square that's

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.310 
they're forming a this square that's
hard<00:04:00.730> energy<00:04:01.150> because<00:04:01.330> there<00:04:01.480> are<00:04:01.600> 90<00:04:01.989> degrees

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
hard energy because there are 90 degrees

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.280 
hard energy because there are 90 degrees
separation<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.370> that<00:04:03.750> astrologically<00:04:04.750> is

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
separation and that astrologically is

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.430 
separation and that astrologically is
difficult<00:04:05.950> energy<00:04:06.459> ok<00:04:06.940> so<00:04:07.000> imagine<00:04:07.780> all<00:04:08.260> of

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
difficult energy ok so imagine all of

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.030 
difficult energy ok so imagine all of
them<00:04:08.680> coming<00:04:09.190> together<00:04:09.599> on<00:04:10.599> that<00:04:11.140> 90<00:04:11.650> which

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
them coming together on that 90 which

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.520 
them coming together on that 90 which
I'll<00:04:12.220> show<00:04:12.430> you<00:04:12.490> what<00:04:12.700> it<00:04:12.819> looks<00:04:13.000> like

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
I'll show you what it looks like

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.980 
I'll show you what it looks like
the<00:04:13.770> 90-degree<00:04:14.580> doll<00:04:14.850> is<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.090> amazing<00:04:15.810> it's

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
the 90-degree doll is so amazing it's

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.620 
the 90-degree doll is so amazing it's
what<00:04:16.829> I<00:04:16.859> use<00:04:17.430> all<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.730> time<00:04:17.970> as<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.180> can<00:04:18.390> see

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
what I use all the time as you can see

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.150 
what I use all the time as you can see
those<00:04:19.049> planets<00:04:19.530> all<00:04:19.650> coming<00:04:20.010> together

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
those planets all coming together

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.900 
those planets all coming together
because<00:04:20.549> they're<00:04:20.940> all<00:04:21.090> on<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:22.310> harmonic<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.430> 90

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
because they're all on a harmonic of 90

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.700 
because they're all on a harmonic of 90
or<00:04:24.000> fourth<00:04:24.270> harmonic<00:04:24.660> which<00:04:24.930> is<00:04:25.050> 90<00:04:25.410> degrees

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
or fourth harmonic which is 90 degrees

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.990 
or fourth harmonic which is 90 degrees
so<00:04:25.740> they<00:04:25.950> all<00:04:26.070> have<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.370> come<00:04:26.400> together<00:04:26.730> and

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
so they all have to come together and

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.390 
so they all have to come together and
this<00:04:27.090> is<00:04:27.150> showing<00:04:27.540> you<00:04:27.870> hard<00:04:28.710> energy<00:04:29.160> a

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
this is showing you hard energy a

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.960 
this is showing you hard energy a
clustering<00:04:30.120> of<00:04:30.240> energy<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:30.900> price<00:04:31.970> because

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
clustering of energy and price because

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.640 
clustering of energy and price because
of<00:04:33.000> this<00:04:33.300> also<00:04:33.570> is<00:04:34.080> finding<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.620> very

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
of this also is finding it very

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.980 
of this also is finding it very
difficult<00:04:34.920> there's<00:04:35.910> a<00:04:36.000> boundary<00:04:36.450> there<00:04:36.570> for

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
difficult there's a boundary there for

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.740 
difficult there's a boundary there for
it<00:04:37.140> okay<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.430> more<00:04:38.640> of<00:04:38.760> that<00:04:38.790> that<00:04:39.150> cluster

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
it okay so the more of that that cluster

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.440 
it okay so the more of that that cluster
you<00:04:39.930> get<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:41.190> more<00:04:41.400> resistance<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.120> support

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
you get the more resistance and support

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.530 
you get the more resistance and support
you<00:04:42.600> will<00:04:42.750> have<00:04:42.900> for<00:04:43.320> price<00:04:43.820> okay<00:04:44.820> so<00:04:45.360> that's

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
you will have for price okay so that's

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.180 
you will have for price okay so that's
still<00:04:45.750> on<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.050> ozzie<00:04:46.350> and<00:04:46.560> I'll<00:04:46.890> show<00:04:47.160> you

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
still on the ozzie and I'll show you

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.080 
still on the ozzie and I'll show you
this<00:04:47.430> on<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:48.030> Euro<00:04:48.210> same<00:04:49.200> thing<00:04:49.700> you<00:04:50.700> can<00:04:50.850> see

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
this on the Euro same thing you can see

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.760 
this on the Euro same thing you can see
if<00:04:51.300> I<00:04:51.390> had<00:04:51.540> have<00:04:51.660> gone<00:04:51.780> past<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.260> just<00:04:52.290> wanted<00:04:52.620> to

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
if I had have gone past I just wanted to

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.159 
if I had have gone past I just wanted to
show<00:04:52.950> you<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.160> last<00:04:53.400> two<00:04:53.640> days<00:04:53.820> you<00:04:54.720> can<00:04:54.900> see

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
show you the last two days you can see

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.550 
show you the last two days you can see
it<00:04:55.320> coming<00:04:55.860> through<00:04:56.040> here<00:04:56.840> also<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.440> other

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
it coming through here also the other

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.110 
it coming through here also the other
planets<00:04:58.980> will<00:04:59.100> play<00:04:59.280> an<00:04:59.370> important<00:04:59.790> role<00:04:59.820> too

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
planets will play an important role too

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.730 
planets will play an important role too
this<00:05:00.270> is<00:05:00.390> actually<00:05:00.720> a<00:05:00.750> Jupiter<00:05:01.200> here<00:05:01.410> so<00:05:01.650> the

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
this is actually a Jupiter here so the

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.680 
this is actually a Jupiter here so the
price<00:05:01.980> actually<00:05:02.220> bounced<00:05:02.790> on<00:05:02.940> Jupiter<00:05:03.419> and

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
price actually bounced on Jupiter and

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.900 
price actually bounced on Jupiter and
again<00:05:04.530> on<00:05:04.650> Jupiter<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.310> fourth<00:05:05.520> home<00:05:05.760> on

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
again on Jupiter and the fourth home on

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.840 
again on Jupiter and the fourth home on
it<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:06.270> it's<00:05:06.570> gone<00:05:06.810> up<00:05:07.050> up<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:08.040> sort<00:05:08.730> of

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
it and it's gone up up and sort of

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.750 
it and it's gone up up and sort of
finding<00:05:09.919> resistance<00:05:10.919> at<00:05:11.100> that<00:05:11.280> level<00:05:11.460> all

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
finding resistance at that level all

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.210 
finding resistance at that level all
that<00:05:11.910> clustering<00:05:12.330> planets<00:05:12.780> are<00:05:13.070> support<00:05:14.070> as

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
that clustering planets are support as

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.310 
that clustering planets are support as
well<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.730> at<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.360> moment<00:05:15.570> it's<00:05:15.810> right<00:05:16.050> here<00:05:16.260> I

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
well and at the moment it's right here I

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.080 
well and at the moment it's right here I
don't<00:05:16.440> know<00:05:16.620> if<00:05:16.740> it's<00:05:16.860> made<00:05:17.070> it<00:05:17.190> through<00:05:17.430> at

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
don't know if it's made it through at

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.659 
don't know if it's made it through at
the<00:05:18.270> moment<00:05:18.300> so<00:05:18.900> but<00:05:19.710> using<00:05:20.160> it<00:05:20.280> with<00:05:20.400> one<00:05:20.550> of

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
the moment so but using it with one of

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.010 
the moment so but using it with one of
your<00:05:20.760> favorite<00:05:21.150> indicators<00:05:21.690> I've<00:05:21.840> just

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
your favorite indicators I've just

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.600 
your favorite indicators I've just
support<00:05:22.290> the<00:05:22.440> RSI<00:05:22.890> on<00:05:23.040> the<00:05:23.130> bottom<00:05:23.400> here<00:05:23.580> you

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
support the RSI on the bottom here you

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.210 
support the RSI on the bottom here you
can<00:05:23.850> see<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.240> overbought<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:24.780> oversold

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
can see the overbought and oversold

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.320 
can see the overbought and oversold
signal<00:05:26.220> so<00:05:26.430> if<00:05:26.610> you<00:05:26.729> can<00:05:26.880> see<00:05:27.120> them

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
signal so if you can see them

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.710 
signal so if you can see them
approaching<00:05:28.370> some<00:05:29.370> of<00:05:29.400> this<00:05:29.610> clustering<00:05:30.210> sort

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
approaching some of this clustering sort

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.580 
approaching some of this clustering sort
of<00:05:30.810> gives<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.020> a<00:05:31.080> little<00:05:31.110> bit<00:05:31.380> more

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
of gives you a little bit more

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.159 
of gives you a little bit more
confidence<00:05:32.160> of<00:05:32.340> whether<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.940> start<00:05:33.570> to<00:05:33.930> sell

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
confidence of whether to start to sell

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.219 
confidence of whether to start to sell
or<00:05:34.320> not<00:05:34.380> okay<00:05:35.010> so<00:05:35.790> let's<00:05:36.270> have<00:05:36.360> a<00:05:36.510> look<00:05:36.720> at<00:05:36.960> the

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
or not okay so let's have a look at the

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.200 
or not okay so let's have a look at the
British<00:05:37.470> pan<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:38.100> same<00:05:38.340> sort<00:05:38.610> of<00:05:38.700> thing<00:05:38.910> here

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
British pan the same sort of thing here

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.090 
British pan the same sort of thing here
I<00:05:39.590> found<00:05:40.590> support<00:05:40.770> on<00:05:41.280> these<00:05:41.910> that's<00:05:42.690> Mars

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
I found support on these that's Mars

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.890 
I found support on these that's Mars
Mars<00:05:44.100> and<00:05:45.919> Pluto<00:05:46.919> sorry<00:05:47.669> no<00:05:47.910> sorry<00:05:48.180> Mars<00:05:48.540> and

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
Mars and Pluto sorry no sorry Mars and

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.070 
Mars and Pluto sorry no sorry Mars and
on<00:05:49.410> Pluto<00:05:50.190> I'm<00:05:50.910> sorry<00:05:51.240> I<00:05:51.330> haven't<00:05:51.510> labeled<00:05:51.780> all

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
on Pluto I'm sorry I haven't labeled all

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.690 
on Pluto I'm sorry I haven't labeled all
the<00:05:52.169> planets<00:05:52.560> on<00:05:52.710> this<00:05:52.830> one<00:05:53.070> I<00:05:53.160> just<00:05:53.370> did<00:05:53.550> my

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
the planets on this one I just did my

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.550 
the planets on this one I just did my
own<00:05:53.850> color<00:05:54.120> so<00:05:54.419> remember<00:05:54.840> what<00:05:54.930> they<00:05:55.080> are<00:05:55.110> and

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
own color so remember what they are and

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.990 
own color so remember what they are and
you<00:05:55.919> can<00:05:56.070> see<00:05:56.100> when<00:05:56.460> it<00:05:56.550> reached<00:05:56.790> those

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
you can see when it reached those

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.780 
you can see when it reached those
clustering<00:05:57.720> that<00:05:58.110> that<00:05:58.380> Cardinal<00:05:59.370> square

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
clustering that that Cardinal square

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.820 
clustering that that Cardinal square
there<00:06:00.030> that<00:06:00.540> I<00:06:00.570> found<00:06:00.840> it<00:06:01.020> very<00:06:01.080> difficult<00:06:01.290> to

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
there that I found it very difficult to

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.680 
there that I found it very difficult to
get<00:06:01.950> through<00:06:02.130> in<00:06:02.340> it's<00:06:02.490> it's<00:06:02.729> it's<00:06:03.180> come<00:06:03.450> down

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
get through in it's it's it's come down

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.010 
get through in it's it's it's come down
again<00:06:04.020> now<00:06:04.710> it's<00:06:04.979> made<00:06:05.280> a<00:06:05.460> higher<00:06:06.330> bottom<00:06:06.870> to

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
again now it's made a higher bottom to

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.320 
again now it's made a higher bottom to
this<00:06:07.169> one<00:06:07.470> and<00:06:07.680> it's<00:06:07.830> pushed<00:06:08.130> through<00:06:08.520> but

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
this one and it's pushed through but

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.270 
this one and it's pushed through but
again<00:06:09.600> it's<00:06:09.780> sort<00:06:10.020> of<00:06:10.080> resting<00:06:10.650> on<00:06:10.770> Jupiter

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
again it's sort of resting on Jupiter

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.580 
again it's sort of resting on Jupiter
and<00:06:11.520> then<00:06:12.180> it's<00:06:12.330> gone<00:06:12.540> up<00:06:12.780> and<00:06:12.960> again<00:06:13.229> it's<00:06:13.380> met

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
and then it's gone up and again it's met

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.940 
and then it's gone up and again it's met
resistance<00:06:14.600> to<00:06:15.600> the<00:06:15.690> clustering<00:06:16.229> Cardinal

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
resistance to the clustering Cardinal

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.030 
resistance to the clustering Cardinal
Square<00:06:17.540> and<00:06:18.540> then<00:06:19.050> again<00:06:19.350> it's<00:06:19.500> pulled<00:06:19.800> back

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
Square and then again it's pulled back

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.250 
Square and then again it's pulled back
so<00:06:20.400> you<00:06:20.700> know<00:06:20.790> it's<00:06:20.940> it's<00:06:21.240> amazing<00:06:21.539> to<00:06:21.990> look<00:06:22.110> at
