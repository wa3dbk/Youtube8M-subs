00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.400
 here we are defining techniques and 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.230
 we have not always tried 10 reculta 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.810
 tyc of mixology and is what we will 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.690
 do on that occasion with a cocktail made 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:27.390
 by us called os vais fisco 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.390
 first of all let's add full 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.730
 let's play by adding an advance of 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.060
 a role of 5 years as having where 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.060
 strike 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.620
 let's play a digital aromatic disc 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.620
 from sotelo 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.160
 later as the cocktail bar 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.280
 building is used a lot we are going to cut 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.280
 to see you heal a pepper syrup 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.870
 which we are going to do one thing 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.950
 and then we're going to add a juice of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.300
 pineapple 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:16.180
 no sugar one more thing 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:20.220
 and passion fruit juice also without sugar 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.920
 one more thing we are always fresh 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.550
 what the hold and Atticus 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.840
 original always 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.840
 then we are going to add 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.550
 latest 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.350
 to amalgamate all the flavors 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.200
 always required 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.750
 we proceed to beat 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.840
 then we are going to add 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.659
 and we are going to add 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.230
 and the picados 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.720
 it was good 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.720
 and always controlling 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.900
 we will reach this 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.250
 the double combination by straightening a little bit 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.310
 because remember that when squeezing the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.310
 lemon 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.400
 some kind that is 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:47.319
 leaving the necessary space 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:51.969
 to finish completing what 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:54.180
 handmade vermouth with strong tones of 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:57.310
 chamomile 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.150
 let's aromatize a little 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.150
 the cocktail 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.570
 like the orange peel 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.870
 and let's go to the league 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.870
 some sorbets 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.450
 and finally we are going to decorate 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.110
 with pineapple 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.940
 at your expense 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.940
 for that country 0 2
