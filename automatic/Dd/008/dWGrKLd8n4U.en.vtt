00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.880
 hello to everyone from the unsj yesterday 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.740
 good today I bring you the second 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.320
 compilation of tricks with the trampoline 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.790
 and so, well, let's start 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.260
 this trick is to place us here 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.150
 behind the wall as we see we are 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.680
 behind the stone is this way you have 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.900
 fixed seeing them I'll say where we 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.669
 we put there we see it in the first person 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.890
 what we have to do is place the 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.689
 trampoline here right on this wall 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.909
 located where I am placing it 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.259
 then once we place it there 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.150
 we see that we are trying a little 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.170
 trying to find the most point or 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.190
 least to see where the trick is done 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.780
 we have to see that we have it placed 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.520
 we wait for it to go down we put in 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.220
 this corner and we hope to lower the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.740
 trampoline we see that we get here 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.450
 inside is worth inside this wall if we 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.620
 we crouch we can lift it up 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.480
 we'll have to until we go out to 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.070
 'plante' we see that the zombies are 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.920
 It is the accumulated mucosa before 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.990
 ok since it's a trick they can also 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.520
 attack since I do not recommend 100% that 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.100
 you do it but if you want to do it 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.350
 do if you want nothing happens ye 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.110
 free this trick I already uploaded 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.760
 long ago little better said in the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.890
 that what we were doing was the same 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.580
 procedure that this one except that instead 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.290
 to upload 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.550
 on top of the map we climb on top of the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.580
 roof for what we have to do is 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.230
 place the trampoline there opposite is worth and 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.340
 then take the partner's there 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.710
 we see that what we have to do 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.260
 now it's waiting for it to go down and when 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.970
 come down here and we have to 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.950
 try until we get caught and 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.860
 we see that we try it again lame 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.300
 13 with the partner's trampoline and we 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.620
 we are approaching little by little until 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.810
 put us and see what has gotten us 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.400
 perfect and I have to put in the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.890
 trampoline a little sending towards the 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.240
 left and there you have seen it and the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.430
 we wait for the trampoline below 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.380
 come down and then take us then 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.240
 then we take the one below and now 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.140
 we will have the one above placed inside the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.050
 only thing we have to do is 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.390
 put us here stuck and justly 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.400
 here I'm aiming we put high and now 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.710
 will put us in here can pass two 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.880
 things one that puts you here and you do not hear 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.340
 we climb on top of the roof that goes 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.780
 pretty good or take us to the rival 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.510
 all of heaven is worth for these is 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.220
 teach in a video that I already uploaded that 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.270
 I took you to heaven and you will have to fall 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.280
 in a place so that you do not kill 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.479
 patch now and so good then 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.670
 you have seen that what we have to 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.470
 do here little is worth here the zombies do not 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.240
 they pile up but we will be invincible 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.730
 that we can create others 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.740
 or if we can be completely 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.810
 invincible here we can make another 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.850
 trick in front of you already what 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.290
 I will teach this trick soon 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.910
 I was testing the other day, it's worth 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.770
 a trick pretty easy to do what 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.870
 we will do is get inside the tables 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.030
 of the sewing machines is worth where 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.500
 are there and there we see that what 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.270
 what we have to do is place the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.280
 trampoline just looking a little 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.620
 towards the wall is only a little bit worth 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.720
 nothing else we already see that once it is 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.310
 come down little by little towards the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.530
 wall until we see that he does not get 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.320
 in here it's worth what happens is that 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.880
 we have to be jumping painting and 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.340
 everything to be able to leave here because if 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.340
 you notice they do not throw us there you see that 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.300
 ua say I stay no longer as green here 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.820
 so what we have to do is 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.230
 meter jump around it to me 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.240
 it came out pretty fast as you have seen 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.160
 we can move for all this 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.930
 but as I'm telling you, you'll have to 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.610
 try them many times until she dares 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.550
 try jumping jumping jumping until 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.430
 you can go out, you can see that here 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.280
 we can move for anything goes for all 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.960
 this area and we will be totally 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.120
 invincible is worth as we can see 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.569
 we can move from this part to the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.579
 other 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.170
 and no zombies can attack us 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.510
 that we can do what we want have 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.159
 we have many angles to kill and so 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.109
 that you see that the truth is a trick 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.180
 what happens that to leave energetic 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.760
 go out with another trampoline if you want if 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.379
 it breaks that's why this trick is done 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.900
 in this hole what we will have to 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.430
 to do is to be as you see at least two 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.739
 people in the game to do the 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.719
 trick and what we will see is that we have 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.730
 to put us in two positions and 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.799
 we know that in the first one you have to 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.840
 be on a wall near the wall there 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.120
 we see it more or less out there does not have 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.560
 to be exactly exactly in that 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.030
 where it has been placed has to be 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.709
 more or less out there but neither do you pass 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.629
 it has to be you do not know how you have 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.449
 seen in the video and the other one has to 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.620
 to be here more or less is also worth it and the 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.629
 that is here what I recommend that 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.400
 take titan because they can hit us 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.079
 Once there you have seen it but it is no longer 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.030
 they can hit us many times at what 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.590
 that can hit us once 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.180
 nothing that we can be here all the 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.470
 departure those from behind do not come not us 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.790
 they come by now only they 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.560
 they pile up here what happens here 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.030
 from here there is not much angle that 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.340
 has more angle is the one that is in the 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.690
 left but good we see that it is 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.970
 easy enough we can do rounds 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.530
 easily here and so good then 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.010
 here we will see it in third person how 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.530
 they are falling they are repairing themselves by the weapon 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.900
 is new this trick is to get us 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.630
 inside the room without electricity 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.280
 open door is worth the truth is that a lot 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.470
 utility does not have the trick but you see 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.060
 that is curious I was trying it myself 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.370
 I said look over here we can 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.010
 put without having without having the need 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.720
 to open the door and then what 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.140
 what we have to do is place the 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.540
 trap is 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.130
 the sweeping steam we have to place 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.020
 there is that way and then one 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.760
 is lowered we have to approach the 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.050
 wall little by little until he puts us 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.490
 in here and we see that we are 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.920
 looking at the wall 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.960
 good bypassing everything and then already 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.180
 will push us and get us 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.970
 in one of two or you can draw another 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.800
 time or get in here, you have seen that 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.420
 it has gone to the first voucher and 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.970
 it's a pretty easy trick to do already 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.650
 you see how good is another trick and 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.900
 sure it's safe I assure you there are 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.760
 many more that can be done from this 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.250
 way without opening door and I'll try 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.200
 bring more and I can and so good then 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.300
