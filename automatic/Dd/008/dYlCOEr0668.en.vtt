00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.860 

it's<00:03:43.210> like<00:03:43.390> alternating<00:03:44.050> it's<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.350> form

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
it's like alternating it's the form

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.059 
it's like alternating it's the form
indexed<00:03:46.870> or<00:03:47.050> middle<00:03:47.860> thumb<00:03:48.160> index<00:03:48.400> or<00:03:48.880> middle

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
indexed or middle thumb index or middle

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.470 
indexed or middle thumb index or middle
and<00:03:51.300> that<00:03:52.300> will<00:03:52.480> be<00:03:52.600> on<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.550> set<00:03:54.550> up<00:03:54.670> sync<00:03:54.910> that

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
and that will be on the set up sync that

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.230 
and that will be on the set up sync that
will<00:03:55.690> be<00:03:55.780> on<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.050> first<00:03:56.260> string<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:58.000> what<00:03:58.120> we
