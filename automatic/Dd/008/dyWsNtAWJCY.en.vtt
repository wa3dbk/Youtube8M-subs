Dolphy we don't even know if that is a
clone<00:00:38.010> or<00:00:38.040> not<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:39.120> doesn't<00:00:39.480> matter<00:00:39.899> we've

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
clone or not it doesn't matter we've

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.020 
clone or not it doesn't matter we've
already<00:00:40.379> seen<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> devastation<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.850> of

already seen the devastation one of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.270 
already seen the devastation one of
these<00:00:42.149> clones<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.829> loopy

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
these clones can do and so loopy

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.310 
these clones can do and so loopy
fighting<00:00:45.030> Dolphy<00:00:45.680> yeah<00:00:47.300> okay<00:00:48.300> okay<00:00:48.930> well

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
we'll have to see this and what makes it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.729 
we'll have to see this and what makes it
even<00:00:50.969> scarier<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:52.199> they're<00:00:52.379> trapped

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
even scarier is that they're trapped

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.010 
even scarier is that they're trapped
inside<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.399> corridor<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.329> well<00:00:54.690> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
inside of a corridor this well and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.139 
inside of a corridor this well and
Dolphy<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.829> blocking<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.370> only<00:00:56.610> interest<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
Dolphy is blocking the only interest is

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.150 
Dolphy is blocking the only interest is
little<00:00:57.480> freakin<00:00:57.870> hole<00:00:58.079> how<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> hell<00:00:59.129> are

them to pieces this next chapter is
going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.909> fucking<00:01:06.479> insane<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
going to be so fucking insane I have a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.440 
going to be so fucking insane I have a
couple<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.490> Furies<00:01:08.760> real<00:01:08.909> quick<00:01:09.090> okay<00:01:09.299> but

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
couple of Furies real quick okay but

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.700 
couple of Furies real quick okay but
before<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.720> go<00:01:09.840> into<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> other<00:01:10.229> stuff<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.590> this

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
before I go into the other stuff in this

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.850 
before I go into the other stuff in this
chapter<00:01:11.010> okay<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:12.720> see<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> birdcage

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
chapter okay so we see the birdcage

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.440 
chapter okay so we see the birdcage
shrink<00:01:14.400> down<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> little<00:01:14.850> bit<00:01:14.970> fujitora

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
shrink down a little bit fujitora

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.120 
shrink down a little bit fujitora
mentions<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.170> earlier<00:01:16.350> parts<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.920> this

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
mentions that in earlier parts of this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.160 
mentions that in earlier parts of this
chapter<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.180> might<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.659> into<00:01:18.990> more

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
chapter so this might go into more

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.170 
chapter so this might go into more
explaining<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.740> most<00:01:19.979> likely<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.580> dollfie

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
explaining that most likely this dollfie

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.580 
explaining that most likely this dollfie
at<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> end<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.750> chapter<00:01:22.020> could<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
at the end of this chapter could be a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.010 
at the end of this chapter could be a
clone<00:01:22.890> since<00:01:23.460> birdcage<00:01:23.970> shrunk<00:01:24.420> down<00:01:24.630> i'm

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
clone since birdcage shrunk down i'm

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.630 
clone since birdcage shrunk down i'm
guessing<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.560> clone<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.159> holding<00:01:26.460> at<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
guessing the clone of is holding at the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
guessing the clone of is holding at the
birdcage<00:01:27.000> might<00:01:27.210> weaken<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.110> dollfie

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
birdcage might weaken and so dollfie

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.830 
birdcage might weaken and so dollfie
made<00:01:28.680> another<00:01:28.979> clone<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:29.939> able<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.509> attack

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
made another clone to be able to attack

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.749 
made another clone to be able to attack
luffy<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.439> law<00:01:31.619> I'm<00:01:32.040> guessing<00:01:32.430> that's<00:01:32.520> what's

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
luffy in law I'm guessing that's what's

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.460 
luffy in law I'm guessing that's what's
going<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.090> right<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.390> because<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.079> mean<00:01:34.320> since

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
going on right now because I mean since

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.230 
going on right now because I mean since
the<00:01:34.590> birdcage<00:01:34.920> front<00:01:35.189> down<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.520> would<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.700> for

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the birdcage front down it would be for

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.490 
the birdcage front down it would be for
some<00:01:36.420> reason<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.780> Dolphy<00:01:37.079> either<00:01:37.229> getting

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
some reason of Dolphy either getting

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.499 
some reason of Dolphy either getting
weaker<00:01:37.950> taking<00:01:38.549> damage<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:39.090> at<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> same<00:01:39.390> time

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
weaker taking damage or at the same time

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.940 
weaker taking damage or at the same time
making<00:01:39.689> another<00:01:39.930> clone<00:01:40.259> that's<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> only

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
making another clone that's the only

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.370 
making another clone that's the only
obvious<00:01:41.100> thing<00:01:41.430> at<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.670> moment<00:01:42.000> okay<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.140> at

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
obvious thing at this moment okay so at

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.380 
obvious thing at this moment okay so at
