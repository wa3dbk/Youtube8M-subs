with<00:06:42.240> this<00:06:42.360> even<00:06:42.540> though<00:06:42.600> i<00:06:42.630> didn't<00:06:42.840> quite<00:06:43.020> get

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
with this even though i didn't quite get

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.720 
with this even though i didn't quite get
to<00:06:43.260> do<00:06:43.410> what<00:06:43.560> I<00:06:43.590> wanted<00:06:43.830> to<00:06:43.890> do<00:06:44.070> that<00:06:44.520> said<00:06:44.700> I

think<00:06:44.820> this<00:06:45.030> deck<00:06:45.210> actually<00:06:45.510> works<00:06:45.630> a<00:06:45.690> little

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
think this deck actually works a little

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.270 
think this deck actually works a little
bit<00:06:45.930> better<00:06:46.260> than<00:06:46.560> how<00:06:46.680> I<00:06:46.710> was<00:06:46.920> running<00:06:47.190> it

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
bit better than how I was running it

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.220 
bit better than how I was running it
before<00:06:48.090> um<00:06:48.620> I<00:06:50.180> I<00:06:51.180> definitely<00:06:51.600> like<00:06:51.840> this<00:06:51.990> build

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
before um I I definitely like this build

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.560 
before um I I definitely like this build
compared<00:06:52.710> to<00:06:52.770> my<00:06:52.860> old<00:06:52.890> dragon<00:06:53.700> build<00:06:54.120> a<00:06:54.360> little

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
compared to my old dragon build a little

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.570 
compared to my old dragon build a little
bit<00:06:54.660> better<00:06:55.070> dragons<00:06:56.070> mirrors<00:06:56.280> a<00:06:56.340> little<00:06:56.490> more

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
bit better dragons mirrors a little more

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.860 
bit better dragons mirrors a little more
consistent<00:06:57.060> it's<00:06:57.180> just<00:06:57.330> a<00:06:57.420> little<00:06:57.600> bit<00:06:57.720> I

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
consistent it's just a little bit I

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.000 
consistent it's just a little bit I
think<00:06:58.110> it's<00:06:58.200> just<00:06:58.380> a<00:06:58.410> little<00:06:58.590> bit<00:06:58.740> overall

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
think it's just a little bit overall

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.290 
think it's just a little bit overall
better<00:06:59.130> I<00:06:59.220> solo<00:06:59.430> things<00:06:59.580> that<00:06:59.730> great<00:07:00.060> but<00:07:00.240> I

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
better I solo things that great but I

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.940 
better I solo things that great but I
think<00:07:00.480> it's<00:07:00.570> a<00:07:00.630> lot<00:07:00.780> more<00:07:00.810> fun<00:07:01.050> to<00:07:01.200> play<00:07:01.350> but<00:07:01.560> I

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
think it's a lot more fun to play but I

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.050 
think it's a lot more fun to play but I
