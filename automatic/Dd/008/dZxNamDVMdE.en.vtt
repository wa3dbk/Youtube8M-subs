 jungle 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:51.479
 as you will see the skills can be 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.509
 performed in combination in the eco echoes is 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.829
 likewise no-cup air short attack 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.310
 a small area around another one 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.310
 character 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.679
 Well now that I've explained things to you 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.539
 Take already know all do not give a damn 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:12.360
 we don't pass things on to anyone 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:14.730
 series with the ato is possible to leave 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.190
 both of q if you want to play a little more if 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.440
 we have of ourselves in this case we see glue 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.510
 and I attack the champion directly 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.100
 opponent on level 1 using i 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.500
 minion to verify the damage for 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.670
 move i do my free for 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:34.560
 come back on twitter with the remember 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.440
 140 damage already from level 1 in the phase 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.180
 of slow pede to adopt different strategies 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.910
 one of these wait for the minions for 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.500
 reach the opponent is in loss 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:49.410
 few or you could just do it yourself 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.900
 and try to stop it and then maybe 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.940
 take the frates we remember are 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.350
 very easy to defeat as diaso 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.090
 we give here it is possible already from level 3 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:06.140
 with the help that the passive and the wall 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.140
 without losing too much life 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.400
 look anyway when possible of 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:27.569
 exploit the potential of whom 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:30.620
 in lane the last can be activated when 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.359
 there is some opponent in the area 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.650
 if you are quite sure of yourself there 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:39.260
 I advise you to delay as much as possible 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.260
 he maximizes the duration of the new camp 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.629
 better than this character comes out 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.689
 when you have other hard linkages 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:51.930
 in teams you can simply 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:53.669
 go inside pitting everyone and caesar 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.859
 opponents then to finish after the team 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:59.250
 fight as it is happening with this 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:02.750
 poor cahill but saved if not 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.750
 I am in fact 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.790
 the characters we are with 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:17.070
 good for excellence are part of ten 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:18.780
 with air k as a 3 wool hole up 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.690
 golden cager then use ours 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.710
 last on their no cup without having to 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.710
 remove the 3 q 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:49.169
 guys I leave you with one last trick 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:50.399
 which is the wall jump must serve monsters 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.419
 neutral and reach them by products 

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:55.889
 go on holiday walls the moment in 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:01.409
 direction in which you know is the 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:02.759
 I show this eagle and mini case and with the 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.309
 dax in the size of the wall not 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.379
 exceeded now is not really 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:10.279
 immediate with a bit of training there 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.279
 you will do it smoothly 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.670
 hello thank you all for your time 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.060
 for your attention 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.370

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.880
 forget what care subscribers referred from 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.710

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.510
 also because the idea of â€‹â€‹the guide was born 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:40.090
 right from facebook from a survey that 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:42.370
 I shared it was voted case at all 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.060
