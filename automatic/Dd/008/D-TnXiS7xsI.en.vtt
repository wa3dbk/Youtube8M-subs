smoke<00:04:07.439> sadly<00:04:08.090> RPGs<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.449> use<00:04:09.599> this<00:04:09.840> with<00:04:10.109> all<00:04:10.379> my

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
smoke sadly RPGs I use this with all my

smoke sadly RPGs I use this with all my
dragon<00:04:10.859> art<00:04:10.979> class<00:04:11.220> let's<00:04:11.669> talk<00:04:11.879> about<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.389> um

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
dragon art class let's talk about it um

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.140 
dragon art class let's talk about it um
it's<00:04:13.470> really<00:04:13.590> good<00:04:14.099> because<00:04:14.310> if<00:04:14.729> you<00:04:14.849> need<00:04:15.030> it

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
it's really good because if you need it

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.060 
it's really good because if you need it
to<00:04:15.299> take<00:04:15.509> out<00:04:15.689> a<00:04:15.720> chopper<00:04:16.139> um<00:04:18.199> then<00:04:19.199> you're

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
to take out a chopper um then you're

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.500 
to take out a chopper um then you're
obviously<00:04:20.190> defenseless<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.090> can't<00:04:21.299> shoot

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
obviously defenseless you can't shoot

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.040 
obviously defenseless you can't shoot
out<00:04:21.719> like<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:22.139> could<00:04:22.320> with<00:04:22.469> it<00:04:22.590> out

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
out like you could with it out

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.439 
out like you could with it out
this<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.860> good<00:04:24.389> claymores<00:04:25.389> obvious<00:04:25.930> reasons

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
this is good claymores obvious reasons

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.640 
this is good claymores obvious reasons
three<00:04:28.449> frags<00:04:29.310> yeah<00:04:30.509> go<00:04:31.509> ahead<00:04:31.659> use<00:04:32.229> it<00:04:32.409> with<00:04:32.530> a

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
three frags yeah go ahead use it with a

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.869 
three frags yeah go ahead use it with a
thought<00:04:32.860> though<00:04:33.159> you're<00:04:33.460> going<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.639> use<00:04:33.759> they

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:33.879 
thought though you're going to use they

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.029 
thought though you're going to use they
come<00:04:34.150> I<00:04:34.389> think<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:35.169> can<00:04:35.319> use<00:04:35.440> all<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:35.889> these

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
come I think you can use all of these

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.300 
come I think you can use all of these
about<00:04:36.599> bandolier<00:04:37.599> if<00:04:37.720> you<00:04:37.900> really<00:04:38.379> rarely<00:04:38.889> run

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
about bandolier if you really rarely run

going to miss Moshe shells because the

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.129 
going to miss Moshe shells because the
recoil<00:05:24.759> is<00:05:24.879> going<00:05:25.030> to<00:05:25.090> be<00:05:25.180> too<00:05:25.360> insane<00:05:25.750> don't

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
recoil is going to be too insane don't

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.749 
recoil is going to be too insane don't
use<00:05:26.289> that<00:05:26.880> overkill<00:05:28.169> okay<00:05:29.169> I<00:05:29.740> would<00:05:30.370> say<00:05:30.550> try

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.959 
use that overkill okay I would say try
to<00:05:30.969> use<00:05:31.150> it<00:05:31.300> more<00:05:31.479> for<00:05:31.690> hardcore<00:05:32.550> maybe<00:05:33.550> jammer

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 
to use it more for hardcore maybe jammer

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.240 
to use it more for hardcore maybe jammer
great<00:05:34.630> hardcore<00:05:35.020> but<00:05:35.620> it's<00:05:35.800> kind<00:05:36.039> of<00:05:36.069> useless

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250
