00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
a ball out and I could have scored here

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.500 
a ball out and I could have scored here
if<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.400> took<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:08.760> further<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:09.239> it's<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.420> nice

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
if I took it on further but it's a nice

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.479 
if I took it on further but it's a nice
shot<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.900> get<00:03:10.019> a<00:03:10.049> corner<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.620> he<00:03:11.250> just

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
shot and I get a corner and he just

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.130 
shot and I get a corner and he just
dribbles<00:03:11.880> around<00:03:11.970> players<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:13.110> think

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
dribbles around players and I think

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.479 
dribbles around players and I think
there<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.620> definitely<00:03:14.069> an<00:03:14.220> improvement

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
there is a definitely an improvement
