interview<00:02:46.780> tip<00:02:46.989> would<00:02:47.410> be<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:48.010> go<00:02:48.730> into<00:02:48.940> the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
interview tip would be to go into the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.270 
interview tip would be to go into the
room<00:02:49.390> with<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.380> goal<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.799> getting<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.130> know

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
room with the goal of getting to know

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.949 
room with the goal of getting to know
the<00:02:51.519> judges<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.090> let<00:02:52.209> them<00:02:52.360> get<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.660> know<00:02:52.750> you

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
the judges and let them get to know you

the judges and let them get to know you
a<00:02:52.989> little<00:02:53.170> bit<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.010> think<00:02:54.190> it's<00:02:54.310> so

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
a little bit and I think it's so

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.190 
a little bit and I think it's so
important<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.120> also<00:02:55.299> read<00:02:55.690> up<00:02:55.720> on<00:02:56.049> who

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
important to you to also read up on who

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.140 
important to you to also read up on who

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
your judges are going to be so that you

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.270 
your judges are going to be so that you
have<00:02:58.329> background<00:02:58.569> on<00:02:59.019> them<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.620> then<00:03:00.069> just

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
have background on them and then just

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.620 
have background on them and then just
treat<00:03:00.549> it<00:03:00.579> like<00:03:00.670> you're<00:03:01.000> you're<00:03:01.299> sitting

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
treat it like you're you're sitting

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.750 
treat it like you're you're sitting

I would have to say that the best
interview<00:03:07.590> tip<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.070> ever<00:03:08.190> received<00:03:08.400> was

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
interview tip that I ever received was

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.930 
interview tip that I ever received was

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
to actually do the job before you become

schools<00:03:16.440> developing<00:03:17.040> your<00:03:17.160> school<00:03:17.430> program<00:03:17.880> I

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
schools developing your school program I

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.120 
schools developing your school program I
think<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.810> probably<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.200> best<00:03:19.470> interview<00:03:19.920> tip

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
think is probably the best interview tip

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.410 
think is probably the best interview tip
it<00:03:20.310> creates<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.610> lot<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.730> substance<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.300> the

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
it creates a lot of substance in the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.820 
it creates a lot of substance in the
interview<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.140> I<00:03:22.200> think<00:03:22.230> makes<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.680> really

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
interview and I think makes a really

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.410 
interview and I think makes a really
valuable<00:03:23.040> experience<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.030> judges<00:03:24.330> as

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
valuable experience for the judges as

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.450 
valuable experience for the judges as
well<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:25.050> I<00:03:25.770> think<00:03:26.010> that's<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.310> most

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
well and I think that's the most

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.100 
well and I think that's the most
important<00:03:27.090> tip<00:03:27.270> that<00:03:27.300> I<00:03:27.480> could<00:03:27.750> give<00:03:27.870> anyone

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
important tip that I could give anyone

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.820 
important tip that I could give anyone
is<00:03:28.440> don't<00:03:29.100> be<00:03:29.220> tempted<00:03:29.490> to<00:03:30.380> become<00:03:31.380> somebody

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
is don't be tempted to become somebody

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.040 
is don't be tempted to become somebody
else<00:03:32.040> or<00:03:32.310> try<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.550> emulate<00:03:33.030> or<00:03:33.420> model<00:03:33.780> someone

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
else or try to emulate or model someone

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.500 
else or try to emulate or model someone
else<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:34.560> know<00:03:34.860> God<00:03:35.100> created<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:35.940> be<00:03:36.120> and
