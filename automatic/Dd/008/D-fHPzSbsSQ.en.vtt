00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.469
 hello glad to welcome you 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.990
 channel megaphone tv today we are with you 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.020
 let's figure out what 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.380
 and tara should choose today we will 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.890
 choose a guitar well I suggest this 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.220
 Vidos do pro acoustic guitar then 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.130
 there is no pickup next vidos 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.439
 I'll probably write about electric guitars not 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.239
 acoustic are not two types with 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.840
 iron strings with nylon 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.420
 strings 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.789
 do not think that everything is so simple the differences are not 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.890
 only in the strings of the carp frame itself 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.850
 guitars have differences in sound 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.070
 naturally too 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.309
 but first let's talk about the difference 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.940
 iron strings they pull much 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.190
 stronger than nylon and well, I'll show you 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.339
 the example here is this little guitar here 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.909
 this part here and this part of the guitar they are 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:02.100
 one that is but in this 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:05.580
 particular guitar they are glued from when 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.619
 glue relief and in ordinary guitar with 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.130
 nylon strings but nylon it 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.840
 here are some of which 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.570
 sound softer they play mostly 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.399
 classical guitar players but mostly 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.579
 In general, they are more nylon strings 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:24.719
 common since they still don't 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:27.299
 so they beat on the fingers as if when 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.909
 you do your fingers do not 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.890
 are erased so much and they generally 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.259
 much softer well nylon plastic 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.899
 can say iron strings is another 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.030
 history because iron strings are very 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.130
 strongly pull from here to court 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.829
 the tension is very strong and they can 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.009
 just pull out the neck and wrest it for 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.719
 In order to avoid this inside is made 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.880
 pin about the court goes 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.030
 metal pin from here i mean he 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.719
 he will firmly hold the guitar himself 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.840
 neck and nothing breaks even there sometimes 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.869
 there are bolts that screw it 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.240
 used to screw in now I don't know but 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.140
 I know before that they screwed up the differences 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.900
 and the sound of the sound well, I think what are you 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.220
 each person must choose which one 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.100
 the sound he likes 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.440
 metal or nylon with it 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.200
 The point is not only that soft and 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.810
 solid there are many aspects you need to play 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.570
 and listen further at the guitar with 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.590
 metal strings usually this 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.560
 here is the width of the neck 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.660
 she is much narrower than a guitar with 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.640
 nylon strings well, about show 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.980
 Now let's say this is a guitar with metal 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.270
 strings and nylon guitars will be here 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.550
 such a width neck 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.130
 usually metal strings buy those 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.800
 you want to play all the same stage 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.170
 any strange music there is not well 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.760
 classical classic classic guitar player 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.620
 playing on nylon strings 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.650
 classical guitarists 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.959
 that is, they have a slightly different staging 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.400
 hands and for this they have a much wider neck 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.100
 the small narrow neck is made to 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.590
 so you can easily get in right away 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.250
 not looking what combination we need 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.100
 to put 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.840
 there are pros and cons so 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.519
 see for yourself what you want to play what 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.100
 you are comfortable and most importantly judge by 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.530
 sound and if you like the sound then 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.799
 take a guitar if you don't like the sound then 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.500
 choose a different one and so now for us 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.910
 choose your own guitar with iron 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.950
 strings and then tell you how with 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.989
 nylon iron strings what are you 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.769
 must check we must check 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.430
 chops how well they are fixed on 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.290
 how many bolts are screwed in there 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.799
 as far as they go well that is they 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.829
 may be there ungreased or just 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.530
 rusted well, you never know 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.230
 Strug there will buy and will be very 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.440
 bad hard to go better this guitar is not 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.380
 buy because you are new 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.630
 tune and and and there lubricate it 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.930
 constantly in general what else do you have to 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.370
 pay attention to the well since here 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.060
 this part is dk 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.030
 and this part of the neck they are not monolithic but 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.880
 You can say so they are not a whole you 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.640
 must determine how the neck is glued to 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.380
 the guitar itself if you have a slope like this 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.900
 Well, I naturally exaggerate 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.660
 then it is still normal and if the slope in this 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.400
 aside then this is bad well i am natural 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.510
 exaggerating there the slope can be 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.940
 one or two degrees 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.250
 that is, if there is a big slope 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.290
 he wouldn't buy you either 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.990
 will be very far reaching 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.560
 press look like this 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.380
 the guitar and the plane here it is the neck 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.070
 must lie on the same plane as 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.700
 plane 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.190
 soundboard here here that is look and 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.770
 utensils vulture and wildly with this 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.100
 consideration should be parallel 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.470
 each other and the neck should not be further 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.050
 tilted like this he shouldn't 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.900
 curl somehow there might be 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.300
 fall into a hole he must be 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.740
 perfectly even you can look 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.650
 in fact here on this one here and 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.360
 compare it with this one 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.810
 impose on each other through here 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.430
 so here and then you will understand just but 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.650
 relatively naturally this one 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.970
 big plane when you figure out how 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:31.150
 just how big is the error there 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:34.720
 was when machining a tool but if 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:38.820
 little slope that you too you can her 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:42.030
 buy because it is quite normal 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.340
 what else should I check? 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.440
 Are there any cracks if you take it from hand 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.370
 because there may be significant 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.990
 cracks here here and here here and 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.170
 traces of blows here I have a very 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:58.560
 just because I'm not careful and 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.390
 I keep and when we allow food in there 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.180
 music school must jump 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:06.090
 over the fence and she is thousand above the fence 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.450
 and here a crack appears so here 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.450
 it should be seen well and naturally 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.290
 play play even if you can't 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.690
 nothing to play 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:22.680
 just play there every way 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:25.320
 there that every note sounded and that 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.760
 without any overtones sounded all that is 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.730
 clear sound and everything 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.370
 and pull each string there all 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.650
 sounded good don't neglect such 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.260
 checks it is important to choose a good 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.840
 tool there is another vidos me 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.540
 how to choose an electric guitar 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.850
 can see if you do not trust well

 two horns a distinctive feature not even in 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:13.650
 form but here's a pickup ah if you 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:17.480
