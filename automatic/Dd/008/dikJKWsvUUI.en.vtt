00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.080
 and well that's another year, if not for us 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.150
 this year was very good in terms of 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.160
 News movies and comics by RÃ©gil and 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.780
 that's why I bring you a top 5 of the 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.340
 most important world news 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.300
 comics according to my opinion 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.580
 let's start number 5 the return of peter 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.160
 parker 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.140
 definitely the death of Peter Parker together 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.390
 with the later higher power man 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.820
 were the most controversial chapters of the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.009
 superhero's life but what happened 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.900
 had to happen now touched that is 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.660
 dead and the medicine that spider-man has 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.580
 returned with all the bad luck and humor 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.470
 that characterizes it now will have to 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.600
 Fix your life after events 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.010
 of superior spider-man 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.870
 number 4 captain falco this is not only 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.289
 refers to the captain's change of color 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.600
 america but all the characters 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:58.820
 racially varied that you have introduced 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.489
 marvel to his comics to do looks 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.619
 inclusive and that attract more audience 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.520
 which has been a constant in this 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.560
 year in the two editorials 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.270
 number 3 the death of the watchman if one 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.850
 of the most iconic characters in 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.990
 mysteries of marvel has died in a 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.540
 event 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.500
 that according to barber would change forever 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.720
 the universe 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.880
 but this has brought some changes 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.190
 important in some superiors like 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.250

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.930

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.890
 this year it was really overwhelming the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.830
 number of movies that were 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.950

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.130
 this can be considered a good 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.060
 news but it would also take away emotion 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.870
