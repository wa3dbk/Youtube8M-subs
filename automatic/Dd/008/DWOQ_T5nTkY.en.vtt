and you're just going to click on that
and<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.370> reason<00:01:11.610> I'm<00:01:11.700> using<00:01:11.880> Windows

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and the reason I'm using Windows

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.550 
and the reason I'm using Windows
Explorer<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.720> because<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.110> faster<00:01:13.440> than

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
Explorer is because it's faster than

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200 
Explorer is because it's faster than
Google<00:01:13.890> Chrome<00:01:14.160> for<00:01:14.430> my<00:01:14.580> computer<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:15.150> now

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I did a whole bunch of crap and I made a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.219 
I did a whole bunch of crap and I made a
lot<00:01:17.700> faster<00:01:18.210> than<00:01:18.240> Google<00:01:18.720> Chrome<00:01:18.960> which<00:01:19.200> is

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
lot faster than Google Chrome which is

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.310 
lot faster than Google Chrome which is
