today<00:00:04.380> we're<00:00:04.589> going<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.770> be<00:00:04.830> talking<00:00:05.250> about

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.230 
today we're going to be talking about
angiosperms<00:00:06.540> seed<00:00:07.020> development<00:00:07.710> and

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
angiosperms seed development and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.540 
angiosperms seed development and
development<00:00:09.240> occurs<00:00:09.840> after<00:00:10.650> fertilization

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
development occurs after fertilization

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.360 
development occurs after fertilization
takes<00:00:11.820> place<00:00:12.240> after<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.929> sperm<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.980> an<00:00:14.130> egg

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
takes place after a sperm and an egg

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.080 
takes place after a sperm and an egg
fused<00:00:15.360> together<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:16.020> they<00:00:16.560> form<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.220> zygote<00:00:17.609> a

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
fused together and they form a zygote a

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.439 
fused together and they form a zygote a
single<00:00:18.779> fertilized<00:00:19.680> egg<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:21.000> let's<00:00:21.180> go<00:00:21.330> ahead

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
single fertilized egg so let's go ahead

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.740 
single fertilized egg so let's go ahead
and<00:00:21.570> start<00:00:22.020> there<00:00:23.000> so<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.090> going<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.300> go<00:00:24.630> ahead

and start there so I'm going to go ahead

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.000 
and start there so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:25.050> I'm<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.289> draw<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.890> zygote<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.730> single

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
and I'm going to draw a zygote a single

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.130 
and I'm going to draw a zygote a single
fertilized<00:00:29.010> egg<00:00:29.490> there's<00:00:30.060> its<00:00:30.300> nucleus<00:00:30.810> and

basal cell the basal cell is going to
further<00:01:08.490> develop<00:01:09.119> into<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> suspense<00:01:10.500> ER<00:01:11.750> and

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
further develop into the suspense ER and

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.060 
further develop into the suspense ER and
the<00:01:14.400> suspense<00:01:15.000> ER<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.560> structure<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.590> has

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the suspense ER is a structure that has

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.630 
the suspense ER is a structure that has
a<00:01:17.490> couple<00:01:18.000> purposes<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:19.290> suspensory<00:01:19.979> anchors

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
a couple purposes the suspensory anchors

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.440 
a couple purposes the suspensory anchors
the<00:01:20.820> embryo<00:01:25.250> because<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> embryo<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.119> very

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the embryo because the embryo is very

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.359 
the embryo because the embryo is very
delicate<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:28.259> don't<00:01:28.439> want<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.799> jostling

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
delicate we don't want it jostling

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.190 
delicate we don't want it jostling
around<00:01:29.670> inside<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.390> seed<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.140> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
around inside the seed so it's going to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.080 
around inside the seed so it's going to
anchor<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> embryo<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.579> inside<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
anchor the embryo to the inside of the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.069 
anchor the embryo to the inside of the
seed<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:34.310> also<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.490> suspense<00:01:36.000> or<00:01:36.210> transfers

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
seed and also the suspense or transfers

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:50.300 
seed and also the suspense or transfers
and<00:01:37.380> nutrients<00:01:42.049> from<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:45.570> endosperm<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
and nutrients from the endosperm to the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.410 
and nutrients from the endosperm to the
embryo

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.490 

so<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.570> also<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.990> serve<00:01:55.229> that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so it's also going to serve that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.859 
so it's also going to serve that
function<00:01:56.420> now<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.409> begins<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.950> enlarge

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
function now is this begins to enlarge

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.940 
function now is this begins to enlarge
alright<00:02:00.869> we're<00:02:01.170> going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.380> draw<00:02:01.530> our<00:02:01.649> next

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
alright we're going to draw our next

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.630 
alright we're going to draw our next
structure<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:07.560> large<00:02:07.860> structure<00:02:08.459> up

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
structure and this large structure up

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.800 
structure and this large structure up
here<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.069> be<00:02:11.160> our<00:02:11.310> throw<00:02:11.790> embryo

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.660 

this<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.989> our<00:02:16.140> early<00:02:16.620> embryo<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.519> this

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
this is our early embryo so this

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.440 
this is our early embryo so this
terminal<00:02:18.090> cell<00:02:18.390> continues<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.790> divide<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
terminal cell continues to to divide and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.809 
terminal cell continues to to divide and
differentiate<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:22.860> he<00:02:22.950> comes<00:02:23.190> our<00:02:23.400> pearl

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
differentiate and if he comes our pearl

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.330 
differentiate and if he comes our pearl
embryo<00:02:24.300> our<00:02:24.540> very<00:02:24.900> very<00:02:25.290> early<00:02:25.739> embryo<00:02:26.130> it's

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
embryo our very very early embryo it's

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.160 
embryo our very very early embryo it's
made<00:02:26.519> of<00:02:26.670> many<00:02:26.880> cells<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.630> I'm<00:02:27.750> just<00:02:27.930> going<00:02:28.110> to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
made of many cells so I'm just going to

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.870 
made of many cells so I'm just going to
show<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.769> like<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.160> but<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.459> made<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.700> many

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
show it like this but it's made of many

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.949 
show it like this but it's made of many
many<00:02:30.060> cells<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.720> down<00:02:31.530> below<00:02:31.799> our<00:02:32.690> basal<00:02:33.690> cell

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
many cells and down below our basal cell

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.620 
many cells and down below our basal cell
has<00:02:34.260> continued<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:34.980> divide<00:02:35.850> and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
has continued to divide and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.949 
has continued to divide and
differentiate<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.239> now<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:39.900> to

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
differentiate and this is now going to

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.910 
differentiate and this is now going to
be<00:02:40.140> referred<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.530> as<00:02:40.739> our<00:02:41.069> suspense<00:02:41.970> ER<00:02:45.920> now

here<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:54.380> next<00:02:55.380> structure<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.150> going

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
here the next structure is this is going

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.060 
here the next structure is this is going
to<00:02:57.359> further<00:02:57.690> develop<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.739> I'm<00:02:58.799> going<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.010> go

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
to further develop so I'm going to go

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.190 
to further develop so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.340> draw<00:02:59.459> our<00:02:59.579> arrow<00:02:59.850> here<00:03:00.239> this<00:03:01.049> is

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
ahead and draw our arrow here this is

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.979 
ahead and draw our arrow here this is
going<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.440> further<00:03:01.680> develop<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.690> I'm<00:03:03.690> going

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
going to further develop and I'm going

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.380 
going to further develop and I'm going
to<00:03:04.019> go<00:03:04.170> ahead<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.590> draw<00:03:04.829> a<00:03:05.220> structure<00:03:06.120> that

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
to go ahead and draw a structure that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.940 
to go ahead and draw a structure that
looks<00:03:06.810> like<00:03:07.109> this<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:11.690> this<00:03:12.690> mid<00:03:13.019> portion<00:03:13.290> here

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
looks like this so this mid portion here

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.120 
looks like this so this mid portion here
again<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:15.000> going<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.299> be<00:03:15.450> our<00:03:15.600> pro<00:03:16.230> embryo<00:03:16.799> our

portion<00:03:28.950> which<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.400> now<00:03:29.760> developing<00:03:30.319> are

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
portion which is now developing are

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.800 
portion which is now developing are
going<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.739> be<00:03:31.829> our<00:03:32.120> cotyledons<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.569> have

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
going to be our cotyledons and I have

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.539 
going to be our cotyledons and I have
two<00:03:37.139> cotyledons<00:03:37.650> there

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
two cotyledons there

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.840 
two cotyledons there
these<00:03:39.000> cotyledons<00:03:39.900> are<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.590> sense<00:03:40.859> storage

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
these cotyledons are in a sense storage

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.080 
these cotyledons are in a sense storage
containers<00:03:42.569> they're<00:03:43.109> going<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.319> store<00:03:43.560> food

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
containers they're going to store food

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.090 
containers they're going to store food
mainly<00:03:45.090> starches<00:03:45.840> some<00:03:46.109> protein<00:03:46.680> maybe<00:03:46.950> a

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
mainly starches some protein maybe a

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.150 
mainly starches some protein maybe a
little<00:03:47.250> bit<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.549> fat<00:03:48.060> material<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:49.829> food

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
little bit of fat material and this food

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.930 
little bit of fat material and this food
is<00:03:50.310> going<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.519> be<00:03:50.639> used<00:03:50.940> by<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.269> future<00:03:51.930> embryo

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
is going to be used by the future embryo

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.729 
is going to be used by the future embryo
now<00:03:53.940> if<00:03:54.090> there<00:03:54.239> was<00:03:54.420> just<00:03:54.450> one<00:03:54.720> lump<00:03:55.260> instead

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
now if there was just one lump instead

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.000 
now if there was just one lump instead
of<00:03:55.859> two<00:03:56.480> that<00:03:57.480> would<00:03:57.660> be<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.810> monocoque<00:03:58.620> right

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
of two that would be a monocoque right

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.460 
of two that would be a monocoque right
now<00:03:59.160> we<00:03:59.220> have<00:03:59.609> two<00:03:59.940> lungs<00:04:00.239> two<00:04:00.510> cotyledons<00:04:00.900> and

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
now we have two lungs two cotyledons and

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.450 
now we have two lungs two cotyledons and
that<00:04:02.099> is<00:04:02.310> going<00:04:02.519> to<00:04:02.640> be<00:04:02.909> a<00:04:03.090> dicot

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
that is going to be a dicot

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.060 
that is going to be a dicot
remember<00:04:05.260> angiosperms<00:04:06.260> can<00:04:06.590> be<00:04:06.710> further

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
remember angiosperms can be further

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.810 
remember angiosperms can be further
categorized<00:04:07.670> into<00:04:08.390> either<00:04:08.510> monocots<00:04:09.290> or

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
categorized into either monocots or

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.000 
categorized into either monocots or
dicots<00:04:10.820> depending<00:04:11.750> upon<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:12.230> type<00:04:12.470> of<00:04:12.500> seed

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
dicots depending upon the type of seed

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.320 
dicots depending upon the type of seed
they<00:04:13.250> produce<00:04:13.990> now<00:04:14.990> in<00:04:15.440> addition<00:04:16.190> around<00:04:16.970> here

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
they produce now in addition around here

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.420 
they produce now in addition around here
we've<00:04:17.540> also<00:04:17.840> got<00:04:18.260> some<00:04:18.560> other<00:04:18.770> things<00:04:18.890> going

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
we've also got some other things going

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.820 
we've also got some other things going
on<00:04:19.760> which<00:04:20.090> I'm<00:04:20.360> not<00:04:20.600> going<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:20.930> show<00:04:21.170> but<00:04:21.470> very

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
on which I'm not going to show but very

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.520 
on which I'm not going to show but very
quickly<00:04:22.160> there<00:04:22.940> is<00:04:23.090> also<00:04:23.530> endosperm

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
quickly there is also endosperm

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.010 
quickly there is also endosperm
developing<00:04:25.250> out<00:04:25.400> here<00:04:25.760> and<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.510> endosperm

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
developing out here and the endosperm

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.400 
developing out here and the endosperm
was<00:04:27.800> formed<00:04:28.310> from<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:29.080> second<00:04:30.080> sperm

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
was formed from the second sperm

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.520 
was formed from the second sperm
fertilizing<00:04:31.370> our<00:04:31.550> central<00:04:32.120> cell<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.840> then

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
fertilizing our central cell and then

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.860 
fertilizing our central cell and then
that<00:04:33.770> became<00:04:34.190> our<00:04:34.250> endosperm<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:35.510> again<00:04:35.750> the

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
that became our endosperm and again the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.020 
that became our endosperm and again the
endosperm<00:04:36.350> is<00:04:36.770> also<00:04:37.340> kind<00:04:37.610> of<00:04:37.670> a<00:04:37.760> food

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
endosperm is also kind of a food

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.480 
endosperm is also kind of a food
container<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.050> food<00:04:40.010> is<00:04:40.160> going<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.370> be

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
container and that food is going to be

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.320 
container and that food is going to be
used<00:04:40.790> by<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.120> future<00:04:41.630> embryo<00:04:43.330> oftentimes

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
used by the future embryo oftentimes

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.290 
used by the future embryo oftentimes
however<00:04:44.840> what<00:04:45.110> happens<00:04:45.590> is<00:04:45.800> that<00:04:46.300> endosperm

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
however what happens is that endosperm

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.780 
however what happens is that endosperm
gets<00:04:47.630> transferred<00:04:48.530> those<00:04:48.830> though<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.280> food's

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
gets transferred those though the food's

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.850 
gets transferred those though the food's
stored<00:04:50.240> in<00:04:50.330> that<00:04:50.450> endosperm<00:04:51.170> gets

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
stored in that endosperm gets

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.510 
stored in that endosperm gets
transferred<00:04:52.640> to<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:52.970> cotyledons<00:04:53.450> and<00:04:54.520> in

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
transferred to the cotyledons and in

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.770 
transferred to the cotyledons and in
some<00:04:56.030> plants<00:04:56.740> almost<00:04:57.740> all<00:04:58.040> or<00:04:58.850> maybe<00:04:59.150> even<00:04:59.300> all

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
some plants almost all or maybe even all

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.660 
some plants almost all or maybe even all
that<00:05:00.020> endosperm<00:05:00.650> is<00:05:00.860> transferred<00:05:01.430> to<00:05:01.460> the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
that endosperm is transferred to the

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.220 
that endosperm is transferred to the
cotyledons<00:05:02.060> so<00:05:02.510> you<00:05:02.600> don't<00:05:02.750> even<00:05:02.870> have<00:05:03.050> any

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
cotyledons so you don't even have any

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:09.070 
cotyledons so you don't even have any
any<00:05:03.520> endosperm<00:05:04.520> left<00:05:07.600> now<00:05:08.600> we're<00:05:08.900> going<00:05:09.020> to

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
any endosperm left now we're going to

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.980 
any endosperm left now we're going to
draw<00:05:09.260> another<00:05:09.500> arrow<00:05:09.620> here<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:10.630> our<00:05:11.630> pro

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
draw another arrow here and our pro

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.110 
draw another arrow here and our pro
embryo<00:05:12.470> is<00:05:12.710> going<00:05:12.890> to<00:05:12.980> further<00:05:13.250> develop<00:05:13.940> at

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
embryo is going to further develop at

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.580 
embryo is going to further develop at
this<00:05:14.300> point<00:05:14.660> so<00:05:15.260> I'm<00:05:15.380> going<00:05:15.530> to<00:05:15.560> draw<00:05:15.800> it<00:05:17.590> like

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
this point so I'm going to draw it like

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.060 
this point so I'm going to draw it like
this<00:05:22.330> so<00:05:23.330> again<00:05:23.480> up<00:05:23.930> here<00:05:23.990> these<00:05:24.770> are<00:05:24.950> our

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
this so again up here these are our

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.180 
this so again up here these are our
cotyledons

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.410 

down<00:05:31.190> here<00:05:31.550> this<00:05:31.730> is<00:05:31.910> going<00:05:32.060> to<00:05:32.120> be<00:05:32.270> our

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
down here this is going to be our

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.080 
down here this is going to be our
basil's<00:05:33.020> are<00:05:33.230> our<00:05:34.070> basal<00:05:34.520> cell<00:05:34.730> which<00:05:34.910> is

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
basil's are our basal cell which is

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.380 
basil's are our basal cell which is
further<00:05:35.480> awry<00:05:36.430> developed<00:05:37.430> into<00:05:37.730> our<00:05:37.850> suspense

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
further awry developed into our suspense

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.300 
further awry developed into our suspense
ER<00:05:40.600> and<00:05:41.600> our<00:05:42.050> suspense<00:05:42.590> er<00:05:42.710> didn't<00:05:42.980> get<00:05:43.130> any

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
ER and our suspense er didn't get any

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.120 
ER and our suspense er didn't get any
smaller<00:05:43.760> but<00:05:44.350> relatively<00:05:45.350> speaking<00:05:45.680> our

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
smaller but relatively speaking our

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.330 
smaller but relatively speaking our
embryo<00:05:46.640> got<00:05:46.970> much<00:05:47.270> larger<00:05:48.200> and<00:05:48.860> this<00:05:48.980> is<00:05:49.160> going

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
embryo got much larger and this is going

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.670 
embryo got much larger and this is going
to<00:05:49.400> be<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:49.610> embryo<00:05:50.030> here<00:05:50.300> this<00:05:50.660> whole<00:05:51.110> thing

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
to be the embryo here this whole thing

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.300 
to be the embryo here this whole thing
is<00:05:51.920> going<00:05:52.760> to<00:05:53.030> be<00:05:53.980> the<00:05:54.980> embryo<00:05:55.850> or<00:05:56.210> baby<00:05:56.750> plant

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
is going to be the embryo or baby plant

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.130 
is going to be the embryo or baby plant
and<00:05:58.310> we're<00:05:58.550> going<00:05:58.670> to<00:05:58.700> divide<00:05:59.030> that<00:05:59.300> embryo<00:05:59.840> up

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
and we're going to divide that embryo up

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.580 
and we're going to divide that embryo up
into<00:06:00.800> its<00:06:00.980> various<00:06:01.220> parts<00:06:01.820> and<00:06:02.320> although<00:06:03.320> this

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
into its various parts and although this

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.650 
into its various parts and although this
isn't<00:06:03.920> perfect<00:06:04.160> I<00:06:04.520> like<00:06:04.820> to<00:06:04.970> divide<00:06:05.150> it<00:06:05.480> into

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
isn't perfect I like to divide it into

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.690 
isn't perfect I like to divide it into
thirds<00:06:06.110> and<00:06:06.560> the<00:06:07.520> top<00:06:08.030> third<00:06:09.370> is<00:06:10.370> going<00:06:10.490> to<00:06:10.610> be

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
thirds and the top third is going to be

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.400 
thirds and the top third is going to be
called<00:06:10.970> the<00:06:11.060> epicotyl

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.540 

the<00:06:15.400> epicotyl<00:06:15.880> is<00:06:16.270> also<00:06:16.780> known<00:06:17.050> as<00:06:17.380> the<00:06:17.980> plume

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
the epicotyl is also known as the plume

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.920 
the epicotyl is also known as the plume
Yule<00:06:18.970> and<00:06:20.880> this<00:06:21.880> is<00:06:22.000> going<00:06:22.180> to<00:06:22.270> form<00:06:22.660> the

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
Yule and this is going to form the

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:31.110 
Yule and this is going to form the
future<00:06:24.030> upper<00:06:25.030> stem<00:06:27.600> and<00:06:28.860> leaves<00:06:29.860> of<00:06:30.310> the

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
future upper stem and leaves of the

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.950 
future upper stem and leaves of the
plant<00:06:31.420> and<00:06:31.770> then<00:06:32.770> the<00:06:32.890> middle<00:06:33.370> portion<00:06:33.960> is

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
plant and then the middle portion is

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.960 
plant and then the middle portion is
going<00:06:35.110> to<00:06:35.320> be<00:06:35.410> referred<00:06:35.800> to<00:06:36.010> as<00:06:36.190> the<00:06:36.400> hypo

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
going to be referred to as the hypo

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:43.650 
going to be referred to as the hypo

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
caudal okay Kappa let's just go back to

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.040 
caudal okay Kappa let's just go back to
this<00:06:43.780> really<00:06:44.080> quickly<00:06:44.430> apple<00:06:45.430> means<00:06:45.640> above<00:06:46.480> or

on top of and hypo means below or
underneath<00:06:53.770> or<00:06:54.220> even<00:06:54.460> less<00:06:54.670> than<00:06:54.970> so<00:06:55.720> the<00:06:55.870> hypo

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
underneath or even less than so the hypo

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.130 
underneath or even less than so the hypo
connell<00:06:56.710> is<00:06:56.860> underneath<00:06:57.550> the<00:06:57.880> epicotyl<00:06:58.750> and

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.140 
connell is underneath the epicotyl and

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.290 
connell is underneath the epicotyl and
the<00:06:59.740> hypo<00:07:00.160> Cottle<00:07:00.610> is<00:07:00.730> going<00:07:00.910> to<00:07:00.970> become<00:07:01.270> our

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300 
the hypo Cottle is going to become our

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.860 
the hypo Cottle is going to become our
future<00:07:02.190> lower<00:07:03.190> stem<00:07:05.790> and<00:07:06.790> then<00:07:07.060> finally<00:07:07.690> the

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
future lower stem and then finally the

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:15.750 
future lower stem and then finally the
last<00:07:07.900> part<00:07:08.650> is<00:07:10.200> going<00:07:11.200> to<00:07:11.260> be<00:07:11.380> our<00:07:11.530> radical<00:07:14.760> and

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
last part is going to be our radical and

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.690 
last part is going to be our radical and
radical<00:07:16.390> means<00:07:16.600> root<00:07:17.020> so<00:07:17.590> the<00:07:18.070> radical<00:07:18.310> is

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:18.700 
radical means root so the radical is

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.210 
radical means root so the radical is
going<00:07:18.880> to<00:07:18.940> be<00:07:19.060> our<00:07:19.300> future<00:07:19.750> our<00:07:20.200> future<00:07:21.300> root

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 
going to be our future our future root

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.070 
going to be our future our future root
and<00:07:25.170> all<00:07:26.170> three<00:07:26.500> of<00:07:26.590> these<00:07:26.740> parts<00:07:27.250> make<00:07:27.520> up<00:07:27.550> the

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 
and all three of these parts make up the

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:35.610 
and all three of these parts make up the
embryo<00:07:29.080> that<00:07:32.730> is<00:07:33.730> going<00:07:34.060> to<00:07:34.120> be<00:07:34.240> it<00:07:34.420> for<00:07:35.350> seed

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620 
embryo that is going to be it for seed

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.190 
embryo that is going to be it for seed
development
