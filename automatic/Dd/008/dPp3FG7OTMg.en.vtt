00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 hey here is norman more often i hear 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.950
 the excuse that many do not even 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.410
 start with raw food because they are not 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.960
 high-performance mixer or in safter 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.009
 but we can do our food too 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.190
 just chew 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.310
 Here I have spoken now 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.910
 buckwheat in about a day 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.060
 spoken then they look like that and that 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.429
 Of course we can also eat them like that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.300
 can make delicious spices like 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:39.750
 eg stevia really reaches very little 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:44.000
 and everything tastes super sweet or 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.219
 we can give other powder to 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.219
 then we have cookies like vanilla 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.100
 there is enough again very little 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.629
 or we could also pollinate 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:06.200
 They also taste sweet but even regulate 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.850
 after our blood sugar than many 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.979
 contain amino acids or we could 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.380
 just add a little coconut oil 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:20.930
 just not in bulk should we eat 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.430
 because it's 100 fat so more than one 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.930
 I would not eat tablespoons daily 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.880
 want 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.040
 now we can mix this and that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.840
 tastes delicious as all cookies or 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.090
 cake I've eaten so so 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.500
 I'm definitely not a fan of gourmet 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.630
 raw food is far too time consuming 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.200
 heavy with many exotic ingredients 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.939
 to get are usually also expensive 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.670
 much more suitable for everyday use are simple 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.390
 recipes with little ingredients the everyone 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.530
 can do it yourself and above all things 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.530
 also tastes delicious
