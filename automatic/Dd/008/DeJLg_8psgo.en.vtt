 we already have it available for this 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.460
 terminal the only thing we have to do 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.460
 is to enter into recovery mode 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.189

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.129
 of fs as well as doing an android 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.559
 go down so that we avoid problems 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.000
 later that a moleta the action 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.280
 as you can see we have what's coming 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.470
 being the recovery we can do the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.730
 three thousand manually or also 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.500
 I will leave in the description of the video the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.120
 mega uy but I will use what comes 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.650
 being the mega hit that is a bit more 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.950
 Quick 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.560
 how to enter the cult a rum only 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.210
 we give install and the completely clean 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.620
 everything we have in the terminal and 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.480
 delete all the files you have 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.730
 using the rom we have 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.200
 currently this is necessary to have 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.720
 a clean installation of our 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.520
 terminal and so the rom then have a 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.170
 optimal performance at the time of 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.370
 work is not finished 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.050
 now let's proceed what comes 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.160
 being the installation of the rom we are going to 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.770
 install what is being the ls box 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.240

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.010
 we installed what has been the rom 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.290
 then we proceed to install what they are 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.600
 algae this is a rom of pure android no 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.100
 It has customization layers but 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.510
 it works very well so is it the 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.479
 I recommend so you can install it 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.979
 it's from the first miley but I was 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.380
 trying and I have no problem 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.940
 as long as always 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.250
 I told you earlier that at the time of 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.710
 rom have to be some pending 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.060

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.560

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.380

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.380

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.530
 As you can see , the 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.330
 what are we going to do 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.280
 now below like us 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.440

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.990
 problems let's do what comes 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.940
 being going to happen what is in the 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.709
 superuser update because 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.510
 we have spent in mega wifi the same has been 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.890
 deleted game I always take the steps 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.390
 when I use the mega hole always 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.360

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.810
 the superuser update fine 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.580
 let's restart our terminal 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.080
 and let's hope I load next 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.580
 then we will have to continue what comes 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.620

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.620

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.950
 phone information as you can see 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.230
 here we have android 4 points 4.4 for 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.370
 the samsung galaxy s3 9.300 rom the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.630
 liquid is mod in its version 3.1 what 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.010
 comes being the functions that incorporates 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.590
 this rom we have seen them before 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.120
 in the versions of android 4 points 4.3 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.580
 in what has been this 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.370
 update of this latest version of 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.200
 Android is like putting patches of 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.150
 security to the android version that 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.040
 we have previously since I had 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.340
 some information leaks through 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.489
 of the open ssl and then google has decided 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.380
 release this new version but for the 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.799
 rest of options because the same does not 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.750
 we have no novelty the only thing 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.370
 what is expected is that we can use what 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.180
 What is the new machine? 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.060
 virtual 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.560
 dt that we are not going to use what 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.630
 that today being such an end now we are going to 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.680
 use that new virtual machine well 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.299
