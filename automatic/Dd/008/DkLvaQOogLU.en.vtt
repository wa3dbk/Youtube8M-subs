00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
vitamins and that's it so it's not

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.830 
vitamins and that's it so it's not
anything<00:02:08.399> different<00:02:09.119> than<00:02:09.239> what<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.720> would

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
typically do with anything else so folic

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.050

acid<00:02:13.349> as<00:02:13.560> women<00:02:14.220> when<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.489> take<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:14.940> goes

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
acid as women when we take it it goes

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.449 
acid as women when we take it it goes
right<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> our<00:02:15.690> reproductive<00:02:16.170> system<00:02:16.739> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
right to our reproductive system the

biotin however carries it to the scalp

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.270 
biotin however carries it to the scalp
so<00:02:20.700> we<00:02:20.940> need<00:02:21.269> folic<00:02:21.900> acid<00:02:22.410> for<00:02:22.650> our<00:02:22.769> hair<00:02:23.010> to
