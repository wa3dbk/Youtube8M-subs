00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
paleo you know just put it in a bowl and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.380 
paleo you know just put it in a bowl and
mix<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:04.979> totally<00:02:05.369> fine<00:02:05.549> what<00:02:06.270> we're

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
mix it that's totally fine what we're

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.029 
mix it that's totally fine what we're
going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.810> take<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> zest<00:02:07.439> off<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.920> our

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
going to do is take the zest off of our

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
going to do is take the zest off of our
lives<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.580> our<00:02:08.700> grapefruit<00:02:08.970> before<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.660> cut<00:02:09.899> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
lives in our grapefruit before we cut it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.920 
lives in our grapefruit before we cut it
open<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.819> microplane<00:02:12.450> it's

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
open and so this is a microplane it's

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.020 
open and so this is a microplane it's
kind<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.290> teeny<00:02:13.500> tiny<00:02:13.739> greater<00:02:14.280> if<00:02:14.910> you

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
kind of a teeny tiny greater if you

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.509 
kind of a teeny tiny greater if you
don't<00:02:15.209> have<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.660> microplane<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.800> could<00:02:17.040> use<00:02:17.250> a

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
don't have a microplane you could use a

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.580 
don't have a microplane you could use a
actual<00:02:18.090> grader<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> box<00:02:19.019> grater<00:02:19.170> it's

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
actual grader this is a box grater it's

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.550 
actual grader this is a box grater it's
got<00:02:19.769> kind<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.099> a<00:02:20.220> fine<00:02:20.549> setting<00:02:21.239> here<00:02:21.569> or<00:02:21.780> maybe

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
got kind of a fine setting here or maybe

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.130 
got kind of a fine setting here or maybe
you're<00:02:22.709> just<00:02:22.739> your<00:02:23.040> callous<00:02:23.370> remover<00:02:24.019> no<00:02:25.019> I'm

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
can try to find something that would

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.830 
can try to find something that would
substitute<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.790> zest<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.269> going<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.569> give<00:02:30.720> you

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
itself we don't want to get down into

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.050

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
across the edge of the microplane and

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.960 
across the edge of the microplane and
rotate<00:02:45.829> so<00:02:46.829> we're<00:02:46.950> going<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.130> do<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.640> all

do<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.299> really<00:03:30.660> stick<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.230> fork<00:03:31.260> in<00:03:31.650> there<00:03:31.829> and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
do is really stick the fork in there and

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.129

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
out strain it before you put it in the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.539 
out strain it before you put it in the
bag<00:03:42.120> hope<00:03:42.720> doesn't<00:03:43.290> bother<00:03:43.620> me<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.160> I'm<00:03:44.310> just

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
bag hope doesn't bother me so I'm just

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.460 
bag hope doesn't bother me so I'm just
going<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.790> make<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.180> even<00:03:45.329> easier<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:46.079> not<00:03:46.290> do

going to make it even easier and not do
that<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.190> that's<00:03:47.340> like<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.910> fork<00:03:48.209> or<00:03:48.870> you

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
that so that's like the fork or you

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.970 
that so that's like the fork or you
could<00:03:49.440> do<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.790> citrus<00:03:51.120> reamer<00:03:51.299> like<00:03:51.980> squish

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
could do the citrus reamer like squish

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.349 
could do the citrus reamer like squish
the<00:03:53.130> guts<00:03:53.340> out<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:53.609> it<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:53.880> want<00:03:54.090> all<00:03:54.209> that

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
the guts out of it you want all that

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.470 
the guts out of it you want all that
juice<00:03:55.609> alright<00:03:56.609> so<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.910> next<00:03:56.940> step<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.450> to

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
juice alright so the next step is to

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.020 
juice alright so the next step is to
prep<00:03:58.260> our<00:03:58.440> fish<00:03:58.709> as<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.430> can<00:03:59.549> see<00:03:59.730> I<00:03:59.760> did
