00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.380
 good hello how about friends of 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.830
 good youtube subscribers in this 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.099
 I'm going to show you how to create a video 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.240
 ringtone for your iphone not your ipod or your 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.610
 ipad 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.820
 depends on the good case for iphone 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.250
 to create a ringtone for when 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.280
 call since many times the rhythm 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.710
 said this and then for a minimum for a 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.660
 for a cousin since he had told me that 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.830
 you have to put a ring done to your 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.850
 iphone you have to buy the song 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.280
 and for this you had to buy the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.390
 song and put it in settings already but 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.190
 I taught a method 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.920
 in the description of the video I will leave you 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.040
 the link to download and 2 are only going to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.190
 extract and they will open it and I have it 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.520
 extracted on my desk I will open and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.040
 everyone 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.010
 they are going to go to regret nothing equal to 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.710
 this one is going to wait race here is 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.280
 this little option 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.250
 here as everything space tells you here 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.729
 it is also very detailed this says you 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.400
 says what kind of device is the ipod 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:16.380
 fourth generation touch would be the 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.570
 name jailbreak that says here and that's not 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.320
 region in mexico by chase 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.100
 but I 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.930
 here we have to say that all this 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.750
 also the version the ibas I'm in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.020
 5.1.1 here gives you a section that is 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.630
 applications against you they said 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.090
 mean which is to see the music 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.810
 the songs 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.079
 here can I have several folders of 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.299
 music to create a new folder 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.299
 we are going to give here in new playlist 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.360
 well I in another video I will show how 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.550
 use and all now let's concentrate 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.830
 in a ringtone we can also see photos 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.320
 and several things but here we are going to go to 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.380
 mean in the section of average we will go 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.140
 where it says here ringtone here I've already 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.600
 created three ringtones what are we going to 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.840
 to do is to put this bell that is 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.120
 here 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.250
 what we are going to do is choose a 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.980
 song from our bookstore that the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.430
 we have in our our computer 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.110
 let's put here in your we will 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.709
 send to this and here I have a 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.900
 selected song will be loaded here 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.180
 we can take it this is for calls 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.620
 40 seconds and this is for messages 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.030
 although for me to my taste this one is very 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.480
 it took 25 seconds for a simple 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.860
 message here you can create one I believe it 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.680
 normally as we can here 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.200
 modify and what I normally like to 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.180
 four seconds I'm going to add more or 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.480
 except here I will give an example of 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.480
 list 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.290
 and more or less there would end the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.060
 ringtone but you already depend on your 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.319
 song they want 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.319
 I can put myself there too 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.550
 I can only create more here because it depends on 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.550
 his courses also in calls 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.500
 well here I can leave it like this 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.239
 I'm not going to leave like this for now they're going to 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.819
 give in save here import to the bright 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.099
 more so that it is loaded is once 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.640
 done this is going to start loading this 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:37.549
 again this small section and as 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.790
 come the new corner has stayed now 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:44.079
 let's go to the device here I'm going to 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.909
 put can make videos with and all 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.099
 here from here you can in this record your 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.909
 device in this section that is of 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.010
 stock 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.950
 then live stop 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.110
 here I am recording is my ipod with 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.340
 who was talking but now we're going to 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.680
 follow 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.050
 the little section that I tell you I'm going to 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.739
 close all this now I'm going to go to 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.739
 settings 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:18.900
 once being in settings I will go to 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:22.169
 songs are god not being here 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.539
 in the corner is going to be for the iphone here 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.050
 I already have these that I have created and this 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:30.650
 that I just believe you never harp and what 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.650
 I'm going to select 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.940
 This is going to be the new ring tone as 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.940
 see what I had is this 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.820
 you can not put and it's up to you 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.260
 they want when they have created a 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.230
 once selected each time it arrives 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.330
 a message will sound exactly the same 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.830
 to that sound that we just created but 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.350
 good friends this has been all of my 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.070
 We'll see each other until the next video 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.070
