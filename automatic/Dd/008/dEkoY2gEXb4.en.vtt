cotton ball fire starter we do ours a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.220 
cotton ball fire starter we do ours a
little<00:00:17.699> different<00:00:18.090> when<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:18.660> actually<00:00:18.810> make

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
little different when we actually make

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and more productive than the ones that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.830 
and more productive than the ones that
people<00:00:22.830> actually<00:00:23.070> instruct<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.420> it's

idea to carry in your kit and also gives
you<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> little<00:01:26.009> bit<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.310> hard<00:01:26.640> tinner<00:01:27.000> which

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
you a little bit of hard tinner which

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.749 
you a little bit of hard tinner which
will<00:01:27.390> sustain<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.810> fire<00:01:28.259> for<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.310> longer

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
will sustain a fire for a little longer

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
will sustain a fire for a little longer
period<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.390> time<00:01:30.470> while<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:31.619> trying<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
get actually a better fire going once

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.789 
get actually a better fire going once
again<00:01:34.470> wrap<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> cotton<00:01:35.759> ball<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.450> match
