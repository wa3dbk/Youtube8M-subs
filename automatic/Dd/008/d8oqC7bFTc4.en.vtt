know<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> looks<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.119> lot<00:01:39.359> like<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.810> old<00:01:39.840> model

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
know it looks a lot like the old model

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.309 
know it looks a lot like the old model
but<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:41.069> actually<00:01:41.490> longer<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.630> wider<00:01:42.990> it's

go
during<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.720> commute<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:08.800> from<00:05:08.860> work<00:05:09.070> you

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
during a commute to and from work you

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.250 
during a commute to and from work you
would<00:05:09.700> use<00:05:09.910> this<00:05:10.120> hundreds<00:05:10.690> of<00:05:10.780> times<00:05:10.840> and

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
would use this hundreds of times and

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.960 
would use this hundreds of times and
it's<00:05:11.410> a<00:05:11.500> feature<00:05:11.680> I<00:05:12.010> think<00:05:12.190> once<00:05:12.670> you've<00:05:12.820> had

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
it's a feature I think once you've had

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.820 
it's a feature I think once you've had
it<00:05:13.180> you'd<00:05:13.480> want<00:05:13.750> it<00:05:13.840> in<00:05:13.960> every<00:05:14.080> car<00:05:14.380> when<00:05:14.710> you

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
it you'd want it in every car when you

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.350 
it you'd want it in every car when you
look<00:05:14.980> at<00:05:15.100> this<00:05:15.220> golf<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:15.940> kind<00:05:16.120> of<00:05:16.180> think<00:05:16.330> to

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
look at this golf you kind of think to

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.030

yourself it looks like the old golf they

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.610 
yourself it looks like the old golf they
have<00:05:18.250> evolved<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.090> design<00:05:19.480> but<00:05:20.110> take<00:05:20.320> it<00:05:20.410> from

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
have evolved the design but take it from

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.830 
have evolved the design but take it from
me<00:05:20.800> this<00:05:21.160> is<00:05:21.340> a<00:05:21.370> brand<00:05:21.820> new<00:05:22.030> car<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.330> brand<00:05:22.690> new
