though<00:00:02.730> this<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.090> short<00:00:03.270> tutorial<00:00:03.810> on<00:00:04.259> how

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
though this is a short tutorial on how

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.350 
though this is a short tutorial on how
to<00:00:04.470> solve<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.580> Rubik's<00:00:06.480> Cube<00:00:07.820> the<00:00:08.820> easy<00:00:09.000> way

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
to solve a Rubik's Cube the easy way

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.629 
to solve a Rubik's Cube the easy way
which<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.019> what<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.200> would<00:00:10.410> say<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:11.519> know<00:00:11.580> I'm

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
which is what I would say you know I'm

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.919 
which is what I would say you know I'm
now<00:00:11.790> one<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.059> guys<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.330> can<00:00:12.480> solve<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.870> in

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
now one of the guys that can solve it in

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.650 
now one of the guys that can solve it in
15<00:00:13.349> seconds<00:00:13.860> or<00:00:13.980> anything<00:00:14.130> like<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.820> can

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
15 seconds or anything like that I can

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.359 
15 seconds or anything like that I can
solve<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:15.990> about<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> minute<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:17.010> know<00:00:17.100> if<00:00:17.279> I

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
solve it in about a minute you know if I

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.170 
solve it in about a minute you know if I
go<00:00:17.490> fast<00:00:18.830> the<00:00:19.830> way<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:19.980> solve<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.970> deals

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
go fast the way I solve it it's it deals

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.410 
go fast the way I solve it it's it deals
with<00:00:21.240> layers<00:00:21.890> you<00:00:22.890> know<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.880> top<00:00:24.150> layer

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
with layers you know the the top layer

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.150 
with layers you know the the top layer
which<00:00:25.080> I'll<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.350> three<00:00:25.529> different<00:00:25.619> videos<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
which I'll do three different videos the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.009 
which I'll do three different videos the
first<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.460> how<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.730> top<00:00:26.970> layer<00:00:27.210> then

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
first is how to do the top layer then

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.200 
first is how to do the top layer then
the<00:00:28.230> middle<00:00:28.500> layer<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.609> then<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> bottom

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the middle layer and then the bottom

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.120 
the middle layer and then the bottom
layer<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.689> mean<00:00:31.140> there's<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.349> lot<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.590> algorithms

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
layer I mean there's a lot of algorithms

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.120 
layer I mean there's a lot of algorithms
out<00:00:32.250> there<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.880> know<00:00:33.000> front<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:33.750> up<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.559> right

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
out there you know front one up to right

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.690 
out there you know front one up to right
one<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.660> those<00:00:36.660> are<00:00:36.899> hard<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> remember<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
one in those are hard to remember it's a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.819 
one in those are hard to remember it's a
it's<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.030> whole<00:00:39.180> entire<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:40.410> know<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.649> like

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
it's a whole entire you know it's like

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.380 
it's a whole entire you know it's like
algebra<00:00:41.129> basically<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> remember

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
algebra basically you have to remember

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.810 
algebra basically you have to remember
these<00:00:42.629> long<00:00:42.840> things<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.770> mine<00:00:44.100> more<00:00:44.399> by<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
these long things I do mine more by I

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
these long things I do mine more by I
feel<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.559> me<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.520> know<00:00:48.620> dropping<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
feel like to me you know dropping the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.430 
feel like to me you know dropping the
edge<00:00:49.860> flick<00:00:50.520> bring<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.000> back<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.930> easier

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
edge flick bring it back up is easier

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.350 
edge flick bring it back up is easier
than<00:00:52.620> remembering<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.460> know<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.789> one<00:00:54.030> it's

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
than remembering you know right one it's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.939 
than remembering you know right one it's
just<00:00:54.539> more<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.840> pattern<00:00:55.110> okay<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.890> very

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
just more of a pattern okay it's very

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.500 
just more of a pattern okay it's very
easy<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.579> remember<00:00:57.590> okay<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.270> top

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
easy to remember okay so for the top

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.349 
easy to remember okay so for the top
layer<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.079> usually<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.010> white<00:01:02.250> because<00:01:03.210> it's

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
layer I usually do white because it's

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.250 
layer I usually do white because it's
visible<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.769> lot<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.309> people<00:01:05.580> solve<00:01:05.880> white

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
visible in a lot of people solve white

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.500 
visible in a lot of people solve white
but<00:01:07.260> they<00:01:07.409> don't<00:01:07.680> solve<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.610> edges<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.360> want

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
but they don't solve the edges you want

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.940 
but they don't solve the edges you want
to<00:01:09.570> make<00:01:09.689> sure<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.260> solve<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
to make sure that when you solve the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.500 
to make sure that when you solve the
layer<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.400> get<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> complete<00:01:11.970> layer<00:01:12.180> which

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
layer you get the complete layer which

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170 
layer you get the complete layer which
means<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.680> edges<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.220> lined<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.970> also

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
means that the edges are lined up also

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.080 
means that the edges are lined up also
and<00:01:16.020> how<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.470> tell<00:01:16.650> whatever<00:01:16.979> what<00:01:17.790> aside

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and how you can tell whatever what aside

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.410 
and how you can tell whatever what aside
is<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.020> by<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> son<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.740> cube

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
is going to be is by the son of cube

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.460 
is going to be is by the son of cube
this<00:01:21.420> sides<00:01:21.689> obviously<00:01:22.080> gonna<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.290> white

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
this sides obviously gonna be white

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.570 
this sides obviously gonna be white
because<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.799> center<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.040> white<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.520> is

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
because the center is white this is

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.200 
because the center is white this is
green<00:01:23.960> orange<00:01:24.960> blue<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.830> forth<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:27.060> by

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
green orange blue and so forth so by

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.270 
green orange blue and so forth so by
that<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.810> know<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.200> pretty<00:01:28.470> much<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:29.009> that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
that you know you pretty much know that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.810 
that you know you pretty much know that
you<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.720> red<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> blue<00:01:31.740> cube<00:01:32.070> goes<00:01:32.520> here

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
you know a a red and blue cube goes here

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.609 
you know a a red and blue cube goes here
there's<00:01:33.119> only<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.570> red<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.869> blue<00:01:34.020> edge<00:01:34.200> cube

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
there's only one red and blue edge cube

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.830 
there's only one red and blue edge cube
and<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:35.939> here<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.600> as

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and that's going to go here you know as

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.350 
and that's going to go here you know as
well<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> white<00:01:37.590> red<00:01:38.520> blue<00:01:38.850> corner<00:01:39.180> piece

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
well as the white red blue corner piece

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.390 
well as the white red blue corner piece
is<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.110> here<00:01:40.439> because<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
is going to go here because that's the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.630 
is going to go here because that's the
size<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.820> knowing<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.189> helps<00:01:44.460> you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
size so knowing that you know helps you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.870 
size so knowing that you know helps you
or<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:46.070> necessary<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.399> correctly

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
or is necessary for you to correctly

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.539 
or is necessary for you to correctly
place<00:01:48.060> cubes<00:01:48.530> okay<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.100> first<00:01:50.280> thing<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.490> do

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
place cubes okay so the first thing I do

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.530 
place cubes okay so the first thing I do
with<00:01:50.880> my<00:01:50.970> top<00:01:51.149> side<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.090> famous

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
with my top side is I get the the famous

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.889 
with my top side is I get the the famous
cross<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.380> know<00:01:55.500> which<00:01:55.799> means<00:01:56.630> it's<00:01:57.630> gonna<00:01:57.719> be

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
cross you know which means it's gonna be

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.780 
cross you know which means it's gonna be
white<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.409> red<00:01:59.869> white<00:02:00.869> blue<00:02:01.369> orange<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
white and red white blue orange and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.230 
white and red white blue orange and
green<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> easy<00:02:04.500> way<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.579> if<00:02:06.149> you

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
green so the easy way to do it is if you

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.210 
green so the easy way to do it is if you
can<00:02:06.390> navigate<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.079> bottom<00:02:07.560> with<00:02:07.979> white

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
can navigate it to the bottom with white

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.199 
can navigate it to the bottom with white
on<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> bottom

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
on the bottom

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.809 
on the bottom
okay<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:09.659> white<00:02:10.079> and<00:02:10.259> blue<00:02:10.500> just<00:02:11.159> put<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.459> under

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
okay so white and blue just put it under

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.250 
okay so white and blue just put it under
it<00:02:11.969> and<00:02:12.379> then<00:02:13.379> flip<00:02:13.829> it<00:02:14.010> all<00:02:14.219> the<00:02:14.250> way<00:02:14.430> up<00:02:15.260> and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
it and then flip it all the way up and

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.660 
it and then flip it all the way up and
you've<00:02:16.409> got<00:02:16.620> your<00:02:16.799> white<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.159> blue<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.489> if<00:02:17.579> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
you've got your white and blue so if you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.640 
you've got your white and blue so if you
can<00:02:17.790> get<00:02:17.909> it<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> bottom<00:02:18.569> that's<00:02:19.109> perfect

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
can get it to the bottom that's perfect

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.740 
can get it to the bottom that's perfect
here's<00:02:20.159> one<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.579> bottom<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:21.569> not

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
here's one on the bottom but it's not

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.780 
here's one on the bottom but it's not
facing<00:02:22.260> down<00:02:22.439> so<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:22.980> can't<00:02:23.310> flip<00:02:23.609> up

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
facing down so that I can't flip up

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.240 
facing down so that I can't flip up
because<00:02:23.969> if<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.120> put<00:02:24.299> that<00:02:24.359> under<00:02:24.659> green<00:02:25.250> right

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
because if I put that under green right

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.789 
because if I put that under green right
here<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.730> flip<00:02:26.969> it<00:02:27.060> off<00:02:27.620> obviously<00:02:28.620> it's

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
here and I flip it off obviously it's

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.800 
here and I flip it off obviously it's
not<00:02:29.189> going<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.430> be<00:02:29.519> right<00:02:29.700> right<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.689> case

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
not going to be right right so in a case

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.099 
not going to be right right so in a case
like<00:02:30.989> this<00:02:31.219> if<00:02:32.219> it's<00:02:32.370> flipping<00:02:32.700> facing<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.329> if

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
like this if it's flipping facing you if

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.000 
like this if it's flipping facing you if
you<00:02:34.319> can<00:02:34.530> put<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:34.950> alongside<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:36.000> over<00:02:36.540> here

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
you can put it alongside of it over here

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.690 
you can put it alongside of it over here
okay<00:02:38.010> rotate<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.609> side<00:02:38.879> up<00:02:40.400> flick<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.579> up

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
okay rotate that side up flick it up

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.309 
okay rotate that side up flick it up
which<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.209> kind<00:02:42.359> of<00:02:42.510> makes<00:02:42.840> sense<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.200> goes

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
which just kind of makes sense it goes

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.140 
which just kind of makes sense it goes
this<00:02:43.470> way<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.919> then<00:02:44.129> put<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.489> side<00:02:44.700> back<00:02:44.909> in

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
this way and then put this side back in

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.240 
this way and then put this side back in
case<00:02:45.329> you<00:02:45.480> had<00:02:45.629> your<00:02:45.810> other<00:02:45.900> piece<00:02:46.349> there<00:02:46.590> so

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
case you had your other piece there so

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.679 
case you had your other piece there so
now<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.400> have<00:02:47.579> two<00:02:47.879> of<00:02:48.000> them<00:02:48.150> out<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.329> this<00:02:48.419> cross

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
now I have two of them out of this cross

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.300 
now I have two of them out of this cross
okay<00:02:49.169> I<00:02:49.200> look<00:02:49.590> for<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.769> rest<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.129> pieces

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
okay I look for the rest of the pieces

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.089 
okay I look for the rest of the pieces
here's<00:02:51.239> another<00:02:51.510> one<00:02:51.720> I'm<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:52.349> gonna<00:02:52.680> put<00:02:52.980> it

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
here's another one I'm just gonna put it

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.490 
here's another one I'm just gonna put it
to<00:02:53.189> the<00:02:53.280> bottom<00:02:54.739> move<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.859> over<00:02:57.169> put<00:02:58.169> it<00:02:58.200> back

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
I've got the cross okay ignore this

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.349 
I've got the cross okay ignore this
piece<00:03:20.159> this<00:03:20.310> piece<00:03:20.370> is<00:03:20.729> in<00:03:20.879> the<00:03:20.909> wrong<00:03:21.060> spot

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
piece this piece is in the wrong spot

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.369 
piece this piece is in the wrong spot
anyway<00:03:21.599> it<00:03:21.720> doesn't<00:03:21.900> matter

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
anyway it doesn't matter

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.869 
anyway it doesn't matter
but<00:03:22.769> what<00:03:22.889> I've<00:03:23.010> got<00:03:23.159> is<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.430> cross<00:03:23.609> that's

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
but what I've got is the cross that's

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.270 
but what I've got is the cross that's
the<00:03:24.000> first<00:03:24.209> step<00:03:24.389> in<00:03:24.449> to<00:03:24.689> solving<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:26.010> top

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
the first step in to solving the the top

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.569 
the first step in to solving the the top
layer<00:03:26.579> okay<00:03:27.439> the<00:03:28.439> next<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.829> just<00:03:29.189> get<00:03:29.459> the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
layer okay the next I just get the

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.149 
layer okay the next I just get the
corners<00:03:29.909> and<00:03:30.120> that's<00:03:30.389> as<00:03:31.139> simple<00:03:31.199> as<00:03:31.769> let<00:03:32.129> me

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
corners and that's as simple as let me

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.899 
corners and that's as simple as let me
find<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.489> nice<00:03:32.639> piece<00:03:33.329> for<00:03:33.629> you<00:03:33.720> here<00:03:33.930> okay

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
find a nice piece for you here okay

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.369 
find a nice piece for you here okay
ideally<00:03:35.909> they'd<00:03:36.090> be<00:03:36.329> in<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.870> scenario<00:03:37.169> where

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
ideally they'd be in a scenario where

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.490 
ideally they'd be in a scenario where
they're<00:03:37.739> kind<00:03:37.919> of<00:03:38.009> like<00:03:38.129> this<00:03:38.340> okay<00:03:38.939> so<00:03:39.599> I<00:03:39.959> look

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500

go left one you know it just you just
this<00:04:26.699> is<00:04:26.759> the<00:04:27.210> common-sense<00:04:27.569> part<00:04:27.960> this<00:04:28.080> she

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
this is the common-sense part this she

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.279 
this is the common-sense part this she
just<00:04:28.379> kind<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.710> kind<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.449> look<00:04:30.449> go<00:04:30.719> slow<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.229> be

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
just kind of kind of look go slow and be

just kind of kind of look go slow and be
like<00:04:31.500> oh<00:04:31.650> okay<00:04:31.680> that's<00:04:32.189> going<00:04:32.729> to<00:04:32.909> line<00:04:33.120> up

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
like oh okay that's going to line up

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.689 
like oh okay that's going to line up
this<00:04:33.569> way<00:04:33.629> let's<00:04:34.199> see<00:04:34.349> and<00:04:34.590> then<00:04:35.340> I'll<00:04:35.490> bring

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
this way let's see and then I'll bring

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.029 
this way let's see and then I'll bring
it<00:04:35.849> back<00:04:36.000> okay<00:04:36.449> and<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.780> last<00:04:39.960> piece<00:04:40.289> if<00:04:40.830> it's

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
it back okay and the last piece if it's

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.879 
it back okay and the last piece if it's
facing<00:04:41.250> down<00:04:41.780> what<00:04:42.780> you<00:04:42.870> do<00:04:43.080> is<00:04:43.289> you<00:04:43.530> just<00:04:43.590> put

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
facing down what you do is you just put

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.159 
facing down what you do is you just put
it<00:04:43.979> underneath<00:04:44.250> it<00:04:44.580> okay<00:04:45.449> drop<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:45.810> like<00:04:46.050> you

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
it underneath it okay drop it like you

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.990 
it underneath it okay drop it like you
normally<00:04:46.259> would<00:04:46.500> only<00:04:47.250> flick<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:47.729> bottom

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
normally would only flick the bottom

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.170 
normally would only flick the bottom
twice<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.659> then<00:04:49.439> bring<00:04:49.620> it<00:04:49.740> back<00:04:49.770> up<00:04:50.180> then

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
twice and then bring it back up then

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.619 
twice and then bring it back up then
move<00:04:51.389> it<00:04:51.539> underneath<00:04:51.779> it<00:04:52.139> say<00:04:53.180> then<00:04:54.180> drop<00:04:54.479> it

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
move it underneath it say then drop it

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.950 
move it underneath it say then drop it
again<00:04:55.520> line<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.669> up<00:04:56.759> and<00:04:57.060> bring<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.449> back<00:04:57.479> now

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
again line it up and bring it back now

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.019 
again line it up and bring it back now
I've<00:04:58.110> solved<00:04:58.469> the<00:04:58.560> top<00:04:58.770> layer<00:04:59.159> which<00:05:00.000> means

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:00.029 
I've solved the top layer which means

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:03.080 
I've solved the top layer which means
I've<00:05:00.449> got<00:05:00.629> the<00:05:00.779> face<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:02.159> corresponding

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
I've got the face and the corresponding

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.240 
I've got the face and the corresponding
green<00:05:03.360> red<00:05:04.229> blue<00:05:04.979> and<00:05:05.340> orange<00:05:06.770> so<00:05:07.770> that's<00:05:07.979> it

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
green red blue and orange so that's it

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.800 
green red blue and orange so that's it
next<00:05:08.610> we<00:05:08.759> just<00:05:08.939> solved<00:05:09.270> for<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:10.259> middle<00:05:10.590> layer
