you could take some of these fixtures

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.040 
you could take some of these fixtures
and<00:04:59.680> apply<00:04:59.919> them<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.220> a<00:05:00.580> smaller<00:05:01.270> trussing<00:05:01.840> kit

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
and apply them to a smaller trussing kit

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.930 
and apply them to a smaller trussing kit
like<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.350> arch<00:05:02.530> kit<00:05:02.919> or<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.100> goalpost<00:05:03.639> kit

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
like the arch kit or the goalpost kit

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.480 
like the arch kit or the goalpost kit
which<00:05:04.570> used<00:05:04.810> 35-millimeter<00:05:05.400> trusting<00:05:06.400> the

which used 35-millimeter trusting the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.940 
which used 35-millimeter trusting the
smaller<00:05:06.820> more<00:05:07.120> mobile<00:05:07.539> kits<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.710> lights

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
smaller more mobile kits and the lights

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.700 
smaller more mobile kits and the lights
certainly<00:05:09.760> are<00:05:10.000> mobile<00:05:10.450> in<00:05:10.570> any<00:05:10.780> situation<00:05:11.530> so

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
certainly are mobile in any situation so

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.529 
certainly are mobile in any situation so
hopefully<00:05:12.550> this<00:05:12.729> gets<00:05:12.880> a<00:05:13.030> little<00:05:13.180> bit<00:05:13.360> of<00:05:13.450> your
