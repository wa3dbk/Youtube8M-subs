many of us have a lot of houseplants

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.850 
many of us have a lot of houseplants
that<00:00:15.309> we<00:00:15.490> take<00:00:16.059> outside<00:00:16.900> for<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:17.320> summer<00:00:17.560> time

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
that we take outside for the summer time

to they really you know like that for
example<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.579> palm<00:00:22.149> tree<00:00:22.540> that<00:00:22.750> I<00:00:22.779> have<00:00:23.079> that

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
example the palm tree that I have that

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.950 
example the palm tree that I have that
I'd<00:00:23.770> set<00:00:24.070> outside<00:00:24.279> and<00:00:24.970> it<00:00:25.090> really<00:00:25.509> enjoys

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
I'd set outside and it really enjoys

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.710 
I'd set outside and it really enjoys
that<00:00:26.290> and<00:00:26.619> grows<00:00:27.130> real<00:00:27.430> well<00:00:27.669> but<00:00:28.300> then<00:00:28.509> when

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
that and grows real well but then when

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.600 
that and grows real well but then when
you<00:00:28.750> get<00:00:29.020> ready<00:00:29.200> before<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:30.160> temperature

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
you get ready before the temperature

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.310 
you get ready before the temperature
drops<00:00:30.910> down<00:00:31.119> you<00:00:31.360> need<00:00:31.540> to<00:00:31.660> get<00:00:31.779> it<00:00:31.960> in<00:00:32.110> there

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
drops down you need to get it in there

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.500 
drops down you need to get it in there
are<00:00:32.380> some<00:00:32.559> things<00:00:32.770> like<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.309> palm<00:00:33.550> tree<00:00:33.940> that

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
are some things like the palm tree that

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.090 
are some things like the palm tree that
if<00:00:34.840> you<00:00:34.989> leave<00:00:35.320> it<00:00:35.350> out<00:00:35.649> after<00:00:35.890> the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
if you leave it out after the

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.540 
if you leave it out after the
temperature<00:00:36.580> drops<00:00:36.910> below<00:00:37.030> 40<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.920> water<00:00:39.220> in

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
temperature drops below 40 the water in

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.080 
temperature drops below 40 the water in
the<00:00:39.730> leaves<00:00:39.910> and<00:00:40.300> so<00:00:40.480> forth<00:00:40.980> freezes<00:00:41.980> or<00:00:42.820> gets

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
the leaves and so forth freezes or gets

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.090 
the leaves and so forth freezes or gets
real<00:00:43.330> cold<00:00:43.600> and<00:00:44.050> destroys<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.860> cell

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
real cold and destroys the cell

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.950 
real cold and destroys the cell
structure<00:00:45.520> there<00:00:46.210> are<00:00:46.330> other<00:00:46.420> things<00:00:46.810> that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
structure there are other things that

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.860 
structure there are other things that
can<00:00:47.890> tolerate<00:00:48.100> being<00:00:49.090> down<00:00:49.360> then<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.720> little

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
can tolerate being down then a little

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.680 
can tolerate being down then a little
bit<00:00:50.110> of<00:00:50.140> frost<00:00:50.470> my<00:00:50.820> Christmas<00:00:51.820> cactus<00:00:52.090> I<00:00:52.480> like

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
bit of frost my Christmas cactus I like

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.270 
bit of frost my Christmas cactus I like
to<00:00:52.870> leave<00:00:53.020> out<00:00:53.260> until<00:00:53.590> they<00:00:53.710> get<00:00:53.860> a<00:00:53.920> little<00:00:54.040> bit

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
to leave out until they get a little bit

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.010 
to leave out until they get a little bit
of<00:00:54.400> frost<00:00:54.640> because<00:00:54.940> that<00:00:55.120> kind<00:00:55.300> of<00:00:55.420> stimulates

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
of frost because that kind of stimulates

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.240 
of frost because that kind of stimulates
them<00:00:56.290> then<00:00:56.560> to<00:00:56.800> go<00:00:57.640> ahead<00:00:57.910> and<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:59.220> you<00:01:00.220> know

Blum<00:01:00.640> and<00:01:00.910> amaryllis<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.840> same<00:01:02.050> way<00:01:02.290> I

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
Blum and amaryllis the same way I

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.039 
Blum and amaryllis the same way I
usually<00:01:02.710> wait<00:01:03.130> and<00:01:03.310> let<00:01:03.399> a<00:01:03.460> frost<00:01:03.820> do<00:01:04.089> it<00:01:04.239> you

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
usually wait and let a frost do it you

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.139 
usually wait and let a frost do it you
can<00:01:05.320> force<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.920> amaryllis<00:01:06.399> if<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:06.820> want<00:01:07.030> it

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
can force the amaryllis if you want it

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.690 
can force the amaryllis if you want it
to<00:01:07.299> have<00:01:07.450> bloom<00:01:07.780> but<00:01:08.020> by<00:01:08.280> Christmas<00:01:09.280> time<00:01:09.520> you

materials<00:01:56.500> here<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:56.860> show<00:01:57.010> you<00:01:57.070> how<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.369> do

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
materials here to show you how to do

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.000 
materials here to show you how to do
that<00:01:57.700> some<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.840> ones<00:01:59.049> like<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.740> coffee

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
that some of the ones like the coffee

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.999 
that some of the ones like the coffee
tree<00:02:00.400> over<00:02:00.700> there<00:02:00.729> must<00:02:01.540> go<00:02:01.840> below<00:02:02.110> 40<00:02:02.560> because

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
tree over there must go below 40 because

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.270 
tree over there must go below 40 because
the<00:02:03.250> cell<00:02:03.850> walls<00:02:04.240> break<00:02:05.229> and<00:02:05.500> then<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.100> brown

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
the cell walls break and then the brown

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.460 
the cell walls break and then the brown
leaves<00:02:06.580> turn<00:02:06.939> brown<00:02:06.970> they<00:02:07.390> might<00:02:07.630> survive<00:02:08.019> one

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
leaves turn brown they might survive one

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.679 
leaves turn brown they might survive one
night<00:02:08.500> but<00:02:09.189> it<00:02:09.670> will<00:02:09.819> go<00:02:09.970> in<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.269> greenhouse

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:10.689 
night but it will go in the greenhouse

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.759 
night but it will go in the greenhouse
and<00:02:11.650> if<00:02:12.340> it's<00:02:12.639> a<00:02:12.790> fun<00:02:13.060> thing<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.810> has<00:02:14.230> all<00:02:14.590> those

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
and if it's a fun thing it has all those

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.860 
and if it's a fun thing it has all those
leaves<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.579> spring<00:02:16.029> it<00:02:16.299> suddenly

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
leaves and this spring it suddenly

systemic stinks to high heaven so I

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.020 
systemic stinks to high heaven so I
leave<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.510> out<00:02:58.840> here<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.349> water<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.519> in<00:03:00.670> and

six hours the Christmas cactus is just

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.830 
six hours the Christmas cactus is just
the<00:03:06.010> opposite<00:03:06.519> in<00:03:06.700> order<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.000> get<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.359> to<00:03:07.390> bloom

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the opposite in order to get it to bloom

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.309 
the opposite in order to get it to bloom
it<00:03:08.560> needs<00:03:08.859> to<00:03:09.099> get<00:03:09.310> almost<00:03:09.879> frozen<00:03:10.390> now<00:03:11.260> you

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
it needs to get almost frozen now you

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.170 
it needs to get almost frozen now you
don't<00:03:11.590> want<00:03:11.769> to<00:03:11.890> get<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.160> down<00:03:12.310> below<00:03:12.549> say

don't want to get it down below say
thirty<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.840> thirty<00:03:14.319> it<00:03:14.560> can<00:03:14.709> probably<00:03:14.890> go<00:03:15.160> to

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
thirty to thirty it can probably go to

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.830 
thirty to thirty it can probably go to
30<00:03:15.549> because<00:03:15.730> it's<00:03:15.940> got<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.090> high<00:03:16.299> sugar<00:03:16.599> content

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
30 because it's got a high sugar content
