is I think it just gone bigger and the

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.869 
is I think it just gone bigger and the
max<00:03:02.700> level<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.239> 10<00:03:03.510> unless<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.109> have<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
max level is 10 unless you have the

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.110 
max level is 10 unless you have the
