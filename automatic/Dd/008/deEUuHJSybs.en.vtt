see<00:02:23.160> what's<00:02:23.490> called<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.760> tracer<00:02:24.330> cord<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.930> it

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
see what's called a tracer cord and it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.650 
see what's called a tracer cord and it
looks<00:02:25.380> similar<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.040> it'll<00:02:26.370> be<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.660> multi

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
looks similar to this it'll be a multi

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.290 
looks similar to this it'll be a multi
colored<00:02:28.020> cord<00:02:28.380> or<00:02:28.620> be<00:02:28.920> one<00:02:29.160> color<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:30.180> is

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
colored cord or be one color that is

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.120 
colored cord or be one color that is
different<00:02:30.690> from<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> regular<00:02:31.680> white<00:02:31.860> nylon

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
different from the regular white nylon

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.580 
different from the regular white nylon
strands<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.540> because<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.900> has<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.110> tracer

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
strands just because it has a tracer

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.110 
strands just because it has a tracer
cord<00:02:34.830> doesn't<00:02:34.950> mean<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:35.310> milspec<00:02:35.790> you'll

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
cord doesn't mean it's milspec you'll

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.240 
cord doesn't mean it's milspec you'll
see<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.810> still<00:02:37.080> just<00:02:37.110> two<00:02:37.710> strands

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
see that this is still just two strands

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.730 
see that this is still just two strands
okay<00:02:39.500> but<00:02:40.500> milspec<00:02:41.130> requires<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:42.390> tracer<00:02:43.350> cord

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
okay but milspec requires a tracer cord

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.010 
okay but milspec requires a tracer cord
so<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.250> military<00:02:44.820> knows<00:02:45.240> who<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
so that the military knows who the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.970 
so that the military knows who the
manufacturer<00:02:46.770> of<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:46.980> cord<00:02:47.459> was<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:49.050> am

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
manufacturer of that cord was so I am

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.210 
manufacturer of that cord was so I am
assuming<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:51.150> case<00:02:51.360> there's<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.690> problem<00:02:52.050> or<00:02:52.920> an

I'm going to give you three

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.530 
I'm going to give you three
characteristics<00:03:10.709> one<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:12.209> there<00:03:12.390> will

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
characteristics one is that there will

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.259 
characteristics one is that there will
be<00:03:12.570> three<00:03:13.130> strands<00:03:14.130> making<00:03:15.000> up<00:03:15.090> each

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
be three strands making up each

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.900 
be three strands making up each
individual<00:03:15.780> strand<00:03:15.989> inside<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:17.340> second<00:03:17.790> will

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
individual strand inside the second will

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.380 
individual strand inside the second will
be<00:03:17.940> one<00:03:18.690> or<00:03:18.810> more<00:03:18.930> tracer<00:03:19.410> cords<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.970> identify

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
be one or more tracer cords to identify

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.490 
be one or more tracer cords to identify
the<00:03:21.450> manufacturer<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:23.790> final

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
the manufacturer and the final

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.680 
the manufacturer and the final
identifier<00:03:25.500> would<00:03:26.310> be<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.670> price<00:03:26.970> milspec

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
identifier would be the price milspec

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.660 
identifier would be the price milspec
cord<00:03:28.050> is<00:03:28.200> actually<00:03:28.410> about<00:03:28.830> double<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.340> price

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
cord is actually about double the price

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.920 
cord is actually about double the price
of<00:03:29.970> commercial<00:03:30.510> type<00:03:30.750> 3<00:03:31.110> paracord<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:33.660> next

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
of commercial type 3 paracord the next

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.190 
of commercial type 3 paracord the next
thing<00:03:34.110> I'm<00:03:34.410> gonna<00:03:34.560> talk<00:03:34.680> about<00:03:34.739> is<00:03:35.780> nylon<00:03:36.780> cord

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
thing I'm gonna talk about is nylon cord

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.590 
thing I'm gonna talk about is nylon cord
versus<00:03:37.680> polyester<00:03:38.400> cord<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.269> there's<00:03:39.390> been<00:03:39.570> a

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
versus polyester cord and there's been a

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.770 
versus polyester cord and there's been a
lot<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:39.870> debate<00:03:40.260> about<00:03:40.290> this<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.570> which<00:03:42.570> one's

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
lot of debate about this and which one's

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.479 
lot of debate about this and which one's
better<00:03:43.140> which<00:03:43.590> one's<00:03:43.890> easier<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.310> work<00:03:44.430> with

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
better which one's easier to work with

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.940 
better which one's easier to work with
and<00:03:45.150> all<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.769> in<00:03:47.540> reality<00:03:48.540> nylon<00:03:49.230> paracord

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
and all that in reality nylon paracord

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.570 
and all that in reality nylon paracord
is<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.820> way<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.030> go<00:03:51.269> it<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.440> king<00:03:53.220> when<00:03:53.459> it

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
is the way to go it is king when it

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.720 
is the way to go it is king when it
comes<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.880> paracord<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:55.519> you<00:03:56.519> know<00:03:56.670> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
comes to paracord and you know the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.990 
comes to paracord and you know the
reasons<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.239> numerous<00:03:57.600> nylon<00:03:58.080> is<00:03:59.000> it's

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
reasons of numerous nylon is it's

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.240 
reasons of numerous nylon is it's
colored<00:04:00.570> in<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.110> manufacturing<00:04:01.709> process<00:04:02.220> so

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
colored in the manufacturing process so

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.970 
colored in the manufacturing process so
will<00:04:02.700> not<00:04:02.820> fade<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.900> will<00:04:04.019> amount<00:04:04.200> raw<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.620> will

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
will not fade it will amount raw it will

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.740 
will not fade it will amount raw it will
not<00:04:05.160> mildew<00:04:06.230> so<00:04:07.489> nylon<00:04:08.489> is<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:09.269> can<00:04:09.450> bleach

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
not mildew so nylon is you can bleach

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.200 
not mildew so nylon is you can bleach
this<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.769> won't<00:04:10.980> hurt<00:04:11.360> so

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
this and it won't hurt so

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.970 
this and it won't hurt so
you<00:04:14.780> know<00:04:14.900> won't<00:04:15.110> fade<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:15.440> colors<00:04:15.770> or

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
you know won't fade the colors or

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.290 
you know won't fade the colors or
anything<00:04:16.630> so<00:04:17.769> nylon<00:04:18.769> is<00:04:19.070> you<00:04:19.580> know<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:20.030> real

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:20.300 
anything so nylon is you know the real

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.810 
anything so nylon is you know the real
paracord<00:04:20.870> now<00:04:21.200> what<00:04:21.500> we<00:04:21.590> get<00:04:21.860> a<00:04:22.100> lot<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.550> times

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
paracord now what we get a lot of times

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.930 
paracord now what we get a lot of times
and<00:04:23.780> you<00:04:23.870> can<00:04:24.160> probably<00:04:25.160> see<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.520> difference

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
and you can probably see the difference

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.150 
and you can probably see the difference
in<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.150> color<00:04:26.390> we<00:04:26.870> have<00:04:27.020> two<00:04:27.320> distinct<00:04:28.480> shades

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
in the color we have two distinct shades

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.520 
in the color we have two distinct shades
that<00:04:31.160> are<00:04:31.250> different<00:04:31.640> with<00:04:31.850> this<00:04:32.060> color<00:04:32.390> cord

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
that are different with this color cord

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.010 
that are different with this color cord
the<00:04:33.920> same<00:04:34.160> pattern<00:04:34.640> and<00:04:34.820> then<00:04:35.420> and<00:04:35.750> it's<00:04:35.870> also

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
the same pattern and then and it's also

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.110 
the same pattern and then and it's also
called<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.470> same<00:04:36.770> thing<00:04:36.980> but<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:37.730> see<00:04:37.910> the

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
called the same thing but you see the

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.110 
called the same thing but you see the
this<00:04:38.870> one<00:04:39.080> is<00:04:39.110> much<00:04:39.500> brighter<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.820> actually

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
this one is much brighter it actually

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.000 
this one is much brighter it actually
has<00:04:41.270> a<00:04:41.300> sheen<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:41.930> if<00:04:42.170> I<00:04:42.260> were<00:04:42.380> to<00:04:42.560> feel<00:04:42.860> it

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
has a sheen to it if I were to feel it

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.940 
has a sheen to it if I were to feel it
it<00:04:43.130> feels<00:04:43.340> kind<00:04:43.550> of<00:04:43.580> silky<00:04:44.060> some<00:04:45.050> nylon<00:04:45.650> cord

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
it feels kind of silky some nylon cord

it feels kind of silky some nylon cord
will<00:04:46.130> always<00:04:46.400> have<00:04:46.550> a<00:04:46.580> plastic<00:04:46.910> feel<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.540> it

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
will always have a plastic feel to it

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.460 
will always have a plastic feel to it
because<00:04:47.840> now<00:04:48.080> on<00:04:48.290> is<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.740> plastic<00:04:50.470> the

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
because now on is a plastic the

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.690 
because now on is a plastic the
polyester<00:04:51.970> paracord<00:04:52.970> is<00:04:54.220> much<00:04:55.220> more<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.640> a

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
polyester paracord is much more of a

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.560 
polyester paracord is much more of a
textile<00:04:56.330> in<00:04:56.780> a<00:04:56.870> material<00:04:57.560> feel<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.190> it

textile in a material feel to it

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
textile in a material feel to it
sometimes<00:04:59.570> it's<00:04:59.780> a<00:04:59.840> little<00:05:00.020> hard<00:05:00.410> on<00:05:00.530> the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
sometimes it's a little hard on the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.830 
sometimes it's a little hard on the
hands<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:01.040> work<00:05:01.220> with<00:05:01.550> because<00:05:02.390> it'll<00:05:02.630> burn

hands to work with because it'll burn

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.360

and you know I've seen some nylon cord

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.110 
and you know I've seen some nylon cord
is<00:05:18.530> pretty<00:05:18.740> stiff<00:05:18.980> enough<00:05:19.130> to<00:05:19.400> work<00:05:19.670> with<00:05:19.880> too

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
is pretty stiff enough to work with too

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.360 
is pretty stiff enough to work with too
so<00:05:20.390> that<00:05:20.570> I<00:05:20.600> don't<00:05:20.780> really<00:05:21.080> make<00:05:21.950> that<00:05:22.130> an

so that I don't really make that an

so that I don't really make that an

how you can tell which one it is

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.760 
how you can tell which one it is
we'll<00:05:30.110> take<00:05:30.260> the<00:05:30.380> piece<00:05:30.560> of<00:05:30.590> nylon<00:05:30.860> cord<00:05:32.770> and

we'll take the piece of nylon cord and
we'll<00:05:33.919> burn<00:05:34.130> it<00:05:34.190> and<00:05:35.150> hopefully<00:05:35.900> get<00:05:36.350> this<00:05:36.500> on

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
we'll burn it and hopefully get this on

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.430 
we'll burn it and hopefully get this on
camera<00:05:36.740> really<00:05:37.430> good<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:38.150> you'll<00:05:38.540> see<00:05:38.870> that

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
camera really good and you'll see that

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.240 
camera really good and you'll see that
the<00:05:39.710> nylon<00:05:40.580> cord<00:05:40.970> melts<00:05:41.630> very<00:05:41.720> evenly<00:05:42.650> the

the polyester cord it's an entirely

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.250 
the polyester cord it's an entirely
different<00:05:54.950> story

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
different story

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.540 
different story
what<00:05:57.260> happens<00:05:57.770> and<00:05:57.890> I'll<00:05:58.010> do<00:05:58.160> this<00:05:58.310> very

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
what happens and I'll do this very

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.180 
what happens and I'll do this very
slowly<00:05:59.060> so<00:05:59.360> you<00:05:59.419> can<00:05:59.540> see<00:05:59.750> it<00:05:59.870> happen<00:06:00.200> is<00:06:00.380> the

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
slowly so you can see it happen is the

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.300 
slowly so you can see it happen is the
jacket<00:06:01.760> the<00:06:01.880> polyester<00:06:02.270> jacket<00:06:02.720> burns<00:06:03.650> very

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
jacket the polyester jacket burns very

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.550 
jacket the polyester jacket burns very
quickly<00:06:04.490> compared<00:06:05.390> to<00:06:05.540> the<00:06:05.660> inner<00:06:05.810> core<00:06:06.140> if

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
quickly compared to the inner core if

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.360 
quickly compared to the inner core if
you<00:06:06.740> see<00:06:07.040> how<00:06:07.850> quickly<00:06:08.270> that<00:06:08.450> will<00:06:08.780> burn<00:06:09.020> away

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
you see how quickly that will burn away

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.890 
you see how quickly that will burn away
compared<00:06:10.370> to<00:06:10.430> inner<00:06:10.580> core<00:06:10.910> that's<00:06:11.600> how<00:06:11.840> you

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
compared to inner core that's how you

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.170 
compared to inner core that's how you
can<00:06:12.169> tell<00:06:12.430> that's<00:06:13.430> one<00:06:13.610> way<00:06:13.730> you<00:06:13.790> can<00:06:13.910> tell

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
can tell that's one way you can tell

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.650 
can tell that's one way you can tell
that<00:06:14.300> it's<00:06:14.450> polyester<00:06:14.780> so<00:06:15.560> a<00:06:16.430> lot<00:06:17.360> of<00:06:17.390> times

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
that it's polyester so a lot of times

of it is is the big thing for me I can
tell<00:06:28.520> by<00:06:28.699> feeling<00:06:28.729> it<00:06:29.270> that<00:06:29.449> it's<00:06:29.660> a<00:06:30.520> textile

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
and not nylon or plastic and then like I

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.279 
and not nylon or plastic and then like I
said<00:06:36.169> the<00:06:37.030> jacket<00:06:38.030> will<00:06:38.300> melt<00:06:38.750> very<00:06:39.110> quickly

said the jacket will melt very quickly

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:42.460 
said the jacket will melt very quickly
compared<00:06:40.220> to<00:06:40.460> an<00:06:40.669> a-line<00:06:41.000> cord<00:06:41.539> which<00:06:41.810> will

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
compared to an a-line cord which will

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.510 
compared to an a-line cord which will
melt<00:06:43.460> evenly<00:06:43.819> and<00:06:44.800> you<00:06:45.800> also<00:06:45.979> have<00:06:46.310> a<00:06:46.340> lot<00:06:46.490> of

melt evenly and you also have a lot of

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.219 
melt evenly and you also have a lot of
problems<00:06:46.909> trying<00:06:47.090> to<00:06:47.240> melt<00:06:47.569> it<00:06:47.720> and<00:06:47.870> join<00:06:48.050> the

problems trying to melt it and join the

problems trying to melt it and join the
ends<00:06:48.379> together<00:06:49.330> the<00:06:50.330> real<00:06:50.750> trick<00:06:51.020> to<00:06:51.139> that<00:06:51.289> is

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
ends together the real trick to that is

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.309 
ends together the real trick to that is
to<00:06:51.830> try<00:06:52.069> to<00:06:52.310> melt<00:06:52.729> the<00:06:52.940> core<00:06:53.300> nylon<00:06:53.930> strands

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 
to try to melt the core nylon strands

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:55.990 
to try to melt the core nylon strands
first<00:06:54.680> and<00:06:54.949> melt<00:06:55.130> them<00:06:55.310> together<00:06:55.430> and<00:06:55.849> then

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
first and melt them together and then

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.909 
first and melt them together and then
kind<00:06:56.330> of<00:06:56.389> mold<00:06:56.659> the<00:06:56.930> outer<00:06:57.139> jacket<00:06:57.259> together

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 
kind of mold the outer jacket together

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.990 
kind of mold the outer jacket together
and<00:06:58.159> that<00:06:58.310> should<00:06:58.599> hold<00:06:59.599> it<00:06:59.750> pretty<00:06:59.900> well<00:07:00.110> but

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
and that should hold it pretty well but

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.920 
and that should hold it pretty well but
hopefully<00:07:02.000> this<00:07:02.150> has<00:07:02.270> been<00:07:02.330> helpful<00:07:02.479> to

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930 
hopefully this has been helpful to

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.819 
hopefully this has been helpful to
everyone<00:07:03.139> and<00:07:03.530> thank<00:07:04.460> you<00:07:04.520> for<00:07:04.580> watching
