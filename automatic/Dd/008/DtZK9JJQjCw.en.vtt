00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
read maybe beats him out just a little

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.900 
read maybe beats him out just a little
bit<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:29.410> know<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.740> for<00:02:29.920> example<00:02:30.070> pretty

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
bit you know just for example pretty

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.270 
bit you know just for example pretty
much<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.270> only<00:02:31.300> thing<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.560> ronnie<00:02:32.830> Lott<00:02:33.100> is

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
much the only thing that ronnie Lott is

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.400 
much the only thing that ronnie Lott is
better<00:02:33.610> at<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.060> ned<00:02:34.300> read<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.690> tackling<00:02:35.200> he

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
better at the ned read is tackling he

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.030 
better at the ned read is tackling he
has<00:02:35.560> an<00:02:35.710> 84<00:02:36.130> where<00:02:36.370> ed<00:02:36.550> has<00:02:37.060> 76<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:38.620> other<00:02:38.800> than

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
has an 84 where ed has 76 but other than

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.880 
has an 84 where ed has 76 but other than
that<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.280> think<00:02:39.400> Ed<00:02:39.910> Reed<00:02:40.230> slightly<00:02:41.230> edges<00:02:41.710> him

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
that I think Ed Reed slightly edges him

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.280 
that I think Ed Reed slightly edges him
out<00:02:42.100> for<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.550> better<00:02:42.760> safety<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.080> case

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290
