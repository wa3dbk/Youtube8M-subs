00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
to their kitchen so that we can open up

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.150 
to their kitchen so that we can open up
that<00:00:54.190> space<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.700> little<00:00:54.940> bit<00:00:55.090> and<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:56.590> know<00:00:56.710> as

that space a little bit and you know as
part<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.760> layout<00:00:58.150> and<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.480> visualization

part of the layout and the visualization

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.230 
part of the layout and the visualization
that<00:00:59.380> goes<00:00:59.680> along<00:00:59.980> with<00:01:00.100> that<00:01:00.160> we<00:01:00.910> used

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
that goes along with that we used

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.630 
that goes along with that we used
painters<00:01:01.840> tape<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.260> help<00:01:02.530> mark<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.100> wall<00:01:03.340> for

painters tape to help mark the wall for
the<00:01:03.730> client<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.540> helped<00:01:04.869> them<00:01:04.989> visualize<00:01:05.439> it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
the client it helped them visualize it

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.530 
the client it helped them visualize it
we<00:01:05.830> actually<00:01:05.950> left<00:01:06.369> it<00:01:06.490> up<00:01:06.580> for<00:01:06.759> a<00:01:06.820> week<00:01:07.030> so

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
we actually left it up for a week so

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.090 
we actually left it up for a week so
they<00:01:07.659> could<00:01:07.810> walk<00:01:07.990> by<00:01:08.259> come<00:01:08.619> in<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:08.950> out<00:01:09.040> of

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
they could walk by come in and out of

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.160 
they could walk by come in and out of
the<00:01:09.159> house<00:01:09.340> and<00:01:09.520> look<00:01:09.759> at<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.240> figure<00:01:10.840> out<00:01:11.079> if

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
the house and look at it figure out if

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.140 
the house and look at it figure out if
that's<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.890> size<00:01:12.189> they<00:01:12.460> wanted<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.030> they

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
that's the size they wanted and they

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.470 
that's the size they wanted and they
ended<00:01:13.329> up<00:01:13.450> changing<00:01:14.020> it<00:01:14.110> several<00:01:14.500> times<00:01:15.480> once

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
ended up changing it several times once

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.170 
ended up changing it several times once
the<00:01:16.840> layout<00:01:17.080> is<00:01:17.440> fine<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:18.070> secure<00:01:18.550> then<00:01:19.060> you

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
the layout is fine and secure then you

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.970 
the layout is fine and secure then you
got<00:01:19.300> to<00:01:19.420> start<00:01:19.450> thinking<00:01:19.870> about<00:01:19.990> what<00:01:20.830> you're

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
got to start thinking about what you're

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.470 
got to start thinking about what you're
going<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.159> do<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.580> what<00:01:21.790> we<00:01:21.909> did<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.150> we<00:01:22.180> used

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
going to do and what we did is we used

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480 
going to do and what we did is we used
levels<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.200> we<00:01:23.290> did<00:01:23.470> level<00:01:23.800> lines<00:01:24.010> and<00:01:24.250> plumb

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
levels and we did level lines and plumb

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.000 
levels and we did level lines and plumb
lines<00:01:24.730> to<00:01:25.030> mark<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:26.290> side<00:01:26.620> of<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.830> wall

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
lines to mark one side of the wall

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.390 
lines to mark one side of the wall
perfectly<00:01:27.700> where<00:01:28.360> we<00:01:28.479> wanted<00:01:28.810> this<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:28.960> go

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
perfectly where we wanted this to go

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.560 
perfectly where we wanted this to go
we'll<00:01:30.400> worry<00:01:30.610> about<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.909> other<00:01:31.030> side<00:01:31.270> later

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
we'll worry about the other side later

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.660 
we'll worry about the other side later
then<00:01:32.470> we<00:01:32.590> started<00:01:32.830> looking<00:01:33.070> at<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.280> wall<00:01:33.490> are

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
then we started looking at the wall are

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.450 
then we started looking at the wall are
there<00:01:33.970> any<00:01:34.090> outlet<00:01:34.479> switches<00:01:35.080> plumbing<00:01:35.830> you

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
there any outlet switches plumbing you

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.710 
there any outlet switches plumbing you
can<00:01:36.610> look<00:01:36.729> from<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.000> basement<00:01:37.420> up<00:01:37.510> from

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
can look from the basement up from

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.750 
can look from the basement up from
upstairs<00:01:38.050> down<00:01:38.380> there's<00:01:38.650> lots<00:01:38.860> of<00:01:39.070> ways<00:01:39.370> to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
upstairs down there's lots of ways to

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.100 
upstairs down there's lots of ways to
try<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.940> figure<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:40.240> off<00:01:40.390> there<00:01:40.540> things<00:01:40.870> in<00:01:41.020> the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110

try to figure it off there things in the
wall<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:41.590> if<00:01:41.710> you're<00:01:41.860> unsure<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:43.210> could

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
wall and if you're unsure you could

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.000 
wall and if you're unsure you could
punch<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.960> hole<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.350> wall<00:01:44.530> or<00:01:44.770> poke<00:01:44.979> a

punch a hole in the wall or poke a
little<00:01:45.130> inspection<00:01:45.670> hole<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.270> do<00:01:46.630> inspection

what<00:02:26.599> I<00:02:26.630> like<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.959> do<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.319> I<00:02:27.440> like<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.650> use<00:02:27.800> a

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
what I like to do is I like to use a

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.280 
what I like to do is I like to use a
multi-tool<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:29.090> have<00:02:29.270> a<00:02:29.300> vacuum<00:02:29.780> the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
multi-tool and I have a vacuum the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.860 
multi-tool and I have a vacuum the
multi-tool<00:02:30.830> allows<00:02:31.220> me<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.730> create<00:02:32.599> an

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
multi-tool allows me to create an

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.320 
multi-tool allows me to create an
opening<00:02:33.319> with<00:02:33.890> precision<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.640> control<00:02:34.819> and

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
opening with precision and control and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.780 
opening with precision and control and
does<00:02:35.750> not<00:02:35.930> cause<00:02:36.319> a<00:02:36.350> lot<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:36.739> damage<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.670> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
does not cause a lot of damage to the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.180 
does not cause a lot of damage to the
surrounding<00:02:38.000> wall<00:02:38.630> board<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.560> while<00:02:40.010> I'm

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
surrounding wall board so while I'm

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.979 
surrounding wall board so while I'm
making<00:02:40.580> my<00:02:40.730> cut<00:02:41.030> with<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.330> multi-tool<00:02:41.780> I'm

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
making my cut with the multi-tool I'm

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.470 
making my cut with the multi-tool I'm
having<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.380> helper<00:02:43.040> hold<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.610> HEPA<00:02:43.790> vacuum<00:02:43.910> and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
having a helper hold the HEPA vacuum and

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.580 
having a helper hold the HEPA vacuum and
again<00:02:44.930> collecting<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.650> dust<00:02:45.920> at<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.190> source

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
again collecting the dust at the source

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.930 
again collecting the dust at the source
so<00:02:48.590> we<00:02:48.620> cut<00:02:48.980> all<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.430> way<00:02:49.550> around<00:02:49.850> the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
so we cut all the way around the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.250 
so we cut all the way around the
perimeter<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.360> one<00:02:50.660> side<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.110> wall

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
perimeter of one side of the wall

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.710 
perimeter of one side of the wall
cutting<00:02:51.980> through<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.370> board<00:02:52.580> completely<00:02:53.209> and

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
cutting through the board completely and

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.390 
cutting through the board completely and
then<00:02:53.900> we<00:02:53.989> take<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.200> hammer<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.739> we<00:02:54.830> tap<00:02:55.069> around

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
then we take a hammer and we tap around

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.890 
then we take a hammer and we tap around
the<00:02:55.610> edge<00:02:55.760> of<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.090> perimeter<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.569> make<00:02:56.630> sure

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
the edge of the perimeter to make sure

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.130 
the edge of the perimeter to make sure
that<00:02:57.080> we've<00:02:57.230> broken<00:02:57.980> that<00:02:58.310> connection<00:02:58.700> and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
that we've broken that connection and

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.809 
that we've broken that connection and
either<00:03:00.140> use<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.319> pry<00:03:00.650> bar<00:03:00.680> or<00:03:01.190> poke<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.700> hole

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
either use a pry bar or poke a hole

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.030 
either use a pry bar or poke a hole
through<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.299> wall<00:03:02.330> with<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.840> hammer<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.769> create

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
through the wall with a hammer to create

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.370 
through the wall with a hammer to create
a<00:03:04.069> handhold<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:04.790> then<00:03:05.000> we<00:03:05.150> rip<00:03:05.420> those<00:03:05.750> the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
a handhold and then we rip those the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.250 
a handhold and then we rip those the
wall<00:03:06.739> board<00:03:07.040> off<00:03:07.190> piece<00:03:07.580> by<00:03:07.850> piece<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
wall board off piece by piece and and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.509 
wall board off piece by piece and and
the<00:03:09.380> wall<00:03:09.560> board<00:03:09.769> really<00:03:09.890> does<00:03:10.100> it<00:03:10.220> comes<00:03:10.370> off

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
the wall board really does it comes off

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.460 
the wall board really does it comes off
in<00:03:10.700> chunks<00:03:10.880> we<00:03:11.150> move<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.510> piece<00:03:11.720> by<00:03:11.750> piece<00:03:11.959> and

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
in chunks we move it piece by piece and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.229 
in chunks we move it piece by piece and
then<00:03:13.040> we<00:03:13.160> put<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:13.730> know<00:03:13.760> on<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.000> bottle

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
then we put it you know on the bottle

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.390 
then we put it you know on the bottle
take<00:03:14.390> it<00:03:14.569> out<00:03:14.680> once<00:03:15.680> we<00:03:15.860> have<00:03:16.069> one<00:03:16.100> side

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
take it out once we have one side

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.650 
take it out once we have one side
completely<00:03:17.330> open<00:03:17.799> we<00:03:18.799> then<00:03:19.510> turn<00:03:20.510> our

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
completely open we then turn our

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.180 
completely open we then turn our
attention<00:03:21.109> to<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.320> opposite<00:03:21.739> side<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.010> the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
attention to the opposite side of the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.319 
attention to the opposite side of the
wall<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:23.030> get<00:03:23.239> our<00:03:23.560> lines<00:03:24.760> transferred<00:03:25.760> we

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
wall and to get our lines transferred we

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.229 
wall and to get our lines transferred we
use<00:03:26.540> long<00:03:27.310> insulation<00:03:28.310> rods<00:03:28.609> they're<00:03:28.940> their

use long insulation rods they're their

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.420 
use long insulation rods they're their
insulation<00:03:29.630> holding<00:03:30.230> rods<00:03:30.470> we<00:03:31.040> chuck<00:03:31.310> them

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
insulation holding rods we chuck them

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.729 
insulation holding rods we chuck them
into<00:03:31.670> our<00:03:31.790> drill<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.690> we<00:03:32.810> basically<00:03:33.079> drill<00:03:33.590> in

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
into our drill and we basically drill in

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.030 
into our drill and we basically drill in
all<00:03:33.980> four<00:03:34.310> corners<00:03:34.579> through<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.299> drywall<00:03:35.750> and

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
all four corners through the drywall and

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.220 
all four corners through the drywall and
then<00:03:37.040> we<00:03:37.160> just<00:03:37.370> connect<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.730> dots<00:03:38.230> once

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
then we just connect the dots once

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.560 
then we just connect the dots once
that's<00:03:39.530> done<00:03:39.799> we<00:03:40.280> repeat<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.030> process<00:03:41.060> with

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
that's done we repeat the process with

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.780 
that's done we repeat the process with
the<00:03:41.630> multi-tool<00:03:42.140> in<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.410> HEPA<00:03:42.590> vacuum

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
the multi-tool in the HEPA vacuum

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.900 
the multi-tool in the HEPA vacuum
cutting<00:03:43.790> out<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.150> removing<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.810> drywall

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
cutting out and removing the drywall

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.000 
cutting out and removing the drywall
from<00:03:46.910> there<00:03:47.209> we<00:03:47.690> now<00:03:47.870> have<00:03:48.170> an<00:03:48.320> open<00:03:48.709> space

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
from there we now have an open space

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.800 
from there we now have an open space
it's<00:03:49.250> wide<00:03:49.519> open<00:03:49.549> we<00:03:50.120> need<00:03:50.269> to<00:03:50.390> cut<00:03:50.630> out<00:03:50.780> the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
it's wide open we need to cut out the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.680 
it's wide open we need to cut out the
studs<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.950> use<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.430> reciprocating<00:03:52.880> saw<00:03:53.359> and<00:03:53.630> we

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
studs I use a reciprocating saw and we

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.240 
studs I use a reciprocating saw and we
just<00:03:53.870> cut<00:03:54.049> the<00:03:54.170> stubs<00:03:54.410> top<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:54.829> bottom<00:03:55.130> and

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
just cut the stubs top and bottom and

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.699 
just cut the stubs top and bottom and
now<00:03:55.910> we<00:03:55.970> have<00:03:56.299> our<00:03:56.510> opening<00:03:56.900> our<00:03:57.200> opening<00:03:57.620> is

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
now we have our opening our opening is

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.039 
now we have our opening our opening is
now<00:03:57.890> defined<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:59.090> now<00:03:59.510> you<00:03:59.569> need<00:03:59.840> to<00:03:59.900> start

now defined and now you need to start

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.050 
now defined and now you need to start
thinking<00:04:00.140> about<00:04:00.620> nailers<00:04:01.100> because<00:04:01.459> we<00:04:01.640> want

it<00:04:25.220> a<00:04:25.250> couple<00:04:25.729> of<00:04:25.820> different<00:04:26.240> locations

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
it a couple of different locations

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.220 
it a couple of different locations
rip<00:04:27.860> one<00:04:28.310> by<00:04:28.490> flatstock<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.480> that<00:04:29.630> measurement

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
rip one by flatstock to that measurement

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.560 
rip one by flatstock to that measurement
and<00:04:30.650> then<00:04:30.950> I<00:04:31.070> make<00:04:31.340> my<00:04:31.550> extension<00:04:32.090> jam<00:04:32.240> on<00:04:32.450> the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
and then I make my extension jam on the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.430 
and then I make my extension jam on the
ground<00:04:32.810> it's<00:04:32.990> basically<00:04:33.380> just<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:33.800> rectangular

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
ground it's basically just a rectangular

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.620 
ground it's basically just a rectangular
box<00:04:36.440> that<00:04:37.220> we<00:04:37.430> we<00:04:37.760> fastened<00:04:38.240> with<00:04:38.300> finished

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
box that we we fastened with finished

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.480 
box that we we fastened with finished
nails<00:04:38.810> and<00:04:39.080> then<00:04:39.200> we<00:04:39.350> place<00:04:39.620> in<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:40.070> opening

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
nails and then we place in the opening

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.330 
nails and then we place in the opening
we<00:04:41.150> plumb<00:04:41.930> and<00:04:41.960> level<00:04:42.169> it<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.680> shim<00:04:43.040> it<00:04:43.160> in

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
we plumb and level it and shim it in

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.600 
we plumb and level it and shim it in
place<00:04:43.639> so<00:04:43.940> once<00:04:44.690> it's<00:04:44.870> secured<00:04:45.380> you're<00:04:46.340> then

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
place so once it's secured you're then

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.870 
place so once it's secured you're then
able<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:47.210> install<00:04:48.200> your<00:04:48.500> trim<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.070> you<00:04:49.760> know

able to install your trim and you know
installing<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.690> trim<00:04:50.960> is<00:04:51.200> probably<00:04:51.800> the

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
installing the trim is probably the

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.140 
installing the trim is probably the
final<00:04:52.250> step<00:04:52.460> you've<00:04:52.610> got<00:04:52.700> to<00:04:52.790> do<00:04:52.880> it<00:04:52.970> to<00:04:53.030> both

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
final step you've got to do it to both

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.750 
final step you've got to do it to both
sides<00:04:53.480> and<00:04:53.810> if<00:04:54.680> you've<00:04:54.800> noticed<00:04:55.070> in<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.460> video
