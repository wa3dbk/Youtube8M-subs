winning the title in the ladder match

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.250 
winning the title in the ladder match
and<00:00:52.170> then<00:00:53.449> Roman<00:00:54.449> reigns<00:00:54.480> winning<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> money

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and then Roman reigns winning the money

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.600 
and then Roman reigns winning the money
in<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.469> bank<00:00:55.710> because<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.039> didn't<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.520> at

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
in the bank because they didn't think at

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.709 
in the bank because they didn't think at
the<00:00:56.699> start<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> show<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the start of the show that was the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.209 
the start of the show that was the
opening<00:00:57.840> match<00:00:58.230> was<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> money<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> bank

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
opening match was the money in the bank

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.209 
opening match was the money in the bank
so<00:00:59.460> it<00:01:00.210> gives<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> long<00:01:01.070> period<00:01:02.070> of

so it gives you a long period of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.420 
so it gives you a long period of
forgetting<00:01:02.910> their<00:01:03.359> kind<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> know

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
plans for Triple H vs seth rollins of

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.690 
plans for Triple H vs seth rollins of
SummerSlam<00:04:13.470> so<00:04:13.709> there's<00:04:14.040> gonna<00:04:14.190> be<00:04:14.459> something

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
SummerSlam so there's gonna be something

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.599 
SummerSlam so there's gonna be something
in<00:04:15.000> between<00:04:15.120> june<00:04:15.690> july<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:17.209> august<00:04:18.209> where

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
in between june july and august where

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.670 
in between june july and august where
Seth<00:04:20.609> Rollins<00:04:20.820> is<00:04:21.150> going<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:21.359> be<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:22.200> would

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
Seth Rollins is going to be I would

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.279 
Seth Rollins is going to be I would
imagine<00:04:23.360> turning<00:04:24.360> into<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:24.720> good<00:04:24.900> guy<00:04:25.050> or

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
imagine turning into a good guy or

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.050 
imagine turning into a good guy or
unless<00:04:25.770> they<00:04:25.919> do<00:04:26.039> Triple<00:04:26.340> H<00:04:26.430> but<00:04:26.669> highly

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
unless they do Triple H but highly

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.770 
unless they do Triple H but highly
unlikely

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
unlikely

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.770 
unlikely
so<00:04:28.410> looking<00:04:29.010> forward<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.490> I<00:04:29.700> don't<00:04:30.690> really

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
so looking forward to it I don't really

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.030 
so looking forward to it I don't really
know<00:04:30.960> what<00:04:31.110> else<00:04:31.139> battleground<00:04:31.740> will<00:04:31.860> have

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
probably the rubber match with John Cena

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.480 
probably the rubber match with John Cena
and<00:04:34.050> Kevin<00:04:34.110> Owens<00:04:34.590> for<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.040> United<00:04:35.130> States
