these directions curved stroke you have

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.990 
these directions curved stroke you have
a<00:01:06.440> little<00:01:06.619> more<00:01:06.740> room<00:01:06.950> for<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.310> now<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:07.909> it

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
a little more room for it now so it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.640 
a little more room for it now so it
should<00:01:08.180> be<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.330> little<00:01:08.510> easier<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.840> do<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.170> push

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
should be a little easier to do I push

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.620 
should be a little easier to do I push
in<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.890> little<00:01:10.250> bit<00:01:10.400> from<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.790> left<00:01:10.970> come<00:01:11.450> down

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
in a little bit from the left come down

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.039 
in a little bit from the left come down
to<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:11.810> vertical<00:01:12.229> side<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.799> then<00:01:12.920> release

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
to a vertical side and then release

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.139 
to a vertical side and then release
release<00:01:15.049> wait<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:15.619> it's<00:01:15.770> a<00:01:16.060> light<00:01:17.470> exit<00:01:18.470> stroke

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
release wait so it's a light exit stroke

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.249 
release wait so it's a light exit stroke
those<00:01:20.149> are<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.359> mean<00:01:20.570> strokes<00:01:20.929> are<00:01:21.079> going<00:01:21.200> to

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
those are the mean strokes are going to

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.679 
those are the mean strokes are going to
be<00:01:21.380> using<00:01:21.619> with<00:01:22.039> the<00:01:22.640> brush<00:01:22.820> grip<00:01:23.090> caps<00:01:23.359> and

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
be using with the brush grip caps and

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.069 
be using with the brush grip caps and
here's<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:24.170> monoline<00:01:25.869> version<00:01:26.869> of<00:01:26.990> the

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
here's the monoline version of the

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.510 
here's the monoline version of the
script<00:01:27.259> cap<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:27.829> you<00:01:27.890> can<00:01:28.070> see<00:01:28.219> it's<00:01:28.340> like<00:01:28.429> a

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
script cap so you can see it's like a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.419 
script cap so you can see it's like a
skeleton<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.329> caps<00:01:29.799> they're<00:01:30.799> based<00:01:31.039> on<00:01:31.249> an

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
skeleton of the caps they're based on an

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:32.739 
skeleton of the caps they're based on an
ellipse<00:01:31.759> in<00:01:31.999> there<00:01:32.149> they<00:01:32.329> have<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.479> slight

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
ellipse in there they have a slight

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.349 
ellipse in there they have a slight
slant<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.289> them<00:01:33.469> so<00:01:34.340> we'll<00:01:34.640> imitate<00:01:35.149> that

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
slant to them so we'll imitate that

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.789 
slant to them so we'll imitate that
below<00:01:35.780> them<00:01:36.020> with<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.609> with<00:01:37.609> the<00:01:37.729> script<00:01:37.999> caps

and the brush caps these horizontal

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.440 
and the brush caps these horizontal
strokes<00:01:43.130> have<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.369> little<00:01:43.729> bit<00:01:43.880> of<00:01:43.999> a<00:01:44.119> weight

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450

brush lettering is this direction so you

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.960 
brush lettering is this direction so you
have<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.680> keep<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.950> weight<00:02:29.160> out<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.700> ball

brush grip caps I like to do ones with a
little<00:03:22.349> bit<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.500> flourish<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.430> get<00:03:23.580> up

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
little bit of flourish so I can get up

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.880 
little bit of flourish so I can get up
on<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:23.970> tip<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.450> tool<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.440> tip<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.800> the

on the tip of the tool the tip of the

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.710

thrown<00:03:28.730> graceful<00:03:29.730> movements

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
thrown graceful movements

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.640

so<00:03:31.200> here's<00:03:31.800> flourish<00:03:32.310> caps<00:03:32.670> combining<00:03:33.660> more

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
so here's flourish caps combining more

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.369 
so here's flourish caps combining more

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
the curve strokes at some point you can

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.950 
the curve strokes at some point you can
let<00:04:27.759> go<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:30.030> get<00:04:31.030> some<00:04:31.240> flourish<00:04:31.570> in<00:04:31.750> there

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
let go and get some flourish in there

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:40.250 
let go and get some flourish in there
too

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.260 

and<00:04:40.770> coming<00:04:41.070> up<00:04:41.190> on<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.430> tip<00:04:41.640> of<00:04:41.670> the<00:04:41.850> tool<00:04:42.030> to

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
and coming up on the tip of the tool to

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:52.510 
and coming up on the tip of the tool to
do<00:04:42.390> these<00:04:42.570> kinds<00:04:42.960> of<00:04:43.020> things

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.430 

and<00:04:53.030> you<00:04:53.120> have<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.270> lot<00:04:53.509> of<00:04:53.690> opportunity<00:04:54.319> to

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
and you have a lot of opportunity to

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.080 
and you have a lot of opportunity to
flourish<00:04:54.650> probably<00:04:55.250> better<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:55.520> just<00:04:55.819> pick

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
flourish probably better to just pick

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.659 
flourish probably better to just pick
one<00:04:56.419> one<00:04:57.319> of<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.650> opportunities<00:04:57.889> so<00:04:58.550> it

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
one one of the opportunities so it

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.790 
one one of the opportunities so it
doesn't<00:04:59.000> get<00:04:59.090> too<00:04:59.330> too<00:05:00.199> busy

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
doesn't get too too busy

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.370 
doesn't get too too busy
so<00:05:01.009> that's<00:05:01.699> flourished<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.539> these<00:05:02.900> may<00:05:03.319> be

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
so that's flourished and these may be

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:11.620 
so that's flourished and these may be
more<00:05:03.949> under<00:05:04.190> control<00:05:04.930> like<00:05:05.930> on<00:05:06.110> NRK<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:10.630> okay

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630
