00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
they're all extremely builds this one is

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.650 
they're all extremely builds this one is
just<00:04:51.449> a<00:04:51.720> little<00:04:52.080> bit<00:04:52.970> more<00:04:53.970> exciting<00:04:54.330> as<00:04:54.479> more

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
just a little bit more exciting as more

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.120

really<00:05:01.080> expect<00:05:01.199> from<00:05:01.680> an<00:05:01.830> Asian<00:05:02.099> deck<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:03.300> now

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
really expect from an Asian deck and now

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.050 
really expect from an Asian deck and now
the<00:05:03.720> torgai<00:05:04.289> thing<00:05:04.500> in<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.710> world<00:05:04.889> no<00:05:05.729> longer

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
stuff this is probably the best way to

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.870 
stuff this is probably the best way to
build<00:05:11.190> a<00:05:11.370> kiosk<00:05:11.699> type<00:05:11.940> agent<00:05:12.360> deck<00:05:12.539> and<00:05:13.880> yeah
