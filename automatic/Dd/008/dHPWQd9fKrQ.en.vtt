00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
did play competitive on the scheme but

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.360 
did play competitive on the scheme but
not<00:02:15.030> nearly<00:02:15.390> as<00:02:15.510> much<00:02:15.870> as<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.230> as<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.800> do<00:02:17.040> now

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
not nearly as much as I you as I do now

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.720 
not nearly as much as I you as I do now
so<00:02:18.020> but<00:02:19.020> anyways<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.620> think<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:20.100> main<00:02:20.250> reason<00:02:20.310> i

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
so but anyways I think the main reason i

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.760 
so but anyways I think the main reason i
hated<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:21.150> game<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.630> much<00:02:21.690> was<00:02:22.140> because<00:02:22.530> of

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
hated this game so much was because of

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.820 
hated this game so much was because of
my<00:02:23.040> internet<00:02:23.490> when<00:02:24.090> i<00:02:24.120> played<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.900> but<00:02:25.800> i

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
my internet when i played on this but i

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.700 
my internet when i played on this but i
played<00:02:26.130> black<00:02:26.370> ops<00:02:26.400> 2<00:02:26.880> i<00:02:26.910> had<00:02:27.240> five<00:02:27.720> down<00:02:28.260> and
