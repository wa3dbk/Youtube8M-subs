00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.310
 taught to make this delicious cake 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.960

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.690
 delicious 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.210
 and before starting the recipe and if it is 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.840
 well because if we go to 100 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.840
 subscribers 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.540
 the following that we are going to need 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.699
 for the recipe only following 100 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.290
 oreo cookie delegates if not against 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.750
 that you do not have you can also use 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.570
 reading is chocolate 200 milliliters 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.570
 can to cook if you can not 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.390
 use also sing to aim 200 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.370
 grams of black chocolate 300 grams 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.170
 strawberries I bought a handful of 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.390
 companies but this will depend on 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.940
 according to your mold or the lies that 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.330
 you want to use 100 grams of chocolate 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.240
 with milk 50 grams of almonds 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.149
 almonds also depends on how many 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.920
 you want to throw and 110 grams of 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.110
 butter at room temperature 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.350
 the edge that I will use for this recipe 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.689
 is this is a removable mold so 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.700
 will help me to disassemble it better if not 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.880
 you put nothing but I recommend 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 that if you find it in the world what 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.670
 first thing we have to do is 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.649
 crush our cookies with a 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.930
 chopper or tm on the opening and 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.149
 have a bag and give him one with a 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.189
 equal roller dry converts so I 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.259
 you can directly split it if they are 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.850
 if you want to take away the king 's 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.710
 filling the cookies also what 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.510
 you can do this according to what I like 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.170
 I like to put it full 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.170
 two 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.070
 what we have to do is melt 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.170
 our butter in a microwave 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.540
 30 in 30 seconds is not easy because 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.970
 then it can be filled when we have 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.770
 crushed moo-jin cookies and 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.390
 melted butter is the time to 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.870
 throw the butter on our 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.870
 cookies 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.959
 and they do not help the pastry maker let's go 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.519
 incorporating them if you do not have help 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.360
 with the help of a spoon you can do it 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.610
 equally 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.360
 when we have these ingredients very 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.360
 integrated 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.099
 this step if you do not have a find 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.550
 pastry can also do with a 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.550
 spoon 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.159
 when we have our mix for all 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.629
 our edge we are going to put it to 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.569
 refrigerator while doing 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.670
 got this step what we have to 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.469
 to do now is to put our chocolate 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.680
 that has to be well chopped into a 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:54.680
 bowl 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.680
 and now we have to remove the cream but 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.659
 if it comes to boil 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.189
 when we see that the battle is what 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.930
 we miss warm enough 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.930
 directly on top of the chocolate 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.490
 now we have to let it rest 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.860
 for two minutes after about two 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.560
 resting minutes let's go moving 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.060
 with the heat of the cream will help 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.370
 our chocolate melts by 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.040
 complete if you see that chocolate does not 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.900
 knows retirement when you have moved it 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.850
 you can put 10 seconds in the microwave 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.950
 but we have to be very careful of 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.960
 that you do not have but as you see my 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.069
 chocolate is totally melted not 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.709
 has no one 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.709
 When I'm traveling too 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.069
 and this different 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.720
 two 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.720
 A) Yes 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.810
 do not 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.720
 now that we have our tails of 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.970
 our men what we have to 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.770
 to do is to remove the corner that I feel 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.530
 pour strawberries and let's go 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.750
 to go forming what we have to do 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.199
 now is go placing strawberries 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.199
 all our 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.020
 if you do not like strawberries there low 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.880
 I'm going to leave a book where I make a 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.880
 cake very similar but if company 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.860
 and good now what we have to do 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:57.820
 is to put them in the refrigerator between 1 and 2 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:05:00.220
