00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.350
 welcome to another video friends today 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.520
 jaypee pokemon eyes me on the day of 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.529
 today I bring to the channel here what 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.139
 it would be another small tutorial for pokemon 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.340
 ruby or mega and sapphire alpha today 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.500
 I come to show you how you can 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.599
 get to what would be life sphere 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.090
 and the lucky egg there is a pretty way 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.350
 fast and also unlimited 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.210
 friends so you can really 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.160
 get what they want since the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.630
 way to get them is pretty easy 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.000
 first of all with life sphere 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.220
 we will have to come to the route that is 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.340
 next to tree-lined city and we'll have 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.450
 to start capturing what would be 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.280
 absolute time we capture an app only 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.310
 we will start using our snap 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.070
 with what will be the 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.050
 the chain and once we start to 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.030
 chain a bunch of apps or some of 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.590
 they will have to appear with object in 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.020
 where the skill would have to appear 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.910
 and right there we will see that the lapse 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.920
 in question would bring the object life 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.170
 sphere for all people who do not 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.230
 know what this object does what it does 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.180
 life sphere is to increase by 30% the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.850
 power of each movement but without 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.339
 But at the cost of losing what will be 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.020
 I 'm not wrong 10 percent of ps in 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.330
 every turn that really is quite 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.369
 good for pokemon as offensive as 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.650
 ninja greg can see that once you 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.330
 let's get the lapse the one that has the life 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.760
 sphere as it is this we will have two 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.010
 options the first one will be as simple as 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.990
 capture the pokemon and get rid of 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.450
 any problem already so that having the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.979
 pokemon and just take the object and 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.619
 then if we want to release it or 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.240
 stay on the team or second what 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.070
 what we could do is bring some 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.740
 pokemon which learns the movement 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.360
 steal and steal the object so we 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.340
 we are also us and now 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.950
 we would have in question what would be the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.050
 object and without the need to capture the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.030
 pokemon that is also pretty easy 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.210
 One thing that they also have to know is 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.760
 what 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.100
 in some pokemon with the eye skill 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.380
 compound will increase the probability 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.510
 of the pokemon carrying an object 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.369
 equipped ok now let's see how it 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.820
 capture or how the egg is obtained 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.820
 luck 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.580
 for the lucky egg is exactly the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.590
 same procedure nothing more than in this 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.750
 occasion for the pokemon selected by 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.970
 so saying it is going to make this movie but 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.790
 once we find a movie because it 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.560
 find in the city I say the bad suck and 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.630
 all this route that is before arriving 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.370
 to the port city ​​so good here 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.350
 we'll have to search here 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.540
 until you find some pokemon which the 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.040
 movie but tell us that it has the object 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.890
 lucky egg and once we get 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.590
 this lucky egg will be exactly the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.660
 same procedure one of two you 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.640
 we remove the object with theft or what 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.230
 weakened what we capture rather said already 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.090
 then we take it off that it really is 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.610
 easy enough either of the two 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.260
 examples that I am commenting on as 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.450
 I told them something they have to have in 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.910
 account and that will help them a lot 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.440
 bring some pokemon with compound eye 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.780
 as my live what I bring in this 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.310
 once lived as this makes it 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.710
 increase the probability that the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.210
 pokemon carry object another thing that 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.460
 they have to know about this peri erez 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.830
 that the pokemon can appear with three 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.420
 objects if I'm not wrong feather beautiful 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.310
 lucky egg that I think is the most 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.020
 difficult and last rope or life 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.130
 it really is quite easy this 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.930
 procedure and I think that 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.970
 it will help a lot since eggs luck 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.100
 it helps us with a lot of experience to 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.230
 our pokémon so it really is 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.880
 pretty good but good here we go to 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.860
 capture this danger which which 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.660
 I had the lucky egg and I hope that 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.160
 I really liked this tutorial and if 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.380
 they liked it, forget to destroy this 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.310
 button I like and hopefully in support 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:31.010
 we can achieve what would be the 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.260
 three hundred 300 I like you for this 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.260
 video see you until the next friends 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
 goodbye
