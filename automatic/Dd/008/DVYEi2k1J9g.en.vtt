yes<00:00:38.399> well<00:00:38.760> morally<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> don't<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:40.020> don't<00:00:40.559> think

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
yes well morally I don't I don't think

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.110 
yes well morally I don't I don't think
it<00:00:40.860> good<00:00:41.219> or<00:00:41.340> bad<00:00:41.370> I

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
it good or bad I

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.880 
it good or bad I
it's<00:00:42.899> what<00:00:43.079> seems<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.410> happening<00:00:43.469> at<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
it's what seems to be happening at the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.279 
it's what seems to be happening at the
moment<00:00:44.570> technology<00:00:45.570> often<00:00:45.840> writes<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> rules

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
moment technology often writes the rules

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.569 
moment technology often writes the rules
as<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.620> goes<00:00:46.739> along<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.489> to

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
as it goes along and we just have to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.740 
as it goes along and we just have to
catch<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.030> it

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
catch up with it

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.510 
catch up with it
there<00:00:49.289> were<00:00:49.350> behemoths<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> Industrial

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
there were behemoths in the Industrial

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.510 
there were behemoths in the Industrial
Age<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.910> fell<00:00:51.059> by<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.180> wayside<00:00:51.410> because

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
Age that fell by the wayside because

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.650 
Age that fell by the wayside because
everything<00:00:53.520> modernized<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.390> think<00:00:54.570> we're

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
everything modernized and I think we're

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.139 
everything modernized and I think we're
experiencing<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.260> again<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:56.219> certainly

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
experiencing that again I certainly

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.670 
experiencing that again I certainly
think<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.570> difficult<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:57.960> bands<00:00:58.379> when<00:00:58.559> they

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
think it's difficult for bands when they

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.639 
think it's difficult for bands when they
weigh<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> side<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.750> music

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
weigh in on the side of the music

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.889 
weigh in on the side of the music
industry<00:01:02.070> they<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.090> get<00:01:03.300> tainted<00:01:03.570> by<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
industry they then get tainted by that

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.109 
industry they then get tainted by that
we<00:01:04.439> look<00:01:04.559> at<00:01:04.680> Metallica<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.549> other<00:01:05.909> bands

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
we look at Metallica and other bands

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.149 
we look at Metallica and other bands
extraordinarily<00:01:06.780> good<00:01:07.260> bands<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:08.070> have

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
extraordinarily good bands that have

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.500 
extraordinarily good bands that have
been<00:01:08.189> come<00:01:08.460> slightly<00:01:08.700> tainted<00:01:08.939> by<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.270> fact

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
been come slightly tainted by the fact

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.690 
been come slightly tainted by the fact
that<00:01:09.540> they've<00:01:09.750> demanded<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.340> know

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
that they've demanded that you know

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.039 
that they've demanded that you know
their<00:01:11.850> fans<00:01:12.030> don't<00:01:12.299> download<00:01:12.630> them<00:01:12.840> from<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
their fans don't download them from the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.530 
their fans don't download them from the
internet<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.650> think<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.130> happening<00:01:14.390> it's<00:01:15.390> how

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
internet I think it's happening it's how

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.760 
internet I think it's happening it's how
we're<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.110> deal<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.530> there'll<00:01:16.710> be

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
we're going to deal with it there'll be

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.770 
we're going to deal with it there'll be
interesting<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.759> mean<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> record<00:01:18.270> companies

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
interesting I mean the record companies

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.719 
interesting I mean the record companies
are<00:01:18.810> certainly<00:01:19.200> losing<00:01:19.590> out<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.430> isn't<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
are certainly losing out it isn't the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.190 
are certainly losing out it isn't the
money<00:01:20.820> now<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> telcos<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
money now just going to the telcos and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.780 
money now just going to the telcos and
once<00:01:22.650> again<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.009> songwriters<00:01:23.520> are<00:01:23.610> getting

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
once again the songwriters are getting

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.910 
once again the songwriters are getting
left<00:01:23.970> out<00:01:24.180> well<00:01:24.840> yeah<00:01:25.200> suppose<00:01:25.590> although<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
left out well yeah suppose although I

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.350 
left out well yeah suppose although I
think<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.130> telcos<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.060> know<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
think that telcos have to know the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.319 
think that telcos have to know the
telcos<00:01:27.689> are<00:01:27.720> evil<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.290> don't<00:01:28.619> know<00:01:28.680> if<00:01:28.770> you

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329
