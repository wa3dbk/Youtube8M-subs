once you get the main a format for the

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.879 
once you get the main a format for the
program's<00:04:01.150> it's<00:04:01.540> pretty<00:04:01.900> gets<00:04:02.229> easier<00:04:02.680> as<00:04:02.859> you

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
program's it's pretty gets easier as you

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.849 
program's it's pretty gets easier as you
go<00:04:03.009> along<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:04.239> then<00:04:04.569> i<00:04:04.719> have<00:04:04.900> my<00:04:04.930> dreamweaver
