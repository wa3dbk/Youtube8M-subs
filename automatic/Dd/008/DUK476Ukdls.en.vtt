00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
just like we did with lego harry potter

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.879 
just like we did with lego harry potter
of<00:02:29.689> course<00:02:29.959> we've<00:02:30.290> shown<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.590> guys

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
differences between this and some of the

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.800 
differences between this and some of the
previous<00:02:36.170> titles<00:02:36.769> are<00:02:36.920> obviously<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.209> battle

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
previous titles are obviously the battle

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.379

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
system that'll be shown later in some of

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:42.879 
system that'll be shown later in some of
the<00:02:41.480> bigger<00:02:41.659> levels<00:02:42.049> we<00:02:42.169> have<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.439> go<00:02:42.590> through

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:42.889 
the bigger levels we have to go through

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.830 
the bigger levels we have to go through
and<00:02:43.040> take<00:02:43.249> over<00:02:43.459> bases<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.299> then<00:02:44.389> call<00:02:44.659> in

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
and take over bases and then call in

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.740 
and take over bases and then call in
units<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.439> stuff<00:02:45.680> like<00:02:45.889> that<00:02:45.950> but<00:02:46.849> you<00:02:47.719> know

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
units and stuff like that but you know

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.280 
units and stuff like that but you know
in<00:02:48.169> general<00:02:48.379> it<00:02:48.709> just<00:02:49.189> seems<00:02:49.430> like<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.120> um<00:02:50.510> you
