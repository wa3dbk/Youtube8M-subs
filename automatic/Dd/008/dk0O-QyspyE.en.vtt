15 years or so and the last big guy that

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.670 
15 years or so and the last big guy that
we<00:01:09.370> see<00:01:09.700> we<00:01:09.910> saw<00:01:10.150> was<00:01:10.750> Dorian<00:01:11.170> Yates<00:01:11.350> and<00:01:11.560> he

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
we see we saw was Dorian Yates and he

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.250 
we see we saw was Dorian Yates and he
thinks<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.730> advent<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.480> big<00:01:13.720> Graeme<00:01:13.990> is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
thinks that the advent of big Graeme is

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.950 
thinks that the advent of big Graeme is
even<00:01:14.950> bigger<00:01:15.190> than<00:01:15.580> that<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:16.120> Dorian<00:01:16.720> Yates

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
even bigger than that of Dorian Yates

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.620 
even bigger than that of Dorian Yates
right<00:01:17.380> of<00:01:18.220> course<00:01:18.520> he<00:01:18.580> is<00:01:18.730> competing<00:01:19.030> he<00:01:19.510> was

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
right of course he is competing he was

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.020 
right of course he is competing he was
computed<00:01:19.990> back<00:01:20.410> in<00:01:20.620> the<00:01:20.770> 90s<00:01:21.190> vs.<00:01:21.580> Yates<00:01:21.850> and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
computed back in the 90s vs. Yates and

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.180 
computed back in the 90s vs. Yates and
never<00:01:22.270> was<00:01:22.510> able<00:01:22.690> to<00:01:22.870> beat<00:01:23.170> him<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:24.040> I<00:01:24.130> think

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
never was able to beat him and I think

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.300 
never was able to beat him and I think
he<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:24.520> referring<00:01:25.120> to<00:01:25.150> Dorian<00:01:25.600> knees<00:01:25.780> in<00:01:26.310> 1993
