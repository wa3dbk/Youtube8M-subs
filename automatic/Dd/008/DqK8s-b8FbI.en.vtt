several<00:00:41.340> types<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.850> holders<00:00:43.129> supports<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
several types of holders supports on the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.590 
several types of holders supports on the
market<00:00:45.860> this<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:46.920> one<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.219> them<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.270> make

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
market this is one of them and just make

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.049 
market this is one of them and just make
sure<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.780> put<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> right<00:00:49.530> direction<00:00:53.059> but

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
sure I put it in the right direction but

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.270 
sure I put it in the right direction but
I<00:00:54.440> must<00:00:55.440> say<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.949> my<00:00:56.340> point<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.730> view<00:00:57.199> rather

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
I must say in my point of view rather

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.860 
I must say in my point of view rather
bulky<00:00:59.300> yeah<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.260> would<00:01:01.440> put<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.010> yeah

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
bulky yeah and you would put the yeah

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.179 
bulky yeah and you would put the yeah
the<00:01:03.870> star<00:01:04.199> light<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.890> case<00:01:05.960> as<00:01:06.960> such<00:01:07.350> yes

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the star light in this case as such yes

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.649 
the star light in this case as such yes
it's<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.700> actually<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> right<00:01:09.360> size<00:01:09.630> for

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it's not actually the right size for

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.830 
it's not actually the right size for
this<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> idea<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.689> what

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
this one but you get the idea of what

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.380 
this one but you get the idea of what
I'm<00:01:12.930> talking<00:01:13.110> about<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.650> there<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
I'm talking about but there is a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.950 
I'm talking about but there is a
possibility<00:01:15.619> if<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:16.920> probability<00:01:17.759> of

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
possibility if not probability of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.859 
possibility if not probability of
actually<00:01:18.960> snagging<00:01:19.950> when<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> cast<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.270> this

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
actually snagging when you cast and this

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.539 
actually snagging when you cast and this
or<00:01:22.140> everything<00:01:22.619> would<00:01:22.920> break<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:24.259> I<00:01:25.549> really

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
or everything would break and I really

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.450 
or everything would break and I really
don't<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.880> them<00:01:27.150> yup<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.130> don't<00:01:29.130> recommend

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
don't like them yup so I don't recommend

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.460 
don't like them yup so I don't recommend
them<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.320> that's<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:31.860> type<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.030> buy

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
them so that's one type that you can buy

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.660 
them so that's one type that you can buy
another<00:01:34.470> time<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:34.979> buy<00:01:35.130> sexually

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
another time you can buy sexually

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.179 
another time you can buy sexually
electric<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.750> has<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> battery<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.009> which

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
electric it has a battery in it which

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.660 
electric it has a battery in it which
I'll<00:01:38.340> show<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.759> minute<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:40.579> this<00:01:41.579> is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
I'll show you in a minute and this is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.639 
I'll show you in a minute and this is
the<00:01:41.729> same<00:01:41.939> system<00:01:42.210> basically<00:01:43.909> again<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.649> would

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the same system basically again I would

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.179 
the same system basically again I would
not<00:01:46.860> recommend<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.759> system<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.009> what<00:01:50.009> would

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
not recommend this system and what would

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.389 
not recommend this system and what would
happen<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.630> push<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.770> bottom<00:01:53.100> part

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
happen here is as I push the bottom part

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.450 
happen here is as I push the bottom part
it<00:01:54.149> would<00:01:54.390> light<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:56.009> light<00:01:56.189> there

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
it would light up the the light there

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.389 
it would light up the the light there
which<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:57.149> actually<00:01:57.659> lit<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.920> can't<00:01:59.189> see

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
which is actually lit but you can't see

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
which is actually lit but you can't see
it<00:01:59.520> because<00:01:59.700> of<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> lots<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.110> flash<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
it because of the lots of flash of the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.719 
it because of the lots of flash of the
camera<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:04.530> would<00:02:04.740> disconnect<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.549> in

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
camera and you would disconnect it in

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.330 
camera and you would disconnect it in
the<00:02:05.850> same<00:02:06.060> way<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:07.020> has<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.950> type<00:02:08.310> of

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the same way and it has this type of

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.770 
the same way and it has this type of
battery<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.599> it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
battery in it

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.570 
battery in it
it's<00:02:09.929> all

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.940 

water<00:02:13.180> tight<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.010> doesn't<00:02:15.100> get

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
water tight so that it doesn't get

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.060 
water tight so that it doesn't get
doesn't<00:02:17.950> get<00:02:18.220> damaged<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.880> any<00:02:19.030> way<00:02:19.210> but<00:02:19.780> as<00:02:20.080> I

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
doesn't get damaged in any way but as I

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.930 
doesn't get damaged in any way but as I
say<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:22.650> probability<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.680> snagging<00:02:24.640> when<00:02:24.820> you

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
say the probability of snagging when you

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.100 
say the probability of snagging when you
cast<00:02:25.240> as<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:26.590> see<00:02:26.740> it's<00:02:26.860> rather<00:02:26.980> bulky<00:02:27.340> is

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
cast as you can see it's rather bulky is

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.210 
cast as you can see it's rather bulky is
it's<00:02:29.110> very<00:02:29.170> high<00:02:29.590> no<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:31.150> other<00:02:31.300> type<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:33.160> a

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
it's very high no the other type is a

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.440 
it's very high no the other type is a
much<00:02:33.550> simpler<00:02:34.060> type<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:36.640> must<00:02:37.090> say<00:02:37.240> out<00:02:37.420> of

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
much simpler type and I must say out of

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.120 
much simpler type and I must say out of
all<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.990> beholders<00:02:38.850> available<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:41.620> would

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
all the beholders available this would

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.390 
all the beholders available this would
be<00:02:42.390> my<00:02:43.390> favorite<00:02:43.780> if<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:45.040> were<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.520> use<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:45.910> and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
be my favorite if I were to use it and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.830 
be my favorite if I were to use it and
that<00:02:48.400> would<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:49.030> know<00:02:49.150> it's<00:02:49.300> quite<00:02:49.450> simple<00:02:49.780> to

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
that would you know it's quite simple to

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.240 
that would you know it's quite simple to
put<00:02:50.050> on<00:02:50.170> there<00:02:50.380> very<00:02:50.560> cheap<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:53.230> not<00:02:54.040> as

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
put on there very cheap and it's not as

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.980 
put on there very cheap and it's not as
bulky<00:02:54.610> as<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.300> other<00:02:55.420> ones<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.400> therefore

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
bulky as the other ones and therefore

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.260 
bulky as the other ones and therefore
less<00:02:58.990> chance<00:02:59.680> of<00:02:59.950> snagging<00:03:00.880> but<00:03:01.060> there's

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
less chance of snagging but there's

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
less chance of snagging but there's
still<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.600> very<00:03:01.930> large<00:03:03.390> chance<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.840> snagging

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
still a very large chance of snagging

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.230 
still a very large chance of snagging
when<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.740> cast<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.460> everything<00:03:06.640> would<00:03:07.000> break

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
when you cast and everything would break

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.710 
when you cast and everything would break
you<00:03:08.110> know<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.710> I<00:03:09.010> don't<00:03:09.460> like<00:03:09.670> any<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.270> these

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
you know so I don't like any of these

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.630 
you know so I don't like any of these
systems<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:12.370> system<00:03:12.820> that<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.210> prefer<00:03:13.720> is<00:03:14.640> a

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
systems the system that I prefer is a

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.470 
systems the system that I prefer is a
homemade<00:03:16.270> system<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:18.430> you're<00:03:18.970> going<00:03:19.240> to<00:03:19.300> see

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
homemade system and you're going to see

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.440 
homemade system and you're going to see
it<00:03:19.600> better<00:03:19.810> in<00:03:19.960> the<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.650> photograph<00:03:21.160> but

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
it better in the in the photograph but

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.350 
it better in the in the photograph but
basically<00:03:22.450> what<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.690> do<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.970> actually<00:03:25.920> wind

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
basically what I do is I actually wind

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.970 
basically what I do is I actually wind
the<00:03:28.360> tube<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:29.350> comes<00:03:29.620> with<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.550> Starlight

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
the tube that comes with the Starlight

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.800 
the tube that comes with the Starlight
yes<00:03:32.980> with<00:03:33.280> which<00:03:33.520> comes<00:03:33.790> with<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.030> little<00:03:34.600> tip

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
yes with which comes with the little tip

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.300 
yes with which comes with the little tip
globe<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:37.150> wind<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:38.140> as<00:03:38.350> if<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:38.860> were<00:03:39.040> a

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
globe and I wind it as if it were a

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.910 
globe and I wind it as if it were a
guide<00:03:39.700> in<00:03:40.270> exactly<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.050> same<00:03:41.110> way<00:03:41.440> as<00:03:41.590> if<00:03:41.740> it

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
guide in exactly the same way as if it

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.160 
guide in exactly the same way as if it
were<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.100> guide<00:03:42.430> so<00:03:43.090> when<00:03:43.300> I'm<00:03:43.420> not<00:03:43.600> using<00:03:43.870> it

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
were a guide so when I'm not using it

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.760 
were a guide so when I'm not using it
it's<00:03:44.610> not<00:03:45.610> going<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.060> snag<00:03:46.360> even<00:03:46.840> if<00:03:46.960> the<00:03:47.230> line

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
it's not going to snag even if the line

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.390 
it's not going to snag even if the line
goes<00:03:48.100> over<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.460> top<00:03:48.490> of<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.150> will<00:03:49.180> not<00:03:49.510> snag

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
goes over the top of it it will not snag

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.160 
goes over the top of it it will not snag
and<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:51.610> well<00:03:51.790> placed<00:03:52.060> never<00:03:52.450> snagged<00:03:52.870> for

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
and it's well placed never snagged for

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.200 
and it's well placed never snagged for
me<00:03:53.290> anyway<00:03:53.740> and<00:03:53.950> it<00:03:54.490> holds<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:55.440> glow<00:03:56.440> light

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
me anyway and it holds the glow light

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.760 
me anyway and it holds the glow light
perfectly<00:03:58.210> well<00:03:58.860> yeah<00:03:59.860> so<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:00.370> get<00:04:00.700> your<00:04:01.770> when

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
perfectly well yeah so you get your when

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.440 
perfectly well yeah so you get your when
you<00:04:03.730> get<00:04:03.910> your<00:04:04.090> bite<00:04:04.330> you<00:04:05.320> know<00:04:05.770> it<00:04:06.270> tells<00:04:07.270> you

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
you get your bite you know it tells you

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.630 
you get your bite you know it tells you
very<00:04:07.480> well<00:04:07.840> that<00:04:08.050> but<00:04:08.230> something<00:04:08.620> there<00:04:08.860> on

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
very well that but something there on

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.630 
very well that but something there on
the<00:04:09.910> end<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.360> of<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.959> line<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:12.010> know<00:04:12.070> now

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
the end of the of the line you know now

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.240 
the end of the of the line you know now
the<00:04:12.700> way<00:04:12.880> to<00:04:12.910> do<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.390> is<00:04:13.950> it's<00:04:14.950> actually

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
the way to do that is it's actually

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.190 
the way to do that is it's actually
quite<00:04:15.459> simple

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
quite simple

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.170 
quite simple
you<00:04:17.200> have<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.440> practice<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:18.010> bit<00:04:18.190> too<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:19.000> learn

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
you have to practice a bit too to learn

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.080 
you have to practice a bit too to learn
how<00:04:19.330> to<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:20.200> wind<00:04:20.500> but<00:04:21.370> it's<00:04:21.609> not<00:04:21.820> that<00:04:21.970> you're

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
how to to wind but it's not that you're

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.340 
how to to wind but it's not that you're
good<00:04:22.210> at<00:04:22.300> all

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
good at all

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.890 
good at all
what<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:23.890> do

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
what you do

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.370 
what you do
YouTube<00:04:27.389> generally<00:04:28.389> comes<00:04:28.660> in<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.020> packet

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
YouTube generally comes in the packet

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.719 
YouTube generally comes in the packet
with<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:30.360> tip<00:04:31.360> close<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:33.340> make<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.759> cut

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
with the tip close and you make a cut

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.430 
with the tip close and you make a cut
along<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:37.750> tube<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.639> then<00:04:39.639> to<00:04:39.880> smaller<00:04:40.539> much

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
along the tube and then to smaller much

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.050 
along the tube and then to smaller much
smaller<00:04:41.470> cuts<00:04:43.320> at<00:04:44.320> right<00:04:44.889> angles<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:45.729> the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
smaller cuts at right angles to the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.920 
smaller cuts at right angles to the
first<00:04:46.479> cut<00:04:47.050> on<00:04:47.320> either<00:04:47.800> side<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:50.500> tube

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
first cut on either side of the tube

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.159 
first cut on either side of the tube
now<00:04:52.930> very<00:04:53.139> light<00:04:53.289> at<00:04:53.440> all<00:04:53.590> but<00:04:53.860> by<00:04:54.009> small<00:04:54.310> we

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
now very light at all but by small we

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.939 
now very light at all but by small we
don't<00:04:56.169> want<00:04:56.320> to<00:04:56.500> cut<00:04:56.949> too<00:04:57.130> much<00:04:58.740> just<00:04:59.740> enough

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
don't want to cut too much just enough

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:06.120 
don't want to cut too much just enough
so<00:05:00.669> that<00:05:00.699> it<00:05:00.850> it<00:05:01.360> can<00:05:01.570> spread<00:05:02.169> and<00:05:02.669> open<00:05:03.669> up<00:05:05.130> and

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
so that it it can spread and open up and

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.409 
so that it it can spread and open up and
then<00:05:06.460> what<00:05:06.639> you<00:05:06.760> would<00:05:06.880> do<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.389> you<00:05:07.930> would

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
then what you would do is you would

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.439 
then what you would do is you would
place<00:05:10.419> it<00:05:10.720> on<00:05:11.289> your<00:05:11.669> onion<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:12.789> tip<00:05:13.030> of<00:05:13.330> your

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
place it on your onion the tip of your

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.820 
place it on your onion the tip of your
rod<00:05:13.840> and<00:05:15.510> you<00:05:16.510> can<00:05:16.690> hold<00:05:16.990> it<00:05:17.110> in<00:05:17.229> position<00:05:17.349> with

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
rod and you can hold it in position with

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.600 
rod and you can hold it in position with
some<00:05:18.039> kind<00:05:18.280> of<00:05:18.400> tape<00:05:18.669> and<00:05:19.260> then<00:05:20.260> as<00:05:20.470> I<00:05:20.919> say<00:05:21.099> you

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
some kind of tape and then as I say you

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.670 
some kind of tape and then as I say you
wind<00:05:21.970> it<00:05:22.270> on<00:05:22.680> as<00:05:23.680> if<00:05:23.949> you<00:05:24.099> were<00:05:24.250> winding<00:05:24.580> a

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
wind it on as if you were winding a

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.439 
wind it on as if you were winding a
guide<00:05:26.680> and<00:05:27.720> for<00:05:28.720> me<00:05:28.870> that<00:05:29.110> is<00:05:29.440> by<00:05:30.190> far<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:30.910> best

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
guide and for me that is by far the best

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.310 
guide and for me that is by far the best
system<00:05:32.199> even<00:05:32.710> if<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:34.270> lion<00:05:34.510> goes<00:05:34.900> over<00:05:35.199> the

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
system even if the lion goes over the
