00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.479 
and just in case you're wondering if
it's<00:02:08.970> going<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.330> between<00:02:10.080> 1<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.039> 30<00:02:11.250> no

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
it's going to be between 1 and 30 no

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.210 
it's going to be between 1 and 30 no
it's<00:02:11.700> actually<00:02:11.879> like<00:02:12.420> you

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
it's actually like you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.430 
it's actually like you
number<00:02:13.580> one<00:02:13.940> could<00:02:14.240> win<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.080> doesn't<00:02:15.350> need

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
number one could win so it doesn't need

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.280 
number one could win so it doesn't need
to<00:02:15.500> be<00:02:15.560> between<00:02:15.890> zero<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.400> 31<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:18.020> for

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
to be between zero and 31 so for

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.870 
to be between zero and 31 so for
instance<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.900> show<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.140> here<00:02:21.410> between<00:02:22.040> one

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
instance you show you here between one

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.820 
instance you show you here between one
and<00:02:22.910> two<00:02:23.270> it's<00:02:23.540> not<00:02:23.720> actually<00:02:24.110> between<00:02:24.500> one

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
and two it's not actually between one

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.120 
and two it's not actually between one
and<00:02:24.860> two<00:02:25.100> it's<00:02:25.340> actually<00:02:26.590> one<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.800> two<00:02:27.950> or

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
and two it's actually one and two or

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.550 
and two it's actually one and two or
anything<00:02:28.430> between<00:02:28.550> see<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:29.180> even<00:02:29.420> be<00:02:29.600> one

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
anything between see it can even be one

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.920 
anything between see it can even be one
so<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:32.240> works<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.750> way<00:02:32.960> and<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.690> won't<00:02:35.870> be

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
so that works that way and so won't be

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.360 
so that works that way and so won't be
to<00:02:36.230> hear<00:02:36.530> all<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.800> time<00:02:36.830> let's<00:02:37.220> see<00:02:37.370> what<00:02:39.370> so

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
to hear all the time let's see what so

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.430 
to hear all the time let's see what so
yeah<00:02:40.610> there<00:02:41.060> see<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.720> can<00:02:41.810> be<00:02:41.900> three<00:02:42.170> as<00:02:42.260> well

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
yeah there see it can be three as well

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.740 
yeah there see it can be three as well
so<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.680> won't<00:02:42.860> always<00:02:43.010> be<00:02:43.160> too<00:02:43.580> but<00:02:44.480> I'm<00:02:44.720> a

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
so it won't always be too but I'm a

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.370 
so it won't always be too but I'm a
anyway<00:02:46.209> that's<00:02:47.209> how<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.450> works<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:48.200> I'm

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
anyway that's how that works and I'm

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.540 
anyway that's how that works and I'm
going<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.530> be<00:02:48.620> doing<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.860> Lego<00:02:49.040> gift<00:02:49.310> card
