this person that you got clean from the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.030 
this person that you got clean from the
US<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.009> have<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.880> guess<00:01:36.600> which<00:01:37.439> picture

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
US so you have to guess which picture

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.749 
US so you have to guess which picture
chip<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.729> under<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.840> grid<00:01:40.049> cover<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.430> have

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
chip is under the grid cover so you have

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.319 
chip is under the grid cover so you have
to<00:01:41.909> say<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.890> guess<00:01:44.960> under<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.229> green<00:01:46.470> cover

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
to say I guess under the green cover

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.010 
to say I guess under the green cover
there<00:01:48.329> might<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:49.049> parrot<00:01:50.040> then<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.750> can

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
there might be a parrot then you can

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.370 
there might be a parrot then you can
lift<00:01:52.680> up<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.579> grid<00:01:53.820> cover<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.390> check<00:01:54.810> whether

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
lift up the grid cover and check whether

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.700 
lift up the grid cover and check whether
your<00:01:55.680> answer<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.219> correct<00:01:56.250> or<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:58.530> answer

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
your answer is correct or not the answer

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.580 
your answer is correct or not the answer
is<00:01:58.920> correct

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
is correct

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.330 
is correct
the<00:02:00.159> power<00:02:00.460> is<00:02:00.759> under<00:02:01.509> threat<00:02:02.020> of<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.590> red

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
the power is under threat of the red

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.149 
the power is under threat of the red
cover<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:03.909> you<00:02:04.210> can<00:02:04.840> have<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.560> power<00:02:05.770> curve

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
cover so you can have the power curve

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.050 
cover so you can have the power curve
and<00:02:06.399> move<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:08.440> green<00:02:08.679> cover<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.340> place<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:10.590> on

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and move the green cover and place it on

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.570 
and move the green cover and place it on
another<00:02:13.060> picture<00:02:13.840> check<00:02:14.140> then<00:02:14.860> plane<00:02:15.280> works

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
another picture check then plane works

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.460 
another picture check then plane works
to<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.030> next<00:02:16.330> person<00:02:16.750> next<00:02:18.900> person<00:02:19.900> also<00:02:20.290> got

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
to the next person next person also got

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.170 
to the next person next person also got
the<00:02:21.220> green<00:02:21.519> so<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.510> person<00:02:22.810> can<00:02:23.230> guess<00:02:24.180> what

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
the green so this person can guess what

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.460 
the green so this person can guess what
it<00:02:25.450> s<00:02:25.870> under<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.739> black<00:02:26.950> cover<00:02:28.050> but<00:02:29.050> they<00:02:29.260> this

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
it s under the black cover but they this

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.350 
it s under the black cover but they this
person<00:02:30.930> couldn't<00:02:31.930> get<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.319> correct<00:02:32.650> answer<00:02:33.250> I

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.630 

cast<00:02:37.360> under<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:40.120> green<00:02:41.019> cover<00:02:41.739> there<00:02:42.340> might

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
cast under the green cover there might

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.539 
cast under the green cover there might
be<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.850> tree<00:02:43.239> then<00:02:43.840> lift<00:02:44.110> up<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:45.069> cover<00:02:45.250> and

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
be a tree then lift up the cover and

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.809 
be a tree then lift up the cover and
check<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.299> answer<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:47.260> answer<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.980> incorrect

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
check the answer the answer is incorrect

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.190 
check the answer the answer is incorrect
so<00:02:49.480> he<00:02:50.260> has<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.769> return<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.459> cover<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
so he has to return the cover on the

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.809 
so he has to return the cover on the
original<00:02:53.680> place<00:02:54.630> if<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:56.080> got<00:02:56.319> sucker<00:02:57.280> from

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
original place if you got sucker from
