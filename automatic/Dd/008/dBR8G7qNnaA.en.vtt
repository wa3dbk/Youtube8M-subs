however<00:03:23.470> because<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:24.070> back<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.310> somewhat

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
however because the back is somewhat

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.150 
however because the back is somewhat
difficult<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.239> do<00:03:25.390> that<00:03:25.709> it's<00:03:26.709> easier<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:29.160> do

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
difficult to do that it's easier to do

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.600 
difficult to do that it's easier to do
it<00:03:30.280> via<00:03:30.400> bluetooth<00:03:30.910> or<00:03:31.180> via<00:03:31.540> cable<00:03:32.640> no<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:35.610> this

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
it via bluetooth or via cable no so this

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.100 
it via bluetooth or via cable no so this
phone<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.959> comes<00:03:38.290> with<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.590> believe<00:03:38.739> one<00:03:40.110> one

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
phone it comes with I believe one one

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.130 
phone it comes with I believe one one
game<00:03:43.860> which<00:03:44.860> is<00:03:45.040> called<00:03:45.340> Lux<00:03:45.640> or<00:03:45.850> quest<00:03:46.329> it

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
game which is called Lux or quest it

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.080 
game which is called Lux or quest it
also<00:03:47.320> has<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.709> ability<00:03:47.769> to<00:03:48.160> run<00:03:48.370> app<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:48.970> you

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
also has the ability to run app so you

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.840 
also has the ability to run app so you
can<00:03:49.239> see<00:03:49.390> have<00:03:49.739> downloaded<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:51.220> Google<00:03:51.640> Maps
