I<00:01:57.490> think<00:01:58.000> these<00:01:58.090> toverland<00:01:58.539> coming<00:01:59.050> through

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
I think these toverland coming through

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.109 
I think these toverland coming through
this<00:01:59.470> is<00:01:59.649> outstanding<00:01:59.979> disease<00:02:00.700> do<00:02:00.940> you<00:02:01.030> no

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
this is outstanding disease do you no

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.219 
this is outstanding disease do you no
wonder<00:02:01.360> they<00:02:01.450> got<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.600> shield<00:02:01.810> does<00:02:02.020> these

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
wonder they got the shield does these

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.510 
wonder they got the shield does these
boys<00:02:02.440> they<00:02:02.979> can't<00:02:03.220> know<00:02:03.520> how<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.700> get<00:02:03.789> through

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
boys they can't know how to get through

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.370 
boys they can't know how to get through
and<00:02:06.520> they<00:02:06.610> made<00:02:06.789> 69<00:02:07.420> tackles<00:02:07.929> in<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.140> first

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
and they made 69 tackles in the first

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.040 
and they made 69 tackles in the first
half<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.830> think<00:02:08.910> his<00:02:09.910> Rutledge<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.509> was<00:02:10.690> again

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
half I think his Rutledge it was again

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.960 
half I think his Rutledge it was again
and<00:02:11.319> another<00:02:11.560> reason<00:02:11.860> why<00:02:12.310> there<00:02:12.580> wasn't<00:02:12.849> too

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
and another reason why there wasn't too

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.880 
and another reason why there wasn't too
