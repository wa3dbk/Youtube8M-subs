00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
out by making another protein shake

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.609 
out by making another protein shake
video<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:24.269> lot<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.510> people<00:00:24.630> know<00:00:25.050> me<00:00:25.590> as

video and a lot of people know me as

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.960 
video and a lot of people know me as
uncle<00:00:25.859> Jason<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.460> we're<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.789> call<00:00:26.939> this

uncle Jason's post-workout power shake

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.700 
uncle Jason's post-workout power shake
and<00:00:30.210> there's<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.810> reason<00:00:30.960> why<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.410> call<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
10 ounces 10 to 12 ounces of milk we'll

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.810 
10 ounces 10 to 12 ounces of milk we'll
start<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:59.300> and<00:01:00.320> next<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.590> will

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
start out with that and next I will

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.280 
start out with that and next I will
throw<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> banana<00:01:05.479> now<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.659> protein<00:01:07.080> shake

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
throw in a banana now this protein shake

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.899 
throw in a banana now this protein shake
is<00:01:07.470> obviously<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.580> high<00:01:08.729> in

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
is obviously it's going to be high in

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.149 
is obviously it's going to be high in
protein<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> be<00:01:10.740> high<00:01:10.950> in

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
protein and it's going to be high in

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.090 
protein and it's going to be high in
carbohydrates<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.229> back<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.710> power

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
carbohydrates and back to the power

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.740 
carbohydrates and back to the power
section<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> shake<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> reason<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.540> call

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
section of the shake the reason I call

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.740 
section of the shake the reason I call
it<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> power<00:01:16.049> shake<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:17.210> because<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.540> is

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it a power shake is because this is

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.020 
it a power shake is because this is
going<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.110> also<00:01:19.439> loaded<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> lot<00:01:21.000> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
going to be also loaded with a lot of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.300 
going to be also loaded with a lot of
recovery<00:01:21.570> agents<00:01:22.140> as<00:01:22.680> well<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> lot<00:01:23.220> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
recovery agents as well as a lot of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.910 
recovery agents as well as a lot of
antioxidants<00:01:24.290> I'm<00:01:25.290> getting<00:01:25.470> these<00:01:25.650> little

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
antioxidants I'm getting these little

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.620 
antioxidants I'm getting these little
things<00:01:25.950> off<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.549> banana<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> hate

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
things off the banana here and I hate

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.649 
things off the banana here and I hate
that<00:01:27.780> don't<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:29.150> alright<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.299> good<00:01:30.479> enough

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that don't you alright it's good enough

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.940 
that don't you alright it's good enough
so<00:01:31.409> we're<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.979> go<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.759> banana<00:01:33.060> end

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
so we're going to go to the banana end

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.810 
so we're going to go to the banana end
but<00:01:34.950> I'm<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> see<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:35.400> you're<00:01:35.610> opposed

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
but I'm going to see if you're opposed

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.069 
but I'm going to see if you're opposed
to<00:01:35.909> work<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.329> know<00:01:36.360> recoveries<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
to work out you know recoveries and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.960 
to work out you know recoveries and
poured<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:38.130> protein<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.909> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
poured it so your protein is going to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
poured it so your protein is going to
come<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.479> handle<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.500> I've<00:01:40.619> also

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
come in and handle that but I've also

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.140 
come in and handle that but I've also
got<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> lot<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> ingredients<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.909> this

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
got a lot of ingredients here this

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.069 
got a lot of ingredients here this
they're<00:01:42.390> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.659> loaded<00:01:43.049> with

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
they're going to be loaded with

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.870 
they're going to be loaded with
antioxidants<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.490> think<00:01:44.700> that's

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
antioxidants and I think that's

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149 
antioxidants and I think that's
important<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.509> recovery<00:01:46.020> as<00:01:46.170> well<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.680> also

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
important for recovery as well and also

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.850 
important for recovery as well and also
to<00:01:47.399> build<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.670> your<00:01:47.700> immune<00:01:48.030> system<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:48.960> got

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
milk we got a banana you'll see next let

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.380 
milk we got a banana you'll see next let
me<00:01:53.640> grab<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.880> spoon<00:01:54.240> here<00:01:54.509> real<00:01:54.659> quick

that was in the early nineties and guess
what<00:04:43.860> it<00:04:44.010> still<00:04:44.310> works<00:04:44.580> well<00:04:44.790> today<00:04:45.060> so<00:04:45.570> most

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350
