00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
something which I didn't really see why

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.840 
something which I didn't really see why
but<00:00:38.840> it's<00:00:39.840> good<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.559> see<00:00:40.770> Ryback<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.309> know<00:00:41.520> get

the<00:00:42.030> win<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> think<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.960> smart<00:00:43.140> decision

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the win I think it's a smart decision

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.680 
the win I think it's a smart decision
for<00:00:44.160> right<00:00:44.850> back<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.210> retain<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
for right back to retain the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.830 
for right back to retain the
championship<00:00:46.100> as<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.280> predicted<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:48.059> didn't

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
championship as I predicted I didn't

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.540 
championship as I predicted I didn't
want<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> mr.<00:00:49.530> when<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.890> think<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.340> big

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
want the mr. when and I think the big

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.670 
want the mr. when and I think the big
show<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.239> wouldn't<00:00:51.989> lead<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.410> anything

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
show that just wouldn't lead to anything

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.860 
show that just wouldn't lead to anything
I<00:00:53.070> think<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:53.640> need<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.000> carry<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.539> right

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
I think that they need to carry on right

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.500
