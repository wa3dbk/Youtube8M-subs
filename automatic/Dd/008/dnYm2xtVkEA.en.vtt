remain that way okay how do we do this

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.880 
remain that way okay how do we do this
do<00:01:23.060> we<00:01:23.150> get<00:01:23.360> even<00:01:23.570> more<00:01:23.960> cubes<00:01:24.320> on<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.470> table

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
do we get even more cubes on the table

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.060 
do we get even more cubes on the table
this<00:01:25.040> time<00:01:25.280> no<00:01:25.820> there<00:01:26.720> are<00:01:26.840> only<00:01:27.070> three

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
this time no there are only three

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.719 
this time no there are only three
positions<00:01:29.080> we<00:01:30.080> have<00:01:30.200> this<00:01:30.770> position<00:01:31.310> which

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
positions we have this position which

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.000 
positions we have this position which
will<00:01:31.909> be<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.090> soft<00:01:32.420> State<00:01:32.750> case<00:01:33.320> if<00:01:33.619> you<00:01:33.830> get

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
will be the soft State case if you get

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.630 
will be the soft State case if you get
this<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.930> same<00:01:36.170> color<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:36.770> same<00:01:36.799> color<00:01:37.280> the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
this the same color the same color the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.580 
this the same color the same color the
same<00:01:37.670> color<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.510> same<00:01:38.930> color<00:01:39.350> on<00:01:39.470> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
same color and the same color on the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.160 
same color and the same color on the
corners<00:01:40.040> you<00:01:40.790> are<00:01:40.909> done<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:41.390> can<00:01:41.420> skip<00:01:42.020> to

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
corners you are done you can skip to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.700 
corners you are done you can skip to
skip<00:01:42.409> eight<00:01:42.619> very<00:01:43.250> lucky<00:01:44.500> there<00:01:45.500> are<00:01:45.590> two

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
skip eight very lucky there are two

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.810 
skip eight very lucky there are two
other<00:01:45.920> possibilities<00:01:47.920> there<00:01:48.920> will<00:01:49.100> be<00:01:49.130> two

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
other possibilities there will be two

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.450 
other possibilities there will be two
colors<00:01:51.040> which<00:01:52.040> will<00:01:52.250> match<00:01:54.100> but<00:01:55.100> all<00:01:55.340> the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
colors which will match but all the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.950 
colors which will match but all the
other<00:01:55.610> colors<00:01:56.030> won't<00:01:58.570> there's<00:01:59.570> also<00:01:59.750> the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
other colors won't there's also the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.080 
other colors won't there's also the
possibility<00:02:00.619> that<00:02:02.020> nothing<00:02:03.880> matches<00:02:04.880> that

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
possibility that nothing matches that

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.190 
possibility that nothing matches that
means<00:02:05.329> these<00:02:06.290> two<00:02:06.490> these<00:02:07.490> two<00:02:07.629> these<00:02:08.629> two<00:02:08.689> and

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
means these two these two these two and

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.050 
means these two these two these two and
these<00:02:09.769> two<00:02:09.829> are<00:02:10.610> never<00:02:10.909> the<00:02:11.090> same<00:02:11.299> colors<00:02:12.790> okay

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
these two are never the same colors okay

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.870 
these two are never the same colors okay
so<00:02:14.239> how<00:02:14.450> do<00:02:14.510> we<00:02:14.959> recognize<00:02:15.590> which<00:02:16.459> one<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.670> the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
so how do we recognize which one of the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.940 
so how do we recognize which one of the
three<00:02:16.910> we<00:02:17.270> have<00:02:17.510> well<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.410> first<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.800> really

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
three we have well the first is really

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.170 
three we have well the first is really
easy

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
easy

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.360 
easy
if<00:02:20.290> everything<00:02:21.730> red<00:02:22.730> green<00:02:23.629> orange<00:02:24.379> and<00:02:24.980> blue

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
if everything red green orange and blue

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.679 
if everything red green orange and blue
matches<00:02:26.379> then<00:02:27.379> you're<00:02:27.530> done<00:02:28.329> but<00:02:29.329> in<00:02:29.480> all

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
matches then you're done but in all

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.199 
matches then you're done but in all
other<00:02:29.900> cases<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:31.489> don't<00:02:31.640> have<00:02:31.879> to<00:02:32.030> memorize

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
other cases you don't have to memorize

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.600 
other cases you don't have to memorize
or<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:33.019> recognized<00:02:33.560> piece<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.129> cases<00:02:34.489> you

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
or a recognized piece of the cases you

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.640 
or a recognized piece of the cases you
have<00:02:34.819> just<00:02:35.209> like<00:02:35.420> before<00:02:35.599> there's<00:02:36.230> one<00:02:36.439> simple

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
have just like before there's one simple

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.479 
have just like before there's one simple
rule<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.189> follow<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:38.390> look<00:02:38.599> at<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.890> cut<00:02:40.129> two

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
rule to follow you look at to cut two

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.410 
rule to follow you look at to cut two
corners<00:02:40.909> and<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:42.680> rotate<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.280> corners<00:02:43.700> or

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
corners and you rotate the corners or

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.679 
corners and you rotate the corners or
the<00:02:44.810> cube<00:02:46.689> so<00:02:47.689> that<00:02:48.129> two<00:02:49.129> opposites<00:02:49.730> are<00:02:50.030> on

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
the cube so that two opposites are on

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.710 
the cube so that two opposites are on
the<00:02:50.840> front<00:02:51.700> okay<00:02:52.700> remember<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.329> opposites

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
the front okay remember the opposites

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.420 
the front okay remember the opposites
the<00:02:54.319> light<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:55.549> fire<00:02:55.819> and<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.450> sea<00:02:56.889> well<00:02:57.889> blue

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
the light the fire and the sea well blue

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.869 
the light the fire and the sea well blue
and<00:02:58.700> red<00:02:59.000> are<00:02:59.930> not<00:03:00.200> opposites<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:01.519> can<00:03:01.700> see

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
and red are not opposites you can see

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.050 
and red are not opposites you can see
blue<00:03:02.389> is<00:03:02.540> here<00:03:02.810> red<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:03.590> here<00:03:04.010> that's<00:03:04.760> also

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
blue is here red is here that's also

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.839 
blue is here red is here that's also
because<00:03:05.180> blue<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.569> water<00:03:05.959> red<00:03:06.470> it's<00:03:06.620> fire<00:03:06.849> so

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
because blue is water red it's fire so

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.569 
because blue is water red it's fire so
they<00:03:08.000> don't<00:03:08.209> make<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.510> pair<00:03:09.159> green<00:03:10.159> and<00:03:10.370> green

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
they don't make a pair green and green

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.539 
they don't make a pair green and green
they're<00:03:11.359> the<00:03:11.480> same<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:13.220> they're<00:03:13.370> not

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
they're the same so they're not

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.589 
they're the same so they're not
definitely<00:03:14.120> not<00:03:14.299> opposites<00:03:14.900> orange<00:03:15.889> and<00:03:16.099> blue

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
definitely not opposites orange and blue

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.729 
definitely not opposites orange and blue
orange<00:03:17.599> fuzz<00:03:17.900> fire<00:03:18.109> blue<00:03:18.590> OC<00:03:18.980> not<00:03:19.760> opposites

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
orange fuzz fire blue OC not opposites

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.589 
orange fuzz fire blue OC not opposites
red<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:21.980> orange<00:03:22.310> they<00:03:23.000> are<00:03:23.060> both<00:03:23.269> fire

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
red and orange they are both fire

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.720 
red and orange they are both fire
they're<00:03:24.109> different<00:03:24.349> so<00:03:24.949> they<00:03:25.099> are<00:03:25.220> opposites

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
they're different so they are opposites

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.069 
they're different so they are opposites
let's<00:03:26.239> see<00:03:26.389> if<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.569> works

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
let's see if it works

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.369 
let's see if it works
red<00:03:28.040> on<00:03:28.280> this<00:03:28.459> side<00:03:28.810> orange<00:03:29.810> on<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:29.989> other<00:03:30.199> one

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
red on this side orange on the other one

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:37.030 
red on this side orange on the other one
okay<00:03:31.190> we<00:03:32.180> have<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:32.989> pair<00:03:35.139> so<00:03:36.139> this<00:03:36.169> one<00:03:36.530> goes

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
okay we have the pair so this one goes

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.539 
okay we have the pair so this one goes
in<00:03:37.220> front<00:03:37.489> and<00:03:38.500> now<00:03:39.500> comes<00:03:39.799> one<00:03:40.099> of<00:03:40.129> the<00:03:40.340> most

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
in front and now comes one of the most

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.569 
in front and now comes one of the most
complicated<00:03:40.879> moves<00:03:41.409> which<00:03:42.409> you<00:03:42.590> really<00:03:43.099> just

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
complicated moves which you really just

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.819 
complicated moves which you really just
have<00:03:43.669> to<00:03:43.819> learn<00:03:44.180> all<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.750> other<00:03:45.139> ones<00:03:45.409> will<00:03:45.709> be

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
have to learn all the other ones will be

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.399 
have to learn all the other ones will be
really<00:03:46.159> easy<00:03:46.419> but<00:03:47.419> this<00:03:47.569> one<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:47.870> nine<00:03:48.109> moves

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
really easy but this one is nine moves

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.069 
really easy but this one is nine moves
which<00:03:49.069> you<00:03:49.220> will<00:03:49.370> have<00:03:49.549> to<00:03:49.609> learn<00:03:49.900> if<00:03:50.900> you

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
which you will have to learn if you

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.229 
which you will have to learn if you
break<00:03:51.319> it<00:03:51.349> up<00:03:51.560> into<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.919> couple<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:52.519> small<00:03:52.819> parts

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
break it up into a couple of small parts

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.039 
break it up into a couple of small parts
it<00:03:53.449> will<00:03:53.599> be<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.810> bit<00:03:54.229> more<00:03:54.409> easy<00:03:55.690> so<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.810> first

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
it will be a bit more easy so the first

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.089 
it will be a bit more easy so the first
part<00:03:57.290> will<00:03:57.590> be<00:03:57.739> free<00:03:58.069> moves<00:03:58.340> we<00:03:59.030> move<00:03:59.859> the<00:04:00.859> are

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
part will be free moves we move the are

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:07.300 
part will be free moves we move the are
the<00:04:01.609> right<00:04:01.879> side<00:04:03.159> counterclockwise<00:04:06.310> front

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
the right side counterclockwise front

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.300 
the right side counterclockwise front
side<00:04:07.579> clockwise<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:09.769> right<00:04:10.010> side

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
side clockwise the right side

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.780 
side clockwise the right side
counterclockwise<00:04:11.000> again<00:04:12.579> that's<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.760> first

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
counterclockwise again that's the first

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.839 
counterclockwise again that's the first
free<00:04:15.310> then<00:04:16.310> we<00:04:16.340> do<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:17.389> back

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
free then we do the back

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.819 
free then we do the back
don't<00:04:19.849> turn<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.239> cube<00:04:20.479> that<00:04:20.599> would<00:04:21.019> be<00:04:21.560> very

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
don't turn the cube that would be very

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.510 
don't turn the cube that would be very
confusing

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
confusing

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.050 
confusing
keep<00:04:22.909> yellow<00:04:23.180> on<00:04:23.300> top<00:04:23.500> do<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.620> back<00:04:24.830> a<00:04:25.130> half

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
keep yellow on top do the back a half

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.090 
keep yellow on top do the back a half
turn

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.510 

then<00:04:31.100> again<00:04:31.750> do<00:04:32.750> free<00:04:33.110> moves<00:04:33.440> which<00:04:33.950> are<00:04:34.130> quite

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
then again do free moves which are quite

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.910 
then again do free moves which are quite
similar<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.300> first<00:04:35.570> free<00:04:35.900> just<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.680> slight

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
similar to the first free just a slight

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.090 
similar to the first free just a slight
difference<00:04:37.330> now<00:04:38.330> we<00:04:38.390> do<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:40.250> right<00:04:40.490> side<00:04:40.730> back

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
difference now we do the right side back

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.430 
difference now we do the right side back
the<00:04:43.100> front<00:04:43.430> side<00:04:43.700> back<00:04:43.970> but<00:04:44.900> don't<00:04:45.080> do<00:04:45.290> the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
the front side back but don't do the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.780 
the front side back but don't do the
right<00:04:45.620> side<00:04:45.890> back<00:04:46.690> it<00:04:47.690> has<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:48.020> go<00:04:48.170> like<00:04:48.790> this

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
right side back it has to go like this

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.300 
right side back it has to go like this
to<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.570> bottom<00:04:53.620> then<00:04:54.620> do<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.890> back<00:04:55.070> side

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
to the bottom then do the back side

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.180 
to the bottom then do the back side
another<00:04:56.120> half<00:04:56.540> turn<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.230> now<00:04:57.830> it<00:04:57.980> should<00:04:58.160> be

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
another half turn and now it should be

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.610 
another half turn and now it should be
very<00:04:58.550> obvious<00:04:58.730> to<00:04:59.060> see<00:04:59.390> that<00:04:59.630> you<00:05:00.260> have<00:05:00.350> to<00:05:00.500> do

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
very obvious to see that you have to do

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.520 
very obvious to see that you have to do
the<00:05:00.740> right<00:05:00.920> side<00:05:01.190> another<00:05:01.550> turn<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.260> those<00:05:03.260> are

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
the right side another turn so those are

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.120 
the right side another turn so those are
free<00:05:03.980> moves<00:05:04.280> I<00:05:05.140> will<00:05:06.140> do<00:05:06.410> them<00:05:06.590> on<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.980> other

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
free moves I will do them on the other

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.420 
free moves I will do them on the other
cube<00:05:09.130> free<00:05:10.130> moves<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:11.330> backside<00:05:11.720> of<00:05:11.750> off<00:05:12.020> turn

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
cube free moves the backside of off turn

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.820 
cube free moves the backside of off turn
free<00:05:13.430> moves<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:14.540> backside<00:05:14.990> of<00:05:15.020> off<00:05:15.320> turn<00:05:15.620> and

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
free moves the backside of off turn and

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.310 
free moves the backside of off turn and
then<00:05:16.520> one<00:05:16.760> final<00:05:17.000> move<00:05:17.300> which<00:05:17.750> would<00:05:17.900> be<00:05:18.080> very

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
then one final move which would be very

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.110 
then one final move which would be very
obvious<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:18.920> see<00:05:19.100> it's<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.610> right<00:05:19.790> side

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
obvious to see it's the right side

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.500 
obvious to see it's the right side
altering<00:05:21.610> okay<00:05:22.610> so<00:05:22.670> let's<00:05:23.000> look<00:05:23.210> at<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:23.390> other

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
altering okay so let's look at the other

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.890 
altering okay so let's look at the other
situation<00:05:24.170> in<00:05:24.530> here<00:05:25.400> we<00:05:25.700> have<00:05:25.880> a<00:05:26.150> red<00:05:26.690> and

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
situation in here we have a red and

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.710 
situation in here we have a red and
orange<00:05:27.770> corner<00:05:28.220> those<00:05:28.700> are<00:05:28.880> fire<00:05:29.150> so<00:05:29.570> we

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
orange corner those are fire so we

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.800 
orange corner those are fire so we
should<00:05:29.930> have<00:05:30.860> this<00:05:31.220> side<00:05:31.490> in<00:05:31.760> front<00:05:31.910> of<00:05:32.150> us<00:05:32.300> but

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
should have this side in front of us but

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.470 
should have this side in front of us but
let's<00:05:33.050> see<00:05:33.230> your<00:05:33.380> name<00:05:33.530> next<00:05:33.770> side<00:05:34.240> those<00:05:35.240> are

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
let's see your name next side those are

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.110 
let's see your name next side those are
blue<00:05:35.750> and<00:05:36.020> green<00:05:36.260> that's<00:05:36.800> the<00:05:37.010> C<00:05:37.250> so<00:05:37.670> we<00:05:37.820> could

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
blue and green that's the C so we could

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.900 
blue and green that's the C so we could
also<00:05:38.300> have<00:05:38.720> deciding<00:05:39.440> front<00:05:39.680> of<00:05:39.830> us<00:05:39.980> let's

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
also have deciding front of us let's

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.560 
also have deciding front of us let's
look<00:05:41.180> a<00:05:41.240> bit<00:05:41.390> further<00:05:41.830> orange<00:05:42.830> and<00:05:43.040> red

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
look a bit further orange and red

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.570 
look a bit further orange and red
those<00:05:44.570> are<00:05:44.720> fire<00:05:44.990> so<00:05:45.410> we<00:05:45.530> could<00:05:45.740> keep<00:05:46.040> this

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
those are fire so we could keep this

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.510 
those are fire so we could keep this
side<00:05:46.820> in<00:05:46.970> front<00:05:47.150> and<00:05:47.830> finally<00:05:48.830> the<00:05:49.100> other<00:05:49.280> one

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
side in front and finally the other one

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.030 
side in front and finally the other one
has<00:05:49.790> green<00:05:50.120> and<00:05:50.150> blue<00:05:50.510> which<00:05:51.170> is<00:05:51.320> also<00:05:51.530> water

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
has green and blue which is also water

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.460 
has green and blue which is also water
so<00:05:52.850> we<00:05:53.000> could<00:05:53.210> also<00:05:53.390> have<00:05:53.570> decide<00:05:54.230> on<00:05:54.380> the

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
so we could also have decide on the

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.640 
so we could also have decide on the
front<00:05:54.740> so<00:05:55.700> it<00:05:55.820> doesn't<00:05:56.090> matter<00:05:56.240> if<00:05:56.930> we<00:05:57.230> keep<00:05:57.500> it

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
front so it doesn't matter if we keep it

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.030 
front so it doesn't matter if we keep it
like<00:05:57.680> this<00:05:57.920> or<00:05:58.370> this<00:05:58.520> or<00:05:58.790> this<00:05:58.820> or<00:05:59.090> this

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
like this or this or this or this

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.200 
like this or this or this or this
everything<00:06:01.040> is<00:06:01.130> correct<00:06:01.490> because<00:06:01.820> there's

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
everything is correct because there's

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.870 
everything is correct because there's
always<00:06:02.420> two<00:06:03.230> opposite<00:06:03.710> stickers<00:06:04.190> on<00:06:04.460> the

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
always two opposite stickers on the

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:12.540 
always two opposite stickers on the
front<00:06:05.650> so<00:06:06.650> let's<00:06:06.860> do<00:06:07.040> free<00:06:07.490> moves<00:06:09.400> are<00:06:10.400> fine<00:06:11.240> f

not everything is done yet so we will

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.400 
not everything is done yet so we will
have<00:06:35.880> to<00:06:36.060> check<00:06:36.270> for<00:06:36.570> two<00:06:36.690> opposite<00:06:37.050> colors

orange<00:06:37.830> and<00:06:38.100> blue<00:06:38.280> are<00:06:38.430> not<00:06:38.460> opposites

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
orange and blue are not opposites

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.380 
orange and blue are not opposites
because<00:06:39.450> they<00:06:39.600> are<00:06:39.660> fire<00:06:39.870> and<00:06:40.170> water<00:06:41.060> red<00:06:42.060> and

because they are fire and water red and
orange<00:06:43.260> those<00:06:43.860> are<00:06:44.040> opposites<00:06:44.190> because

orange those are opposites because

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.980

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
they're both fire blue and red are not

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010
