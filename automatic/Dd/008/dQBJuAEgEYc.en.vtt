00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.099
 aschaffenburg is here this is the new one 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.860
 and above all, the first tablet 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.420
 from acer liquid s1 that the samsung 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.800
 galaxy s 4 and we compare now 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.290
 my little bit so he at least 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.880
 so the obvious differences 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.910
 of course, the samsung could see 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.500
 galaxy s 4 5 inch display 10 80 p us 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.599
 5.7 on liquid it has 127 g me 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.820
 have the expo 5 variant that is so 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:40.160
 This 8 core medium thus gets is 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.470
 a quad core a7 below quad-core 15 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.350
 whereas here at the acer mediatek 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.180
 ssi also have a quad core 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.460
 arm cortex a9 that's the one 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.060
 generation before the 15th 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.970
 otherwise 2 gb ram her on the s4 some 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.920
 work on the liquid it 116 or 32 gb 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.530
 variants on the galaxy s 4 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.600
 and that's eight gigabytes here on the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.810
 liquid it as both you can with one 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.240
 upgrade micro sd card accordingly 2 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.890
 megapixel camera front 8 megapixel 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.380
 Camera back there, the two do 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.700
 not much else is interesting at 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.260
 Worth a look it could be here 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.740
 It's a dual sim device 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.520
 whereas on the s4 we only have a sim card 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:31.590
 it can not be so packed 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.869
 been that four and the liquid s1 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.180
 weighs 195 grams 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:42.470
 otherwise it is priced too 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.119
 quite thick difference that will 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.000
 349 euro about for free on the market 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.560
 whereas the galaxy s 4 ever comes 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.720
 which variant do you have? 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.610
 think it is about 1 599 euro 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.630
 Let's go that was a short comparison test 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.150
 between the new acer liquid s1 and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.770
 this is my samsung galaxy s 4 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.280
 I am very happy about the many thanks 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.280
 to see that
