00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:14.620
 the difference between thinning shears and Christmas tree 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:18.339
 on the left here we take a strand and we do 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.289
 Christmas tree means school means higher here 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.070
 we got such brushes 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.109
 hair 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.849
 several times that length but they are different 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.339
 genes are not in separate areas do not cry 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.079
 the camera gradually smoothly and when they 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.800
 respect they create a certain 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.210
 texture 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.330
 if I work on thinning 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.330
 scissors 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.810
 but 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.210
 such a texture we can not she 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.900
 will be if we are several times on one and 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.270
 in the same place, but in this case 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.950
 Christmas cuts it will be much faster 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.520
 we can say with manual it will be 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.000
 five times more and here if you are this length 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.540
 120 hp 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.550
 to create these rates if we 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.680
 We work through a tapering strongly 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.270
 nothing has changed for us 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.610
 hair type for this haircut 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:16.010
 thinning scissors did not help us 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.330
 turn it industry thick and power 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.290
 transition look 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.900
 so to create and align something 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.100
 there we make the festive cut they immediately 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.560
 create texture 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.160
 us certain they then they will 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.660
 fall 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.170
 some dense mass namely it will be 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.170
 hub 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.340
 do i don't 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.340
 acquire some kind of texture 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.920
 working 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.750
 thus 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.500
 also we try anal sex 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.160
 on 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.940
 but we have a decent here 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.060
 but make a Christmas tree means to whom 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.150
 Putin us Christmas cut enough 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.280
 deep do to 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.840
 remove and texture simultaneously with 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.410
 can of course be thin 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.060
 scissors bottom 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.310
 worlds to me when i better be so 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.860
 crushing will raise these and 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.900
 still aggravate our problem and us here 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.990
 need to lift without removing the total length 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.190
 remove here 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.700
 height 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.830
 how to work 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.370
 we got this enough 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.940
 tight bangs that we 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.570
 and movies u have to pick it up 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.180
 Here we have our bangs I invest in 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.180
 the site often remains a corner here 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.460
 this little corner we shoot smoothly 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:57.730
 we enter into the total mass of the site as on 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.900
 just remove the corner bangs already begins 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.900
 how to avoid 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.200
 that also 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.920
 do not remove simultaneously 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.920
 heroin density 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.140
 what to work 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.090
 here is our account 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.090
 so dense 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.379
 you look okay i will arrange 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:14.530
 features get home she the hive 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.530
 he and these 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.730
 will fall 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.139
 our 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.620
 man is always one side a little 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.620
 man 2 a little less 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.000
 always length 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.000
 on the one hand grow faster 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:19.180
 we ourselves check so simple that 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.180
 also create texture 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.720
 vertical sections we check ourselves 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.720
 horizontal 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.150
 now be sure to blow foam to 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.990
 remove all the small hair that we have 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.990
 do n't care 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.960
 is ready
