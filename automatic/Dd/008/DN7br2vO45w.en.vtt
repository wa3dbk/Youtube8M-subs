00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.960
 that you will not regret it 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.290
 will continue in delusions like that 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.640
 so thank you very much everyone so we go 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.780
 move on to this little video a little bit 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.390
 special since it is a video 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.739
 tips and tricks for survival 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.239
 happy owners I started with that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.509
 happy owners of iphone and xbox 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.340
 360 since a few days ago I 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.100
 discovered a pretty cool app 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.079
 on iphone so here I am you 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.979
 show already on the apple store how 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.560
 they present themselves 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.100
 here is this reminder its xbox mart ice 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.450
 sorry it'll reload the page 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.090
 so I know she's available on 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.899
 iphone i read the description of de 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.340
 this application 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.719
 only it's not marked that it's 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.249
 compatible with the ipod but very 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.229
 honestly I think it works well 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:34.590
 of course it would have to be a minimum 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.389
 an ios 4 or 5 if I will not tell you 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.619
 as an update for it to work 

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:38.789
 but in my opinion it works because everything 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.840
 what you need is a 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.490
 Internet connection 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.399
 so I think there are no worries 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.499
 for that and I think you've seen the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.429
 xbox players that after with with the setting 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:51.719
 up to date forgiveness that we did xbox and 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.209
 now fighting to send our messages 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.499
 our keyboard is going ti what is 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.929
 pretty much and you'll see that this 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:00.719
 application is a good outcome to this 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.270
 worry so there you see I'm in 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.069
 the home is connected so here is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.299
 you have the players and it's the games 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.350
 recent with which you played 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.940
 you have access to your 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.940
 your avatar your account and that's at 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.770
 to discover that it's a little 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.600
 elements of the xbox you can have 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.160
 access to your successes no I did not want 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.870
 click because that's not what 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.340
 I'm interested in Bresse and you have your 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.230
 xbox in your phone in any 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.890
 so so there you click down there there 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.660
 either here to access remote control and 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.640
 you will see that you will be able to 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.360
 point your xbox using your 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.400
 phone 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.000
 so to open the guide button you 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.800
 just tap here on magic hero guide 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.810
 it opens the guide button 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.660
 so we will go to the messages of 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.610
 sweating engineers in addition I do not know 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.700
 what is it about 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.860
 to a message from the small alex masters 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.180
 kisses to you alex we're going to go sent a 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:01.780
 message to fight if I do not find it 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.240
 it does not have to be connected during 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.400
 and a message he added we talked about it 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.620
 like this little game that had broken his 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.970
 cd blackops we're going to send him a 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.180
 little message and you will see that 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.440
 is frankly huppert super cool it 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.050
 my boys since says you click 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.840
 there and of course the iphone you have a 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.180
 keyboard that opens it's magic that one 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.040
 can watch as soon as I type it is written 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.210
 on the xbox it's just beautiful 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.370
 and in addition I was doing the correction of 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.880
 your iphone it's cool not to do 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.980

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:39.250
 we will send him a little message 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.580
 will sink here is hop you send 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.500
 tac so the button pressed what you 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.330

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.970
 abbas button and you press the 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.290

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.700
 after you just have to press on the 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.920
 button b to go back 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.390
 hop home xbox yeah no game like 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.860
 offline but now you can see 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.710
 that all the buttons work as it 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.740
 must you can navigate in there 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:09.540
 as well 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:11.120
 hop I not wrong side 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.069
 Well, it's frankly a 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.390
 rather nice application so there if you 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.370
 are tired of using your iphone goes 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.699
 you click on the controller and that makes you 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.199
 switch on joysticks after keyboard so 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.190
 there that except that really dig in the 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.350
 messenger though you can navigate 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.000
 on this app only when you 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.100
 are on the xbox for example in the 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.419
 games you can not move in 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.310
 the game menus using this 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.169
 application 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.220
 so that's basically for 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.259
 the messages I wanted to show you 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.160
 this application 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.020
 since there are not really any others 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.000
 features if not that low ok 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.830
 it's cool to navigate in his 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.990
 menus with his phone but good to 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.820
 share that very honestly I have not found 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.810
 huge interest either but as soon as 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.039
 you have a message and want 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.800
 respond very quickly and well it's 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.050
 really super easy so bah listen 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.240
 friends here it was a brief video 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.530
 but that could interest me I think 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.699
 several people of that very 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.759
 honestly me when I found that 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.050
 I just looked for it because I 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.759
 you admit that typing keyboards 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.039
 qwerty keyboard messages it's not my 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.780
 kif and there besides that you are with 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.020
 your your phone you do not have 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.030
 galley with your forgiveness controller so 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.440
 here I am closing this video there 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.669
 on because there is not much 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.870
 else to say it was just for you 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.130
 keep informed that this little 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.800
 application existed so I'm going to you 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.820
 put the name in the description etc 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.560
 I hope you have enjoyed friends 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.930
 very short video do not worry 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.830
 for the new video finally the 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.000
 chain is not powered only by 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.229
 simple good I think you've seen it 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.930
 there will be black ops to come well 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.580
