we did most of our drills we just did
from<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.500> top<00:00:04.710> down<00:00:05.089> we<00:00:06.089> always<00:00:06.270> try<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.450> get<00:00:06.660> a

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
from the top down we always try to get a

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.990 
from the top down we always try to get a
couple<00:00:06.899> from<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.230> bottom<00:00:07.649> up<00:00:07.799> for<00:00:08.429> attackman

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
couple from the bottom up for attackman

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.730 
couple from the bottom up for attackman
they're<00:00:09.450> gonna<00:00:09.570> dodge<00:00:09.840> up<00:00:10.110> pretty<00:00:10.349> much<00:00:10.440> from

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
they're gonna dodge up pretty much from

it the same and then they're gonna come
up<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.289> curl<00:00:22.710> off<00:00:23.189> another<00:00:23.519> cone<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.119> get

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
up and curl off another cone and get

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.570 
up and curl off another cone and get
kind<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.930> warp<00:00:25.500> more<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.949> more<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.460> a

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
kind of a warp more of it more of a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.150 
kind of a warp more of it more of a
mid-range<00:00:27.029> shot<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.529> run<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.859> just<00:00:29.010> kind

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
mid-range shot on the run and just kind

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.980 
mid-range shot on the run and just kind
of<00:00:29.220> curl<00:00:29.400> into<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> goal<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.539> we'll<00:00:30.720> put<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
of curl into the goal so we'll put a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.479 
of curl into the goal so we'll put a
couple<00:00:31.170> cones<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> island<00:00:32.279> where<00:00:32.399> they

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
couple cones on the island where they

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:44.119 
couple cones on the island where they
got<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:42.110> just<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.320> wanted<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:43.890> goal

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129
