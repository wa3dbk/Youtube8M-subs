 in 2-3 hours you will fry 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.079
 so we must have the sea in the marinade 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.780

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.250

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.180
 we will not dilute the sauce 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.820
 if you decide to cook in advance 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.270
