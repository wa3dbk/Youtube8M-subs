00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
my only thing with this is um I didn't

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.960 
my only thing with this is um I didn't
try<00:03:22.359> it<00:03:22.390> on<00:03:22.630> in<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.320> store<00:03:23.859> which<00:03:24.790> was<00:03:24.940> a

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
try it on in the store which was a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.390 
try it on in the store which was a
mistake<00:03:25.150> but<00:03:26.019> it's<00:03:26.230> just<00:03:26.410> because<00:03:26.560> I'm<00:03:26.680> lazy

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
mistake but it's just because I'm lazy

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.640 
mistake but it's just because I'm lazy
and<00:03:27.609> I<00:03:27.760> don't<00:03:27.790> like<00:03:28.030> trying<00:03:28.329> things<00:03:28.510> on<00:03:28.650> it

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
and I don't like trying things on it

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.809 
and I don't like trying things on it
actually<00:03:29.920> already<00:03:30.549> has<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.390> hole<00:03:31.750> in<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:32.230> in<00:03:33.160> the

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
actually already has a hole in it in the

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.690 
actually already has a hole in it in the
side<00:03:34.440> right<00:03:35.440> there<00:03:37.709> but<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:38.739> mean<00:03:39.069> whatever

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
side right there but I mean whatever

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.199 
side right there but I mean whatever
that<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.870> fix<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:41.920> easily<00:03:41.950> what<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> real

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
that I fix that so easily what the real

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.670 
that I fix that so easily what the real
problem<00:03:43.600> is<00:03:43.690> is<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:43.959> it's<00:03:44.230> kind<00:03:44.560> of

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
problem is is that it's kind of

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.620 
problem is is that it's kind of
see-through<00:03:45.060> like<00:03:46.170> like<00:03:47.170> on<00:03:47.410> my<00:03:47.680> butt

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
see-through like like on my butt

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.309 
see-through like like on my butt
especially<00:03:49.630> because<00:03:49.870> when<00:03:50.019> it<00:03:50.139> gets

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
especially because when it gets

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.520 
especially because when it gets
stretched<00:03:50.859> out<00:03:51.209> bigger<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.630> gets<00:03:52.959> more

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
stretched out bigger it gets more

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.069 
stretched out bigger it gets more
see-through<00:03:54.040> like<00:03:54.639> I'm<00:03:54.970> pretty<00:03:55.480> sure<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:55.900> can

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
see-through like I'm pretty sure you can

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.830 
see-through like I'm pretty sure you can
tell<00:03:56.260> that<00:03:56.290> that's<00:03:56.609> see-through<00:03:57.609> so<00:03:58.150> it's<00:03:58.450> not

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
tell that that's see-through so it's not

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.819 
tell that that's see-through so it's not
the<00:03:59.200> best<00:03:59.620> for<00:04:00.519> like<00:04:00.940> i<00:04:01.299> know<00:04:02.230> i<00:04:02.260> need<00:04:02.380> to<00:04:02.650> get<00:04:02.769> a
