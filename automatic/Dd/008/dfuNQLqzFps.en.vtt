00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
it looks like if you buy one from

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.920 
it looks like if you buy one from
radioshack<00:01:21.409> coming<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.860> pair<00:01:23.130> got<00:01:23.670> the

radioshack coming in and a pair got the
actual<00:01:24.930> jack<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.130> then<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.540> end<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.470> i'm

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
actual jack and then this end so i'm

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.249 
actual jack and then this end so i'm
going<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.890> mount<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:30.360> radio<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
going to mount that in my radio on the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.749 
going to mount that in my radio on the
side<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.310> case<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.509> i<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.590> plug<00:01:35.009> this

the wire is to bring it out of the back

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.340

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
assembly list was all plugging in and

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.110 
assembly list was all plugging in and
now<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.650> I've<00:03:14.860> run<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.160> wire<00:03:15.430> up<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.730> side

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
now and I've run the wire up the side

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.240 
now and I've run the wire up the side
here<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:16.780> there's<00:03:17.380> plenty<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.800> room<00:03:17.890> in<00:03:18.070> here

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
here and there's plenty of room in here

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.229 
here and there's plenty of room in here
I've<00:03:18.850> placed<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.690> jack<00:03:20.620> on<00:03:20.920> here<00:03:21.310> we<00:03:21.940> can<00:03:22.090> go

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
I've placed the jack on here we can go

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.180 
I've placed the jack on here we can go
ahead<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.480> put<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.900> transmitter<00:03:23.890> back

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
ahead and put the transmitter back

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.870 
ahead and put the transmitter back
together<00:03:24.550> now<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:26.620> can<00:03:26.800> see<00:03:27.100> this<00:03:27.670> is

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
together now and you can see this is

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.910 
together now and you can see this is
where<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.890> wire<00:03:30.100> plugs<00:03:30.520> in<00:03:31.650> for<00:03:32.650> your

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
where the wire plugs in for your

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.820 
where the wire plugs in for your
simulator<00:03:33.519> just<00:03:34.209> like<00:03:34.390> that<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:34.989> now<00:03:35.530> we're

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
simulator just like that and now we're

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.580 
simulator just like that and now we're
all<00:03:35.980> set<00:03:36.340> nothing's<00:03:37.120> in<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.420> way<00:03:37.600> it's<00:03:38.320> a

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
all set nothing's in the way it's a

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.070 
all set nothing's in the way it's a
perfect<00:03:39.100> little<00:03:39.190> setup<00:03:39.519> so<00:03:39.910> another<00:03:40.600> way<00:03:40.840> that

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
perfect little setup so another way that

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.110 
perfect little setup so another way that
you<00:03:41.110> can<00:03:41.230> do<00:03:41.860> it<00:03:41.980> let's<00:03:42.190> go<00:03:42.340> try<00:03:42.580> a<00:03:42.610> little

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
you can do it let's go try a little

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.400 
you can do it let's go try a little
flight<00:03:43.450> see<00:03:44.350> how<00:03:44.410> it<00:03:44.470> does<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:46.269> as<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.230> can

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
flight see how it does and as you can

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.830 
flight see how it does and as you can
see<00:03:47.440> we<00:03:47.890> still<00:03:48.130> have<00:03:48.310> our<00:03:48.519> I<00:03:48.850> have<00:03:49.420> plugs<00:03:49.690> that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
see we still have our I have plugs that

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.380 
see we still have our I have plugs that
I<00:03:49.989> can<00:03:50.170> use<00:03:50.290> any<00:03:50.830> other<00:03:51.040> transmitter<00:03:51.610> with<00:03:51.850> and

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
I can use any other transmitter with and

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.479 
I can use any other transmitter with and
just<00:03:52.600> happen<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.080> like<00:03:53.500> why<00:03:53.830> my<00:03:54.010> simulator

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
just happen to like why my simulator

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:16.900 
just happen to like why my simulator
with

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.270 

when<00:04:17.480> you're<00:04:17.690> learning<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.230> hover<00:04:18.860> and<00:04:19.220> fly

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
when you're learning to hover and fly

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.390 
when you're learning to hover and fly
around<00:04:19.750> what<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.900> want<00:04:21.110> to<00:04:21.200> do<00:04:21.350> is<00:04:21.590> practice

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
around what you want to do is practice

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.250 
around what you want to do is practice
doing<00:04:22.970> some<00:04:23.210> terms<00:04:23.510> in<00:04:23.750> front<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.140> you<00:04:24.230> like

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
doing some terms in front of you like

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.640 
doing some terms in front of you like
this<00:04:25.270> over<00:04:26.270> off<00:04:26.450> start<00:04:26.990> flying<00:04:27.290> around

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
this over off start flying around

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.060 
this over off start flying around
because<00:04:28.130> you'll<00:04:28.400> probably<00:04:28.700> not<00:04:29.030> get<00:04:29.240> back

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
because you'll probably not get back

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.500 
because you'll probably not get back
you've<00:04:31.070> got<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:31.460> learn<00:04:31.580> how<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.910> totally

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
you've got to learn how to totally

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.540 
you've got to learn how to totally
control<00:04:32.690> your<00:04:33.080> helicopter<00:04:33.740> at<00:04:33.980> all<00:04:34.160> speeds

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
wind on make it a little tough before

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.410 
wind on make it a little tough before
you<00:04:41.090> go<00:04:41.240> out<00:04:41.300> for<00:04:41.780> any<00:04:41.990> big<00:04:42.230> flying<00:04:43.180> get<00:04:44.180> used

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
you go out for any big flying get used

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.840 
you go out for any big flying get used
to<00:04:44.600> turn<00:04:44.840> in<00:04:44.990> that<00:04:45.020> tail<00:04:45.440> rotor<00:04:45.770> see<00:04:46.550> what<00:04:46.730> it

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
to turn in that tail rotor see what it

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.580 
to turn in that tail rotor see what it
looks<00:04:47.030> like<00:04:47.210> when<00:04:47.390> you're<00:04:47.540> you're<00:04:48.260> having

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
looks like when you're you're having

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.490 
looks like when you're you're having
straight<00:04:48.950> at<00:04:49.070> your<00:04:49.220> face<00:04:49.870> you<00:04:50.870> know<00:04:50.990> get<00:04:51.290> used

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
straight at your face you know get used

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.030 
straight at your face you know get used
to<00:04:51.680> that<00:04:51.860> knows<00:04:52.160> Ian<00:04:52.400> hovering<00:04:52.910> being<00:04:53.890> able<00:04:54.890> to

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
to that knows Ian hovering being able to

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.340 
to that knows Ian hovering being able to
turn<00:04:55.280> left<00:04:55.610> and<00:04:55.820> right<00:04:56.060> without<00:04:56.330> any<00:04:56.690> problem

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
turn left and right without any problem

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.560 
turn left and right without any problem
and<00:04:57.560> get<00:04:58.070> it<00:04:58.220> right<00:04:58.400> back<00:04:58.610> down<00:04:58.670> and<00:04:59.180> landed

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
and get it right back down and landed

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.160 
and get it right back down and landed
and<00:04:59.900> when<00:05:00.620> you<00:05:00.740> can<00:05:00.920> do<00:05:01.100> that<00:05:01.370> then<00:05:01.670> you<00:05:02.510> go<00:05:03.320> fly

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
and when you can do that then you go fly

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.650 
and when you can do that then you go fly
okay<00:05:06.170> like<00:05:06.920> that<00:05:07.760> set<00:05:08.030> up<00:05:08.150> worked<00:05:08.360> on<00:05:08.540> my

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
okay like that set up worked on my

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.720
