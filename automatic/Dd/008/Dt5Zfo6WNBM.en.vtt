ever<00:03:50.230> gone<00:03:50.440> through<00:03:50.500> but<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.280> think<00:03:51.550> I<00:03:51.640> like<00:03:51.790> the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
ever gone through but I think I like the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.250 
ever gone through but I think I like the
challenges<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.510> knew<00:03:52.630> all<00:03:52.660> odds<00:03:53.050> were

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
challenges and I knew all odds were

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.400 
challenges and I knew all odds were
against<00:03:53.530> me<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:54.580> almost<00:03:54.730> gave<00:03:55.030> me<00:03:55.210> that

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
against me and it almost gave me that

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.350 
against me and it almost gave me that
inspiration<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.560> sight<00:03:56.890> that<00:03:57.190> that<00:03:58.060> drive

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
inspiration that sight that that drive

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.900 
inspiration that sight that that drive
to<00:03:58.660> make<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:58.960> back<00:03:59.140> I<00:03:59.470> feel<00:04:00.460> great

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
to make it back I feel great

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.360 
to make it back I feel great
I<00:04:00.940> know<00:04:01.660> there's<00:04:01.960> going<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.140> be<00:04:02.200> more<00:04:02.410> ups<00:04:03.190> and

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
I know there's going to be more ups and

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.450 
I know there's going to be more ups and
downs<00:04:03.460> I<00:04:03.850> expect<00:04:04.270> that<00:04:04.450> but<00:04:05.350> I<00:04:05.380> think<00:04:05.470> this<00:04:06.280> is

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
downs I expect that but I think this is

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.490 
downs I expect that but I think this is
going<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.880> be<00:04:07.000> a<00:04:07.030> great<00:04:07.510> three<00:04:07.900> weeks<00:04:08.140> for<00:04:08.410> me

the<00:04:19.900> team<00:04:20.459> which<00:04:21.459> by<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:21.790> way<00:04:22.830> is<00:04:23.830> very<00:04:24.160> scary

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
the team which by the way is very scary

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.860 
the team which by the way is very scary
to<00:04:24.610> think<00:04:24.700> about<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.270> then<00:04:25.480> by<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.750> third

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
to think about and then by the third

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.050 
to think about and then by the third
week<00:04:26.230> we're<00:04:26.470> hoping<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.800> get<00:04:26.920> me<00:04:27.070> into<00:04:27.400> full-on

week we're hoping to get me into full-on
plane<00:04:28.480> four<00:04:28.930> before<00:04:29.230> games<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.890> pull<00:04:30.760> on

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
plane four before games and pull on

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.970 
plane four before games and pull on
tackling<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.630> then<00:04:32.290> by<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.560> end<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:32.830> that

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
tackling and then by the end of that

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.740 
tackling and then by the end of that
hopefully<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.490> can<00:04:33.580> be<00:04:33.760> cleared<00:04:34.180> going<00:04:34.600> into

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
not wincing as much when she lands and a

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.670 
not wincing as much when she lands and a
couple<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.150> dives<00:05:15.420> yesterday<00:05:15.990> she<00:05:16.290> winced<00:05:16.590> a

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.890 
couple of dives yesterday she winced a
bit<00:05:16.830> which<00:05:17.160> is<00:05:17.190> expected<00:05:17.790> it's<00:05:18.660> been

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
bit which is expected it's been

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.170 
bit which is expected it's been
difficult<00:05:19.170> but<00:05:20.040> she'd<00:05:20.460> been<00:05:20.610> flashing<00:05:20.880> enough

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
difficult but she'd been flashing enough

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.510 
difficult but she'd been flashing enough
to<00:05:21.300> deal<00:05:21.480> with<00:05:21.510> it<00:05:21.720> I<00:05:21.960> have<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.950> be<00:05:23.070> honest<00:05:23.430> that

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
to deal with it I have to be honest that

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.720 
to deal with it I have to be honest that
this<00:05:24.080> process<00:05:25.080> has<00:05:25.290> been<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:25.530> very<00:05:25.830> positive

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
this process has been a very positive

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.400 
this process has been a very positive
process<00:05:26.850> and<00:05:27.360> I'm<00:05:27.420> still<00:05:27.720> hoping<00:05:28.050> you<00:05:28.320> know

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
process and I'm still hoping you know

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.010 
process and I'm still hoping you know
obviously<00:05:28.890> we<00:05:29.040> have<00:05:29.280> I<00:05:29.580> have<00:05:30.120> about<00:05:30.360> probably

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
obviously we have I have about probably

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.580 
obviously we have I have about probably
a<00:05:31.610> month<00:05:32.610> six<00:05:33.240> weeks<00:05:33.330> left<00:05:33.930> before<00:05:34.140> I<00:05:34.440> get

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
a month six weeks left before I get

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.980 
a month six weeks left before I get
cleared<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:34.890> play<00:05:35.390> so<00:05:36.390> anything<00:05:36.720> can<00:05:36.810> still

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
cleared to play so anything can still

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.480 
cleared to play so anything can still
happen<00:05:37.050> we're<00:05:37.500> hoping<00:05:37.740> there's<00:05:37.920> no<00:05:38.040> setbacks

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
happen we're hoping there's no setbacks

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.710 
happen we're hoping there's no setbacks
and<00:05:38.790> but<00:05:39.390> overall<00:05:39.780> the<00:05:40.020> experience<00:05:40.140> has<00:05:40.740> been
