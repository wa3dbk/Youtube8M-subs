the<00:01:21.030> size<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.479> your<00:01:21.509> bike<00:01:21.810> here<00:01:21.950> I'm<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the size of your bike here I'm going to

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.789 
the size of your bike here I'm going to
try<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.000> I've<00:01:24.090> got<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
try this with that I've got here is to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.810 
try this with that I've got here is to
be<00:01:25.950> widened<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.210> bit<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.619> try<00:01:29.009> that

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.570 

a<00:01:32.820> little<00:01:33.630> bit<00:01:33.780> more<00:01:36.740> that's<00:01:37.740> probably<00:01:38.370> going

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
a little bit more that's probably going

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.190 
a little bit more that's probably going
to<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.760> good<00:01:39.000> right<00:01:39.270> there<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:42.180> works<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.080> I'm

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
to be good right there that works so I'm

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.410 
to be good right there that works so I'm
just<00:01:43.350> going<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.560> tighten<00:01:43.950> those<00:01:44.120> kinks<00:01:45.120> bolts

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
just going to tighten those kinks bolts

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.840 
just going to tighten those kinks bolts
down<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.230> feet<00:01:46.410> don't<00:01:46.680> move<00:01:49.850> all

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
down so that the feet don't move all

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.210 
down so that the feet don't move all
right<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.150> raise<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.510> bike<00:01:51.920> set<00:01:52.920> your<00:01:53.040> rear

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
think I still want to keep it like it is

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.960 
think I still want to keep it like it is
because<00:04:18.410> I've<00:04:19.410> seen<00:04:19.470> people<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.640> will<00:04:20.760> try

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
because I've seen people that will try

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.730 
because I've seen people that will try
and<00:04:21.030> hold<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.480> bike<00:04:21.600> upright<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.320> then

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
and hold the bike upright and then

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.980 
and hold the bike upright and then
adjust<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.430> width<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.820> it<00:04:23.970> not<00:04:24.150> realizing<00:04:24.450> you

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
adjust the width of it not realizing you

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.659 
adjust the width of it not realizing you
can<00:04:25.110> adjust<00:04:25.230> the<00:04:25.650> width<00:04:25.860> while<00:04:26.100> it's<00:04:26.310> leaning

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
can adjust the width while it's leaning

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.120 
can adjust the width while it's leaning
over<00:04:26.840> people<00:04:27.840> commonly<00:04:28.200> do<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:28.950> that's

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
over people commonly do that and that's

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.740 
over people commonly do that and that's
a<00:04:29.220> mistake<00:04:29.400> because<00:04:29.790> you<00:04:30.000> can<00:04:30.120> do<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.540> easy

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
a mistake because you can do it the easy

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.780 
a mistake because you can do it the easy
