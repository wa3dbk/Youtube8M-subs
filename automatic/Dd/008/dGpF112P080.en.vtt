00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.690 
this chest and tricep workout for you
guys<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:12.480> was<00:00:12.750> one<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.230> best<00:00:13.700> chest

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
guys and it was one of the best chest

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.609 
guys and it was one of the best chest
and<00:00:14.880> tricep<00:00:15.299> workouts<00:00:15.719> I've<00:00:15.900> had<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> long<00:00:16.320> time

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
and tricep workouts I've had a long time

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.320 
and tricep workouts I've had a long time
so<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:18.510> started<00:00:18.869> off<00:00:18.990> with<00:00:19.220> dumbbell<00:00:20.220> press<00:00:20.520> I

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
so we started off with dumbbell press I

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.460 
so we started off with dumbbell press I
got<00:00:21.810> up<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.650> 105

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
got up to the 105

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.790 
got up to the 105
started<00:00:25.470> light<00:00:25.680> with<00:00:25.920> 75<00:00:26.490> pound<00:00:26.789> dumbbells

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
started light with 75 pound dumbbells

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.700 
started light with 75 pound dumbbells
and<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.369> was<00:00:29.519> doing<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.449> did<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:30.929> did<00:00:31.109> three<00:00:31.380> sets

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and I was doing I did we did three sets

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.950 
and I was doing I did we did three sets
of<00:00:32.870> ten<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.989> twelve<00:00:34.260> basically<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.630> pumped

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
of ten to twelve basically so I pumped

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.690 
of ten to twelve basically so I pumped
those<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.860> seems<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.219> whenever<00:00:38.460> I

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
those out and it seems like whenever I

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.470 
those out and it seems like whenever I
start<00:00:39.090> off<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.570> dumbbells<00:00:40.250> I<00:00:41.480> really

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
start off with the dumbbells I really

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.470 
start off with the dumbbells I really
feel<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.760> throughout<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> whole<00:00:45.090> workout

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
feel it throughout the whole workout

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.910 
feel it throughout the whole workout
after<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> really<00:00:46.140> kind<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.379> tires<00:00:46.620> me<00:00:46.890> out

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
after it really kind of tires me out

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.420 
after it really kind of tires me out
right<00:00:47.820> off<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.239> bat<00:00:48.620> really<00:00:49.620> stretches<00:00:50.280> out

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
right off the bat really stretches out

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.150 
right off the bat really stretches out
your<00:00:50.460> chest<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.090> helps<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.510> grow<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.800> knocked

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
your chest and helps it grow so knocked

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.880 
your chest and helps it grow so knocked
out<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> dumbbells<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.149> moved<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
out the dumbbells and moved on to

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.349 
out the dumbbells and moved on to
incline<00:00:55.890> bench<00:00:56.129> press<00:00:56.360> we<00:00:57.360> did<00:00:57.539> three<00:00:57.870> sets<00:00:58.140> of

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
incline bench press we did three sets of

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.100 
incline bench press we did three sets of
six<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.570> ten<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.579> I<00:01:02.629> didn't<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:03.809> more

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
six to ten on this I didn't get more

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.789 
six to ten on this I didn't get more
than<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:06.170> 45<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.470> 25<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.189> each<00:01:08.310> side<00:01:09.799> seems

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
than a 45 and a 25 on each side seems

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.100 
than a 45 and a 25 on each side seems
like<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.640> incline<00:01:12.000> bench<00:01:12.030> press<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.020> of

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
like the incline bench press is one of

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.999 
like the incline bench press is one of
my<00:01:13.260> weak<00:01:13.470> spots<00:01:15.200> yeah<00:01:16.200> pretty<00:01:16.530> much

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
my weak spots yeah pretty much

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.730 
my weak spots yeah pretty much
and<00:01:17.970> before<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.450> said<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:19.110> notice<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.590> my

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and before you said just notice that my

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740 
and before you said just notice that my
shirt<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.610> coming<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.299> look<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.630> I'm

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
shirt is like coming up I look like I'm

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.870 
shirt is like coming up I look like I'm
wearing<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.049> belly<00:01:22.320> shirt<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.520> don't<00:01:23.700> make<00:01:23.820> fun

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
wearing a belly shirt so don't make fun

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.399 
wearing a belly shirt so don't make fun
of<00:01:24.150> me<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> moving<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.909> went<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.420> decline

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
of me so moving on we went to decline

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.460 
of me so moving on we went to decline
bench<00:01:28.650> press<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> great<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.049> for

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
bench press this is a great one for

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.800 
bench press this is a great one for
really<00:01:31.799> chiseling<00:01:32.610> out<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.000> lower<00:01:33.210> portion

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
really chiseling out the lower portion

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.670 
really chiseling out the lower portion
of<00:01:33.900> your<00:01:33.960> chest<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.439> go<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> little

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
of your chest and you can go a little

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.219 
of your chest and you can go a little
heavier<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.549> one<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.720> started<00:01:40.079> out

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
heavier on this one so we started out

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.190 
heavier on this one so we started out
with<00:01:40.259> 50<00:01:40.890> pounds<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.310> each<00:01:41.430> side<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.020> got

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
with 50 pounds on each side and we got

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.450 
with 50 pounds on each side and we got
up<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.619> two<00:01:44.460> forty<00:01:44.820> fives<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.630> each<00:01:45.869> side<00:01:46.170> so

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
up to two forty fives on each side so

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.179 
up to two forty fives on each side so
that<00:01:47.780> was<00:01:48.780> good<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.320> busted<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:50.009> out

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
that was good one we busted that one out

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.020 
that was good one we busted that one out
and<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.299> moved<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.189> weighted<00:01:53.189> dips<00:01:53.460> I

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and then we moved on to weighted dips I

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.520 
and then we moved on to weighted dips I
was<00:01:54.509> only<00:01:54.720> doing<00:01:54.990> them<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:56.000> I<00:01:57.380> believe<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
was only doing them with I believe it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.490 
was only doing them with I believe it
was<00:01:58.590> 35<00:01:59.130> pounds<00:01:59.610> hanging<00:01:59.790> from<00:02:00.119> me<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:01.200> this

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
was 35 pounds hanging from me but this

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.109 
was 35 pounds hanging from me but this
was<00:02:01.680> our<00:02:01.829> circuit<00:02:02.310> course<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.790> we're<00:02:02.939> doing

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
was our circuit course that we're doing

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.530 
was our circuit course that we're doing
so<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.890> do<00:02:05.070> three<00:02:05.430> sets<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> whole<00:02:06.210> entire

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
so you do three sets of the whole entire

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.930 
so you do three sets of the whole entire
circuit<00:02:07.520> starting<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:08.700> weighted<00:02:09.179> dips<00:02:10.940> pump

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
circuit starting with weighted dips pump

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.760 
circuit starting with weighted dips pump
out<00:02:12.120> as<00:02:12.300> many<00:02:12.599> as<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.500> sir

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
out as many as you can on this sir

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.240 
out as many as you can on this sir
that<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.010> want<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.280> go<00:02:14.460> till<00:02:15.300> failure<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:17.070> do

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
that you want to go till failure and do

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.170 
that you want to go till failure and do
through<00:02:17.550> that's<00:02:17.730> tell<00:02:18.060> yer<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.790> start<00:02:21.060> off

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
through that's tell yer so you start off

so<00:02:33.960> you<00:02:34.080> go<00:02:34.200> till<00:02:34.440> failure<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.100> then<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.760> move

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
so you go till failure and then you move

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.080 
so you go till failure and then you move
on<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.570> Machine<00:02:36.930> fly's<00:02:37.340> till<00:02:38.340> failure<00:02:38.610> and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
on to the Machine fly's till failure and

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.210 
on to the Machine fly's till failure and
we<00:02:39.630> are<00:02:39.720> doing<00:02:39.960> about<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.290> hundred<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:40.920> fifty

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.270 
we are doing about a hundred and fifty
pounds<00:02:41.400> on<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.880> machine<00:02:42.180> fly's<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:43.800> think<00:02:44.220> I

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
pounds on the machine fly's I think I

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.280 
pounds on the machine fly's I think I
had<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.550> lower<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.030> little<00:02:45.210> bit<00:02:45.420> after<00:02:45.990> a

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
had to lower it a little bit after a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.610 
had to lower it a little bit after a
couple<00:02:47.100> sets<00:02:47.520> because<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.880> just<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.330> was<00:02:49.110> my<00:02:49.320> form
