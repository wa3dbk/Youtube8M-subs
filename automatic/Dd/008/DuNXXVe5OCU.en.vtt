00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello my name is Stas and this 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.490
 company softklab and such starting 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.559
 os x training 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.259
 I have long promised but that's already mittens 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.030
 prepared and therefore I can with you his 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.770
 start so this is the first lesson about how 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.710
 activate your magician that is after that 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.180
 how did you either buy it or 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.310
 reinstall the system 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.109
 to me here but I thought that those who can already 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.210
 reinstall the system they this lesson does not 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.970
 need can skip it for those who 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.250
 I can't do it somewhere there are three dashes 4 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.620
 will do about how it should be right 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.270
 do wrong if you bought a magician you do it 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.030
 open absolutely any matter 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.480
 carita training equipment for air macbook 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.190
 pro tag is like mine or aimag 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.770
 or macbook them and value all 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.210
 happens exactly the same if you 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.969
 do nothing for a long time you turn on 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.940
 howling solar power is essentially an assistant 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.219
 voice control for your poppy yes 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.690
 because here we have the nipple combo 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.260
 the only company in the world that 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.149
 helps 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.920
 so to speak to use devices 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.860
 those people who unfortunately 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.939
 limited bunk capacity at 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.619
 so since the magician does not know what 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.100
 happens he starts voice 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.439
 control 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.450
 select the country in which you find yes 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.520
 and every time you scroll through it 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.409
 chooses the lights he dictates what 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.540
 now on the screen is on maybe 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.509
 unfortunately you have vision problems 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.820
 So I choose for example Ukraine as 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.600
 naturally live here now layout 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.759
 keyboard 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.009
 and the main keyboard layout is me 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.170
 I leave all the same English date all 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.240
 this is us you can choose any which 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.250
 you have here most likely after 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.640
 activation if you are the first time just 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.750
 bought a macbook and you activate it 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.299
 presumably you will only have us 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.380
 and only Russian here I think so yes 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.000
 because I already many times 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.470
 reinstalled as if i think that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.780
 the system is already just memorizing yes and 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.299
 Ukrainian though I do not use at all but 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.409
 so I was a country of Ukraine she is to me since 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.280
 so activated further choose 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.259
 continue by the way you can hum 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.810
 let's show all date strength brother 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.329
 keyboard which you need further 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.280
 choose everything i am now connecting to 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.280
 to your wifi 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:16.580
 click continue and now you 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.280
 asks to transfer information from 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.280
 another poppy if you have it 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.940
 Then you choose this way 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.880
 transfer information from windows it to 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.260
 your magician's and of course not carry 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.180
 not according to the information just set it up 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.810
 as new i always use this one 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.850
 option so we continue now 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.950
 enter your apple idi 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.459
 what your password led you 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.290
 click continue 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.890
 allow and put I use geo position 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.530
 this mac for find mac the same thing i 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.870
 already told and iPhones as well as 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.640
 I personally recommend using pads. 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.920
 this function in order to 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.380
 further pits but tell me why 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.140
 need that you could god forbid find your 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.239
 poppy either kicked yes and so big we 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.950
 talk about this later naturally 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.450
 license agreement we accept then 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.100
 there is essentially activation happening the same way 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.620
 as iPhones or else on and pa 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.299
 but have you not satisfied whose name you 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.410
 I personally write here she always 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.709
 is used 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.810
 here's an account, I also have the same 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.190
 give out 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.730
 you can change the picture or you can 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.620
 do yourself in that photo 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.330
 let's choose let's say this ball 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.880
 tennis password password is needed 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.260
 surely you can help yourself 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.060
 write me choosing by example 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.690
 one need password for 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.120
 unlock the screen at will in person 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.459
 I don't need to allow this reset 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.090
 password using and palladium recommend 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.980
 this item 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.650
 leave because if you forgot 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.630
 password but remember your apple password 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.720
 and divas you can reset it with 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.970
 using your apple go play watch 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.790
 geo-based belt to send 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.810
 data technogenic diagnosis optional 2 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.820
 ths is optional 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.010
 and here on iphone aachen ipads 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.100
 turn off the function stage is not necessary on the poppy 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.510
 but you can turn it off you can turn it on 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.950
 here it is actually up to discretion 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.540
 fine register this make or 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.900
 no, you can not register it 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.139
 not necessarily therefore 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.020
 click continue and skip to the point 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.780
 1 activation before our poppy she passed 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.970
 already fully ps pay attention about 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.220
 what to set up for yourself here and now 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.580
 enable natural speed settings 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.370
 In principle, the activation speed depends on 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.889
 this you have a hard drive or ssd you 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.100
 well, much more so we us 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.199
 turns on march i mean this is an installation i 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.820
 activated mavrik what is it today 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.070
 the most current operating system 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.860
 not especially between themselves nothing 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.449
 differ mean i have a card 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.210
 memory is inserted so it is here and and 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.280
