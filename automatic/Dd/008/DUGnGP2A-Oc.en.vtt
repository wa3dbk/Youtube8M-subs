good<00:02:23.439> practice<00:02:23.950> actually<00:02:24.159> for<00:02:24.819> your

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
good practice actually for your

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.539 
good practice actually for your
hammer-on<00:02:25.329> technique<00:02:26.129> because<00:02:27.129> you'll<00:02:27.280> find

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
hammer-on technique because you'll find

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.070 
hammer-on technique because you'll find
lots<00:02:27.849> of<00:02:28.200> risks<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.230> have<00:02:29.439> hammer

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.110 

so<00:02:33.080> that's<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.410> first<00:02:33.680> tricks<00:02:33.980> okay<00:02:34.250> hammer

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
so that's the first tricks okay hammer

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.210 
so that's the first tricks okay hammer
and<00:02:35.690> then<00:02:35.960> underneath<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.770> neck<00:02:36.980> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
and then underneath it and the neck the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.800 
and then underneath it and the neck the
next<00:02:37.430> thing<00:02:37.640> you're<00:02:37.790> going<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.000> have<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.630> deal

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
next thing you're going to have to deal

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.870 
next thing you're going to have to deal
with<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.710> problem<00:02:40.010> with<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.220> fleshy<00:02:40.460> end

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
with is the problem with the fleshy end

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.880 
with is the problem with the fleshy end
of<00:02:41.180> your<00:02:41.270> finger<00:02:41.600> touching<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.470> high<00:02:42.860> E

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
of your finger touching the high E

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.680 
of your finger touching the high E
string<00:02:43.130> because<00:02:43.640> we<00:02:43.760> want<00:02:43.970> those<00:02:44.150> two<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.420> ring

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
string because we want those two to ring

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.830 
string because we want those two to ring
out<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.670> what<00:02:49.790> I'm<00:02:49.880> doing<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.210> Down<00:02:50.480> pick<00:02:50.810> a

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
out so what I'm doing is a Down pick a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.560 
out so what I'm doing is a Down pick a
hammer<00:02:51.260> on<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.770> then<00:02:52.190> while<00:02:52.490> my<00:02:52.850> hammered

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
hammer on and then while my hammered

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.840 
hammer on and then while my hammered
note<00:02:53.780> which<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.530> on<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.800> third<00:02:55.040> fret<00:02:55.340> is<00:02:55.580> still

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
note which is on the third fret is still

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.890 
note which is on the third fret is still
ringing

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
ringing

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.270 
ringing
pick<00:02:58.470> up<00:02:58.709> on<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.310> high<00:02:59.459> E<00:02:59.489> string<00:02:59.730> like<00:03:00.209> this

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.500 

now<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.340> trick<00:03:05.609> is<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.760> make<00:03:05.999> these<00:03:06.209> three

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
now the trick is to make these three

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.760 
now the trick is to make these three
notes

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
get on a hammer pick up you can do that

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.630 
get on a hammer pick up you can do that
any<00:03:41.140> combination<00:03:41.769> of<00:03:41.920> two<00:03:42.040> strings<00:03:42.370> if<00:03:42.519> you

any combination of two strings if you
know<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.879> scale<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:47.250> said<00:03:48.250> right<00:03:48.430> now<00:03:48.459> we're

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
know the scale I said right now we're

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.140 
know the scale I said right now we're
working<00:03:49.150> on<00:03:49.269> this

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
working on this

and the secret is to make the nose sound
like<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.370> was<00:04:02.459> spit

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000

okay<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:08.050> should<00:04:08.290> have<00:04:08.470> that<00:04:08.680> by<00:04:08.890> now<00:04:09.070> and

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
okay you should have that by now and

okay you should have that by now and
then<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.760> next<00:04:10.000> thing<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.210> to<00:04:10.330> just<00:04:10.360> join<00:04:10.780> it

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
then the next thing is to just join it

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.990 
then the next thing is to just join it
with<00:04:10.930> notes<00:04:11.260> in<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.530> scale<00:04:11.680> you<00:04:12.460> could<00:04:12.610> repeat

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
with notes in the scale you could repeat

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.790 
with notes in the scale you could repeat
this<00:04:13.210> cycle

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
this cycle

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.699 
this cycle
more<00:04:16.459> than<00:04:16.670> once

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.990 
and like I said you could make this a
longer<00:05:22.260> cycle<00:05:22.830> I<00:05:22.919> just<00:05:23.130> wrote<00:05:23.340> it<00:05:23.370> out<00:05:23.580> for<00:05:23.850> one

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
longer cycle I just wrote it out for one

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.129 
longer cycle I just wrote it out for one
