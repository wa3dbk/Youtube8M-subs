the crystal skull from indiana jones it

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.310 
the crystal skull from indiana jones it
has<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.960> same<00:05:12.230> size<00:05:12.560> of<00:05:12.890> treads<00:05:13.280> and<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:14.320> same

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
has the same size of treads and the same

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.520 
has the same size of treads and the same
style<00:05:15.680> of<00:05:16.660> chassis<00:05:17.980> it's<00:05:18.980> a<00:05:19.280> nice<00:05:20.530> smart

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
style of chassis it's a nice smart

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.360 
style of chassis it's a nice smart
looking<00:05:24.010> mechanism<00:05:25.010> it's<00:05:25.250> got<00:05:25.490> a<00:05:25.520> swivel

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
looking mechanism it's got a swivel

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.550 
looking mechanism it's got a swivel
weapon<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:31.400> thing<00:05:31.940> does<00:05:32.180> spin<00:05:32.570> I<00:05:32.810> think

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
weapon the the thing does spin I think

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.650 
weapon the the thing does spin I think
so<00:05:33.710> what<00:05:33.860> it<00:05:33.980> is<00:05:34.010> is<00:05:34.340> an<00:05:34.550> underwater<00:05:35.120> mining

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
so what it is is an underwater mining

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.210 
so what it is is an underwater mining
