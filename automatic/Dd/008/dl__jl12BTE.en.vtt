00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.039
 realistic texture you asked for and here 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.590
 I'm late I did a research one 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.260
 little advanced search and I researched more 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.380
 I found the texture so let's go 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.669
 the name of the personal texture is conquest 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.140
 cancun east 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.000
 I think that's the way it is in your name. 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.850
 so let's go then 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.309
 I separated the two cows from the cow with 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.280

 You can see the texture is realistic. 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.750

 You can tell her 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.630
 I think the person used block of stone 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.450

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.710
