00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.020
 What I want to do in this video 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.780
 The basics are thought of in a slightly different way 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.940
 Which would be useful in several areas 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.210
 And also in many examples 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.370
 In the previous video, we saw that the number was as many as a number 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.630
 Means multiplying that number in itself several times 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.780
 If we have a negative number 2 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.740
 And we want to raise it to the 3 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.230
 This means that we take the negative number 2 three times 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.100
 Negative 2, Negative 2, Negative 2 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.360
 We beat them up 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.834
 So, what is this worth? 

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:36.500
 Well, let's see 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.310
 Negative 2 is a negative multiplication 2 is a positive 4 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.800
 A 4 minus 2 is equal to minus 8 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.030
 Thus, this will be equal to 8 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.480
 Another way to think about the basics 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.772
 Instead of saying that you take the negative number 2 three times 

00:00:55.772 --> 00:00:58.313
 You beat them up and this is a logical way to understand the basics 

00:00:58.313 --> 00:00:59.980
 There is another way to understand this 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.770
 This is how many times you do 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.880
 Multiply this number by 1 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.450
 You can see that these two methods are equal 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.930
 It will start with 1 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.210
 You will multiply 1 in minus 2 three times 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.080
 If this is multiplied by a negative of 2, multiplied by a negative of 2, 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.350
 Multiplied by negative 2 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.012
 It is clear that these two figures are equal 

00:01:27.012 --> 00:01:29.470
 Here we took this number and hit it at 1 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.120
 You will also get a negative of 8 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.640
 This method may be more useful 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.410
 To understand the fundamentals in particular 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.040
 When lifting to 1 or 0 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.250
 Let's think about it a bit 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.940
 What is positive 2 (depending on this definition) 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.770
 What is 2S0? 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.470
 We just said that this means 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.740
 How many times will you multiply 1 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.920
 In this issue? 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.250
 I'll have number 1 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.179
 I hit him 2 times 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.280
 Well, if we want to hit him in 2 zero times 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.160
 This means that what remains with me is 1 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.440
 If 2 s is zero, equal 1 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.590
 In fact, any non-zero number is 0 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.551
 Equals 1 depending on that definition 

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:25.300
 I will make another video 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.050
 Which will give a deeper understanding of the foundations 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.430
 Though it seems strange 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.330
 But it is built on one basis to think about the basics 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.812
 He is thinking about the basics this way 

00:02:33.812 --> 00:02:35.270
 This is logical if we think 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.315
 In what equals 2 s1? 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.830
 Let us use this definition given to the foundations 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.840
 Always start with 1, and hit it in 2 for one time 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.690
 We'll just hit it in 2 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.390
 I will use this to beat 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.700
 I will use the dot (dot) 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.160
 We'll hit him in 2 at once 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.700
 If, 1 hit 2 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.380
 Equals 2 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.530
 Any number is 1 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.379
 Equals the same number 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.670
 Sure you are 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.710
 I saw the pattern 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.370
 If we say what equals 2 squared, depending on that definition 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.180
 We start with 1, and we will hit it 2 times 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.630
 Hit 2 hit 2, will equal 4 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.880
 We have seen this in advance 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.710
 2S3 starts with 1 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.150
 Then hit one in two three times 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.050
 Hit 2 Hit 2 Hit 2 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.780
 This will give us a positive 8 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.940
 I may have seen the style here 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.200
 Every time we hit in 2 or I should say 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.420
 Every time we increase the number 2 we will hit in 2 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.920
 Note this, to get 2 s1 from 2 s 0 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.965
 We multiply 2 S 0 by 2 

00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:13.630
 Now I will use the x symbol to express the multiplication 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.440
 Let's get 2S2 from 2S1 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.329
 We'll hit 2 in 2 again 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.620
 This is very logical 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.640
 Because this tells us how often we beat one 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.534
 Multiply 1 in this number 

00:04:30.534 --> 00:04:33.200
 So if you want to get 2 s3 from 2 s2 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.580
 You will hit 2 again 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.740
 This is another way to understand why any number is 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.899
 Equals 1 

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:43.440
 If you go back 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.410
 We did not know what 2S0 equals. 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.420
 And try to find out 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.965
 What does that mean 

00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:50.390
 If we want to get 2 s 2 from 2 s 3 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.630
 We will split on 2 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.170
 We will get 4 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.650
 We will split on 2 again to get 2 s1 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.519
 From 2S2 

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:59.060
 It seems that we must 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.830
 Divide on 2 again to get 2 s 0 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.760
 From 2S1 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.550
 The output will be 1
