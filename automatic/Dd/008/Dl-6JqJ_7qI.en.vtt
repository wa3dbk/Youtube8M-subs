the cars movement isn't actually random
it's<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.969> same<00:01:41.179> movement<00:01:41.479> time<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.649> time

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
it's the same movement time and time

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.099 
it's the same movement time and time
again<00:01:42.950> but<00:01:43.509> depending<00:01:44.509> on<00:01:44.630> how<00:01:44.750> many<00:01:44.810> times

again but depending on how many times

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:46.899 
again but depending on how many times
you<00:01:45.350> get<00:01:45.500> hit<00:01:45.799> will<00:01:46.130> determine<00:01:46.490> where<00:01:46.789> they

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
you get hit will determine where they

it's actually pointed out to me that the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.429 
it's actually pointed out to me that the
cars<00:01:59.740> dodged<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.939> speed<00:02:01.600> boost<00:02:01.869> they<00:02:02.110> changed

lanes<00:02:02.799> right<00:02:03.130> before<00:02:03.490> they<00:02:03.580> get<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.850> them

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.360 

you'll<00:02:53.780> notice<00:02:53.960> the<00:02:54.170> item<00:02:54.530> boxes<00:02:54.950> go<00:02:55.130> along
