intimidate off and I'm pretty afraid of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.340 
intimidate off and I'm pretty afraid of
the<00:00:17.340> tone<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.820> decided<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.180> go<00:00:18.359> into<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.750> cocky

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
the tone so I decided to go into a cocky

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.740 
the tone so I decided to go into a cocky
but<00:00:20.189> he<00:00:20.250> decided<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> drag<00:00:21.000> him<00:00:21.180> down<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.720> I

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
but he decided to drag him down so I

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.259 
but he decided to drag him down so I
should<00:00:22.500> probably<00:00:22.529> sit<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.340> ward<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.000> was

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
should probably sit in a ward but I was

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.890 
should probably sit in a ward but I was
to<00:00:25.080> fear<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> tone<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.519> yeah<00:00:26.820> I'm<00:00:27.119> faster

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
to fear of the tone so yeah I'm faster

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.720 
to fear of the tone so yeah I'm faster
so<00:00:28.080> i<00:00:28.140> guess<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.590> bulky<00:00:29.010> garrus<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.519> he

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
so i guess it's a bulky garrus and he

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460 
so i guess it's a bulky garrus and he
actually<00:00:29.880> has<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.330> wake<00:00:30.599> him<00:00:30.869> welcome

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
actually has to wake him welcome

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.069 
actually has to wake him welcome
bareness<00:00:31.890> why<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.700> able<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.120> live<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.510> from

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
bareness why is able to live that from

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.340 
bareness why is able to live that from
the<00:00:34.200> punisher<00:00:34.910> pretty<00:00:35.910> nicely<00:00:36.120> even<00:00:36.690> after

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the punisher pretty nicely even after

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
the punisher pretty nicely even after
that<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.770> bury<00:00:38.100> was<00:00:38.250> activated<00:00:38.850> think<00:00:39.719> he

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
that we can bury was activated think he

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.750 
that we can bury was activated think he
would<00:00:40.110> actually<00:00:40.140> live<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:40.950> even<00:00:41.399> though<00:00:41.550> he

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
would actually live one even though he

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.369 
would actually live one even though he
didn't<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.180> one<00:00:42.210> because<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> thing<00:00:42.989> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
didn't have one because the thing that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.970 
didn't have one because the thing that
is<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> bulky<00:00:44.489> Garrett<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.180> speed<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
is a bulky Garrett because I speed it

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.709 
is a bulky Garrett because I speed it
but<00:00:46.980> now<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> go<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.700> Mario<00:00:48.059> knowing<00:00:48.570> that

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
but now I go to the Mario knowing that

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.720 
but now I go to the Mario knowing that
he<00:00:48.930> will<00:00:49.110> probably<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.829> told<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.399> decided

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
he will probably not told so I decided

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.020 
he will probably not told so I decided

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
here comes up Zapdos and i don't think i

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.910 
here comes up Zapdos and i don't think i
can<00:03:39.329> want<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.750> hear<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.140> scepters<00:03:40.560> because

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
can want to hear the scepters because

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.449 
can want to hear the scepters because
i'm<00:03:41.430> pretty<00:03:41.670> sure<00:03:41.820> it's<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.090> bulky<00:03:42.450> zapdos<00:03:43.459> but

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
i'm pretty sure it's a bulky zapdos but

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.280 
i'm pretty sure it's a bulky zapdos but
I'm<00:03:44.790> actually<00:03:45.060> able<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.510> take<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:45.870> out<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.140> one

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
I'm actually able to take it out in one

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.380 
I'm actually able to take it out in one
hit<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:46.799> guess<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.340> like<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.790> sweeping

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
hit so I guess that is like a sweeping

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.360 
hit so I guess that is like a sweeping
scepters<00:03:48.959> because<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.530> took<00:03:49.859> it<00:03:50.070> out<00:03:50.100> in<00:03:50.280> one

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
scepters because I took it out in one

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.770 
scepters because I took it out in one
hit<00:03:50.870> but<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.930> yam<00:03:53.209> substance<00:03:54.209> would<00:03:54.329> have<00:03:54.450> been

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
hit but a yam substance would have been

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.569 
hit but a yam substance would have been
a<00:03:54.810> big<00:03:55.109> furniture<00:03:55.440> for<00:03:55.859> my<00:03:55.950> team<00:03:56.190> could

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
a big furniture for my team could

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.280 
a big furniture for my team could
probably<00:03:56.970> take<00:03:57.299> it<00:03:57.450> out<00:03:57.569> to<00:03:57.750> everyone<00:03:57.959> on<00:03:58.109> my

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
probably take it out to everyone on my

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.099 
probably take it out to everyone on my
team<00:03:59.030> so<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.090> was<00:04:00.239> good<00:04:00.450> thing<00:04:00.690> that's<00:04:00.870> wasn't

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
team so it was good thing that's wasn't

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.599 
team so it was good thing that's wasn't
a<00:04:01.260> bulky<00:04:01.560> because<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:01.920> would<00:04:02.040> probably<00:04:02.430> take

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
a bulky because it would probably take

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.059
