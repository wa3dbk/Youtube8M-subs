00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 the relationship between 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.779
 filippo magnini and federica pilgrims 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.790
 confirms the interview given to 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.250
 magazine today where most appear 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.170
 close together that never seems like a 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.130
 far away I remember the crisis experienced in 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.710
 2013 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.770
 after the reconciliation took place a 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.830
 new year the two never left 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.539
 the swimmer in fact explained it there 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.090
 can also leave but if there is a 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.340
 feeling comes naturally to engage for 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.410
 to fix things me and filippo we are 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.960
 experiencing a good time we have matured 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.790
 together federica pilgrims then has 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.860
 declared that in recent times it is 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.510
 an important change occurred in 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.340
 their couple relationship 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.219
 me and filippo we are living a beautiful one 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.500
 moment I don't really know what happened 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.329
 between norm something has changed 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.460
 maybe we made an effort to 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.469
 grow together and we tried to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.420
 understand what we wanted from ours 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.590
 life from that individual and from that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.180
 of couple 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.579
 we have matured together and we have 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.340
 learned to mediate and his partner 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.830
 confirm you must not be afraid of 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.619
 set aside pride crises 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.590
 captain everyone must face them not 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.420
 surrender only a few months ago the couple 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.700
 had stated that despite the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.909
 certainty of the feeling that gathered not 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.229
 they were still ready to make plans 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.570
 also in this case the situation 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.270
 seems to have changed 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.790
 speaking of marriage in fact they exclaim 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.400
 it would be a dream we can't stand 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.229
 distant to get married seems to be 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.900
 the ideal solution for filippo magnini 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.420
 and federica pilgrims who explained 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.509
 of not being able to stay away 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.890
 the swimmer in fact declared not 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.439
 we are more teenagers 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.000
 we need to be together I don't 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.610
 I never believed in long distance relationships 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.119
 we will not be able to stand up and mannini not 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.369
 it's less than that 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.500
 I like to look up and see them 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.420
 tribune gives me strength 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.180
 it makes me feel that we are two that don't 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.969
 they are only on today appear while you are 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.200
 they hug and kiss tenderly 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:05.390
 while showering together 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.390
 if this is not love in who cares
