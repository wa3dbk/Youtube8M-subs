00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.110 

all<00:00:12.929> right<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.230> step-down<00:00:13.500> modules<00:00:14.130> as<00:00:14.400> you

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
all right the step-down modules as you

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.460 
all right the step-down modules as you
saw<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.450> previous<00:00:15.599> video<00:00:15.929> they<00:00:16.289> get<00:00:16.440> a

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
saw in the previous video they get a

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.200 
saw in the previous video they get a
little<00:00:16.710> bit<00:00:16.830> warm<00:00:17.070> as<00:00:17.310> they're<00:00:17.880> doing<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
little bit warm as they're doing the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.470 
little bit warm as they're doing the
stepping<00:00:18.600> down<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.730> I've<00:00:20.730> got<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> couple<00:00:21.240> of

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
stepping down and I've got a couple of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.210 
stepping down and I've got a couple of
fans<00:00:21.990> it's<00:00:22.260> gonna<00:00:22.350> go<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> heat<00:00:22.890> sinks

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
fans it's gonna go on the heat sinks

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.500 
fans it's gonna go on the heat sinks
controlled<00:00:23.640> by<00:00:23.820> an<00:00:23.910> SMD<00:00:24.240> TM<00:00:24.810> one<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:26.330> I'm<00:00:27.330> sure

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
controlled by an SMD TM one and I'm sure

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.269 
controlled by an SMD TM one and I'm sure
you<00:00:27.599> know<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:27.840> about<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.260> if<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:29.160> got

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
you know all about that if not we got

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.710 
you know all about that if not we got
links<00:00:29.670> down<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> bottom<00:00:30.300> where<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.570> see

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
links down the bottom where you can see

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.420 
links down the bottom where you can see
what<00:00:30.869> exactly<00:00:31.199> what<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> TM<00:00:31.800> one's<00:00:32.009> gonna<00:00:32.219> do

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
what exactly what the TM one's gonna do

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.979 
what exactly what the TM one's gonna do
and<00:00:33.260> also<00:00:34.340> I've<00:00:35.340> got<00:00:35.399> 16<00:00:36.090> volt<00:00:36.510> batteries<00:00:36.870> in

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
and also I've got 16 volt batteries in

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.990 
and also I've got 16 volt batteries in
the<00:00:37.050> back<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.500> 12<00:00:38.010> volt<00:00:38.219> battery<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.700> front

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the back a 12 volt battery in the front

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.030 
the back a 12 volt battery in the front
when<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.570> car<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.840> shut<00:00:40.170> off<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.590> don't<00:00:40.649> really

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
when the car is shut off I don't really

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.440 
when the car is shut off I don't really
want<00:00:41.250> them<00:00:41.370> interacting<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.120> each<00:00:42.149> other

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
want them interacting with each other

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.299 
want them interacting with each other
just<00:00:43.170> because<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.620> fact<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> front

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
just because of the fact that the front

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.069 
just because of the fact that the front
battery<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.760> gonna<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:45.030> sitting<00:00:45.809> at<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> little

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
battery is gonna be sitting at a little

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.840 
battery is gonna be sitting at a little
bit<00:00:46.289> higher<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> voltage<00:00:47.190> than<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.550> want<00:00:47.789> it

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
bit higher of a voltage than I want it

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.979 
bit higher of a voltage than I want it
to<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:49.050> basically<00:00:49.829> gonna<00:00:50.010> make<00:00:50.430> my<00:00:50.640> own

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
to so I'm basically gonna make my own

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.920 
to so I'm basically gonna make my own
battery<00:00:51.989> isolator<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.690> make<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> where

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
battery isolator and make it to where

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.660 
battery isolator and make it to where
the<00:00:55.140> front<00:00:55.410> battery<00:00:55.770> connects<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> rear

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the front battery connects to the rear

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.479 
the front battery connects to the rear
only<00:00:57.149> when<00:00:57.360> everything<00:00:57.870> started<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.680> running

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
only when everything started and running

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.760 
only when everything started and running
car<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.090> off<00:01:00.300> 12<00:01:01.050> volt<00:01:01.170> battery<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.530> front

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
car is off 12 volt battery up front

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.820 
car is off 12 volt battery up front
won't<00:01:01.949> even<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.399> touching<00:01:03.140> 16s<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.260> generally

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
won't even be touching 16s I generally

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.890 
won't even be touching 16s I generally
don't<00:01:04.949> want<00:01:05.070> these<00:01:05.670> step-out<00:01:06.180> modules<00:01:06.600> making

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
don't want these step-out modules making

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.270 
don't want these step-out modules making
a<00:01:06.960> bunch<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> heat<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.619> make<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.950> bunch<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
a bunch of heat and make it a bunch of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.570 
a bunch of heat and make it a bunch of
wasted<00:01:08.670> electricity<00:01:09.950> when<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> car<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.250> near

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
wasted electricity when the car is near

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.940 
wasted electricity when the car is near
being<00:01:11.760> used<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:13.080> an<00:01:13.170> 80<00:01:13.380> amp<00:01:13.680> relay

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
being used so I got an 80 amp relay

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.780 
being used so I got an 80 amp relay
right<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:14.810> by<00:01:15.810> air<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.290> use<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.710> for<00:01:16.979> stuff

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
right here by air I use it for stuff

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.870 
right here by air I use it for stuff
like<00:01:17.909> airbags<00:01:18.509> air<00:01:19.229> suspension<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> Tahoe

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
like airbags air suspension on the Tahoe

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
like airbags air suspension on the Tahoe
things<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.770> should<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.040> able

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
things like that and this should be able

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.880 
things like that and this should be able
to<00:01:23.220> carry<00:01:23.479> enough<00:01:24.479> amperage<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.990> run<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> small

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
to carry enough amperage to run a small

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.700 
to carry enough amperage to run a small
floor<00:01:26.159> channel<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.479> car<00:01:27.689> itself<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.590> is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
floor channel and the car itself this is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.109 
floor channel and the car itself this is
in<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.430> everything<00:01:29.670> totally

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
in and I have everything totally

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.330 
in and I have everything totally
separated<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.930> actually<00:01:31.890> totally<00:01:32.220> together

keys at then I'll be ready to start the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.490 
keys at then I'll be ready to start the
new<00:01:36.270> steps<00:01:36.570> which<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.930> ripping<00:01:37.259> off<00:01:37.350> the

port doing all sorts of little things it

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.840 
port doing all sorts of little things it
takes<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.200> gain<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.380> couple<00:01:43.710> extra<00:01:43.950> DB<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.490> don't

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
takes to gain a couple extra DB I don't

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.550 
takes to gain a couple extra DB I don't
know<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.000> I'm<00:01:45.090> gonna<00:01:45.240> gain<00:01:45.509> DB<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.079> don't<00:01:46.439> I'm

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
know if I'm gonna gain DB I don't I'm

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.340 
know if I'm gonna gain DB I don't I'm
gonna<00:01:46.649> lose<00:01:46.920> any<00:01:47.130> DB<00:01:47.490> who<00:01:48.060> knows<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.200> only

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
gonna lose any DB who knows but the only

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.359 
gonna lose any DB who knows but the only
thing<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.560> could<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.950> go<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.130> there<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
