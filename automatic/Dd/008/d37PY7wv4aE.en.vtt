00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.670
 Y 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.610
 and good for today who is the 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.189
 new two we want you to see please 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:21.470
 these dog friends who lost the 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:23.450
 style if they thought that dogs do not 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.150
 they like to eat insects are very 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.010
 wrong and here it shows with these 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.230
 canines that by conviction stop at nothing 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.809
 more like the cheeks were left 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.600
 it's definitely these friends are 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.269
 too adventurous but although not what 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.300
 they create many if they like them and some 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:43.130
 but hey spiders eat up the 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.500
 consequences if they can become 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.480
 harmful as well as funny 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.660
 course as in these dog friends 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.730
 they are a little inflamed it turns out that eating 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.980
 or chew with our friends two or 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.050
 three couples is not so dangerous since 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.360
 contain a toxin that only 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.250
 could slightly intoxicate and inflame 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.559
 as you can see here the matter 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.600
 important is to pay attention if it is 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.420
 they get to swallow the sting and this one 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.700
 dig into the esophagus you smell everything is worth 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.390
 exactly because this could cause 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.200
 an inflammation and the real remedy 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.240
 it would cost very expensive but good 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.400
 enjoy and please do it a little 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.070
 of these naughty dogs that received 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.530
 the few pickets nothing more in their 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.080
 cachetes for walking using chewing gum to 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:36.460
 the bees and it seems to me that these 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:38.380
 cachetones inflamed from walking used is 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.270
 they do not know then that they do not know 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.150
 they believe that their friends are bees and 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.150
 bee and friends chews them like 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.000
 we invite you to continue questioning the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.000
