behind that white desk at the end there

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.670 
behind that white desk at the end there
we<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> lot<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.630> private<00:00:33.989> functions<00:00:34.440> here

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
we have a lot of private functions here

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.260 
we have a lot of private functions here
and<00:00:34.980> they<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.190> pull<00:00:35.370> over<00:00:35.489> these<00:00:35.700> blinds<00:00:36.000> as

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.780 
and they can pull over these blinds as
well<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.719> covers<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.110> roof<00:00:38.040> area<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:38.610> it's

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
well so it covers the roof area if it's

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.360 
well so it covers the roof area if it's
a<00:00:38.879> little<00:00:39.090> bit<00:00:39.210> cool<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:40.469> maybe<00:00:40.770> drizzling<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
a little bit cool or maybe drizzling the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.779 
a little bit cool or maybe drizzling the
torch<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.850> not<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.210> often<00:00:42.420> obviously<00:00:43.789> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
torch is not that often obviously and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.180 
torch is not that often obviously and
then<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.059> course<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.329> look<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:45.690> there<00:00:46.190> see

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
then of course you look out there see

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.160 
then of course you look out there see
it's<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.579> I'm<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> distance<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.960> don't<00:00:49.020> I

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
it's see I'm in the distance I don't I

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.690 
it's see I'm in the distance I don't I
clear<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.500> from<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> camera<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.280> could<00:00:50.520> still

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
clear it from the camera you could still

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.270 
clear it from the camera you could still
horizon<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> mirror<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.280> neighboring

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
Island and this is closer to the outside

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.229 
Island and this is closer to the outside
of<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.000> hotel<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.980> turrets<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.090> the

lush beautiful tropical slight greenery

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.330 
lush beautiful tropical slight greenery
around

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.250 

wouldn't<00:01:08.850> cross<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> balconies<00:01:09.690> too<00:01:09.930> much<00:01:10.110> in

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
wouldn't cross the balconies too much in

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.510 
wouldn't cross the balconies too much in
terms<00:01:10.410> of<00:01:10.590> leaning<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> rails<00:01:11.250> because

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
terms of leaning on the rails because

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.860 
terms of leaning on the rails because
they<00:01:11.640> appears<00:01:11.910> to<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.270> screwed<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.720> with

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
they appears to just be screwed on with

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.900 
they appears to just be screwed on with
the<00:01:12.930> one<00:01:13.050> screw<00:01:13.410> in<00:01:13.440> each<00:01:13.650> corner<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
the one screw in each corner and it's a

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.470 
the one screw in each corner and it's a
goof

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
goof

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.410 
goof
so<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.620> would<00:01:17.520> definitely<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> bit<00:01:18.210> worried

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
so I would definitely be a bit worried

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.580 
so I would definitely be a bit worried
about<00:01:18.660> putting<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.080> my<00:01:19.140> way<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> them
