00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.809
 nice to all guys welcome in 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.390
 this new minecraft video and after 5 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.640
 or even six months have finally returned 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.200
 with a video hunger games 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.970
 sorry if it took me a lot but not 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.290
 I would have continued this series until 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.990
 when the 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.190
 computer is what to say finally I am 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.590
 got the new computer 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.559
 from now on I will continue this series 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.449
 surely in fact the first ep is there 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.580
 let's say I didn't continue the series 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.320
 because my computer is the old one 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.839
 I couldn't resist anything 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.409
 in fact it tied the first episode too much 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:51.390
 registered at a friend's home anyway 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:53.699
 we take the kit immediately, it lacks some 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.710
 I'd say take the barbarian 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.710
 let's steal something from the speakers 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.530
 perfect I've never stolen so much 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.630
 stuff anyway stole us 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.960
 however now we break a couple of 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.630
 blocks to level up 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.600
 ok level 1 so we can upgrade the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:21.490
 sword and away 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:25.880
 perfect we arrange the inventory 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.200
 this is that gift and let's go 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.200
 now we run 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.390
 we take the mushrooms for the food there 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.910
 we are a perfect ok soup anyway 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.369
 the server ip is in description if me 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.880
 find write it in chat so maybe 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.380
 let's make a team 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.030
 nothing i'm happy to do tv with you 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.030
 from now on I was thinking of making three videos a 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.909
 week 1 Monday 1 to Wednesday and one 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.729
 Friday 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.679
 ok i was thinking of making a video on monday 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.319
 left-handed but not because I'm doing i 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.810
 bastoncini thought of making a video 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.679
 maximum ie that video right there for 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.420
 understand each other 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.789
 to understand where I register in this way 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.400
 so here characters and so on 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.860
 Wednesday I thought I would continue 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.019
 the hunger games series and Friday instead 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.530
 I thought I was playing a different game than 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:23.580
 minecraft I don't know for example a series 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.040
 on happy wheels indie horror games 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.569
 indie games are not normal 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.290
 maybe even advise me of the 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.629
 beautiful games like that 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:45.560

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.780

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.180
