the<00:01:19.190> organizing<00:01:19.700> for<00:01:19.820> action<00:01:19.850> was<00:01:20.570> sort<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.350> a

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
the organizing for action was sort of a

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.790 
the organizing for action was sort of a
way<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:22.909> could<00:01:23.240> carry<00:01:23.750> on<00:01:23.869> doing<00:01:24.290> some

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
way that I could carry on doing some

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.920 
way that I could carry on doing some
more<00:01:24.979> things<00:01:25.250> after<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:25.940> campaign<00:01:26.630> was<00:01:26.750> over
