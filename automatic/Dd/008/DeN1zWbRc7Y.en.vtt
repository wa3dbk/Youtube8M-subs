the moment ninjas in pyjamas alright
let's<00:00:16.470> begin<00:00:18.350> let<00:00:19.350> us<00:00:19.470> have<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> look<00:00:19.859> at<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
let's begin let us have a look at the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.609 
let's begin let us have a look at the
overview<00:00:20.490> first<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.330> then<00:00:21.990> we'll<00:00:22.199> see<00:00:22.470> each

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
overview first and then we'll see each

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.650 
overview first and then we'll see each
player's<00:00:22.949> role<00:00:23.340> from<00:00:23.580> his<00:00:23.820> own<00:00:23.970> perspective

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
player's role from his own perspective

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.460 
player's role from his own perspective
as<00:00:25.550> you<00:00:26.550> may<00:00:26.730> well<00:00:26.760> see<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.630> idea<00:00:27.960> behind<00:00:28.140> this

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
as you may well see the idea behind this

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.839 
as you may well see the idea behind this
strategy<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.279> cut<00:00:29.550> off<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
strategy is to cut off the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.299 
strategy is to cut off the
reinforcements<00:00:30.599> from<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.960> side<00:00:31.289> or<00:00:31.560> city<00:00:31.920> spawn

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
reinforcements from a side or city spawn

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.060 
reinforcements from a side or city spawn
an<00:00:32.640> attack<00:00:33.450> bomb<00:00:33.690> site<00:00:33.960> V<00:00:34.200> from<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.770> middle

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
an attack bomb site V from the middle

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.630 
an attack bomb site V from the middle
and<00:00:35.280> B<00:00:35.550> tunnel<00:00:36.800> this<00:00:37.800> tactics<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.430> very

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and B tunnel this tactics is very

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.750 
and B tunnel this tactics is very
effective<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:39.090> two<00:00:39.450> reasons<00:00:40.370> first<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.579> all

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
effective for two reasons first of all

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.160 
effective for two reasons first of all
there<00:00:42.239> are<00:00:42.270> rarely<00:00:42.510> more<00:00:42.809> than<00:00:42.870> two

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
there are rarely more than two

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.959 
there are rarely more than two
counter-terrorist<00:00:43.980> defending<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
counter-terrorist defending be and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.520 
counter-terrorist defending be and
middle<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.750> there<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.260> clear

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
middle so there you have a clear

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.410 
middle so there you have a clear
advantage<00:00:46.649> especially<00:00:47.460> when<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> counter

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
advantage especially when the counter

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
advantage especially when the counter
terrorists<00:00:48.870> pong<00:00:49.079> has<00:00:49.289> been<00:00:49.500> smoked<00:00:49.800> properly

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
terrorists pong has been smoked properly

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.810 
terrorists pong has been smoked properly
secondly<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> easy<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.190> flash<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> whole

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
secondly it is easy to flash the whole

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.490 
secondly it is easy to flash the whole
bomb<00:00:54.059> site<00:00:54.329> from<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.660> middle<00:00:54.930> by<00:00:55.079> cussing

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
bomb site from the middle by cussing

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.760 
bomb site from the middle by cussing
flashbang<00:00:55.980> about<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> wall<00:00:57.230> if<00:00:58.230> properly

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
flashbang about the wall if properly

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.160 
flashbang about the wall if properly
coordinated<00:00:59.129> this<00:01:00.120> tactics<00:01:00.570> nearly<00:01:00.930> always

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
coordinated this tactics nearly always

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.910 
coordinated this tactics nearly always
works<00:01:02.660> now<00:01:03.660> let's<00:01:03.930> move<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.409> each<00:01:04.619> player's
