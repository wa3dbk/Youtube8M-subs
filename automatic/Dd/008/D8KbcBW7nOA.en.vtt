00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
need to people and stuff and I think for

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.950 
need to people and stuff and I think for
a<00:01:26.670> lot<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.970> can't<00:01:27.270> really<00:01:27.390> bother<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.869> go

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
a lot of you can't really bother to go

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
a lot of you can't really bother to go
through<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> effort<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.640> that's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
through the effort of that so if that's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880 
through the effort of that so if that's
right<00:01:30.210> let<00:01:30.420> me<00:01:30.450> know<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.740> quite

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
right let me know this was quite

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.530 
right let me know this was quite
difficult<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.400> want<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.579> jump<00:01:32.700> onto<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> case

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
difficult you want to jump onto the case

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.380 
difficult you want to jump onto the case
just<00:01:33.570> over<00:01:33.869> there<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:35.240> you're<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.450 
just over there and then you're going to
do<00:01:36.509> sort<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> hook<00:01:37.079> jump<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.920> jump<00:01:38.340> out

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
do sort of like a hook jump so jump out

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.850 
do sort of like a hook jump so jump out
to<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.670> right<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.850> hold<00:01:39.119> left<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:40.500> you

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
to the right and hold left and you

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.600 
to the right and hold left and you
should<00:01:41.040> make<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:42.619> nice<00:01:43.619> little<00:01:43.829> spot<00:01:44.100> these

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
should make on a nice little spot these

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.520 
should make on a nice little spot these
spots<00:01:45.299> don't<00:01:45.509> need<00:01:45.630> too<00:01:45.780> much<00:01:45.899> commentating

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
spots don't need too much commentating

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.469 
spots don't need too much commentating
over<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:47.369> tutorials<00:01:48.060> because<00:01:48.329> they're

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
over or tutorials because they're

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.530 
over or tutorials because they're
actually<00:01:48.720> quite<00:01:48.780> simple<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:50.450> they're<00:01:51.450> good

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
actually quite simple but they're good

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.270 
actually quite simple but they're good
to<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.750> not<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.439> an<00:01:52.500> infected<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> lot<00:01:53.189> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
to do not just an infected a lot of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.740 
to do not just an infected a lot of
these<00:01:53.399> spots<00:01:53.700> will<00:01:53.850> be<00:01:53.880> good<00:01:54.060> normal<00:01:54.450> matches

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
these spots will be good normal matches

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.889 
these spots will be good normal matches
as<00:01:54.869> well<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.880> know<00:01:56.880> people<00:01:57.000> hate<00:01:57.270> campers<00:01:57.750> but

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
as well I know people hate campers but

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.270 
as well I know people hate campers but
if<00:01:57.990> you've<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.439> started<00:01:58.680> out<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> game

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
if you've just started out on the game

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.340 
if you've just started out on the game
camping<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.210> quite<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> useful<00:02:00.659> technique<00:02:00.960> for

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
camping is quite a useful technique for

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.780 
camping is quite a useful technique for
you<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.560> learn<00:02:01.680> how<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.920> shoot<00:02:02.219> properly<00:02:02.430> learn

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
you to learn how to shoot properly learn

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.789 
you to learn how to shoot properly learn
how<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.540> your<00:02:03.659> bearing<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.170> how<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.350> aim<00:02:04.619> I

how to get your bearing on how to aim I
think<00:02:05.490> most<00:02:05.700> people<00:02:05.939> have<00:02:06.030> been<00:02:06.149> campus<00:02:06.509> at

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
think most people have been campus at

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.570 
think most people have been campus at
one<00:02:06.719> point<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.990> their<00:02:07.140> life<00:02:07.259> or<00:02:07.290> not<00:02:07.590> maybe<00:02:08.399> not

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
one point in their life or not maybe not

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.430 
one point in their life or not maybe not
hardcore<00:02:08.819> campus<00:02:09.300> again<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.289> another

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
hardcore campus again this is another

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.809 
hardcore campus again this is another

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
out left and hold right and you should

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.580 
out left and hold right and you should
get

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
get

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.119 
get
you<00:02:14.190> go<00:02:14.340> up<00:02:14.550> into<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.790> corner<00:02:15.030> here<00:02:16.129> unlikely

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
you go up into the corner here unlikely

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.530
