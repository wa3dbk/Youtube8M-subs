00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
new deck yeah looks basically the same

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.850 
new deck yeah looks basically the same
except<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:32.960> even<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> Joker's<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
except just even the Joker's so you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.800 
except just even the Joker's so you
really<00:01:35.070> small<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.759> center<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> then<00:01:36.420> just

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
really small the center and then just

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.230 
really small the center and then just
everything<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:38.399> just<00:01:38.610> jumbles<00:01:39.000> us<00:01:39.149> a

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
everything is it just jumbles us a

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.789 
everything is it just jumbles us a
little<00:01:39.390> easier<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.899> see<00:01:40.170> when<00:01:40.470> you're<00:01:40.590> playing

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
little easier to see when you're playing

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.880 
little easier to see when you're playing
poker<00:01:41.700> games<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.210> stuff<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.930> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
poker games and stuff like that like I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.679 
poker games and stuff like that like I
probably<00:01:44.009> won't<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.579> using<00:01:44.820> these<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.119> magic

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
probably won't be using these for magic

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.830 
probably won't be using these for magic
ever<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.680> deck<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.070> my<00:01:47.189> collection

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.440 
only difference is is instead Eric ocean
finish<00:03:53.280> which<00:03:53.519> I<00:03:53.639> believe<00:03:53.880> it's<00:03:54.030> still<00:03:54.120> has

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
finish which I believe it's still has

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.170 
finish which I believe it's still has
his<00:03:54.840> jumbo<00:03:55.139> index<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:55.980> side<00:03:56.250> there<00:03:56.579> the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
his jumbo index on the side there the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.809 
his jumbo index on the side there the
pips<00:03:57.690> are<00:03:58.019> obviously<00:03:58.500> bigger<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.130> everything

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
pips are obviously bigger and everything

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.909 
pips are obviously bigger and everything
squished<00:04:00.150> into<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.419> center<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.019> for<00:04:01.680> some

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
squished into the center and for some

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.289 
squished into the center and for some
reason<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.340> biggest<00:04:02.669> difference<00:04:03.030> is<00:04:03.269> that

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
reason the biggest difference is that

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.339 
reason the biggest difference is that
there's<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.930> seal<00:04:04.919> on<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.519> front<00:04:05.989> and<00:04:06.989> it<00:04:07.079> opens

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
there's a seal on the front and it opens

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.319 
there's a seal on the front and it opens
up<00:04:07.470> front<00:04:07.950> that's<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.400> really<00:04:08.760> big<00:04:08.910> difference

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
up front that's a really big difference

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.740 
up front that's a really big difference
I<00:04:09.510> was<00:04:10.139> not<00:04:10.290> expecting<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:10.889> when<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.220> first

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
I was not expecting that when I first

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.449 
I was not expecting that when I first
went<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.870> get<00:04:13.079> these<00:04:13.260> that's<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.739> jumbo<00:04:14.069> index

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
went to get these that's the jumbo index
