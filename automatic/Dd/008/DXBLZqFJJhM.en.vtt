00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello everybody from the previous video we 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.719
 we showed this helicopter running 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.330
 with solar energy 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:16.790
 now we will show the details of the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.790
 connections made in this helicopter 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.520
 see our helicopter running 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.030
 i 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 we will now show the inner part of this 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.680
 structure 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.320
 he will remove this part is to see the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.260
 there is a plastic cap 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.350
 we took advantage of this plastic lid 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.630
 where the helicopter is now we 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.680
 we will dismantle alicoop first we will 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:23.160
 remove propeller and now we will remove the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:28.800
 helicopter is now we'll take the 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:32.880
 underneath that cap cover we had 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.610
 then one motor to the motor connection 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.390
 Helicopter propeller was through this 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.660
 part of the pen 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:52.430
 we will now place the helicopter on the 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:55.200
 engine to follow the propeller and now 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.660
 we will withdraw the appropriation of the photocell 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.780
 the engine propeller starts to 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.780
 to spin 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.300
 Note that in addition to rotating the propeller 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.780
 own helicopter also revolves around 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.950
 of its own axis 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.530
 now we will show our 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.830
 helicopter running on all 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.830
 resources 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.270
 is 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:53.300
 we do not have the audio of the 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:58.390
 cell phone making the sound of a helicopter 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.390
 we're just the engine noise 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.450
 folks 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.170
 we take advantage of the subject matter 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.350
 let's talk about the helipad that is this symbol 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.860
 with this design the helipad is an area 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.770
 ground level or generally located 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.640
 on top of a building used 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.700
 only for landings and take - offs of 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.700
 helicopters 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.830
 the sag points can be square or 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:33.020
 circular and should be centered 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.910
 shall be the indicative letter of the 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.300
 example shown here we have a 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.790
 helipad where we have the letter h 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.970
 this letter h shows that this point is a 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.370
 heliponto public and that two means 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.310
 amount of tons it supports 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.160
 a public helipad that supports up to 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.390
 two tons 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.780
 here we have an example of a 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.840
 private helipad is that it supports up to six 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.570
 tons 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.940
 In this we have a military helipad are 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.650
 for military helicopters and that 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.650
 up to nine tonnes 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.549
 This is a helipad for 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.030
 hospitals 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:20.209
 he has this cross with h in the center of the 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.690
 cross the helipads that have a circle 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.590
 are points for emergencies and if he 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.919
 emergency point supports up to 700 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.040
 when we have 10 before 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.910
 number means that it supports less 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.780
 one ton 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:43.520
 in this case 700 kilos is the limit 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:46.090
 bearable so it personal point and 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.419
 so we finished our video 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.770
 showing the secrets used in our 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:57.440
 experience with solar energy 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.110
 staff to join our channel on the 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.129
 youtube and look forward to our next 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.750
 videos 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.750
 A big hug to everyone
