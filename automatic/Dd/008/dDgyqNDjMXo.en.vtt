00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello everyone am betty and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.269
 welcome once again to my channel today 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.490
 I come to tell you about the new interface 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:10.980
 this YouTube channel that 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.860
 I personally think it's a good turd 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.630
 big big fat and good I'm going to give my 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.330
 explanations and good then and to you 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.900
 you think and leave your comments what 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.960
 first of all 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.869
 the channel banner will leave you a space 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.610
 very limited that you can put two 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.739
 nonsense and that's it 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:35.320
 then you have a picture of your channel 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.540
 avatar that covers the banner or if already 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.820
 you had little space they put the photo there 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.250
 very big so that it covers you more 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.320
 banner and then you have the links by 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.390
 example to twitter to facebook also that 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.440
 they cover the banner then what the fuck 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.979
 we put there since you intend youtube 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.220
 that you pretend to what we are 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:01:00.640
 partners and what options we have now 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.470
 different from the others but good 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.150
 first thing is first the banner this 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.040
 that is bullshit 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.090
 we have a banner we do not have those of the 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.170
 sides or anything zero customization 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.060
 then we have the at the beginning we have the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.460
 east icon of the house 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.570
 that for example one that is not subscribed 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.759
 to my channel 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.310
 I can put a video for a video of 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.409
 many english presentation good 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.850
 many people who have tried the 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.490
 channel this new 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.130
 They put a presentation video in 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.100
 plan knows I make a video just for 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.560
 the people who are not subscribed to my channel 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.270
 gilipollez a bullshit instead of 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.979
 make an exclusive video for people who 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.689
 is not subscribed to your channel because you put 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.640
 a video of what you usually like 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.490
 do there then as the main video 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.740
 that you have in your normal channel that 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.390
 people see what you do not explain 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.520
 what it does is for that they see that 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.190
 would be as normal as I say I say I 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.680
 what do I say, call me crazy 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.950
 and then for the people who are subscribed 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.790
 then you have to put a video 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.340
 highlighted as normally happened in the 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.190
 previous channel design and then already 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.750
 if 2 arrows come left and 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.290
 right and you're browsing between the videos 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.180
 recently uploaded and right next to 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.510
 that you have your recent activity that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.580
 a part this seems fine to me because 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.700
 if I like a person who does not 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.520
 has many subscribers 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.890
 Well, people almost see the first thing 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.349
 get into my channel is the video of the 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.140
 person that I have given him like and want 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.420
 help him that's fine it's okay I'm not going to 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.510
 say that everything is wrong because that is 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.130
 ok but good then lower down 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.170
 and you have the playlists 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.930
 you have the meeting videos for example 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.150
 put first the recent videos and 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.180
 they come out in order but for example by 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.129
 example you have the other lists of 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.680
 reproductions but that are upside down or 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.750
 whether I want the list of 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.769
 revolution for example from my videos of 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.690
 color 24 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.700
 the new first ones appear because I 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.769
 when the first video commented on with 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.840
 the 24 because maybe not maybe not 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.610
 I told him the same as now before 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.560
 it was a fucking shit compared to with 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.829
 as I comment now then the people who 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.959
 is going to see nor my videos of 4 going to 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.110
 say it's this fucking shit and it's not 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.829
 that's not the case then we go to the 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.829
 video tab 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.250
 Well you have the recent videos and this 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.180
 it's like in the previous channel design 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.890
 that you get the uploaded videos 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.740
 you can choose by playlist 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.300
 by events or by I like it and then 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.220
 You can sort by most popular 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.650
 older date that's the same as 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.380
 it happens that I changed places not and with 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.660
 the new interface is of the cojones 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.820
 then we have then we have in the 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.800
 tab for more information we have 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.540
 the description of the channel that sends 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.130
 guevos that to see the description of 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.340
 channel we have to move to a tab 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.720
 bet instead of colo colo clarito that 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.250
 I was before you know that you got into 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.080
 channel you had all the video presentation 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.090
 you had the videos the lists of 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.860
 reproduction down to the right the 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.780
 information above right because 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.880
 I was all perfect is that I was 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.600
 perfect to a perfect channel 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.220
 and they have changed it that I now 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.350
 put a channel of someone with this new 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.570
 interface and is that I do not stop to read the 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.770
 description of the channel I personally 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.500
 no and it is and then what's 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.240
 that you can put channels from your friends and 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.910
 such is also there in the tab 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.110
 more information than if the same say 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.760
 if you want to help someone who has 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.430
 few subscribers 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.910
 this part is no longer good to this 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.400
 part already you have to go very far to 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.580
 for that but good definition that I 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:53.200
 just the time it's a fucking shit 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.580
 youtube every day does things or is done 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.110
 he thinks he's doing better things 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.960
 but it's not like that the only thing he does is 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.580
 shit more and more and more and by the fact 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.280
 how good I know is google 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.710
 now youtube and want to put the 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.970
 interface so more like google 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.300
 definition that I personally 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.920
 because after all we're going 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.120
 to have all sooner or later so 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.670
 I already put it to get used to 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.740
 and that I do not get caught simply 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.220
 that's why I do not like it more so 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.180
 Well, that leave your comments 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.730
 in the comments section 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.470
 How smart the new one seems 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.330
 interface if you have not seen it 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.770
 you can have a look at my channel and 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.300
 say it in the comments 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.950
