a lot of you liked it and it was

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.120 
a lot of you liked it and it was
something<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:06.660> quite<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.589> majority<00:00:08.099> of

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
something that quite the majority of

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.799 
something that quite the majority of
people<00:00:08.429> really<00:00:08.700> wanted<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.059> see<00:00:09.269> because<00:00:09.540> they

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
people really wanted to see because they

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.930 
people really wanted to see because they
just<00:00:09.960> didn't<00:00:10.290> know<00:00:10.410> how<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:11.340> chemistry<00:00:11.519> works

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
just didn't know how the chemistry works

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.150 
just didn't know how the chemistry works
and<00:00:12.179> everything<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.870> obviously<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.650> nice

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
and everything and obviously a nice

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.519 
and everything and obviously a nice
explanation<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:15.059> always<00:00:15.360> needed<00:00:15.630> because

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
explanation is always needed because

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.750 
explanation is always needed because
sometimes<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.070> can<00:00:17.190> take<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.369> while<00:00:17.460> to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
sometimes it can take a while to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.240 
sometimes it can take a while to
understand<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.680> that<00:00:19.680> if<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.920> don't<00:00:20.070> get<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
understand and that if you don't get the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.340 
understand and that if you don't get the
right<00:00:20.400> information<00:00:20.430> but<00:00:21.420> anyway<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.109> is

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
right information but anyway this is

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.070 
right information but anyway this is
going<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.279> last<00:00:23.550> or<00:00:24.420> second<00:00:24.869> last

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
straight away well there we go that's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.399 
straight away well there we go that's
out<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.920> way<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.449> one<00:01:03.449> no<00:01:03.600> doubt<00:01:03.780> halftime

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
out the way and one no doubt halftime

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.740 
out the way and one no doubt halftime
here<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.010> i<00:01:05.580> think<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.060> dani<00:01:06.390> álvarez

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
here and i think this is dani álvarez

but<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.740> was<00:01:19.890> recorded<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.310> while<00:01:20.460> ago

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
but this was recorded a while ago

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.789 
but this was recorded a while ago
because<00:01:20.939> I've<00:01:21.000> now<00:01:21.180> sold<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.200> dani<00:01:22.439> álvarez

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
because I've now sold the dani álvarez

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.690 
because I've now sold the dani álvarez
and<00:01:23.040> i<00:01:23.070> made<00:01:23.450> 300<00:01:24.450> 400<00:01:24.750> k<00:01:25.290> profit<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.920> him<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and i made 300 400 k profit on him so it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.310 
and i made 300 400 k profit on him so it
was<00:01:26.790> obviously<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.420> worthy<00:01:27.990> investment<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:29.060> I

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
was obviously a worthy investment and I

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.499 
was obviously a worthy investment and I
don't<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.470> he<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:32.130> did<00:01:32.729> end<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.270> changing

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
don't know he just I did end up changing

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.270 
don't know he just I did end up changing
to<00:01:33.869> right<00:01:34.049> wing<00:01:34.259> back<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> tried<00:01:34.920> him<00:01:35.070> out<00:01:35.130> in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
to right wing back and tried him out in

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.760

the<00:01:35.369> right<00:01:35.549> wing<00:01:35.790> position<00:01:36.320> but<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.710> know

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the right wing position but I don't know

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
the right wing position but I don't know
because<00:01:38.130> I've<00:01:38.369> been<00:01:38.400> losing<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.970> chemistry

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
because I've been losing the chemistry

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
because I've been losing the chemistry
in<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.079> didn't<00:01:40.530> work<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.040> got
