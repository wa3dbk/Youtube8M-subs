00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.960 

the<00:02:05.710> devil<00:02:05.980> part<00:02:06.190> on<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.400> most<00:02:06.640> complicated

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
the devil part on this most complicated

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.850 
the devil part on this most complicated
body<00:02:07.300> has<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.750> most<00:02:07.900> amount<00:02:08.140> of<00:02:08.230> tubes

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
body has the most amount of tubes

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.400 
body has the most amount of tubes
I<00:02:08.890> think<00:02:09.730> it's<00:02:09.880> been<00:02:10.030> canceled<00:02:10.420> at<00:02:10.480> over<00:02:10.810> 200

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
I think it's been canceled at over 200

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.630 
I think it's been canceled at over 200
separate<00:02:11.740> rows<00:02:11.980> points<00:02:12.430> for<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.820> whole<00:02:12.970> boys

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.210 

so<00:02:17.210> prep<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.170> tubes<00:02:18.500> with<00:02:18.740> double<00:02:18.950> prod<00:02:19.190> on

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
so prep the tubes with double prod on

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.090 
so prep the tubes with double prod on
embracive<00:02:20.210> just<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.930> frame<00:02:21.260> takes<00:02:21.590> 15<00:02:21.950> hours

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
embracive just the frame takes 15 hours

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.690 
embracive just the frame takes 15 hours
because<00:02:22.970> there<00:02:23.240> are<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:23.570> many<00:02:23.600> tubes<00:02:24.020> in<00:02:24.230> there

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
because there are so many tubes in there

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.520 
because there are so many tubes in there
and<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.820> takes<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.240> number<00:02:26.360> 15<00:02:26.840> hours<00:02:27.140> for<00:02:27.410> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
and it takes the number 15 hours for the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.200 
and it takes the number 15 hours for the
Redhawks<00:02:28.220> front<00:02:28.610> forks<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.970> be<00:02:29.060> made<00:02:31.150> if<00:02:32.150> you
