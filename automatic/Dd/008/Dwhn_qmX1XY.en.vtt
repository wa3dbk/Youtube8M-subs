talking<00:02:55.849> about<00:02:56.120> Rachel<00:02:56.480> here<00:02:56.629> so<00:02:56.780> I'm<00:02:56.840> gonna

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
talking about Rachel here so I'm gonna

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.020

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
let Rachel answer that question I think

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.449 
let Rachel answer that question I think
it's<00:02:59.780> because<00:02:59.989> nobody<00:03:00.650> knows<00:03:00.920> what<00:03:01.099> I<00:03:01.190> really

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
it's because nobody knows what I really

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.309 
it's because nobody knows what I really
look<00:03:01.670> like<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:02.299> think<00:03:02.900> it's<00:03:03.019> more<00:03:03.079> of<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
look like I think it's more of the

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.890 
look like I think it's more of the
hidden<00:03:03.709> persona<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.519> I<00:03:04.579> like<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.299> bring<00:03:05.750> out

hidden persona that I like I bring out
so<00:03:06.829> yeah<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.069> think<00:03:07.159> it's<00:03:07.459> just<00:03:07.489> because<00:03:07.670> I'm<00:03:07.939> a

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
so yeah I think it's just because I'm a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.640 
so yeah I think it's just because I'm a
booty<00:03:08.269> clapping<00:03:08.720> whore<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.230> like<00:03:09.379> to<00:03:09.530> have
