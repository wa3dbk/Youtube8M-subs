00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
of comparison we can do the same test

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.750 
of comparison we can do the same test
with<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.400> homeland<00:02:49.760> shotgun<00:02:50.500> okay<00:02:51.670> here<00:02:52.670> we

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
distance I know this is a crude test but

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.920

take a take a look at the silence -
shotgun<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:03.360> thought<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:03.900> was<00:04:04.110> pretty<00:04:04.200> cool

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
shotgun I thought this was pretty cool

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.830 
shotgun I thought this was pretty cool
the<00:04:04.709> only<00:04:04.920> drawback<00:04:05.400> with<00:04:05.610> this<00:04:05.640> is<00:04:06.120> it's<00:04:06.690> a

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
the only drawback with this is it's a

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.960 
the only drawback with this is it's a
primary<00:04:07.230> weapon<00:04:07.650> so<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.010> means<00:04:08.370> giving<00:04:08.880> up

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
primary weapon so that means giving up

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.930 
primary weapon so that means giving up
my<00:04:09.299> brushes<00:04:09.870> sniper<00:04:10.620> rifle<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.519> don't<00:04:11.730> know<00:04:11.819> if

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
my brushes sniper rifle I don't know if

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.150 
my brushes sniper rifle I don't know if
I<00:04:12.030> could<00:04:12.150> bear<00:04:12.329> with<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.510> but<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:13.590> know<00:04:13.739> anyway

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
I could bear with it but you know anyway

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.159 
I could bear with it but you know anyway
so<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.459> give<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> shot<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.390> actually<00:04:15.660> has

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
so I give it a shot and it actually has

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.580 
so I give it a shot and it actually has
stealth<00:04:16.709> applications<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.760> really<00:04:18.590> really

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
stealth applications that really really

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.740 
stealth applications that really really
works<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:20.549> know<00:04:20.639> you<00:04:20.790> can<00:04:20.940> actually<00:04:21.060> use<00:04:21.540> it

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
works you know you can actually use it

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.960 
works you know you can actually use it
in<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:22.260> stealth<00:04:22.669> environment<00:04:23.669> like<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.880> know

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
in a stealth environment like you know

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.490 
in a stealth environment like you know
this<00:04:24.150> as<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.419> stealth<00:04:24.840> attack<00:04:25.139> is<00:04:25.290> pretty

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
this as the stealth attack is pretty

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.990 
this as the stealth attack is pretty
quiet<00:04:25.680> I'm<00:04:26.130> going<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.430> show<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:26.580> in<00:04:26.790> another

quiet I'm going to show you in another
video<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.600> used<00:04:28.229> it<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.530> take<00:04:28.650> down<00:04:28.889> a<00:04:28.919> three-man

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
video I used it to take down a three-man

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.510 
video I used it to take down a three-man
guard<00:04:29.970> post<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.950> through<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.070> same<00:04:32.280> test

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
guard post and through the same test

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.159 
guard post and through the same test
here<00:04:32.760> it's<00:04:33.240> going<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.450> come<00:04:33.600> out<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.840> same<00:04:33.990> as

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
here it's going to come out the same as

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.860 
here it's going to come out the same as
the<00:04:34.229> whole<00:04:34.380> night<00:04:34.910> nine<00:04:35.910> shots<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.479> get<00:04:36.600> this

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
the whole night nine shots to get this

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.180 
the whole night nine shots to get this
truck<00:04:37.800> critically<00:04:38.310> damaged<00:04:39.800> now<00:04:40.800> in<00:04:40.950> charge

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
truck critically damaged now in charge

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.170 
truck critically damaged now in charge
there<00:04:41.400> we<00:04:41.490> go<00:04:41.610> on<00:04:41.729> the<00:04:41.789> spewing<00:04:42.180> black<00:04:42.450> smoke

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
there we go on the spewing black smoke

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.670 
there we go on the spewing black smoke
pick<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.300> fire<00:04:45.570> rate<00:04:45.870> is<00:04:45.990> probably<00:04:46.320> about<00:04:46.500> the

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
pick the fire rate is probably about the

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.830 
pick the fire rate is probably about the
same<00:04:46.889> -<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:50.250> only<00:04:50.400> thing<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.729> it's<00:04:51.300> silenced

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
same - the only thing is it's silenced

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.760 
same - the only thing is it's silenced
so<00:04:52.200> and<00:04:52.470> it<00:04:52.620> works<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:53.039> actually<00:04:53.220> works

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.360 

so<00:04:56.770> that's<00:04:57.370> that<00:04:58.560> like<00:04:59.560> it's<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.920> only<00:05:00.190> thing

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
so that's that like it's the only thing

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.040 
so that's that like it's the only thing
I<00:05:00.520> don't<00:05:00.580> like<00:05:00.820> about<00:05:00.940> this<00:05:01.360> is<00:05:01.630> it's<00:05:01.930> a

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
I don't like about this is it's a

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.870

my rocket launcher for this especially

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.060 
my rocket launcher for this especially
in<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.050> beginning<00:05:44.350> of<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.500> game<00:05:44.620> you<00:05:44.980> know

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
in the beginning of the game you know

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.710 
in the beginning of the game you know
because<00:05:45.310> then<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.580> rocket<00:05:46.210> launcher<00:05:46.480> only

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720

thing I don't like about it is it's the

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.260 
thing I don't like about it is it's the
sound<00:06:13.900> is<00:06:14.200> not<00:06:14.230> as<00:06:14.860> satisfying<00:06:15.580> as<00:06:15.760> the<00:06:15.940> rocket

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270
