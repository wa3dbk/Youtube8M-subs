00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.280
 electric batteries or a recent invention of daily use with energy 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.130
 our small appliances and according to history were invented in 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.449
 the year 1800 or maybe not 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.449
 random 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.689
 for the reds the counselor 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.970
 because although you think the archeology between your 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.130
 castings 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.519
 has one that surpasses the limits of surprise 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.850
 it's an electric battery with more than two thousand years old and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.210
 which was found in the year 1938 in iraq 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.760
 what scholars found by vase-shaped containers that 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.010
 contained inside it a strange copper cylinder surrounding a rod 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.090
 iron and of course the scientists looked for meaning to 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.090
 zelaya 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.010
 the first examinations determined their antiquity dated from among the years 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.350
 200 27 and 126 before Christ 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.679
 the main researcher the German engineer fine in conil 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.090
 trino the containers with conventional electronic to surprise the rod 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.090
 metal was activated carmen 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.080
 four years later a first scientific report was signed on the content 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.380
 of the vessels assured it works exactly like a pile 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.380
 modern electric 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.780
 a year later according to genre called wide screen india dead will go 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.410
 I was more data on the de facto standard 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.310
 and it was decided to make a peculiar experiment 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.710
 built a replica of the signature and as alkaline liquid I wanted to use 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.300
 some element that was within the reach of the inhabitants of iraq of two 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.370
 a thousand years 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.120
 and the eye originated and another one that had doubt then in a container and 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.210
 causes a respectable amount of the solution and immersed a 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.210
 small silver statuette 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.119
 they succeeded 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.500
 normal 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.520
 He immediately explained the current of his refusal to the supposed aunt of the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.210
 late 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.560
 the result the experience was most disturbing in two hours and as 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.230
 As a result of the electric action, the silver statuette acquired a 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.439
 markedly golden coloration no longer had doubts 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.069
 that strange but rudimentary artifact had been two millennia 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.069
 back nothing more and nothing less than an electric battery 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.909
 Subsequent archaeological investigations uncovered the presence 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.919
 among the ruins new battery similar turns some even greater 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.919
 power that we almost refer 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.579
 the skeptics assure that the earth is no more than an excuse to keep 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.999
 Rolled scrolls and cosmetics have never been able to prove it 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.489
 there are suspicions of the existence of more batteries of these characteristics 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.679
 developed by the bird villages 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:01.399
 today the strip that occupies us is in the archaeological museum of Baghdad 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.260
 the world however the enigma according to some claims has remained 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.790
 buried under the museum allegedly destroyed during the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.739
 bombing of the city continue like this 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.620
 two thousand years later he has returned again akenhead buried under the 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.819
 ruins
