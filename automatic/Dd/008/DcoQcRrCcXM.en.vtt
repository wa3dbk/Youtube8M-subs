00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.880
 today we are going to teach you the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.219
 characteristics of the Bethlehem hull or 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.700
 brand may one of the most sold helmets 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.580
 'the challenge' dotcom 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.170
 the helmet hurts is not designed so much 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:24.289
 for the use of road or mountain if 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:27.739
 you want the visor can be removed 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.340
 so that it takes more case form than 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:35.210
 road after 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.280
 a system that they call in molding that 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.020
 does that when we give ourselves we have a 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.050
 impact 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.850
 in the helmet this dissipates the force of 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.989
 impact thanks 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.000
 to these nerves that have the support 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.290
 consists of kevlar tapes 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.520
 the hitch 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.520
 here on the chin 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.520
 the closing here the business is typically 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.280
 adjust 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.759
 to the size of each one in the part 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.140
 frontal 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:19.590
 we have this gel that is called o2 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 for more comfort on the forehead we do not 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.620
 Leave the mark and it will be much more comfortable 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.550
 It also has great ventilation 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:35.030
 thanks to its longitudinal openings 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.300
 and the hot days will not be 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.030
 nicer 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.990
 and in the back has this 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.680
 reflective to be seen when we go 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.680
 by the road 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.670
