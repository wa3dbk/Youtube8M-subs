00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.750
 your attention is invited so 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.150
 called the fridge glass 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:24.320
 that is, it is a fridge for cooling 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:28.910
 well let's say glasses of water or beer 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:32.759
 he works on the peltier element 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.890
 there is a regular cooler on top of it 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:41.129
 and at the bottom 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.550
 just put on ribbing this with 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.870
 parties 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.860
 cooled part during casting 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:54.949
 the peltier element is the same fridge 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.739
 can be run on a can for 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.699
 shooting from thematic 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.430
 weapons meaning it will be perfect 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:10.200
 autonomous gas variant it is very 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.799
 compact and somewhat larger only 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.490
 pen size plus spray can for 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:23.479
 airguns 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:27.320
 here this machine cools the liquid on 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.970
 10-15 degrees it's pretty 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.280
 thin but it's just 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.130
 experimental sample to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:42.270
 show the possibility of such an option 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:45.960
 cooling drinks this option works 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.450
 from the car cigarette lighter though you can 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.570
 use it and at home if there is a block 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.280
 supply 12 volts and of possible 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.440
 completely different 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:04.270
 defecation here while I'm chatting here you can see 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.300
 that the cup is already fogging 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:12.040
 that is, in 10 minutes it produces 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.350
 cooling drink 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.250
 Now I will raise it to you 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:24.850
 Looked like he looks like the top 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:28.220
 part of this cooler with a fan and the bottom 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.769
 a heat exchanger is made and its length is not 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.000
 should be big since at the expense of 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:38.019
 free convection cold drink 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.850
 goes down the most shuffled there 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:48.500
 everything is very convenient and in general components 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:52.519
 for such apparatik there is for hot 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.540
 the weather is a very good option so 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.600
 same way you can cool and bottle up 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.340
 one and a half liters, respectively 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.320
 increasing a little power from someone or not 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.730
 and thank you all for your attention 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.730
 showing again 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.549
 drug
