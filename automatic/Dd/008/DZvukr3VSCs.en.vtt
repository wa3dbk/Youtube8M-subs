information you can imagine the cost

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.300 
information you can imagine the cost
associated<00:01:31.600> with<00:01:31.960> going<00:01:32.770> all<00:01:32.920> around<00:01:33.040> the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
associated with going all around the

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.480 
associated with going all around the
country<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:34.470> giving<00:01:35.470> physicals<00:01:36.009> to<00:01:36.280> or

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
country and giving physicals to or

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.090 
country and giving physicals to or
bringing<00:01:36.880> 300<00:01:37.570> people<00:01:37.840> into<00:01:38.229> your<00:01:38.440> facility

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
bringing 300 people into your facility

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.190 
bringing 300 people into your facility
so<00:01:39.280> it's<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:40.000> matter<00:01:40.180> of<00:01:40.270> convenience<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:41.110> we

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
so it's a matter of convenience so we

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.320 
so it's a matter of convenience so we
share<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.560> information<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:42.369> then<00:01:42.790> you<00:01:43.270> know

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
share the information and then you know

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330 
share the information and then you know
then<00:01:43.479> obviously<00:01:43.600> you<00:01:44.380> get<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.710> compare<00:01:45.070> them

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
then obviously you get to compare them

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.450 
then obviously you get to compare them
against<00:01:46.000> each<00:01:46.240> other<00:01:46.869> as<00:01:47.110> they<00:01:47.590> begin<00:01:48.310> their

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
against each other as they begin their

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.340 
against each other as they begin their
workouts<00:01:48.820> is<00:01:49.330> there<00:01:49.570> a<00:01:49.600> certain<00:01:49.780> aspect<00:01:50.229> of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
workouts is there a certain aspect of

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.740 
workouts is there a certain aspect of
you<00:01:50.530> want<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.800> see<00:01:51.450> competitiveness<00:01:52.450> out<00:01:52.630> of

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
you want to see competitiveness out of

I mean you know you're not gonna have a
hundred<00:01:59.950> percent<00:02:00.240> participation<00:02:01.240> but

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
hundred percent participation but

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.060 
hundred percent participation but
participation<00:02:02.170> certainly<00:02:02.470> improved<00:02:02.740> over

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
participation certainly improved over

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.580 
participation certainly improved over
over<00:02:03.520> time<00:02:03.729> but<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.840> watch<00:02:05.020> them<00:02:05.200> compete

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
over time but and you watch them compete

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.710 
over time but and you watch them compete
yeah<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.760> know<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:06.909> can't<00:02:07.210> put<00:02:07.390> too<00:02:07.570> much

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
yeah and you know you can't put too much

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.990 
yeah and you know you can't put too much
stock<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.290> and<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:08.619> look<00:02:09.310> back<00:02:09.489> over<00:02:09.670> time

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
stock in it and you look back over time

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.449 
stock in it and you look back over time
guy<00:02:10.720> has<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.899> great<00:02:11.170> combine<00:02:11.650> all<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:12.010> sudden

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
guy has a great combine all of a sudden

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.509 
guy has a great combine all of a sudden
he<00:02:12.610> they<00:02:13.090> say<00:02:13.299> his<00:02:13.480> stock<00:02:13.930> jumps<00:02:14.830> way<00:02:15.010> up<00:02:15.250> and

he they say his stock jumps way up and
he's<00:02:15.880> drafted<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.630> then<00:02:16.870> he<00:02:17.680> can't<00:02:17.920> help<00:02:18.070> you

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
he's drafted and then he can't help you

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.910 
he's drafted and then he can't help you
so<00:02:18.519> you<00:02:18.880> have<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.180> be<00:02:19.209> this<00:02:19.570> is<00:02:19.720> just<00:02:19.870> one<00:02:20.290> one

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
so you have to be this is just one one

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.910 
so you have to be this is just one one
of<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.640> parts<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.209> you<00:02:22.330> it's<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.709> put

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
of the parts that you it's that you put

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.580 
of the parts that you it's that you put
together<00:02:24.040> during<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.940> evaluation<00:02:25.150> process

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
together during the evaluation process

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.710 
together during the evaluation process
it's<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.739> it's<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.130> sophisticated<00:02:27.940> process<00:02:28.150> to

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
it's a it's a sophisticated process to

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.350 
it's a it's a sophisticated process to
evaluate<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.350> college<00:02:29.680> athlete<00:02:30.070> and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
evaluate the college athlete and

you or how he can help you and then

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.800 
you or how he can help you and then
where<00:02:35.019> do<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.290> drafting<00:02:35.799> or<00:02:36.160> no

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
where do you drafting or no

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.460 
where do you drafting or no
correct<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.470> there's<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:39.690> all<00:02:40.230> about

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
correct so there's a it's it's all about

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.680 
correct so there's a it's it's all about
gathering<00:02:40.770> information<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.510> really

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
gathering information and this is really

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.930 
gathering information and this is really
the<00:02:42.870> first<00:02:42.900> step<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.800> process<00:02:43.950> now

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
the first step in that process now

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.040 
the first step in that process now
things<00:02:45.180> are<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.300> little<00:02:45.390> bit<00:02:45.599> different<00:02:45.959> this

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
things are a little bit different this

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.449 
things are a little bit different this
year<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.500> have<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> little<00:02:46.860> bit<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.099> a<00:02:47.220> lag<00:02:47.430> time

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
year you have a little bit of a lag time

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.370 
year you have a little bit of a lag time
between<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.180> combine<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.599> free<00:02:48.959> agency<00:02:49.290> do

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
between the combine and free agency do

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.059 
between the combine and free agency do
you<00:02:49.410> think<00:02:49.620> that's<00:02:49.739> going<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.920> be<00:02:50.040> a

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
you think that's going to be a

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.890 
you think that's going to be a
beneficial<00:02:50.520> thing<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.910> not<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.300> leave

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
beneficial thing to not have to leave

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.420 
beneficial thing to not have to leave
here<00:02:52.170> turn<00:02:52.410> around<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.860> dive<00:02:53.040> right<00:02:53.280> into

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
here turn around and dive right into

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.520 
here turn around and dive right into
that<00:02:53.610> yeah<00:02:53.970> there's<00:02:54.209> no<00:02:54.360> doubt<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.349> more

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
that yeah there's no doubt that the more

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.090 
that yeah there's no doubt that the more
time<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:56.010> have

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
time you have

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.770 
time you have
the<00:02:57.430> better<00:02:57.640> decisions<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.540> make<00:02:58.750> and

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
the better decisions that you make and

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.820 
the better decisions that you make and
so<00:02:59.700> over<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.790> past<00:03:01.030> number<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:02.080> years<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.680> lot

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
so over the past number of years a lot

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.740 
so over the past number of years a lot
of<00:03:02.920> those<00:03:03.070> decisions<00:03:03.580> were<00:03:03.670> made<00:03:03.880> here<00:03:04.240> now<00:03:04.690> we

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
of those decisions were made here now we

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.930 
of those decisions were made here now we
can<00:03:04.990> go<00:03:05.110> back<00:03:05.290> regroup<00:03:05.650> after<00:03:06.430> we're<00:03:06.790> done

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940
