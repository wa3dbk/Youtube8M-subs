00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
civilization fan to really dig into it's

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.340 
civilization fan to really dig into it's
great<00:00:37.730> now<00:00:38.239> that<00:00:38.540> we<00:00:38.629> have<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:38.839> expansion<00:00:39.260> we

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
great now that we have the expansion we

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.259 
great now that we have the expansion we
have<00:00:39.440> 34<00:00:39.920> different<00:00:40.040> civilizations<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:41.030> play

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
have 34 different civilizations to play

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.149 
have 34 different civilizations to play
so<00:00:41.839> that's<00:00:41.989> a<00:00:42.110> lot<00:00:42.260> of<00:00:42.290> choice<00:00:42.589> right<00:00:42.739> there

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
so that's a lot of choice right there

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.180 
so that's a lot of choice right there
but<00:00:43.460> once<00:00:44.269> you<00:00:44.600> latch<00:00:45.350> on<00:00:45.620> to<00:00:45.800> a<00:00:45.829> couple<00:00:46.010> of

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
but once you latch on to a couple of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.680 
but once you latch on to a couple of
your<00:00:46.280> favorite<00:00:46.460> civilizations<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:47.449> tend<00:00:47.659> to

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
your favorite civilizations you tend to

your favorite civilizations you tend to
play<00:00:47.839> them<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.110> lot<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:48.680> I<00:00:49.339> don't<00:00:49.400> like<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.760> play

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
play them a lot and I don't like to play

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.970 
play them a lot and I don't like to play
them<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.210> same<00:00:50.420> way<00:00:50.600> every<00:00:50.960> time<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.500> lot<00:00:51.860> of

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
them the same way every time a lot of

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.260 
them the same way every time a lot of
the<00:00:52.100> civilizations<00:00:52.699> that<00:00:52.760> we<00:00:52.879> added<00:00:53.030> have

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
the civilizations that we added have

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.930 
the civilizations that we added have
really<00:00:53.809> unique<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.469> powerful<00:00:55.340> traits

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
really unique and powerful traits

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.130 
really unique and powerful traits
because<00:00:56.210> we<00:00:56.329> didn't<00:00:56.510> want<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.719> be<00:00:56.840> just<00:00:56.870> to

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
because we didn't want it to be just to

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.959 
because we didn't want it to be just to
a<00:00:57.170> numbers<00:00:57.710> game<00:00:57.920> but<00:00:58.399> add<00:00:58.489> one<00:00:58.519> of<00:00:58.730> these<00:00:58.820> all

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
a numbers game but add one of these all

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.119 
a numbers game but add one of these all
to<00:00:59.120> feel<00:00:59.300> like<00:00:59.420> unique<00:00:59.899> cool<00:01:00.350> gameplay

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
to feel like unique cool gameplay

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.529 
to feel like unique cool gameplay
elements<00:01:01.640> that<00:01:01.730> really<00:01:01.879> fit<00:01:02.210> in<00:01:02.300> with<00:01:02.449> the

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
elements that really fit in with the

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.270 
elements that really fit in with the
civilization<00:01:03.109> that<00:01:03.170> they<00:01:03.289> were<00:01:03.410> using<00:01:03.590> but<00:01:04.160> we

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
civilization that they were using but we

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.130 
civilization that they were using but we
also<00:01:04.430> wanted<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.030> reflect<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.869> fact<00:01:06.020> that

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
also wanted to reflect the fact that

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.710 
also wanted to reflect the fact that
Carthage<00:01:06.679> evolved<00:01:07.580> out<00:01:07.759> of<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.119> Phoenicians

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
Carthage evolved out of the Phoenicians

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.950 
Carthage evolved out of the Phoenicians
sea<00:01:09.020> power<00:01:09.289> and<00:01:09.970> they<00:01:10.970> actually<00:01:11.390> were<00:01:11.720> very

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
sea power and they actually were very

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.440 
sea power and they actually were very
good<00:01:12.140> at<00:01:12.320> establishing<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:13.460> trade<00:01:13.789> network<00:01:14.210> of

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
good at establishing a trade network of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.990 
good at establishing a trade network of
port<00:01:15.440> cities<00:01:15.800> all<00:01:16.039> around<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.369> Mediterranean

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
port cities all around the Mediterranean

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.200 
port cities all around the Mediterranean
coast<00:01:17.179> so<00:01:18.050> they<00:01:18.350> get<00:01:18.470> free<00:01:18.710> harbors<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.460> then

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
coast so they get free harbors and then

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.029 
coast so they get free harbors and then
to<00:01:20.360> reflect<00:01:20.720> that<00:01:20.899> ability<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:21.590> get<00:01:21.740> up<00:01:21.770> over

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
to reflect that ability to get up over

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
actually are the only civilization that

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.340 
actually are the only civilization that
can<00:01:25.310> move<00:01:25.430> units<00:01:25.729> over<00:01:25.909> mountains<00:01:26.390> Austria<00:01:27.259> is

can move units over mountains Austria is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.020 
can move units over mountains Austria is
really<00:01:27.799> cool<00:01:28.189> addition<00:01:28.430> for<00:01:28.759> a<00:01:28.790> couple

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030

it's the only African country that was

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.420

able to withstand the period of European

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.909 
able to withstand the period of European
colonization<00:02:58.969> so<00:02:59.780> they're<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.019> only<00:03:00.230> holdout

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
colonization so they're the only holdout

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.319 
colonization so they're the only holdout
that<00:03:01.189> was<00:03:01.700> never<00:03:02.030> part<00:03:02.629> of<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:03.169> European

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
that was never part of a European

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.879 
that was never part of a European
colonial<00:03:05.329> empire<00:03:05.689> and<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.530> we<00:03:06.620> wanted<00:03:06.829> to

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
colonial empire and so we wanted to

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.500 
colonial empire and so we wanted to
reflect<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.430> in<00:03:07.489> their<00:03:07.819> civilizations

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
reflect that in their civilizations

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.360 
reflect that in their civilizations
traits<00:03:08.900> so<00:03:09.169> we<00:03:09.260> wanted<00:03:09.469> them<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.769> be<00:03:09.889> very<00:03:10.219> very

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
traits so we wanted them to be very very

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.349 
traits so we wanted them to be very very
difficult<00:03:10.879> to<00:03:11.780> take<00:03:11.959> out<00:03:12.199> and<00:03:12.439> conquer<00:03:12.650> and

difficult to take out and conquer and

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.189 
difficult to take out and conquer and
even<00:03:14.359> though<00:03:14.449> they<00:03:14.569> might<00:03:14.689> not<00:03:14.750> be<00:03:15.049> the

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:15.199 
even though they might not be the

biggest or the most powerful

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.069 
biggest or the most powerful
civilization<00:03:16.879> we<00:03:17.269> still<00:03:17.510> wanted<00:03:17.780> them<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.959> be

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
civilization we still wanted them to be

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.750 
civilization we still wanted them to be
strong<00:03:18.319> defensively<00:03:18.889> so<00:03:19.280> that's<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.639> way

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
strong defensively so that's the way

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.670 
strong defensively so that's the way
their<00:03:19.909> trait<00:03:20.150> works<00:03:20.449> any<00:03:21.019> time<00:03:21.469> they're
