00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.150 

let's<00:00:05.420> now<00:00:05.630> look<00:00:05.810> at<00:00:06.020> the<00:00:06.200> forehand<00:00:07.010> loop

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
let's now look at the forehand loop

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.850 
let's now look at the forehand loop
against<00:00:07.550> backspin<00:00:08.559> first<00:00:09.559> thing<00:00:09.710> that's

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
against backspin first thing that's

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.620 
against backspin first thing that's
immediately<00:00:10.430> obvious<00:00:10.580> is<00:00:10.969> the<00:00:11.120> length<00:00:11.330> of<00:00:11.510> the

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
immediately obvious is the length of the

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.529 
immediately obvious is the length of the
swing<00:00:11.930> which<00:00:12.290> is<00:00:12.469> much<00:00:13.010> longer<00:00:13.309> than<00:00:13.760> what

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539 
swing which is much longer than what

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.850 
swing which is much longer than what
you've<00:00:14.660> seen<00:00:14.690> with<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:15.440> forehand<00:00:15.860> counterhit

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
you've seen with the forehand counterhit

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.950 
you've seen with the forehand counterhit
second<00:00:18.860> is<00:00:19.010> the<00:00:19.310> speed<00:00:19.670> of<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.420> swing<00:00:20.660> itself

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
second is the speed of the swing itself

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.740 
second is the speed of the swing itself
is<00:00:21.170> obviously<00:00:21.500> a<00:00:21.619> very<00:00:21.920> very<00:00:22.189> fast<00:00:22.580> swing<00:00:22.939> with

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
is obviously a very very fast swing with

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.230 
is obviously a very very fast swing with
most<00:00:24.019> of<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:24.320> racket<00:00:24.679> speed<00:00:25.000> being<00:00:26.000> turned

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
most of the racket speed being turned

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.029 
most of the racket speed being turned
into<00:00:26.480> heavy<00:00:27.080> topspin<00:00:27.679> as<00:00:27.890> well<00:00:28.730> as<00:00:28.939> some<00:00:29.509> pace

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
into heavy topspin as well as some pace

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.920 
into heavy topspin as well as some pace
one<00:00:31.039> thing<00:00:31.250> to<00:00:31.400> notice<00:00:31.609> because<00:00:31.880> I'm<00:00:32.270> using<00:00:32.570> a

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
one thing to notice because I'm using a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.760 
one thing to notice because I'm using a
one<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:33.710> a<00:00:33.800> half<00:00:34.010> mill<00:00:35.230> chopping<00:00:36.230> rubber<00:00:36.440> here

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
one and a half mill chopping rubber here

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.709 
one and a half mill chopping rubber here
I'm<00:00:37.100> having<00:00:37.700> to<00:00:37.879> swing<00:00:38.090> a<00:00:38.180> little<00:00:38.300> bit<00:00:38.450> more

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
I'm having to swing a little bit more

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.770 
I'm having to swing a little bit more
upwards<00:00:39.309> then<00:00:40.309> I<00:00:40.399> would<00:00:40.579> normally<00:00:40.730> have<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.539> do

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
upwards then I would normally have to do

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.229 
upwards then I would normally have to do
if<00:00:41.960> I<00:00:42.079> was<00:00:42.199> using<00:00:42.440> a<00:00:42.710> thicker<00:00:43.489> more<00:00:43.730> aggressive

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
if I was using a thicker more aggressive

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.400 
if I was using a thicker more aggressive
rubber<00:00:44.420> I'd<00:00:44.600> be<00:00:44.750> able<00:00:44.840> to<00:00:44.930> swing<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.199> little<00:00:45.289> bit

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
rubber I'd be able to swing a little bit

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.910 
rubber I'd be able to swing a little bit
more<00:00:45.649> forwards<00:00:46.690> going<00:00:47.690> into<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:47.989> slow<00:00:48.469> motion

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
more forwards going into the slow motion

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.400 
more forwards going into the slow motion
of<00:00:49.039> the<00:00:49.219> shot<00:00:49.670> first<00:00:50.660> thing<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:50.899> notice<00:00:51.079> is<00:00:51.289> the

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
of the shot first thing to notice is the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.010 
of the shot first thing to notice is the
stance<00:00:51.710> basically<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.309> same<00:00:52.840> still<00:00:53.840> in<00:00:53.930> a

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
stance basically the same still in a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.930 
stance basically the same still in a
forehand<00:00:54.379> stance<00:00:54.739> although<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:55.309> toes<00:00:55.579> of<00:00:55.910> the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
forehand stance although the toes of the

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.790 
forehand stance although the toes of the
right<00:00:56.210> foot<00:00:56.480> really<00:00:56.930> do<00:00:57.079> point<00:00:57.440> out<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.710> the

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
right foot really do point out to the

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.759 
right foot really do point out to the
side<00:00:58.039> to<00:00:58.370> allow<00:00:58.550> me<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:58.730> put<00:00:59.170> more<00:01:00.170> weight<00:01:00.469> onto

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
side to allow me to put more weight onto

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.330 
side to allow me to put more weight onto
that<00:01:01.100> right<00:01:01.430> knee<00:01:02.230> racket<00:01:03.230> now<00:01:03.410> goes<00:01:03.710> behind

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:04.340 
that right knee racket now goes behind

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.330 
that right knee racket now goes behind
the<00:01:04.760> right<00:01:05.030> knee<00:01:05.059> probably<00:01:05.870> about<00:01:06.050> six<00:01:06.440> inches

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340

Square<00:01:19.970> to<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.150> camera<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:23.420> forward<00:01:23.810> swing

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
Square to the camera the forward swing

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.020 
Square to the camera the forward swing
started<00:01:24.650> really<00:01:24.950> by<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.159> opening<00:01:25.700> the

the<00:02:33.840> jumping<00:02:34.840> in<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.110> air<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.440> really<00:02:35.590> just

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
the jumping in the air is really just

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.500 
the jumping in the air is really just
something<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.400> do<00:02:36.460> it<00:02:36.700> was<00:02:36.850> taught<00:02:37.150> how<00:02:37.480> I

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
something that I do it was taught how I

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.840 
something that I do it was taught how I
was<00:02:37.870> taught<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.440> it's<00:02:38.680> um<00:02:38.950> stuck<00:02:39.550> with<00:02:39.700> me

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
was taught and it's um stuck with me

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.240 
was taught and it's um stuck with me
through<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.210> years<00:02:40.530> but<00:02:41.530> not<00:02:41.830> something<00:02:42.160> you

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
through the years but not something you

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.100 
through the years but not something you
have<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.460> do<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:43.360> we'll<00:02:43.450> just<00:02:43.660> now<00:02:43.780> look<00:02:43.960> at<00:02:44.080> it

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
have to do and we'll just now look at it

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.950 
have to do and we'll just now look at it
from<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.380> front<00:02:44.590> view<00:02:44.770> perspective<00:02:45.960> you'll

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
from the front view perspective you'll

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.640 
from the front view perspective you'll
see<00:02:47.140> there<00:02:48.150> it's<00:02:49.150> natural<00:02:49.660> because<00:02:49.900> you're

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
see there it's natural because you're

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.190 
see there it's natural because you're
you're<00:02:50.920> talking<00:02:51.160> about<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.550> fairly<00:02:52.000> low<00:02:52.300> or

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
you're talking about a fairly low or

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.980 
you're talking about a fairly low or
lower<00:02:53.650> margin<00:02:54.220> for<00:02:54.310> error<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:55.690> sort<00:02:55.930> of

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
lower margin for error this sort of

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.510 
lower margin for error this sort of
mistakes<00:02:56.320> you'll<00:02:56.500> tend<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.830> see<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.100> if<00:02:57.340> you

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
mistakes you'll tend to see is if you

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.810 
mistakes you'll tend to see is if you
get<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.690> thinner<00:02:58.990> contact<00:02:59.560> you<00:03:00.400> can<00:03:00.550> tend<00:03:00.760> to

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
get to thinner contact you can tend to

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.670 
get to thinner contact you can tend to
hit<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.030> ball<00:03:01.209> into<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.480> net<00:03:01.620> because<00:03:02.620> you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
hit the ball into the net because you

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.710 
hit the ball into the net because you
don't<00:03:02.860> get<00:03:02.950> enough<00:03:03.190> power<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.820> you'll<00:03:04.480> see

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
don't get enough power and you'll see

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.690 
don't get enough power and you'll see
the<00:03:04.870> occasional<00:03:05.140> top<00:03:05.590> edges<00:03:06.010> where<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.520> ball

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
the occasional top edges where the ball

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.060 
the occasional top edges where the ball
go<00:03:06.910> flying<00:03:07.209> high<00:03:07.630> in<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.900> air<00:03:08.050> simply<00:03:08.800> because

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
go flying high in the air simply because

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.460 
go flying high in the air simply because
you're<00:03:09.190> talking<00:03:09.400> about<00:03:09.790> yet<00:03:10.000> there's<00:03:10.330> a

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
you're talking about yet there's a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.880 
you're talking about yet there's a
fairly<00:03:11.470> or<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.370> much<00:03:12.700> lower<00:03:13.560> margin<00:03:14.560> for<00:03:14.680> error

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
fairly or a much lower margin for error

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.580 
fairly or a much lower margin for error
in<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:15.220> shot<00:03:16.080> again<00:03:17.080> you<00:03:17.200> can<00:03:17.320> see<00:03:17.470> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
in this shot again you can see the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.870 
in this shot again you can see the
dipping<00:03:17.920> of<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.130> right<00:03:18.310> shoulder<00:03:18.610> is<00:03:18.850> a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
dipping of the right shoulder is a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.990 
dipping of the right shoulder is a
personal<00:03:19.690> trait<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.769> lot<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.489> players<00:03:21.730> against

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
personal trait a lot of players against

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.430 
personal trait a lot of players against
backspin<00:03:22.420> just<00:03:22.630> use<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.959> bending<00:03:23.320> of<00:03:23.410> the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
backspin just use the bending of the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.030 
backspin just use the bending of the
knees<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:24.010> don't<00:03:24.220> dip<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.610> right<00:03:24.760> shoulder

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
knees and don't dip the right shoulder

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.130 
knees and don't dip the right shoulder
you<00:03:27.040> can<00:03:27.160> see<00:03:27.220> how<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.519> really<00:03:27.910> get<00:03:28.090> side<00:03:28.390> on<00:03:28.630> to

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
you can see how I really get side on to

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.470 
you can see how I really get side on to
the<00:03:29.260> opponent<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.820> my<00:03:30.970> shoulders<00:03:31.180> are

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
the opponent so my shoulders are

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.509 
the opponent so my shoulders are
basically<00:03:31.930> perpendicular<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.160> camera

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
basically perpendicular to the camera

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.810 
basically perpendicular to the camera
even<00:03:34.480> though<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:35.440> swing<00:03:35.709> is<00:03:35.860> fast<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.580> quick

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
even though the swing is fast and quick

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.690 
even though the swing is fast and quick
the<00:03:37.090> follow-through<00:03:37.530> finishes<00:03:38.550> really<00:03:39.550> not

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
the follow-through finishes really not

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.940 
the follow-through finishes really not
much<00:03:39.850> past<00:03:40.209> my<00:03:40.480> head<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.959> don't<00:03:41.200> cross<00:03:41.440> over<00:03:41.650> the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
much past my head I don't cross over the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.650 
much past my head I don't cross over the
middle<00:03:41.980> line<00:03:42.370> up<00:03:42.519> mid<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.820> lot<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:43.060> my<00:03:43.180> body<00:03:43.390> very

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
middle line up mid a lot of my body very

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.130 
middle line up mid a lot of my body very
much<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:45.220> playing<00:03:45.880> elbow<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.570> racket<00:03:46.900> elbow

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
much the playing elbow the racket elbow

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.930 
much the playing elbow the racket elbow
stays<00:03:47.470> below<00:03:47.769> shoulder<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.430> shoulder<00:03:48.519> height

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
stays below shoulder to shoulder height

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.180 
stays below shoulder to shoulder height
and<00:03:49.420> that's<00:03:50.140> part<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.680> breaking

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
and that's part of the breaking

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.759 
and that's part of the breaking
mechanism<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:52.239> stop<00:03:52.870> me<00:03:53.019> from<00:03:53.230> over<00:03:53.380> swimming

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
mechanism to stop me from over swimming

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.870 
mechanism to stop me from over swimming
with<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.580> racket<00:03:54.910> in<00:03:55.090> front<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.019> head<00:03:56.200> you

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
with the racket in front of the head you

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.550 
with the racket in front of the head you
see<00:03:57.880> now<00:03:58.060> how<00:03:58.239> from<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.930> side<00:03:59.170> view<00:03:59.200> the

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
see now how from the side view the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.509 
see now how from the side view the
racket<00:03:59.920> goes<00:04:00.790> behind<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.420> right<00:04:01.630> knee<00:04:02.519> and

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
racket goes behind the right knee and

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.240 
racket goes behind the right knee and
you'll<00:04:04.209> see<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:04.510> here<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:04.900> then<00:04:05.590> part<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.160> the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
you'll see it here and then part of the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.670 
you'll see it here and then part of the
forward<00:04:06.550> swing<00:04:06.880> brings<00:04:07.390> it<00:04:07.630> back<00:04:07.900> into<00:04:08.290> the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
forward swing brings it back into the

that's another important thing to watch
is<00:04:58.169> that<00:04:58.199> even<00:04:58.560> though<00:04:58.789> it's<00:04:59.789> a<00:04:59.879> big<00:05:00.090> swing<00:05:00.449> by
