it's good closer look at it alright
let's<00:03:15.140> start<00:03:15.290> from<00:03:15.469> the<00:03:15.620> blade<00:03:15.859> itself<00:03:17.079> when<00:03:18.079> I

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
let's start from the blade itself when I

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.020 
let's start from the blade itself when I
cut<00:03:18.379> there<00:03:18.620> are<00:03:18.769> little<00:03:19.150> spots<00:03:20.150> up<00:03:20.480> on<00:03:22.030> the

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
blood is on this knife here and none of

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.420

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.819 
right here let's just paint it on I mean
there<00:04:02.359> are<00:04:02.949> indentations<00:04:03.949> and<00:04:04.639> all<00:04:04.729> that<00:04:04.940> but

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
there are indentations and all that but

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:12.789 
there are indentations and all that but
it's<00:04:06.829> not<00:04:07.010> a<00:04:07.040> natural<00:04:07.220> grille<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:12.530> mount

it's not a natural grille the mount

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.930 
it's not a natural grille the mount
doesn't<00:04:13.729> work<00:04:13.989> because<00:04:14.989> it<00:04:15.169> is<00:04:15.940> straight

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
doesn't work because it is straight

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.199 
doesn't work because it is straight
straight<00:04:17.930> flat<00:04:18.409> across<00:04:18.769> so<00:04:19.130> there's<00:04:19.940> no<00:04:20.090> way

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
straight flat across so there's no way

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.909

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
you can mount anything onto this thing

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.300 
you can mount anything onto this thing
either<00:04:25.389> sight
