00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.180
 and hello to all and to all those who 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.630
 punk and we end up for a new 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:28.700
 video about the filter 2 ariane bright mort 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.769
 who this nice pmg all PM10 particles 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.260
 particles I believe that's all denjean 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.360
 so we're going to have two functions the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.960
 first today the second one in 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.629
 another video 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.930
 the first one that is going to be transforming 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.379
 a particle shape all 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.660
 simply 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.020
 so I have some examples if you want 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.879
 for example in this example which is 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:58.039
 just above I think I have an example 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:01:01.430
 here I transformed the spiral is there to 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:06.380
 spirals that's out there in particles 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.630
 green and the other one that needs to be in 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.110
 below if I'm not mistaken who's the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.080
 that's who this is actually everything 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.479
 just that transform into that and 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.520
 I'm going to show you a cube so that 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.410
 walk like years for just 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.890
 show a cube because you're going 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.539
 understand 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.890
 so what are we going to have to do 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.289
 a file clock 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.410
 so I do it like that and son clock 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.840
 so I 'm doing in a thread that milka duno 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.610
 badly made a raid this block 0 and replaced 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.080
 crowd 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.509
 there I am not much I put 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.830
 swells with a data of 15 that from where 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.470
 he must but put what you want 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.319
 and I made a cube of 11 by eleven per 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.259
 just eleven and I put a cube 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.849
 in the air know where I'm going to display my 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.039
 but particles so it will take you 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:58.640
 some strings and so I'm going 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:02.750
 retrieve the coordinates of this block that 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.690
 is here this is this block so it has to 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.819
 vote to my right is less 643,50 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.220
 7049 and we'll have the coordinates of 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:18.410
 this cube that I also have already noted that they 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.230
 are less 640 71 1073 we will close 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.780
 minecraft and let's go to mc is saying 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.330
 and let's go to custom fireworks on 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.370
 back from there 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.840
 we will first select note fail on 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.620
 go is first select our 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.100
 form 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.870
 that's just why of us by 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.390
 ounce by 11 c you're right now 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.370
 to understand is the size of a cube and 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.650
 i'm going to use the filter so psg's 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.880
 particles the v6 version to the last one to 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.840
 day by the last on dates and we will 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.000
 take from the model block method to 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.710
 generations so I was rathore xyz 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.420
 you will put the coordinates of where 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.540
 you place the block corollas knowing 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:05.010
 that they are going to be there by 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:07.980
 down there is giant doubt sealed x 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.680
 positive and after they will get in 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.850
 positive scene so and you're worth it 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.800
 there it's a length of 2.16 in 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.480
 do they do something 16 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.010
 after 16 there and after you have to taste 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.810
 in tasks so this Czech driver 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.570
 so here is where will select two 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.160
 squares going to be in the filters so there 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.180
 you have body clip of the first point 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.810
 that I have marked you here 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:39.390
 so I already have 1643 57 1049 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.269
 this is generator weeds his sixteen months 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:48.209
 am not touch it's the size the 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:51.150
 size before it goes from usa utah 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.650
 will not need his blunder that we're gonna 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.510
 to be a 3d thing we do not need if you 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.670
 2d have all png prowler prowler penalty 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.900
 png we will need my curves psg you 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.440
 wait I will tell you about it the 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.220
 next time we do not care 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.950
 layher separation I have not quite 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.080
 understood what was the use for I think that 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.239
 when is it when its sector of 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.959
 tasks of 16 by sixteen samut a floor 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:21.450
 you I think that's it and drew x 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.200
 yz know where we want to place the good so 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:29.580
 me it's already put these months 143.0 71 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.680
 points 0 and 1100 13.000 because it's ok 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.820
 walk with commas so or little the 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.520
 dachshund 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.440
 after we return to the particles of 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.720
 so is if you lift everything you 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.270
 just replace the rest of their agent 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.440
 by something else particles makes it the 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.540
 slash particles and to the suffix I have 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:55.530
 put green particles 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:59.300
 so if I put special I saw 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:03.290
 these particles here it is wood 0510 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:07.620
 it's the color you test jo but 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.750
 then the programming speed c1 and 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.850
 the post donation is zero and moans force 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.670
 why base away we could see 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:19.250
 you'll just have at10 I believe in heroes 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.370
 will not fail to not forced everything 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.070
 stop 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.110
 it's the size I can not test everything 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.100
 but it's for the spa on 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.100
 particles if I understood you 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:35.880
 and here is model block lyle start and all 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.680
 I will not touch it works very well 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.570
 like this and you choose stone and 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.250
 you do filter and I'm going 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.280
 save and pagotto every time I 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.900
 you're fooling I'm wrong 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.980
 that sounds great and that's it 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.980
 our cube appeared then the euskal 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.950
 as you have as you understand 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.680
 for me they just plant why 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.780
 to stack a cube 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.090
 I watched it's the closest to a 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.280
 cube it takes rose by eleven per break 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.720
 which seems surprising it would 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.580
 10 by 10 by that would be more 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.310
 logical that's why they stop to 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.560
 a scoop or English accents all 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:21.120
 rotten in this case l 2 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:23.979
 2 0 so it would be 0 0 2 0 3 until 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:30.280
 but what you see is rather house 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:32.319
 in fact con dao perfect tube of the 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.289
 size of a real cubes of water but kraft 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:37.300
 so here I hope that this little you 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.789
 you will have liked it works the same for all 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.340
 you select the spiral and you 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:44.110
 put d2 body where you want to do 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.419
 can be from the structure and from or wanted 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.900
 to be robbed of the particles and 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:52.240
 know very well so here I am you 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.800
 just leave a very important thing you 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.800
 beware the particles because it 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.919
 is already learned 1000 in 1900 particles 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.169
 which is pretty much that that you 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:06.699
 take I do not know how much it took 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:11.440
 saw that geo too seen just cut the clock 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:18.189
 that's it again that without it are six 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:20.469
 years and that in pro wes in 106 years 

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:22.469
 the latter s take less because 

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:25.120
 I did not go around the full force at 

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:27.960
 so I leave you there I tell you to the 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.960
 next pavilion
