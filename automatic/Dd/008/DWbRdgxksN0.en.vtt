east I'm at the 73rd case of Ebola about

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.600 
east I'm at the 73rd case of Ebola about
23<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.230> them<00:00:22.380> being<00:00:22.710> contracted<00:00:23.279> there<00:00:23.460> in

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
23 of them being contracted there in

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.720 
23 of them being contracted there in
Portland<00:00:24.060> we<00:00:24.150> realized<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.810> was<00:00:24.840> time<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.110> go

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
Portland we realized it was time to go

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.390 
Portland we realized it was time to go
so<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:26.820> had<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.239> east<00:00:28.279> moving<00:00:29.279> this

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
so we had to do east moving this

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.880 
so we had to do east moving this
direction<00:00:29.869> maintaining<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.990> sterility<00:00:31.259> factor

direction maintaining a sterility factor

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.009

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
of those humans would be no different

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
any contact with them we moved to move

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.979 
any contact with them we moved to move

push the edge move it would have to do
the<00:00:49.260> unthinkable<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:51.000> now<00:00:51.149> we're<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.420> an<00:00:51.510> area

the unthinkable so now we're in an area

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.240 
the unthinkable so now we're in an area
where<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.140> move<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.379> our<00:00:52.469> cash<00:00:53.039> aid

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
where we can move to our cash aid

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:02.119 
where we can move to our cash aid
supplies<00:01:00.109> all<00:01:01.109> right<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:01.649> heading<00:01:01.949> into

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
/ bivy I really like it I've been using

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.670 
/ bivy I really like it I've been using
it<00:04:46.090> for<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.330> while<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.600> it's<00:04:46.990> held<00:04:47.200> up<00:04:47.380> really

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
it for a while and it's held up really

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.210 
it for a while and it's held up really
well<00:04:47.860> it's<00:04:48.640> a<00:04:48.790> 10<00:04:49.000> by<00:04:49.180> 10<00:04:49.210> so<00:04:50.050> it's<00:04:50.230> a<00:04:50.290> nice<00:04:50.440> size

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220

it's<00:04:51.850> kind<00:04:52.000> of<00:04:52.060> hard<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:52.270> explain<00:04:52.419> but<00:04:52.780> I

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
it's kind of hard to explain but I

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.970 
it's kind of hard to explain but I
actually<00:04:53.760> set<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:54.880> up<00:04:55.030> as<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.240> square<00:04:55.980> folded

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
actually set it up as a square folded

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.510 
actually set it up as a square folded
the<00:04:57.190> back<00:04:57.970> edges<00:04:58.300> under<00:04:59.050> you<00:04:59.710> can<00:04:59.890> see<00:05:00.130> I<00:05:00.160> used

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.280 
the back edges under you can see I used
three<00:05:01.030> poles<00:05:01.330> as<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:02.620> framework<00:05:03.070> I<00:05:04.050> just<00:05:05.050> wanted

tension on the lash up there and then

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.140 
tension on the lash up there and then
it's<00:05:19.330> driven<00:05:19.630> into<00:05:19.960> the<00:05:20.560> hill<00:05:21.370> back<00:05:21.910> behind

could stake these corners back on the
next<00:05:57.130> tie<00:05:57.430> off<00:05:57.640> and<00:05:58.000> then<00:05:58.479> I<00:05:58.600> could<00:05:58.780> pull<00:05:59.020> these

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
next tie off and then I could pull these

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
flaps in and close up the door I like to

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.500 
flaps in and close up the door I like to
leave<00:06:03.040> a<00:06:03.070> little<00:06:03.340> ventilation<00:06:03.580> going<00:06:04.300> through

leave a little ventilation going through

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.450 
leave a little ventilation going through
it<00:06:04.660> just<00:06:04.840> because<00:06:05.680> this<00:06:05.860> is<00:06:06.040> a<00:06:06.070> waterproof

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
it just because this is a waterproof

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.210 
it just because this is a waterproof
tarp<00:06:06.940> so<00:06:07.270> it<00:06:07.750> will<00:06:08.020> collect<00:06:08.440> condensation

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
tarp so it will collect condensation

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.670 
tarp so it will collect condensation
inside<00:06:09.370> if<00:06:10.030> it<00:06:10.210> has<00:06:10.360> no

inside if it has no
winter<00:06:10.860> flow<00:06:11.070> but<00:06:11.759> this<00:06:11.910> should<00:06:12.090> be<00:06:12.120> a<00:06:12.180> good

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360
