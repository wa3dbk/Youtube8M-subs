00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.650
 I knew that I should not continue driving if 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.809
 perceives pain of the exhaust system the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.809
 intoxication can cost you your life 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.439
 on the route there are people who have the 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.860
 special ability never to crash 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.349
 they never collide however they are 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.449
 the cause of many shocks is to have 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.050
 here that may be the ones I drive before 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.460
 little step that I sometimes that what they are more 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.199
 dangerous today you are going to match 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.330
 with me I would like to hear the opinion 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.129
 of you are more but they are the ones 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.629
 they handle slowly that what they are going fast 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.360
 there are some times in which I have 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.010
 particular annoyance what I call Chicana 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.329
 mobile that are these that are going to have 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.680
 kilometers per hour that you do not have to 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.329
 to go around doing pirouettes to avoid it 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:02.649
 is to get to the opposite 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:06.649
 Tails more nervous than ever 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.850
 the step that we call if not 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.770
 they can do is they start making sweets 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.259
 farts to the bumper guy that really 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.630
 makes me mad about this that 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.280
 you say Alberto is when the subject came up 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.590
 of the maximum speed controls 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.460
 in much of the capital and in other 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.619
 in other places I actually 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.500
 I am against the controls of 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.880
 maximum speed I'm against me 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.619
 It seems to have to do it but 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.780
 consistent way it can not be that in 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.520
 some places the maximum speed is 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.710
 40 kilometers more intense more 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.970
 delirium tries to drive a route 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.890
 following the speed posters of 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.750
 kill kill you and make the tony thermos 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.190
 purpose of that I have a comment from 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.270
 World champion Fernando Alonso 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.450
 Formula 1 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.090
 criticizing when in Spain the maximum is 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.210
 had set at 120 kilometers per hour 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.450
 and he said that the minimum of maximum 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.850
 it would have to be 130 kilometers per hour 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.770
 that is 10 kilometers faster I will finish 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.590
 what happens is that here is a problem 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.810
 of culture not speed is the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.070
 dramatic good but all the people I 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.810
 it seems that she is not ready to 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.179
 handle at certain speeds 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.250
 let's say the cars are prepared 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.870
 to go to 200 people are prepared 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.489
 to handle 130 to 140 to 160 the best 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.280
 step we talk for example of the double 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.140
 value to 130 but that took on the boat 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.760
 traction we always return to the concept of 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.620
 energy here there are on television 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.220
 programs a lot is the people 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.290
 enabled to handle 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.480
 Of course that's because you notice that this 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.370
 I have to circulate slowly too 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.830
 they have a habit like you come from 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.360
 space of inertia of the car goes down a lot and 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:48.020
 you can do abrupt maneuvers without 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.960
 warn let's do and that happens together 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.090
 with the wrong use of light 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.010
 when they use it when they use it but others 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.310
 is another issue has not happened to you in 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.070
 the route for example motorway to sea ​​of 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.430
 It deals with double lane people who get 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.840
 left to 120 or 130 and does not move 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.480
 from there instead of circulating to that 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.980
 speed on the right to allow 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.620
 that those who go to the left can 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.270
 move to a little bit more speed 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.400
 what they are doing and someday 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.650
 let's learn from that high hand 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.900
 speed is not to circulate at high 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.810
 speed and stay stuck or less 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.970
 speed is to pass clear right 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.000
 this is respected throughout the world except 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.840
 germany where as the speed is 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.690
 free 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.230
 you can circulate of course I have 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.390
 done by the left hand to 240 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.640
 kilometers per hour from training 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.880
 is with rubén daray circulating by a 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.560
 route in the picture this was the bathroom with 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.110
 an audio of the risks with the foot 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:54.410
 surrounded poorer 200 kilometers by 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:57.410
 hours looked at lights and I stopped standing 17,516 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.840
 to see you truth exactly happened to me and 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.549
 that's why I brought her up, I went to the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.799
 presentation of the porster boxster in 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.380
 Germany and I came comfortably 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:10.640
 installed on the left hand to 240 it 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:14.060
 I lit the rearview mirror a 750 bmw 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.850
 happened to me turned his head he looked at me and he had me 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.979
 into account 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.229
 good good move all this I think that 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.030
 first keep distance from the vehicle 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.970
 that preceded it is addressed to the pisa 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.820
 Tails subject and responsible 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.830
 absolutely irresponsible they have 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.570
 contributed a good part of accident 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.430
 because one has to start thinking 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.289
 who do this guy is going to get the 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.750
 gnaws and is distracted from what happens later 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.630
 and there it happens in many cases 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.400
 sir if you can not pass do not behave 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.500
 in an aggressive way and that 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.570
 unfortunately, people do it with 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.580
 high cost vehicles that stay 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.660
 here they have no feeling of 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.040
 speed of paris 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.290
 we have driven vehicles 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.030
 this guy and we think that the one who is 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.960
 in front comes walking here is in front 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.640
 this comes with a speed 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.770
 regulatory perhaps the maximum that you 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.540
 imposes the gentleman do not count if he puts them 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.640
 and they put light on him, he goes crazy, no, 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.260
 others new to directly by returning 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.700
 to the barça that circulates to the version 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.890
 regulation that does it for the right 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.710
 so that's where it corresponds like that 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.480
 answer you have to circulate good and in that 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.180
 series of comments careful with the 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.500
 stops en route to snack on something 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.140
 all for alcoholic beverages 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.850
 remember that digestion takes away 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.210
 blood to the brain oxygen from the brain 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.670
 rest the rest of cyclists noises 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.130
 because the cyclist comes to what he can 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.630
 with the bicycle but the displacement 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.970
 of the vehicle genre when it passes 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.220
 speed can follow him and he's going to throw 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.400
 any part phenomenon that has 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.960
 converted we have discovered a new 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.570
 arrogant in the streets of buenos aires 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.790
 from the bikes in decisions are 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.570
 the total cyclists 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.610
 they think they are exclusive and they commit everything 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.740
 type of infractions happen in red van 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.750
 of contramano payroll you have to have 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.790
 be careful if you forgive all life 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.800
 the days at the motoqueros school 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:03.640
 I find many cases many that do not 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.640
 I say responsible motorcyclists like the 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.960
 4 fisher road 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.870
 but if it has been transformed 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.400
 in almost professional transgressors there are 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.690
 a lot of these recommendations that 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.850
 you can find them in our 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.930
 page that is interesting to read them 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.910
 because good is at stake his life of 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.700
 those who accompany them and also a little 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.940
 the environment is at stake what you think 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.960
 if in the next block we discuss the 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:34.030
 topic of the editorial that to see what 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.530
 attention deserves our car 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.530
 go ahead with the theme
