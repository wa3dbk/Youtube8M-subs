00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.250
 cube 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.419
 P 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.149
 do you have anything because of this i personally 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.819
 really a little crazy about 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:32.309
 her things she ever thought from 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.489
 take all the things that we buy and 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.000
 where are they waiting for when we throw them out i don't 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.059
 could get rid of that thought i started 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.309
 search online textbook said 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.469
 that our things just pass next 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.359
 stage of production of GDP 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.629
 distribution and consumption 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.270
 recycling all together 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.220
 it's called material kana 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.880
 new enter well I found out a little more 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.220
 easier actually I spent 10 years 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.800
 traveling figuring out where things come from and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.080
 where do they go 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.340
 and you know what I found out that this is not 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.139
 all the truth 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:05.079
 many missed explanations 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:06.969
 at first glance, the system from 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:09.029
 it seems normal business no problem 

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:10.689
 after which the truth is that the system 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.180
 in crisis 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.870
 the cause of this crisis is that 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.790
 line system in place and we live on 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.470
 a planet with a limited life 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.570
 existence on such a planet 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.120
 impossible endlessly work 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.860
 changing the system taking a serious step 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.370
 this system of interaction with 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.290
 real world 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.990
 life is not happening on empty 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.630
 the place is and the interaction behind 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.570
 traditions of society of culture of economy 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.140
 environment 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.190
 and throughout the whole system 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.220
 confronted with restrictions all 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.830
 here we are not going to import restrictions 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.200
 cardiogram not complete therefore 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.479
 let's go back 1 1 3 parts 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.280
 pictures of which taste is missing and 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.250
 perhaps the most important color is missing 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.329
 elements are people when people 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.349
 people constantly live and work in this 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.289
 system and some people outside mean 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.069
 more than others some has 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.470
 little more who are they 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.030
 start building today my friends 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.050
 they say that as a symbol of government 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.870
 need to use sleds they have it 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.260
 fair for many became 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.080
 becoming more relevant for my 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.840
 countries over fifty percent 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.700
 federal taxes 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.290
 with scenic but 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.739
 i use a person to denote 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.069
 governments because I believe that 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.719
 government is chosen from the people 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.549
 the people and for the people the work of the government 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.659
 take care and take care of us such is their work 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.230
 then go corporation reason why 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.319
 corporations seem more government 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.329
 is that corporation 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.260
 really more government 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.159
 Artists of one hundred largest economies 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.700
 at least 50 one corporations 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.920
 the corporation has grown in volume and strength we see 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.160
 small changes in government 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.400
 which is more concerned to 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.849
 everything has been fine since then 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.729
 eleven 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.259
 ok let's see what else is missing 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.539
 picture start with the prey 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.409
 for this wonderful word cost 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.159
 exploitation of natural resources and 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.399
 eyes littering 

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:55.099
 the planets 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.260
 till May 15th it manifests itself in the realm 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.499
 you see in mining or receiving 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:01.049
 mittal use throughout 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.159
 water and animal destruction not so we 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.060
 cross the first border with us 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.879
 running out of resources we leave 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.269
 too much trash I know this is hard 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.980
 listen but that is true and we should 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.369
 recognize and condemn 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:14.809
 by the way of the body for the last 30 years we 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:16.699
 consumed one third of natural resources 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.509
 the planets we consumed irrevocably we 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.669
 we cut down we get transported and 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.299
 throwing away so fast 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.249
 which undermines the very ability of the planet 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:27.260
 give people life requirements and me 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.469
 concept opel provision 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.889
 and I lived in the United States and we have less 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.849
 four percent of real forests 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.680
 qualities of 40 percent have become unsuitable for 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.899
 drinking and our problem is not that we 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.299
 produce too much waste 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.269
 that we use more natural resources 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.319
 what is on the plan 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.090
 we have 5 percent of the world population but 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.969
 consume 30 percent of the world 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.400
 resources and create 30 percent waste 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.269
 the world 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.930
 if everyone consumed at the level 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.419
 us we would need three to five 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:58.249
 planets 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:00.459
 and you know that in addition we only have 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.189
 one 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.029
 so my country's answer to that 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:04.689
 restriction where to go and pick up 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.499
 heavy is a third world country which 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:09.719
 how do you say some of the progress of May title 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:11.629
 for placing our trash on someone else's 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.969
 territories what it looks like 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:16.579
 also in his opinion his territory 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.370
 75 percent fish was poured at level 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.009
 or over volume open 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.050
 80 percent of initial forest volume lost 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.970
 only in the amazon area are we losing 2009 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.990
 minute is 7 football fields per 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.840
 a minute 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.680
 what about the people who live there 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.199
 scary as some say they don't 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.020
 own these resources even if 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.390
 they lived there for generations 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.070
 Ilyich they do not own the stars 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.140
 production and they don't buy a lot of things 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.000
 and in the system if you do not buy or not 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.740
 many solutions are sold all 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.710
 useless 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.870
 then the material go into production and 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.490
 here we use energy for 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.690
 mixing toxic chemicals with natural 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.810
 resources to make products 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.360
 contaminated toxins 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.729
 today there are more than a hundred in the collection 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.229
 thousand synthetic chemicals not 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.319
 only with a small part of them do we know 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:07.879
 how do they affect human health 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:11.110
 but none of them have been verified 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.400
 what will impact on 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.749
 health in the company of other chemicals 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:16.939
 however, we are not aware of the full impact 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:18.429
 toxic substances to our health 

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:21.619
 the environment but know one look at 

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:24.399
 Yana's entrance looks while we continue 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:26.669
 adds an asset to the production system 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.689
 we will get quality things 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:30.669
 who bring home to work in 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.110
 school and of course our body 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.409
 if for example in denmark that earlier fire retardants 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.840
 they make things fireproof but they 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.160
 contain toxic 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.450
 it's not so much so they are toxic for 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.879
 brain 3 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:45.619
 what we don't do when 

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:48.279
 use such chemicals and still 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.399
 we used instruments for computers 

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:52.769
 mattress sofas and even pillows and on 

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.780
 in fact we take our pillow 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.920
 maximum measures toxins and then 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.950
 brings home and lay doves on them 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.160
 eight hours of sleep 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.540
 I do not know for sure, but it probably will 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.740
 potential can come up with a different way 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.830
 save our accusing voices 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.400
 these professions are customized 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.350
 food chains and accumulate at 16 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.360
 do you know which product is on 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.290
 top of the food chain and contains 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.660
 most of all I love women's breast 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.289
 milk 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.379
 This means that we have reached the point when 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:23.990
 the smallest members of our families are our children 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.129
 get the biggest life go 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.210
 toxic chemicals from their mothers 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.909
 EU breastfeeding time 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.449
 is this already a clear violation 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.129
 breastfeeding rules 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:35.319
 fundamental process 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.869
 feeding the baby he should 

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:39.119
 be priests safe now 

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:41.339
 breastfeeding is the best way but we 

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:43.309
 should protect it is necessary to solve the authorities 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:44.590
 must protect him 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.539
 I think they protect NATO 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.639
 it is rather difficult
