00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:39.710 
but I do not think that this effects
getting<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.680> gold<00:01:31.680> trophy<00:01:35.329> so<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:38.720> my

getting this gold trophy so and my

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:49.099 
getting this gold trophy so and my
progress<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.280> game<00:01:42.049> is<00:01:44.869> 91%<00:01:46.610> so

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
progress of the game is 91% so

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.520 
progress of the game is 91% so
