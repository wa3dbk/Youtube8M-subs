was probably getting told off by people
who<00:02:07.860> know<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.190> game<00:02:08.369> much<00:02:08.940> better<00:02:09.179> than<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.420> do

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250

obvious<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.800> heart<00:02:19.980> restriction<00:02:20.430> itself

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
obvious the the heart restriction itself

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.990 
obvious the the heart restriction itself
was<00:02:21.090> only<00:02:21.569> hard<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:22.050> couple<00:02:22.410> bosses<00:02:23.000> Leslie

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
