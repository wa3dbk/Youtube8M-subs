00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.299
 today our talk is about how 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.919
 choose time to buy the dishes 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.320
 represents a large investment 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.120
 investment for us then it is 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.950
 It's necessary that we have information 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.809
 We will not mess up, we 'll be there. 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.410
 talking about different types of dishes 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.699
 on how to compose your set 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.310
 We'll be talking about the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.920
 influence that weight and size have on 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.260
 styles for which dish is appropriate 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.390
 or not and in the end I 'll be giving 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.399
 three tips very important to you 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.329
 so you do not go wrong at the time of buying 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.950
 their deadlines 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.329
 Let's go before anything else is 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.850
 It's important for us to understand that there 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.829
 different types of deadlines and we can 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.329
 separate the plans into groups according 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.930
 with its function 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.420
 we have the driving group that you 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.820
 can include hardy and radio 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.820
 Do you have the group of attacking dishes? 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.940
 crashes and you have the group the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.250
 effects splashs the chai in the bells 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.260
 the first group of driving it is very 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.119
 important because you play these dishes 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.670
 more than any other you with 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.770
 two in that space you make the subdivision 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.020
 usually within these 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.909
 so why be touched a lot of them 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.170
 end up becoming your signature in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.780
 terms of silver sound then it is 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.680
 important to choose your radio your 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.470
 radio the crashes they have a function of 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.740
 more explosive but there are seats 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.229
 in music and you have the effect dishes 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.540
 what are the splashs shine the bells 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.130
 they no longer have a seasoning function 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.070
 so let's add some 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.229
 thing is different in music are not 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.570
 used so often so some 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.570
 drummers use more others less 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:53.759
 then how to compose your set of term 17 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.880
 would be formed by a hatch one 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.100
 raid and a loan but there is no 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.750
 specific rule for this you have 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.170
 drummers for example as achilles 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.200
 priester who has 17 squares 17 of him 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.179
 each dish has a specific function but 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.819
 on the other hand you have the drummer as 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.710
 the American organ cycle he plays 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.410
 with three plates and three plates 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.120
 only driving it attacks on them makes 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.510
 effect on campaigns 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.950
 so it depends on the drummer the drummer 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.350
 said Maria 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.910
 a good tip for you you look the 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.800
 drummer you admire 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.470
 see how he composed his set 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.650
 now remembers the following not always 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.030
 is playing is similar to 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.400
 the music you 're playing 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.280
 so your set of dishes have to serve 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.530
 well there's no god there's three 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.530
 important factors in the choice of 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.490
 dishes that are the law that is what it is 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.210
 made the size and weight in relation to 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.010
 turns on 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.110
 I already spoke in great detail in another 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.860
 video you can look for here at 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.960
 our channel later in relation to the size 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.460
 it's more basic to that kit that I 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.990
 I mentioned at the beginning 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.390
 Are 14 Inch Taste Network 16 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.270
 inches to the crash and 20 inches 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.800
 behind driving for the round but 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.780
 This is not a rule. 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.210
 depending on your style of function 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.880
 musical and your taste too 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.400
 this can change for example civilian 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.850
 order that I mentioned before it uses 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.550
 16 and up to 17 inches and it plays 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.430
 various styles with these regis 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.290
 so it depends on your taste also another 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.820
 aspect is the weight that is closely linked to 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.950
 plate thickness 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.810
 so you have three subcategories there 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.390
 you have a rev Bantam heavy commitment the 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.480
 medium and fine or light 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.180
 there is also action and west reins and 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.370
 the extremes very heavy very light but 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.290
 these three are of their main 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.840
 so if you have a plate or two 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.920
 dishes of the same size but with weights 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.140
 many different 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.970
 most likely the lightest dish 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.860
 it will require less effort to 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.130
 be activated or it will be more 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.650
 sensitive and will probably be more 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.940
 suitable for styles where you play 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.220
 more gently 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.650
 already the heavier plate it requires more 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.390
 effort to be activated but in 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.190
 compensation it has more volume more 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.560
 projection which makes it more 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.770
 suitable for heavier styles 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.180
 what is 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.180
 a more intense dynamic 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.960
 As promised at the beginning I'll give you 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.330
 three tips for you not to go wrong on time 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.030
 the purchase of its terms and the first 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.190
 tip is you know that there is no 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.819
 plate with the sound is exactly the same 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.289
 other 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.409
 so if you hear a dish that you 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.300
 likes and you order the same brand of 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:51.370
 same model of the same size 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.889
 know that you will most likely have 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.199
 sound different from what you heard to 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.120
 What did you buy the best brands? 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.889
 have very high quality control 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.370
 but it still has a difference 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.620
 grammes from one copy to another 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.240
 difference makes a difference 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.720
 difference in sound 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.520
 another aspect is the issue of the budget 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.199
 separate the maximum amount of money you 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.569
 can invest in its terms 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.610
 because if you buy a battery more 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:20.919
 simple you can change the sound of it 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.409
 changing the skins by tweaking but buying 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.110
 You will not be able to do this and if your 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:28.259
 budget is tight then if you 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.370
 can not invest in all the dishes 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.870
 prioritize the dishes you will touch 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.710
 more often than are the terms of 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.430
 driving 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.380
 hatch and hide because you remember if you 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.210
 will play there will they play more often 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.509
 will be your signature in terms of 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:46.000
 term sound and finally if you go 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.340
 buy a dish and already has 17 dishes 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.050
 try to bring your set to test in the 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.789
 shop with the dish you are 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.650
 considering buying because it can 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.110
 sound very good alone there but he can 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.219
 not to match or not to marry the dishes 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.710
 that you already have 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:00.669
 if you can not take your plates 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.009
 to the store 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.830
 You have to at least take your 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.960
 sticks because different sticks will 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.680
 handle different validation actions 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.120
 so your drumstick is your reference 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.949
 if you play with a stick is 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.900
 available in the store the dish will sound 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:18.400
 one way but it can sound one way 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.090
 different when you play with your 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.310
 drumsticks 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.680
 this is going to be a nasty surprise 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.479
 Okay, so this is our information. 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.120
 today we continue to enjoy our 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:30.219
 videos sharing with your friends 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.710
 Ok I'll leave a link down here.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.630
 subject that you can continue this 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:39.910
 talk there in the forum battery brazil 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.620
 already we will have a topic only 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.840
 This is for you to ask questions 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.820

 For today it's only until the next
