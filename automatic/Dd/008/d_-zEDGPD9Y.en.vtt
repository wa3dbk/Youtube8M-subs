00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
honestly thought that this was not that

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.629 
honestly thought that this was not that
good<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.170> fight<00:00:10.380> day<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:11.040> all<00:00:11.130> went<00:00:11.460> all<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
way to the end of the round I thought

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.020 
way to the end of the round I thought
that<00:00:13.170> if<00:00:13.860> anybody<00:00:14.130> had<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> shot<00:00:14.759> at<00:00:14.790> beating

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
that if anybody had a shot at beating

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.910 
that if anybody had a shot at beating
mid-may<00:00:15.839> whether<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.260> was<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.470> Aviva<00:00:16.590> Donna

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
mid-may whether it was it Aviva Donna

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.820 
mid-may whether it was it Aviva Donna
coming<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:17.820> at<00:00:17.910> 30<00:00:18.150> years<00:00:18.390> ago<00:00:18.660> fighting<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.230> 37

coming in at 30 years ago fighting a 37
year<00:00:19.920> old<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:20.520> go<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> decision

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
year old but as we go to the decision

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.700 
year old but as we go to the decision
right<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> thought<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.410> basically

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
right here I thought that this basically

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.790

of<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> fourth<00:00:26.369> round<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.939> thought<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.449> may

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
of the fourth round I thought that may

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.109 
of the fourth round I thought that may
done<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.949> had<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> chance<00:00:29.400> really<00:00:29.820> going

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.560 
reason he is one of the best fighters
out<00:01:30.960> there<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.640> as<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.790> comes<00:01:33.090> down<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
out there and as this comes down to the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.550 
out there and as this comes down to the
decision<00:01:34.049> right<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:36.170> Madonna<00:01:37.170> really

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
decision right here Madonna really

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.140 
decision right here Madonna really
thinks<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.890> he's<00:01:38.009> won<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.400> fight<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.670> really

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
thinks that he's won this fight I really

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.840 
thinks that he's won this fight I really
don't<00:01:39.329> think<00:01:39.390> he<00:01:39.630> has<00:01:39.810> basically<00:01:40.729> when<00:01:41.729> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
don't think he has basically when it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.539 
don't think he has basically when it
came<00:01:42.060> down<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.570> about<00:01:42.780> round<00:01:43.110> four<00:01:43.439> he<00:01:44.250> slipped

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
came down to about round four he slipped

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.520 
came down to about round four he slipped
in<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> give<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> headbutt<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:46.320> Floyd

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
in and to give a headbutt to Floyd

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.889 
in and to give a headbutt to Floyd
Mayweather<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.360> that<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.479> when<00:01:48.689> Mayweather

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
Mayweather and that is when Mayweather

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.780 
Mayweather and that is when Mayweather
basically<00:01:49.619> closed<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> door<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.310> he<00:01:50.520> really
