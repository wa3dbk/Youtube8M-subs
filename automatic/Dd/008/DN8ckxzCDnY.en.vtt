00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
price I think that this retails for

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.610 
price I think that this retails for
about<00:06:12.040> 150<00:06:13.040> to<00:06:13.669> 180<00:06:13.880> maybe<00:06:14.540> I<00:06:14.660> think<00:06:15.260> that's

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
about 150 to 180 maybe I think that's

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.550 
about 150 to 180 maybe I think that's
about<00:06:15.800> it<00:06:16.010> but

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
about it but

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.080 
about it but
thing<00:06:16.860> is<00:06:17.010> that<00:06:17.190> you<00:06:17.340> don't<00:06:17.520> have<00:06:17.610> to<00:06:17.880> buy<00:06:18.030> two

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
thing is that you don't have to buy two

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.360 
thing is that you don't have to buy two
packs<00:06:18.630> and<00:06:18.960> like<00:06:19.169> honestly<00:06:19.590> a<00:06:19.680> lot<00:06:19.950> of<00:06:20.010> clip<00:06:20.250> in

packs and like honestly a lot of clip in

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.310 
packs and like honestly a lot of clip in
extensions<00:06:20.850> they<00:06:21.090> charge<00:06:21.360> so<00:06:21.720> much<00:06:21.990> for<00:06:22.200> them

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
extensions they charge so much for them

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.800

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
like $200 for one pack which is not even

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:25.879 
like $200 for one pack which is not even
going<00:06:24.930> to<00:06:24.960> be<00:06:25.050> enough<00:06:25.260> for<00:06:25.380> your<00:06:25.500> whole<00:06:25.680> head
