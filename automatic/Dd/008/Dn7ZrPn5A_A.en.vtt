00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.949 
power so that you're able to recharge if
it's<00:02:33.680> your<00:02:33.829> smartphone<00:02:34.489> tablet<00:02:35.209> or<00:02:35.360> any

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
it's your smartphone tablet or any

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.520 
it's your smartphone tablet or any
device<00:02:36.350> that<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:37.670> can<00:02:37.820> plug<00:02:38.090> into<00:02:38.299> a<00:02:38.480> USB<00:02:38.690> port

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
device that you can plug into a USB port

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.350 
device that you can plug into a USB port
so<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.130> way<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.459> works<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:41.090> have<00:02:41.120> a

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
so the way this works is you have a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.319 
so the way this works is you have a
micro<00:02:42.170> USB<00:02:42.200> input<00:02:42.739> so<00:02:43.489> that<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:43.730> can<00:02:43.940> charge

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
micro USB input so that you can charge

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.150 
micro USB input so that you can charge
the<00:02:44.630> power<00:02:44.840> bank<00:02:44.989> you're<00:02:45.560> going<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.739> get<00:02:45.860> two

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
the power bank you're going to get two

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.810 
the power bank you're going to get two
USB<00:02:46.760> power<00:02:47.090> outs<00:02:47.829> outputting<00:02:48.829> at<00:02:48.949> two<00:02:49.190> amps<00:02:49.669> so

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
USB power outs outputting at two amps so

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.129 
USB power outs outputting at two amps so
you're<00:02:50.090> going<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.239> get<00:02:50.359> really<00:02:50.750> quick

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
you're going to get really quick

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.150 
you're going to get really quick
charging<00:02:51.530> on

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
charging on

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.250 
charging on
smartphone<00:02:52.910> or<00:02:53.150> if<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:53.780> want<00:02:53.960> to<00:02:54.050> use<00:02:54.230> a

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
smartphone or if you want to use a

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.930 
smartphone or if you want to use a
tablet<00:02:54.800> also<00:02:54.980> you're<00:02:55.190> gonna<00:02:55.310> get<00:02:55.460> regular

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
tablet also you're gonna get regular

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.360 
tablet also you're gonna get regular
charging<00:02:56.390> speeds<00:02:56.780> on<00:02:56.960> that<00:02:57.170> now<00:02:57.710> you<00:02:57.770> can

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
charging speeds on that now you can

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.450 
charging speeds on that now you can
charge<00:02:58.790> two<00:02:59.210> devices<00:02:59.570> at<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.890> same<00:03:00.920> time

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
charge two devices at the same time

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.550 
charge two devices at the same time
using<00:03:01.880> two<00:03:02.240> amps<00:03:02.600> makes<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.320> pretty<00:03:03.440> unique

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
using two amps makes it pretty unique

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.070 
using two amps makes it pretty unique
because<00:03:03.950> most<00:03:04.100> power<00:03:04.550> banks<00:03:04.970> do<00:03:05.300> not<00:03:05.330> do<00:03:05.870> this

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
because most power banks do not do this

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.870 
because most power banks do not do this
another<00:03:06.830> thing<00:03:06.920> you're<00:03:07.070> gonna<00:03:07.160> have<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.640> this

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
another thing you're gonna have is this

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.520 
another thing you're gonna have is this
nice<00:03:08.270> touch<00:03:09.080> activated<00:03:09.860> power<00:03:10.190> indicator<00:03:10.850> and

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
nice touch activated power indicator and

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.550 
nice touch activated power indicator and
overall<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.550> very<00:03:14.330> nice<00:03:14.780> power<00:03:15.230> bank

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
overall this is a very nice power bank

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.550 
overall this is a very nice power bank
now<00:03:16.450> 15,000<00:03:17.450> milliamps<00:03:18.080> just<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.320> give<00:03:18.470> you

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
now 15,000 milliamps just to give you

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.210 
now 15,000 milliamps just to give you
guys<00:03:18.710> an<00:03:18.890> idea<00:03:18.980> most<00:03:19.490> phones<00:03:19.820> have<00:03:20.720> about<00:03:21.220> 2500

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
guys an idea most phones have about 2500

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.450 
guys an idea most phones have about 2500
to<00:03:22.370> 3000<00:03:23.240> milliamp<00:03:23.660> power<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:25.070> this<00:03:25.190> is<00:03:25.310> gonna

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
to 3000 milliamp power so this is gonna

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.240 
to 3000 milliamp power so this is gonna
give<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:26.000> roughly<00:03:26.930> five<00:03:27.380> times<00:03:27.740> doesn't<00:03:28.130> mean

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
give you roughly five times doesn't mean

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.410 
give you roughly five times doesn't mean
that<00:03:28.400> you're<00:03:28.520> gonna<00:03:28.640> be<00:03:28.820> able<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:29.030> charge<00:03:29.240> your

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
that you're gonna be able to charge your

that you're gonna be able to charge your
phone<00:03:29.480> five<00:03:30.080> times<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.890> just<00:03:30.920> means<00:03:31.190> that<00:03:31.310> it

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
phone five times it just means that it

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.970 
phone five times it just means that it
has<00:03:31.580> five<00:03:32.120> times<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.540> capacity<00:03:33.170> of<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.500> regular

power bank in general I think that most
people<00:03:45.110> should<00:03:45.710> actually<00:03:45.980> buy<00:03:46.400> one<00:03:46.610> I

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
people should actually buy one I

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.850 
people should actually buy one I
actually<00:03:47.420> owns<00:03:47.810> several<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.590> them<00:03:48.710> I<00:03:48.800> don't

actually owns several of them I don't
know<00:03:49.010> if<00:03:49.100> you<00:03:49.160> guys<00:03:49.390> saw<00:03:50.390> my<00:03:50.570> video<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:50.930> couple

wireless charging I also have this raft

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.970 
wireless charging I also have this raft
power<00:03:58.700> over<00:03:59.090> here<00:03:59.360> that<00:03:59.540> this<00:03:59.690> is<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.980> 7800

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
power over here that this is a 7800

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.620 
power over here that this is a 7800
milliamp<00:04:01.370> actually<00:04:01.970> if<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:02.120> look<00:04:02.150> at<00:04:02.510> them

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
milliamp actually if you look at them

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.940 
milliamp actually if you look at them
really<00:04:02.900> closely<00:04:03.230> together

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
really closely together

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.920 
really closely together
they're<00:04:04.340> almost<00:04:04.490> about<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:05.030> same<00:04:05.240> size<00:04:05.600> and

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
they're almost about the same size and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.470 
they're almost about the same size and
this<00:04:06.020> is<00:04:06.080> 7800<00:04:07.010> this<00:04:07.370> is<00:04:07.520> not<00:04:07.670> shockproof<00:04:08.060> this

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
this is 7800 this is not shockproof this

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.930 
this is 7800 this is not shockproof this
is<00:04:08.600> not<00:04:08.750> waterproof<00:04:09.110> this<00:04:09.830> is<00:04:10.010> not<00:04:10.190> crushproof

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
is not waterproof this is not crushproof

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.360 
is not waterproof this is not crushproof
so<00:04:11.510> when<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.870> compare<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.470> sizes<00:04:12.709> you're<00:04:13.220> not

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
so when you compare the sizes you're not

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.240 
so when you compare the sizes you're not
this<00:04:13.880> is<00:04:14.030> not<00:04:14.209> going<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.660> be<00:04:14.840> that<00:04:15.680> much<00:04:15.950> bigger

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
this is not going to be that much bigger

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.020 
this is not going to be that much bigger
than<00:04:16.459> your<00:04:16.669> normal<00:04:17.380> standard<00:04:18.380> power<00:04:18.830> bank<00:04:19.190> so

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
than your normal standard power bank so

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.030 
than your normal standard power bank so
why<00:04:20.239> should<00:04:20.480> you<00:04:20.510> get<00:04:20.810> one<00:04:21.049> first<00:04:21.650> of<00:04:21.799> all<00:04:21.919> you

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
why should you get one first of all you

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.590
