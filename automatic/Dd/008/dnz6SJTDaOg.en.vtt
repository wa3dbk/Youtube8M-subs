00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.330
 very cross 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.100
 welcome to live 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.379
 here we are in chapter 4 of your 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.850
 pixelar we are again with alex and 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.490
 Rodri who are all day in the channel 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.230
 a little treat for them and between the two 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.529
 have made some pixels that we are going to 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.929
 see they have made it like a platform 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.999
 aerial and as a kind of bar for 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.039
 see it from here and so invite the 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.019
 people who see them and good for 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.999
 can also hang out drinking something 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.870
 you know they are very partying and they 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:37.520
 I really like to take things in bars and 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.160
 well let's see what they have done 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.230
 they are several megaman versions and they have 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.180
 the mega man a little more classic there 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.699
 in the middle that is what we saw in the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.879
 chapter 1 of your pixelar and good they have 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.760
 right to that mega man shooting and 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.160
 then they have a mega man version 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.140
 zero in the left part as 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.809
 You see, it's impressive, it's the figure 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.010
 bigger as you see it stands out even 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.929
 through the clouds the clouds are 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.610
 going through but hey he's super 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.080
 the mega man zero the truth is 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.090
 that is awesome and the other mega man 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.400
 which also comes out as in the position of 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.750
 shot the truth is that it also remains 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.700
 pretty cool 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.920
 and well I hope you look pretty good 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.120
 from from this platform also 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.130
 Now I'm going to get a little closer to 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.140
 that you see something better there as I say 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.440
 is the mega man is the most classic and 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.200
 then I put it back and more 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.810
 more currado the 0 is very very currado 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.370
 but also the one that the mega man the most 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.740
 normalito but shooting is also 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.560
 very currado and is made with shadows the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.090
 true that it is very very very good and good 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.860
 As I tell you, I'm going to take a little 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.810
 now closer so you can see the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.510
 sizes actually because from afar 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.220
 It may seem that they are smaller but 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.720
 actually has a lot of work and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.430
 they are very high as you can see there is the mega man 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.220
 zero reaches the clouds, so it's very 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.410
 very high and good let's go a little bit 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.840
 over there the mega man is shooting 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.580
 the truth is also achieved 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.190
 it attracts quite a lot of attention and as you see 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.160
 It also has shadows and this one is very 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.050
 very very well done and good I wanted 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.060
 approach as I have told you to see a 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.800
 little size and work because it is 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.560
 flipante as you see are completely 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.700
 made by wool ink and well there you see 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.980
 it's amazing how big it is 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.870
 and let's say that the mega man the younger man 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.790
 from the center is simpler but also 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.310
 It's pretty cranky until it's very 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.500
 nailed and elmer a man zero is already 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.849
 awesome is amazing 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.160
 there you are going to see it even has like 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.580
 fire around good good is like a 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.760
 pass 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.680
 the truth is that of the three mega man 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.090
 who have facts of these versions the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.400
 What has struck me most is the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.680
 mega man zero and good awesome 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.480
 good to thank alexis roller 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.760

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.170
 us and good as I always tell you 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.180
