 new earthquake in japan north 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.049
 the east of the country were fixed 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.070
 tremors magnitude six 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.129
 point two points 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.919
 meanwhile take some money 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:11.929
 Fukushima 1 authorities can not withdraw 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.859
 identify and bury the body of the dead 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.939
 because of our special radiation 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.109
 correspondent in Japan Vyacheslav Gusev 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:19.989
 tried to imagine what would have to 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.989
 pass the country to be reborn 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.840
 futures at that time already estimated at 300 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.929
 billion dollars 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.289
 before loss from outages 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.309
 electricity is not yet measurable when 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.180
 lights go out in areas work even 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.510
 traffic light 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.290
 Beknazarov Marat Safin I said 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.420
 got a driver's seat over 2000 years 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.040
 backwards 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.460
 and never saw turned off 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.830
 traffic lights need 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.800
 many road already restored but 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.950
 quite a few traps 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.480
 in one of them we hit a hundred 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.710
 kilometers from tokyo 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.030
 Yes 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.760
 income ends 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.590
 here it is already destroyed 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.270
 there is still very high humidity 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.540
 block ground 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.820
 what we stuck 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820
 we were lucky that the car got stuck 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.080
 just fall into a hole all the way no 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080
 place of roadway nezhad 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.840
 engineers measure photographed after 40 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.330
 minutes for us to get to pay clings over 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.660
 growth and you are the ones promptly 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.380
 to produce 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.490
 I have clearly more than ten calls 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.790
 in this survey recharge 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.870
 battery 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.000
 the numbers are constantly changing it has been reported 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.310
 the fact that 850 thousand houses in Japan are destroyed 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.430
 no earthquake 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.230
 Wednesday plane lines in 9 points 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.390
 many houses are maintained 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.780
 in one of the Japanese construction 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.420
 companies that build homes throughout 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.090
 the planet 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.670
 and trying to figure out why the Japanese are at home 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.350
 such a steady earthquake 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.970
 maybe mister nakamura 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.070
 always match the questions general 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.920
 sumitomo manager 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.369
 what is the secret of sustainability 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.490
 Japanese houses 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.250
 Komsomol of houses 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.500
 so happy 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.400
 we have more solid construction 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.480
 wall panel we for example made on 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.410
 in the factory we assemble already at the facility 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.810
 used in full-time duel our homes 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.060
 like on springs it helps pay off and 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.429
 flourishing 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.359
 care say if such leasing is better 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.009
 but for cars 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.389
 and this motorcycle services here for three years 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.469
 nasa site other planks length bad parts 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.289
 four and a half centimeters 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.189
 we will not stay 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:23.290
 particularly with real photos 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.169
 after the Hanshin earthquake it is equipped with 16 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:27.179
 years ago 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.549
 cause deformation while we built 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.489
 game to make people nervous 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.870
 affected areas goes garbage collection 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.040
 They say it will take 2 years already 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.819
 calculated that only in Miyagi Prefecture 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.890
 18 million tons to be removed all 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.750
 these ruins are all that remains of the Moscow Ring Road 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.039
 residential buildings 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.489
 270 thousand evacuated almost as much 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.560
 left the territory 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.310
 on their own many have dispersed 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.179
 by relatives 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:53.409
 the inhabitants of these towns lost their homes someone 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.699
 loved ones most work 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.599
 for the city it is agriculture 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.449
 fisheries themselves trading networks 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:00.769
 refuse to buy products 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.009
 capable of a mistake onov fishermen just not on 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:04.689
 what to fish 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.609
 134 countries have already said they are ready to help. 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:08.279
 Japan 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:09.720
 in the aftermath 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.270
 meanwhile the east coast of the country 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.650
 emptied and even hawks now 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.690
 constantly searching for food without furniture 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.440
 so much that pieces of bread are enough even 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.089
 human palms
