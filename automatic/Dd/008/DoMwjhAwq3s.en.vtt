 from what is shown a few steps 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.589
 How can I do for the PDT? 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.249

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.900
 to prevent them from inventing 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.900
 I'm going to speculate and do 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.609
 also in northern CastellÃ³n 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.410

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.530
 Bolivia - the tremendous housing ministry 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.230
 the first one allows to have a great team 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.230
 you have to update the author manually 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.220
 while from the PSOE everyone is demanding it 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.590
 well we do not just think about this 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.510
 we are going to be 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.510
 fano control 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
 from the left hand the state what the second support 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.480
 we can also enter another form 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.480
 if we want to update it 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.180
 bush to install programs and good to go 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.050
 those who cain 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.010
 the errands 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.010
 with Internet 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.799
 hands of the internet page that we have done is 11 is opening the 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.060
 work of 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.750
 microsoft where the gold 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.870
 send them 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.040
 in the middle csc they realize 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.150
 which says former president cost 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
 then this server handcuffed her 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.650
 everyone 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.149
 You can cover crushed nespresso crushed cost 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.920

 it only cost a reason 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.890
 I can see what is being installed sometimes the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.229
 the updates knows here updates and unnecessary 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.129
 that are not needed then 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.349
 I have not been in shock 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.509
 soft I like to be a month left 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:19.059
 maybe for the moment robberies in the silver of paston to show them 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.729
 like this 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:24.729
 Must do 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.089
 while this opens up let's go I'm going to show 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:32.489
 percent 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.919
 antivirus photo 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.789
 your 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:40.059
 If you have already been doing already know that we do not advise fly mortar 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.239
 antivirus 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.379
 and here on the right you see that I have 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.659
 teachers or suppress services 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.129
 searched for it and cooperating theme even expected decreases 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.539
 is up to date 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.839
 then that is an act 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:58.689
 is something important but more important are the windows updates for 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.339
 then Saturday we go to google can show 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:03.319
 other antivirus 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.479
 who love each other 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:06.569
 nothing 32 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.369
 I will make this antivirus 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.619
 lack that is spoken for nothing said 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:14.569
 the accountant is not 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.529
 aggravated customs and at the same time 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:18.849
 lamb 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.849
 the pons applications it takes a bit 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.680
 so now on Sunday we are going to put it to 32 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.219
 that is the antivirus that we are not of how not if you have 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.819
 buy an antivirus elx the antivirus that can buy 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:49.789
 we are staying

 matthysse dessens 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.959
 the company amounting to 32 

00:03:58.089 --> 00:04:01.089
 keeping the page a little more 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:02.709
 then there is 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.309
 from up to 32 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:08.589
 unveiled although we recommend this over the north or casting if you are going to 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:09.919
 to buy 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.669
 percent is because this antivirus 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.519
 efe 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.159
 peking and viano 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.759
 just like frames or your club and censuses and what does that have in a foot shape 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.400
 detect it 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.999
 the infections is that they wanted 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:26.490
 if the buyer is behaving badly 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.039
 he told it he behaves badly he has it 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.439
 the citizen behavior 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.059
 let it be pop ops 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:36.039
 pop constantly asked constantly 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.020
 p 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.629
 propaganda 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:39.610
 so 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.490
 in that case that's where he 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.669
 the atrium is put to work 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.669
 let's go ab again 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.379
 everyone once she goes there 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.180
 we have closed the page 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.129
 I have noticed them 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.870
 with the left hand 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.870
 nyse aai probable tilke sosa 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.629
 we make among the most important 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.409
 because not only do you get updates that will keep you free of infections 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:09.569
 make it up 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.740
 and that was the option that we are posiones 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.069
 that are not necessary read 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.599
 they were installed 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.510
 I do not know that there is no check in the face because 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.309
 solved 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:26.729
 percent has very bad my arrival lellouche is not known with the Palestinians 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:27.620
 they want 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.580
 the most important thing will be the politician more than the account all this makes 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:36.039
 when after that you want to click where you lived in this 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.939
 and in this the philips 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:43.999
 and there salvation began 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.439
 of the extension of 4 14 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:51.689
 de klerk of four of 14 at the national palace a job that does not have to 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:56.569
 download to install after all of them that's the best way 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:58.550
 of maintaining the level of infections 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.930
 before always windows updated 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.650
 always keep the antivirus 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.779
 updated 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:07.419
 and that
