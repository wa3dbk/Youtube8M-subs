now<00:00:18.810> my<00:00:19.080> dad<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.410> too<00:00:19.560> much<00:00:19.710> time<00:00:19.920> too<00:00:20.369> much

now my dad is too much time too much

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
now my dad is too much time too much
time<00:00:20.789> invested<00:00:20.939> let's<00:00:21.930> assume<00:00:22.460> that's<00:00:23.510> 622

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
time invested let's assume that's 622

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.560 
time invested let's assume that's 622
attempts<00:00:24.930> right<00:00:25.460> let's<00:00:26.460> assume<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:27.300> an

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
attempts right let's assume on an

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.560 
attempts right let's assume on an
average<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:28.470> was<00:00:28.619> about<00:00:28.890> 45<00:00:29.460> seconds<00:00:30.210> per

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
average that was about 45 seconds per

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.999 
average that was about 45 seconds per
attempt<00:00:31.019> or<00:00:31.109> something<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.740> let's

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
attempt or something like that let's

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.560 
attempt or something like that let's
just<00:00:32.160> assume<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.790> was<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> average

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
just assume that it was like the average

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.590 
just assume that it was like the average
so<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.590> what's<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.890> put<00:00:35.190> us<00:00:35.280> at<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.730> are

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
so what what's that put us at and are

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.360 
so what what's that put us at and are
you<00:00:36.719> kidding<00:00:36.989> me

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
you kidding me

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.100 
you kidding me
anyway<00:00:38.370> what's<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.730> put<00:00:38.910> us<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.239> taunton

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
anyway what's that put us in taunton

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.650 
anyway what's that put us in taunton
like<00:00:40.350> time<00:00:40.860> how<00:00:41.850> about<00:00:41.940> how<00:00:42.120> much<00:00:42.270> time<00:00:42.510> would

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
like time how about how much time would

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.380 
like time how about how much time would
that<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.960> invested<00:00:43.500> way<00:00:44.340> too<00:00:44.370> much<00:00:44.700> goddammit

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
way too much we have to beat this level

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.580 
way too much we have to beat this level
in<00:00:46.950> his<00:00:47.039> video<00:00:47.390> there's<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.600> mean<00:00:48.930> I'm<00:00:49.200> pretty

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
knows there's no way it's gonna change

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:52.710 
knows there's no way it's gonna change
into<00:01:51.580> what<00:01:51.729> bouncing<00:01:52.179> section<00:01:52.479> or<00:01:52.539> something

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
into what bouncing section or something

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.059 
into what bouncing section or something
like<00:01:52.929> that<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.170> last<00:01:53.380> three<00:01:53.530> percent<00:01:53.890> has<00:01:54.039> to

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
like that the last three percent has to

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.380 
like that the last three percent has to
be<00:01:54.189> like<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.490> last<00:01:54.670> three<00:01:54.759> percent<00:01:55.119> it<00:01:55.179> has<00:01:55.299> to

be like the last three percent it has to

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.570 
be like the last three percent it has to
be<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.599> same<00:01:55.780> flying<00:01:56.110> stuff<00:01:56.439> it<00:01:57.099> has<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.490> be

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
be the same flying stuff it has to be

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.490 
be the same flying stuff it has to be
there's<00:01:57.789> no<00:01:57.939> way<00:01:58.119> it's<00:01:58.299> not<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.840> if<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.380> is

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
there's no way it's not and if it is

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.719 
there's no way it's not and if it is
something<00:01:59.770> different<00:02:00.039> then<00:02:00.399> we're<00:02:00.580> pretty

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
something different then we're pretty

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.359 
something different then we're pretty
much<00:02:00.939> fucked<00:02:01.299> all<00:02:02.229> right<00:02:02.319> that<00:02:02.709> was<00:02:02.890> better

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
much fucked all right that was better

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.699 
much fucked all right that was better
now<00:02:03.759> it's<00:02:03.939> this<00:02:04.179> goddamn<00:02:04.689> flying<00:02:05.110> suit<00:02:05.470> shit

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
now it's this goddamn flying suit shit

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.479 
now it's this goddamn flying suit shit
come<00:02:05.979> on<00:02:06.899> again<00:02:07.899> again<00:02:08.349> one<00:02:08.709> time<00:02:08.950> too<00:02:09.220> many<00:02:09.340> I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
come on again again one time too many I

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.059 
come on again again one time too many I
held<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:10.000> like<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.750> fraction<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.530> second<00:02:11.920> too

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
held it like a fraction of a second too

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.090 
held it like a fraction of a second too
long<00:02:12.250> like<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.150> said<00:02:13.420> man<00:02:13.599> my<00:02:13.870> sensitivity<00:02:14.739> with

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
long like I said man my sensitivity with

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.770 
long like I said man my sensitivity with
the<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.250> button<00:02:15.640> presses<00:02:16.180> during<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.510> flying

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
the a button presses during the flying

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.319 
the a button presses during the flying
today<00:02:16.989> is<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.590> little<00:02:17.980> shaky<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.609> mean<00:02:19.209> I<00:02:19.269> know

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
today is a little shaky I mean I know

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.550 
today is a little shaky I mean I know
we're<00:02:19.600> only<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.930> third<00:02:20.230> or<00:02:20.350> fourth

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
we're only on the third or fourth

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.620 
we're only on the third or fourth
attempt<00:02:20.890> right<00:02:21.040> now<00:02:21.250> but<00:02:21.430> still<00:02:21.700> like<00:02:22.450> I

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
attempt right now but still like I

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.259 
attempt right now but still like I
immediately<00:02:23.500> noticed<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.340> even<00:02:24.640> like<00:02:24.880> once<00:02:25.120> we

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
immediately noticed it even like once we

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.640 
immediately noticed it even like once we
got<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.600> first<00:02:25.810> flying<00:02:26.140> section<00:02:26.590> I

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
got to the first flying section I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.039 
got to the first flying section I
noticed<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.209> was<00:02:28.569> actually<00:02:28.780> thinking

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
noticed it so I was actually thinking

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.080 
noticed it so I was actually thinking
that<00:02:29.500> we<00:02:29.650> could<00:02:29.799> beat<00:02:30.010> this<00:02:30.160> level<00:02:30.370> relatively

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
that we could beat this level relatively

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.390 
that we could beat this level relatively
quick<00:02:31.420> in<00:02:31.569> this<00:02:31.720> video<00:02:32.049> since<00:02:32.739> we<00:02:33.069> already

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
quick in this video since we already

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.030 
quick in this video since we already
know<00:02:33.700> what<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.329> hell<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.540> do<00:02:34.810> but<00:02:35.109> clearly<00:02:35.799> I

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
know what the hell to do but clearly I

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.640 
know what the hell to do but clearly I
don't<00:02:36.130> think<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.489> gonna<00:02:36.579> happen<00:02:36.850> me<00:02:37.380> like<00:02:38.380> I

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
don't think it's gonna happen me like I

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.830 
don't think it's gonna happen me like I
thought<00:02:38.859> we<00:02:38.920> was<00:02:39.130> gonna<00:02:39.220> be<00:02:39.340> able<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:39.970> beat

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
thought we was gonna be able to beat

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.300 
thought we was gonna be able to beat
this<00:02:40.989> level<00:02:41.049> quick<00:02:41.560> enough<00:02:41.829> to<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.069> point

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
this level quick enough to the point

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.190 
this level quick enough to the point
where<00:02:42.549> we<00:02:42.819> actually<00:02:42.970> dig<00:02:43.540> into<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:43.900> next

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
where we actually dig into the next

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.710 
where we actually dig into the next
level<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.590> get<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.799> glimpse<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.700> but<00:02:46.389> I<00:02:46.569> no

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
level and get a glimpse of that but I no

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.700 
level and get a glimpse of that but I no
longer<00:02:47.139> think<00:02:47.500> it's<00:02:47.620> happening<00:02:48.069> man

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
longer think it's happening man

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.500 
longer think it's happening man
this<00:02:49.580> is<00:02:49.760> not<00:02:50.120> cool<00:02:50.420> guys<00:02:50.720> not<00:02:51.650> cool<00:02:52.510> but

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
this is not cool guys not cool but

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.930 
this is not cool guys not cool but
anyway<00:02:53.900> another<00:02:54.740> thing<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:55.310> guys<00:02:55.430> wanted<00:02:55.880> to

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
anyway another thing you guys wanted to

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.630 
anyway another thing you guys wanted to
know<00:02:56.090> if<00:02:56.630> my<00:02:56.870> controller<00:02:57.350> was<00:02:57.980> broken<00:02:58.430> or<00:02:58.550> not

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
know if my controller was broken or not

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.700 
know if my controller was broken or not
and<00:02:58.970> no<00:02:59.240> one<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.480> not<00:02:59.660> still<00:03:00.050> working<00:03:00.440> this<00:03:00.590> is

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
and no one is not still working this is

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.290 
and no one is not still working this is
the<00:03:00.740> same<00:03:01.010> exact<00:03:01.340> controller<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:01.970> used

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
the same exact controller that I used

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.780 
the same exact controller that I used
from<00:03:02.990> two<00:03:03.290> episodes<00:03:03.740> ago<00:03:03.890> where<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.280> threw<00:03:04.670> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
from two episodes ago where I threw the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.000 
from two episodes ago where I threw the
damn<00:03:04.970> thing<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:05.990> only<00:03:06.080> thing<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.500> happened

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
damn thing the only thing that happened

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.890 
damn thing the only thing that happened
was<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.280> couple<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:07.940> plastic<00:03:08.330> pieces<00:03:08.510> just

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
was a couple of the plastic pieces just

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.410 
was a couple of the plastic pieces just
snapped<00:03:09.350> off<00:03:09.770> but<00:03:10.190> it's<00:03:10.370> snapped<00:03:10.730> right<00:03:11.180> back

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
snapped off but it's snapped right back

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.890 
snapped off but it's snapped right back
in<00:03:11.630> so<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.410> controller<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:13.750> more<00:03:14.750> or<00:03:14.870> less

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
in so the controller is more or less

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.660 
in so the controller is more or less
working<00:03:15.710> just<00:03:15.950> fine<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:17.770> mean<00:03:18.770> and<00:03:19.220> besides<00:03:19.520> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
working just fine I mean and besides the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.530
