00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
good as the Xbox version due to

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.500 
good as the Xbox version due to
differences<00:01:32.830> in<00:01:32.890> hardware<00:01:33.520> power<00:01:33.790> but

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
really hard for differences and just

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.480 
really hard for differences and just
