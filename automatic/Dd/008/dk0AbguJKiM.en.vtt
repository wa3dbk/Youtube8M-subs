00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.700 

but<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.630> best<00:02:19.840> thing<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.170> love<00:02:20.380> about<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
but the best thing I love about the

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.620 
but the best thing I love about the
Fiesta<00:02:21.160> by<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.400> mile<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.150> way<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.420> handles

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
Fiesta by a mile is the way it handles

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.290 
Fiesta by a mile is the way it handles
and<00:02:23.290> on<00:02:23.500> these<00:02:23.740> roads<00:02:24.010> out<00:02:24.250> here<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.670> deepest

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
and on these roads out here in deepest

and on these roads out here in deepest
darkest<00:02:25.780> Lincoln<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.920> whole<00:02:27.100> thing

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
darkest Lincoln the whole thing

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.730 
darkest Lincoln the whole thing
just<00:02:27.520> comes<00:02:27.819> alive<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.480> other<00:02:29.080> cars<00:02:29.319> like<00:02:29.500> the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
just comes alive in other cars like the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.320 
just comes alive in other cars like the
Punto<00:02:30.100> especially<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.790> steering<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.300> so

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
Punto especially the steering is so

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330 
Punto especially the steering is so
heavy<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.110> very<00:02:32.380> rarely<00:02:32.680> seem<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.220> have

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
heavy that you very rarely seem to have

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.610 
heavy that you very rarely seem to have
any<00:02:33.459> input<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.090> driving<00:02:34.360> process<00:02:34.690> you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
any input in the driving process you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.230 
any input in the driving process you
feel<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.830> bit<00:02:36.040> like<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.220> spare<00:02:36.610> part<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.209> that

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
feel a bit like a spare part and that

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.910 
feel a bit like a spare part and that
the<00:02:37.570> machine<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.050> just<00:02:38.140> doing<00:02:38.440> all<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.709> work

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
the machine is just doing all the work

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.890 
the machine is just doing all the work
but<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.820> Fiesta<00:02:40.270> it<00:02:40.360> almost<00:02:40.540> feels<00:02:40.810> like

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
but in the Fiesta it almost feels like

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.300 
but in the Fiesta it almost feels like
an<00:02:41.080> extension<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.680> your<00:02:41.740> body

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
an extension of your body

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.310 
an extension of your body
you<00:02:42.580> just<00:02:42.730> have<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:42.940> telepathically<00:02:43.870> tell<00:02:44.200> the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
you just have to telepathically tell the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.900 
you just have to telepathically tell the
car<00:02:44.500> what<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.709> want<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.100> do<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.670> it'll

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
car what you want it to do and it'll

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.420 
car what you want it to do and it'll
respond<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.959> just<00:02:47.260> seems<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.620> make<00:02:47.800> sense<00:02:48.160> and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
respond it just seems to make sense and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.610 
respond it just seems to make sense and
that's<00:02:48.550> why<00:02:48.819> for<00:02:49.060> me<00:02:49.239> it's<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.900> perfect<00:02:50.200> car

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
that's why for me it's the perfect car

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.070 
that's why for me it's the perfect car
for<00:02:50.830> students<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.820> doesn't<00:02:52.150> claim<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.480> be<00:02:52.840> a

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
for students it doesn't claim to be a

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.199 
for students it doesn't claim to be a
particularly<00:02:53.650> sophisticated<00:02:54.640> car<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.120> it

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
particularly sophisticated car and it

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.310 
particularly sophisticated car and it
certainly<00:02:55.540> doesn't<00:02:55.750> have<00:02:55.959> any<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.230> the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
certainly doesn't have any of the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.650 
certainly doesn't have any of the
technology<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.040> support<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.580> but<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.450> just

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
technology to support that but it just

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.420 
technology to support that but it just
does<00:02:58.840> exactly<00:02:59.170> what<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.560> says<00:02:59.769> on<00:02:59.800> the<00:03:00.010> tin<00:03:00.250> and

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
does exactly what it says on the tin and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.190 
does exactly what it says on the tin and
the<00:03:01.120> price<00:03:01.360> for<00:03:01.600> all<00:03:01.630> this<00:03:01.810> just<00:03:02.590> 1,200<00:03:03.310> pounds

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
the price for all this just 1,200 pounds

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.600 
the price for all this just 1,200 pounds
driving<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.290> Fiesta<00:03:05.739> today<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.190> seems<00:03:06.459> to

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
driving the Fiesta today it seems to

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.360 
driving the Fiesta today it seems to
reinforce<00:03:07.269> why<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:07.900> such<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.140> good<00:03:08.380> car<00:03:08.650> it

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
reinforce why it is such a good car it

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.650
