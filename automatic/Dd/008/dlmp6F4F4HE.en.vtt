00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 halli hello and welcome to the twelfth 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.379
 in front of every fifa 15 people look very briefly 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.019
 times down here right or just 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.960
 Not quite the players I am downstairs 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.969
 At that time, when this had been pulled free 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.279
 packs already was quite a while ago the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.699
 now also these two free 35 cars 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.130
 or something and yes from them to you my best 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.050
 as were cuba and so as not to 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.359
 has endured so I had then 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.119
 rather safety but after that 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.590
 nothing worked and I had a file 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.270
 deleted because it was so exciting 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.980
 ultimately we do not welcome one 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.469
 new players in our team and that 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.510
 is kevin prince boateng the now 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.399
 box our league team and we 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.920
 my very much come against this year 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.600
 similar looking bearded families 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.719
 this team seems a similar one 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.789
 be a focal point as I in my eyes 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.170
 Simply player the very good position 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.449
 and then maybe after 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.120
 upgrade is definitely a bit 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.730
 so yes yes 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.649
 I apologize again as she says 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.270
 still sick because there is no 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.400
 faith healing from now then today 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.400
 what is getting better every day what 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.049
 It's not so bad then 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.420
 again road to glory just because I 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.070
 of what had recorded and so much 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.110
 I do not currently have a similar selection 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.590
 that's why you can not record so much 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.509
 that would have to be understood and it will 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.570
 other thing but I can now 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.960
 the time i am sick and also with 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.290
 planting others 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.420
 semester classes of the university are queuing yes 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.720
 I record something limited in things 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.520
 and that's why I have to look what I am 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.290
 always have and that comes 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.509
 then I can not promise 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.000
 that that and that comes then and then 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.300
 no fixed upload plan for the next one 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.310
 weeks first I hope you can 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.619
 understand well we are now in village 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.050
 lead solitude the post 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.990
 met but instead of 3 to 1 gives it up 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.470
 the other side a penalty and the eleven 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.610
 chance of our opponent on 2 2 too 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.869
 shorten 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.149
 by miralem pjanic and that occurs then 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.800
 also against kevin trapp the still 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.860
 a bit around the world 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.989
 line but despite correct corner on 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.530
 not be able to penetrate this end 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.260
 to parry the ball second half then 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.830
 but right from the start kalou on 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.310
 our superstars and almost all of them 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.510
 finds own 3 2 again the leadership 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.730
 and now our opponent broke up 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.400
 Immediately wanted compensation and that works 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.769
 rarely crooked kalou then light 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.650
 Rebound campaigner and the right times 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.200
 and celebration in this lot of mixa hits 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.660
 with luck 4 to 2 now be the 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.670
 course, twice as nice 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.630
 twice as many goals are scored there 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.350
 had 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.400
 gustavo perisic walks by and he sees 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.090
 the 5 to 2 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.980
 and of course the game was through 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.940
 our opponents were not bothered anymore 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:08.620
 and so he asks out here at the booth 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:12.880
 from 52 2 so nice game twice 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:18.280
 own one perisic once so then 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.170
 which is probably three times its own could be so 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.900
 we had six points 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.880
 now in our league after initially 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.579
 defeat two victories in a row 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.410
 So nothing went directly this 43rd 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.690
 number two times bring back the team 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.139
 However, with a composer midfield 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.490
 by remy sanchez that is strong behind 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:40.030
 but then rooney 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.710
 if you're midfielder that's not 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.710
 quite as strong this is definitely 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.870
 not so super smart and the revenge 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.720
 also very fast first 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.580
 action kalou prevails here and 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.200
 hits the 1 0 after six minutes clear 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.970
 Attack star can this team 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.470
 Of course, three are offensive 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.080
 midfielder behind three strikers 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.990
 but he simply has none 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.970
 Mittelfeld especially central defensive 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.860
 of course, nothing at all 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.540
 our opponent and that's why it was 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.190
 Midfield usually relatively fast 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.960
 but bridged our opponent was the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.450
 first time directly after my gate show 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.239
 that he is offensively strong and withdraws 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.840
 then weakly defended by me 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.250
 the one on one right by remy though 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.070
 that was it with all that 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.530
 serenity opponent and services our 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.890
 boateng played on cup class 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.110
 perisic perovic with the two to one 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.940
 Minutes later again bavaria already there 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.920
 no midfielder anymore 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.920
 directly on the estimate again 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:45.910
 it is betrayed the divorced this time 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.500
 but to cech in the gate again minutes 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.510
 midfield already long ago 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.010
 bridged with a half pass and 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:56.800
 then it is against 34 kreten defenders 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.620
 interspersed in the long corner pushes and 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.860
 on 321 older and again short time 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:06.370
 later misguided and conquest and 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.610
 the tan and of course ivan perisic with 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.780
 the 4 2 1 decision and also the 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:17.830
 next ripke three torpedoes once 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:20.050
 salomon kalou and yes already nine 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.700
 points and I think now in the 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.440
 relegation done that we do not 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.020
 descend in front of me three more points for 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.000
 the climb and another three points for 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.000
 the championship but first of all 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.010
 against this topic the trecker trecker 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.340
 heavily on her maria hall in 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.650
 Form is ruin yesterday in the air 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:47.240
 what in the form of reha or sec and 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.979
 inform yourself petit &amp; company that 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.990
 the best chance of the opponent in the 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.710
 whole game that says a lot 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.139
 out 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.610
 because only the team alone is enough 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.669
 Of course not only was not bad 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.039
 opponent does not understand me wrong but 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.539
 I do not know if I already have so many 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.580
 play experience with his team now 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.289
 or if so as the first player was 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.979
 I can not say exactly 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.539
 ah yes as I said his was it 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:15.289
 of course a top feature of the now 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:17.719
 but he has only got far 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.129
 can help here at all and also 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.500
 If I do not have the biggest chance 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:23.810
 this game had end in the end then 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.849
 a good attack carlo joins in 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.479
 Good luck here and push one 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:32.240
 ninetieth minute the 1 0 against this 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.740
 murder team and almost as a team of course 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.509
 The real kick came 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.729
 I 'm a bit jealous of course 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:40.129
 but we have an ivan for it 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.589
 perisic who played at least as well 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:44.120
 puts in the middle sokratis why 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:48.229
 also always forward to understand there 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.330
 and it is even 2 0 in the 90th 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:53.689
 minute than zero at the end of the two 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.430
 against this monster from a team and 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:57.259
 drive the third victory now or 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.289
 a total of four victories in succession in 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:02.569
 this league and yes that high for the 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.860
 thesis she just looks statistic does not have to 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:06.979
 quite as it looks but I'll show you 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.689
 now only show from where our opponents 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:10.279
 the whole time meant to shoot that 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:11.449
 was not very dangerous except 

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:13.819
 this one shot of iniesta 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:15.080
 he liked me and about mine 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:16.969
 could speak change a voice 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.199
 bit of a valuation of you a happy 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:19.699
 someone asked him if I spectator 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:22.009
 teams at the nightliner can le matin 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:24.139
 Maybe he will send suggestions 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:27.399
 then presented here until the 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:27.399
 next time will be first
