Midway the two campaigns are complete

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.390 
Midway the two campaigns are complete
distinct<00:01:01.900> so<00:01:02.080> when<00:01:02.199> you<00:01:02.260> play<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:03.070> Japanese

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
distinct so when you play the Japanese

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.979 
distinct so when you play the Japanese
campaign<00:01:03.820> you<00:01:04.180> play<00:01:04.360> all<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.660> way<00:01:04.690> through<00:01:04.960> so

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
campaign you play all the way through so

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.020 
campaign you play all the way through so
it's<00:01:05.229> not<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.380> case<00:01:05.619> of<00:01:05.650> you<00:01:06.130> play<00:01:06.369> same<00:01:06.790> mission

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
it's not a case of you play same mission

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.609 
it's not a case of you play same mission
that<00:01:07.119> you<00:01:07.210> played<00:01:07.360> on<00:01:07.390> us<00:01:07.660> campaign<00:01:08.140> from<00:01:08.470> the

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
that you played on us campaign from the

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.290 
that you played on us campaign from the
other<00:01:08.740> point<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.070> view<00:01:09.220> they're<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:09.910> distinct

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
other point of view they're the distinct

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.990 
other point of view they're the distinct
parts<00:01:10.660> it<00:01:10.810> really<00:01:10.960> is<00:01:11.050> double<00:01:11.290> contact

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
parts it really is double contact

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.730 
parts it really is double contact
addition<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.570> Japanese<00:01:13.990> campaign<00:01:14.530> is

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
addition of the Japanese campaign is

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.400 
addition of the Japanese campaign is
great<00:01:15.399> in<00:01:15.610> many<00:01:15.880> ways<00:01:16.119> with<00:01:16.720> it<00:01:16.869> it<00:01:17.050> brings<00:01:17.229> a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
great in many ways with it it brings a

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.530 
great in many ways with it it brings a
whole<00:01:17.440> host<00:01:17.800> of<00:01:18.009> units<00:01:18.399> that<00:01:18.520> you<00:01:18.729> won't<00:01:19.210> see

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
whole host of units that you won't see

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.690 
whole host of units that you won't see
me<00:01:19.690> for<00:01:19.800> well<00:01:20.800> obviously<00:01:20.950> all<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.340> units<00:01:21.580> are

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
me for well obviously all the units are

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.380 
me for well obviously all the units are
different<00:01:22.090> they've<00:01:22.180> got<00:01:22.270> different

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
different they've got different

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.910 
different they've got different
strengths<00:01:22.899> and<00:01:23.080> weaknesses<00:01:23.440> different

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
strengths and weaknesses different

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.920 
strengths and weaknesses different
tactical<00:01:24.220> uses<00:01:24.640> so<00:01:25.180> where<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.509> American

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
tactical uses so where the American

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
tactical uses so where the American
counterpart<00:01:26.380> might<00:01:26.530> be<00:01:26.649> more<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.860> an

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
counterpart might be more of an

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.830 
counterpart might be more of an
all-round<00:01:27.399> ship<00:01:27.670> maybe<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.149> Japanese<00:01:28.509> one<00:01:28.690> is

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
all-round ship maybe the Japanese one is

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.440 
all-round ship maybe the Japanese one is
more<00:01:28.960> dedicated<00:01:29.320> at<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.680> air<00:01:29.860> or

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
more dedicated at the air or

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.719 
more dedicated at the air or
has<00:01:30.539> more<00:01:30.750> torpedo<00:01:31.259> tubes<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.189> opens<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.579> new

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
has more torpedo tubes so opens up new

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.639 
has more torpedo tubes so opens up new
tactics<00:01:33.180> new<00:01:33.299> possibilities<00:01:33.810> new<00:01:34.259> challenges

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
tactics new possibilities new challenges

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.050 
tactics new possibilities new challenges
to<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> player<00:01:35.039> just<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:35.850> adds<00:01:35.939> another

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
to the player just really adds another

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.780 
to the player just really adds another
layer<00:01:36.299> today

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.240 

so<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.480> comes<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.840> battle<00:01:41.230> sequences<00:01:41.650> in<00:01:42.100> the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
so it comes to battle sequences in the

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.410 
so it comes to battle sequences in the
Pacific<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.790> what<00:01:42.940> players<00:01:43.120> can<00:01:43.270> really

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
Pacific the what players can really

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.720 
Pacific the what players can really
expect<00:01:43.690> it's<00:01:43.870> just<00:01:44.020> intensity<00:01:44.740> is<00:01:45.010> action

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
expect it's just intensity is action

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.250 
expect it's just intensity is action
so've<00:01:46.240> up<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.480> parts<00:01:46.720> will<00:01:46.900> limit<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.200> can

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
so've up the parts will limit you can

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.780 
so've up the parts will limit you can
see<00:01:47.470> just<00:01:47.500> pot<00:01:48.130> lid<00:01:48.250> fly<00:01:48.460> through<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.730> air

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
see just pot lid fly through the air

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.640 
see just pot lid fly through the air
we've<00:01:49.330> up<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.870> damage<00:01:50.080> model<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.530> can

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
we've up the damage model so you can

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.260 
we've up the damage model so you can
blow<00:01:50.740> wings<00:01:51.010> off<00:01:51.160> planes<00:01:51.430> tails<00:01:51.790> off<00:01:51.970> planes

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
blow wings off planes tails off planes

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.360 
blow wings off planes tails off planes
when<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.260> comes<00:01:53.410> to<00:01:53.500> ships<00:01:53.740> it's<00:01:53.920> fantastic

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
when it comes to ships it's fantastic

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.030 
when it comes to ships it's fantastic
and<00:01:54.460> break<00:01:54.640> them<00:01:54.760> apart<00:01:54.790> completely<00:01:55.860> an<00:01:56.860> all

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
and break them apart completely an all
