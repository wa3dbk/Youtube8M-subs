00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.009 

look<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.619> will<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:29.130> soon<00:00:29.429> until<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.480> hold

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
look that will not do soon until we hold

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.870 
look that will not do soon until we hold
that<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.380> place<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:32.430> unless<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.850> child

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880

physically<00:00:33.570> holds<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:35.090> I<00:00:36.090> daresay

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
physically holds it up and I daresay

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.060 
physically holds it up and I daresay
there's<00:00:37.110> someone<00:00:37.380> out<00:00:37.500> there<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.040> it

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
there's someone out there that can do it

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.430 
there's someone out there that can do it
but<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:39.239> know<00:00:39.270> you've<00:00:39.989> got<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> make<00:00:40.320> these

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
but you know you've got to make these

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.170 
but you know you've got to make these
things<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.890> cool<00:00:41.100> proven<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:41.610> idiot<00:00:41.850> proof<00:00:42.030> as

things as cool proven as idiot proof as

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600 
things as cool proven as idiot proof as
possible<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.829> very<00:00:43.860> very<00:00:44.340> quick

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
possible so it's a very very quick

wise as the select over then it's got
three<00:01:00.149> recline<00:01:00.510> positions<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.920> parent

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
three recline positions so it's a parent

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:12.590 
three recline positions so it's a parent
facing<00:01:03.470> forward<00:01:04.470> facing<00:01:06.170> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
oh yes the adjustable footrest you can

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.940 
oh yes the adjustable footrest you can
still<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.600> you've<00:01:15.840> got<00:01:16.049> same<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.830> the

on that seat side in a minute rather
look<00:01:23.280> there's<00:01:23.549> two<00:01:23.700> believers<00:01:23.940> at<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> back

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
look there's two believers at the back

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.389 
look there's two believers at the back
legal<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.290> give<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.799> three<00:01:26.040> recline

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
legal one give you three recline

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:27.830 
legal one give you three recline
positions<00:01:26.850> remember<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.479> from<00:01:27.600> six

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
positions remember this is from six

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.469 
positions remember this is from six
months<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.830> got<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.460> mid<00:01:30.299> position

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
months so you got like that mid position

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.100 
months so you got like that mid position
a<00:01:30.899> prime<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:32.369> fold<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
a prime to fold this it's not the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.930 
a prime to fold this it's not the
recording<00:01:34.590> Lee<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.220> look<00:01:35.369> below

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
recording Lee but if you look below

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.389 
recording Lee but if you look below
there's<00:01:36.420> too<00:01:36.570> little<00:01:36.600> catches<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.159> what<00:01:38.280> I'm

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
there's too little catches so what I'm

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.120 
there's too little catches so what I'm
doing<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.789> squeezing<00:01:39.180> those<00:01:39.360> two<00:01:39.570> catches

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
doing is squeezing those two catches

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.149 
doing is squeezing those two catches
fold<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.430> half<00:01:44.210> there<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.300> go<00:01:45.860> how'd<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.890> as

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
fold it in half there we go how'd it as

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.510 
fold it in half there we go how'd it as
well<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:49.190> remember<00:01:50.190> that<00:01:50.220> was<00:01:51.050> forward<00:01:52.050> facing

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
well so remember that was forward facing

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.340 
well so remember that was forward facing
now<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.580> do<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.789> parent<00:01:54.240> facing<00:01:55.069> turn<00:01:56.069> around

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.660 

still<00:02:01.350> got<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.560> tapping<00:02:02.100> sound<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.520> coin

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
still got the tapping sound of coin

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.370 
still got the tapping sound of coin
mechanism<00:02:03.710> still<00:02:04.710> got<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> same<00:02:05.220> poll<00:02:09.380> and

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
mechanism still got the same poll and

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.620 
mechanism still got the same poll and
it's<00:02:10.560> smaller<00:02:10.890> folded<00:02:11.519> as<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.850> say<00:02:12.060> them<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.480> is

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
it's smaller folded as I say them it is

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.840 
it's smaller folded as I say them it is
on<00:02:13.049> this<00:02:13.140> erected<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:14.160> simple<00:02:14.519> reason<00:02:14.730> your
