00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.540
 keep our heading small 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.099
 fishing trick 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.449
 Today the conversation will go to the terminal 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.559
 krutilok for 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.109
 apakov leash 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:18.769
 usually he 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.400
 can be found in the store 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.369
 a certain amount of forest difference 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.939
 shipped 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.460
 which usually use rub in 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.169
 times pockmarked 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.979
 and which is well suited for smooth 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:32.360
 because they have 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.120
 I passed 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120
 but this is a typical etozh small range 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.930
 in order to be led from different conditions 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.100
 backrest required to have 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.260
 well at least 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.960
 a shatan after two three grams 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.290
 decent scale range 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.600
 in this case, you can simply type in 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.820
 the store 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.690
 normal loads on the nose 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 with hole 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.550
 such a decree was unloaded plus 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.430
 done in one minute 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.330
 before the wire segment 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.940
 In this case, my husband not to lose 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.230
 of time 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.990
 formed here 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.890
 gpu shock 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.890
 through the hole 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.470
 and at the other end 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.770
 any 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.210
 there either looped behind some 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.390
 anything just like that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.650
 anyway all consumable 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.770
 per liter and somehow strongly 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.750
 it makes no sense to strengthen them 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.750
 any is done 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.730
 ashes anything to back 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.230
 failed at last year 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.370
 course back failed 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.370
 biting off the center too much 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.170
 you are ready 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.270

 report on injections 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.360

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.779
 we would like you MSK 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.279
 note 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.369
 a small figure for which constantly 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:14.669
 think and ask what the heat is doing on 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:16.349
 this century 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.359
