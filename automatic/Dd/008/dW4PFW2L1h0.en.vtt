00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.450 

so<00:00:01.589> all<00:00:02.120> ox3<00:00:03.170> asked<00:00:04.170> me<00:00:04.319> how<00:00:04.890> do<00:00:04.950> I<00:00:05.069> make<00:00:05.250> the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
so all ox3 asked me how do I make the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.770 
so all ox3 asked me how do I make the
redstone<00:00:05.940> power<00:00:06.210> go<00:00:06.839> down<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.379> lower<00:00:07.560> levels

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
redstone power go down to lower levels

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.700 
redstone power go down to lower levels
so<00:00:09.780> i'm<00:00:10.080> going<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.219> show<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:12.410> it's<00:00:13.410> actually

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
so i'm going to show you it's actually

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.590 
so i'm going to show you it's actually
quite<00:00:14.400> simple<00:00:16.340> come<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.460> computer<00:00:17.820> there<00:00:18.510> we

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
quite simple come on computer there we

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.120 
quite simple come on computer there we
go<00:00:19.460> you<00:00:20.460> said<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.939> were<00:00:21.090> using<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.750> lever<00:00:22.529> so

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
go you said you were using a lever so

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.099 
go you said you were using a lever so
basically<00:00:23.550> i'm<00:00:23.760> assuming<00:00:24.060> something<00:00:24.840> like

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
basically i'm assuming something like

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.880 
basically i'm assuming something like
this<00:00:26.539> one<00:00:27.539> way<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
this one way to do it is to have the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.420 
this one way to do it is to have the
redstone<00:00:29.369> coming<00:00:29.730> out<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> back<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:31.430> then

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
redstone coming out of the back and then

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.600 
redstone coming out of the back and then
have<00:00:35.090> they<00:00:36.090> sleep<00:00:36.420> blocks<00:00:38.000> coming<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.149> down

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
have they sleep blocks coming it down

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.979 
have they sleep blocks coming it down
like<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:47.870> put<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
like a so and then you can put the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.209 
like a so and then you can put the
redstone<00:00:50.090> going<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
redstone going down like that and

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.040 
redstone going down like that and
basically<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:54.180> whatever<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.629> need<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> do

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
basically do whatever you need to do

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.170 
basically do whatever you need to do
with<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.350> down<00:00:55.710> there<00:00:56.270> or<00:00:57.270> another<00:00:57.899> way<00:00:59.180> that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
with it down there or another way that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.049 
with it down there or another way that
you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.430> that's<00:01:02.430> useful<00:01:02.699> if<00:01:02.969> you're

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you can do it that's useful if you're

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.570 
you can do it that's useful if you're
hiding<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> wall<00:01:04.339> but<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.430> you're

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
hiding it up on a wall but if you're

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.870 
hiding it up on a wall but if you're
hiding<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> lowest<00:01:06.659> block<00:01:07.729> you<00:01:08.729> know

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
hiding it on the lowest block you know

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.210 
hiding it on the lowest block you know
you're<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> floor<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:10.619> easier<00:01:12.979> not<00:01:13.979> really

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
you're the floor it's easier not really

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.100 
you're the floor it's easier not really
easier<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.240> way<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:16.080> down

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
easier but it's a way for it to go down

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.490 
easier but it's a way for it to go down
a<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:17.250> bit<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.670> directly<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.350> have

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
a little bit more directly so we have

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.170 
a little bit more directly so we have
our<00:01:19.530> lover<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.479> on<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.960> block<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.740> there

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
our lover there on that block up there

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.620 
our lover there on that block up there
so<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.810> is

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
so we can do is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.350 
so we can do is
directly<00:01:27.630> underneath<00:01:28.020> bitch<00:01:32.360> underneath

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
directly underneath bitch underneath

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.200 
directly underneath bitch underneath
that<00:01:33.780> blog<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.450> put<00:01:36.900> redstone<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.250> then

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
that blog you can put redstone and then

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.380 
that blog you can put redstone and then
have<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.630> coming<00:01:39.900> down<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:41.790> gets<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.210> down

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
have that coming down that gets it down

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:51.850 
have that coming down that gets it down
a<00:01:42.750> little<00:01:43.140> bit<00:01:43.350> more<00:01:43.590> quickly<00:01:45.590> so

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.560 

get<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.890> trip<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.570> lever

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
get out of here so if I trip this lever

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.840 
get out of here so if I trip this lever
here<00:01:57.830> it's<00:01:58.830> going<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.070> power<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.580> block

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
here it's going to power this block

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.249 
here it's going to power this block
which<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.240> going<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.509> power<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.899> redstone

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
which is going to power the redstone

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.540 
which is going to power the redstone
wire<00:02:01.470> under<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:04.670> allows<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.970> to

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
wire under it and that allows you to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.580 
wire under it and that allows you to
bring<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.729> power<00:02:09.030> down<00:02:10.130> fairly<00:02:11.130> efficiently

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
bring that power down fairly efficiently

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.270 
bring that power down fairly efficiently
so<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.620> hope<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.160> answered<00:02:14.610> your<00:02:14.910> question<00:02:16.280> if

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
so I hope I answered your question if

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.940 
so I hope I answered your question if
not<00:02:17.700> just<00:02:18.360> comment<00:02:19.050> on<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.380> video<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.860> i'll

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
not just comment on the video and i'll

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.690 
not just comment on the video and i'll
make<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> video<00:02:20.670> response<00:02:21.000> or<00:02:21.360> something
