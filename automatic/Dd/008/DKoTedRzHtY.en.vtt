attached<00:00:44.930> to<00:00:45.199> it<00:00:45.760> I'll<00:00:46.760> show<00:00:47.120> you<00:00:47.239> what<00:00:47.329> it

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
attached to it I'll show you what it

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.720 
attached to it I'll show you what it
looks<00:00:47.540> like<00:00:47.659> without<00:00:47.839> all<00:00:48.019> this<00:00:48.409> stuff<00:00:48.920> so

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
looks like without all this stuff so

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.000 
looks like without all this stuff so
what<00:00:49.910> you're<00:00:50.000> left<00:00:50.120> with<00:00:50.239> is<00:00:50.539> a<00:00:50.899> pretty<00:00:51.079> pretty

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
what you're left with is a pretty pretty

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.720 
what you're left with is a pretty pretty
good<00:00:52.160> body<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:53.269> flip<00:00:53.870> out<00:00:54.019> LCD<00:00:54.890> is<00:00:55.070> great<00:00:55.399> for

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
good body the flip out LCD is great for

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.610 
good body the flip out LCD is great for
when<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:55.910> have<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.059> get<00:00:56.239> shots<00:00:56.589> that<00:00:57.589> are

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
when you have to get shots that are

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.779 
when you have to get shots that are
awkward<00:00:57.829> or<00:00:58.730> we<00:00:59.120> have<00:00:59.269> to<00:00:59.390> look<00:00:59.750> up<00:00:59.929> at<00:01:00.079> things

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
awkward or we have to look up at things

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.579 
awkward or we have to look up at things
so<00:01:01.789> of<00:01:02.239> course<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.660> body<00:01:02.870> is<00:01:03.050> only<00:01:03.199> as<00:01:03.379> good<00:01:03.530> as

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
so of course the body is only as good as

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.980 
so of course the body is only as good as
the<00:01:04.009> lens<00:01:04.190> that<00:01:04.399> you<00:01:04.519> have<00:01:04.699> for<00:01:04.940> it<00:01:05.030> I<00:01:05.630> have<00:01:05.960> a

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
the lens that you have for it I have a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.050 
the lens that you have for it I have a
couple<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.320> lenses<00:01:06.500> actually<00:01:06.920> for<00:01:07.759> different

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
couple of lenses actually for different

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.590 
couple of lenses actually for different
situations<00:01:09.460> this<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:10.759> one<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.119> my<00:01:11.240> favorite

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
situations this is one of my favorite

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.430 
situations this is one of my favorite
ones<00:01:11.780> it's<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.710> it's<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.640> 50<00:01:14.030> millimeter<00:01:14.210> F<00:01:14.810> 1

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
ones it's the it's the 50 millimeter F 1

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.880 
ones it's the it's the 50 millimeter F 1
point<00:01:15.679> 4<00:01:15.890> it's<00:01:16.610> it's<00:01:17.149> great<00:01:17.539> for<00:01:18.080> for

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
point 4 it's it's great for for

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.679 
point 4 it's it's great for for
portraits<00:01:19.310> if<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.119> can<00:01:20.270> see<00:01:20.390> you<00:01:20.479> can<00:01:20.600> look

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
portraits if you can see you can look

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.370 
portraits if you can see you can look
almost<00:01:20.869> directly<00:01:21.439> through<00:01:23.229> through<00:01:24.229> the

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
almost directly through through the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.960 
almost directly through through the
entire<00:01:24.619> lens<00:01:24.799> because<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.310> aperture<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.759> so

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
entire lens because the aperture is so

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:26.440 
entire lens because the aperture is so
wide

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
wide

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.749 
wide
this<00:01:27.049> gives<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.470> really<00:01:27.740> dreamy<00:01:28.130> shallow

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
this gives you the really dreamy shallow

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:29.760 
this gives you the really dreamy shallow
depth<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.119> field

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
depth of field

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.789 
depth of field
great<00:01:30.770> great<00:01:31.250> for<00:01:31.399> portraits<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.469> the

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
great great for portraits this is the

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.069 
great great for portraits this is the
kit<00:01:33.950> lens<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:34.280> I<00:01:34.310> came<00:01:34.369> with<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.880> 60d<00:01:35.329> it's<00:01:35.899> a

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
kit lens so I came with the 60d it's a

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.920 
kit lens so I came with the 60d it's a
18<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.680> 135<00:01:37.719> is<00:01:38.719> there's<00:01:39.170> no<00:01:39.380> usm<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:40.820> it's<00:01:41.780> not

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
18 to 135 is there's no usm so it's not

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.020 
18 to 135 is there's no usm so it's not
as<00:01:42.110> fast<00:01:42.350> as<00:01:42.590> focusing<00:01:43.070> but<00:01:43.280> at<00:01:43.490> least<00:01:43.700> image

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
as fast as focusing but at least image

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.510 
as fast as focusing but at least image
stabilization<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.810> there<00:01:45.159> it's<00:01:46.159> great<00:01:46.340> for

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
stabilization is there it's great for

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.270 
stabilization is there it's great for
like<00:01:46.670> standard<00:01:47.210> shots<00:01:47.500> now<00:01:48.500> this<00:01:48.770> is<00:01:49.009> my

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
like standard shots now this is my

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.789 
like standard shots now this is my
ultra-wide<00:01:49.939> lens<00:01:50.200> ten<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.380> twenty<00:01:51.649> two

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
ultra-wide lens ten to twenty two

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:58.359 
ultra-wide lens ten to twenty two
millimeter<00:01:52.539> f3<00:01:53.619> 3.5<00:01:55.210> 3.5<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.420> 4.5<00:01:56.979> it's<00:01:57.979> great

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
millimeter f3 3.5 3.5 to 4.5 it's great

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.120 
millimeter f3 3.5 3.5 to 4.5 it's great
for<00:01:58.549> architecture<00:01:59.560> crowded<00:02:00.560> rooms<00:02:00.770> really

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
for architecture crowded rooms really

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.270 
for architecture crowded rooms really
tight<00:02:01.460> spaces<00:02:01.969> it's<00:02:02.210> it's<00:02:03.020> really<00:02:03.530> wide<00:02:03.740> the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
tight spaces it's it's really wide the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.399 
tight spaces it's it's really wide the
the<00:02:04.700> angles<00:02:05.659> that<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.899> can<00:02:05.990> get<00:02:06.140> with<00:02:06.289> this

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
the angles that you can get with this

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.029 
the angles that you can get with this
and<00:02:06.680> last<00:02:07.490> but<00:02:07.640> not<00:02:07.759> least<00:02:08.000> my<00:02:08.329> telephoto<00:02:09.079> this

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
and last but not least my telephoto this

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.460 
and last but not least my telephoto this
is<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.280> 72<00:02:11.739> 70<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.829> 300<00:02:13.250> millimeter<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:14.299> usm<00:02:15.109> so

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
is a 72 70 to 300 millimeter is usm so

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.640 
is a 72 70 to 300 millimeter is usm so
it<00:02:15.590> has<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:16.459> has<00:02:16.489> image<00:02:17.060> stabilization<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.780> an

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
it has it has image stabilization and an

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.680 
it has it has image stabilization and an
ultrasonic<00:02:19.130> motor<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:20.000> it's<00:02:20.150> quick<00:02:20.299> to<00:02:20.390> focus

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
ultrasonic motor so it's quick to focus

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.039 
ultrasonic motor so it's quick to focus
and<00:02:21.070> it's<00:02:22.070> got<00:02:22.280> multiple<00:02:22.780> stabilizer<00:02:23.780> modes

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
and it's got multiple stabilizer modes

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.080 
and it's got multiple stabilizer modes
this<00:02:24.919> is<00:02:25.070> pretty<00:02:25.220> much<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.519> best<00:02:25.639> telephoto

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
this is pretty much the best telephoto

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.729 
this is pretty much the best telephoto
you<00:02:26.180> can<00:02:26.299> get<00:02:26.449> before<00:02:26.630> crossing<00:02:27.260> over<00:02:27.380> into

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
you can get before crossing over into

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.110
