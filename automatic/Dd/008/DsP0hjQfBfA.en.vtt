here<00:03:24.960> on<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.320> timer<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:26.370> when<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.580> slide<00:03:26.850> it

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
here on the timer so when you slide it

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.970 
here on the timer so when you slide it
in<00:03:27.150> make<00:03:28.020> sure<00:03:28.200> it's<00:03:28.320> lined<00:03:28.500> up<00:03:28.650> under<00:03:28.920> there

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980

you may have to pull it out this one's
pushed<00:04:12.960> in<00:04:13.200> so<00:04:13.380> we<00:04:14.310> need<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.520> pull<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.790> out<00:04:14.910> and

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
pushed in so we need to pull it out and

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.990 
pushed in so we need to pull it out and
then<00:04:16.590> we<00:04:16.680> need<00:04:16.830> to<00:04:16.920> take<00:04:17.070> our<00:04:17.280> small

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
then we need to take our small

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.420 
then we need to take our small
screwdriver<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:21.690> push<00:04:22.680> this<00:04:22.830> back<00:04:23.040> down<00:04:23.250> so

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
screwdriver and push this back down so

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.840 
screwdriver and push this back down so
we<00:04:23.520> can<00:04:23.640> get<00:04:23.730> the<00:04:23.850> knob<00:04:24.000> on<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:26.430> will<00:04:26.550> release

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
we can get the knob on that will release

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.610 
we can get the knob on that will release
these<00:04:27.060> pins<00:04:27.390> so<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.110> knob<00:04:28.260> can<00:04:28.440> slide<00:04:28.680> back<00:04:28.890> on

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
these pins so the knob can slide back on

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.350 
these pins so the knob can slide back on
if<00:04:31.620> you<00:04:31.710> look<00:04:31.830> inside<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.220> timer<00:04:32.430> knob<00:04:33.060> you'll

if you look inside the timer knob you'll

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.590 
if you look inside the timer knob you'll
see<00:04:33.540> that<00:04:33.690> two<00:04:34.200> sides<00:04:34.470> are<00:04:34.710> flat<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.610> kind<00:04:36.419> of
