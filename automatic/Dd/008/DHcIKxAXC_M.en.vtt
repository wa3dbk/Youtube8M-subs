 No, I was have aligned the other lens 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:14.490
 Because not about Pinger this to edition focus lens I'm certain not look at this mechanism in Yappa 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:20.099
 After all, you'll be interested in ministers 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.270
 Because I make a fashionable video because there is no delay, it is enough in this area to take enough supporting photos 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:26.910

 I got it 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.149
 The box looks like this 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:22.520
 Also you can see that that I Hanari slim just by looking at the package 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.520

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.590

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.590

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.440
 Kyanna 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:44.030
 It is really tiny I this here 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.030
 even compared with the 50mm lens known as Kabirenzu of f 1.8 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.300
 It is like this 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.410
 thin 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.060
 Switch example is for parents and fathers Only auto focus and manual focus change switches 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.190
 Is attached 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.190
 Now I would like to see the lens name 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.210
 blue 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:11.100
 Than I thought-a small number of lenses 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.100
 Let's take a look at the National Assembly immediately with this lens 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.200
 Though there is a kinda face 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.480
 I think that background Meko is out very well 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.480
 Even if the hope goes down, the background is still cats 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.650
 Ne 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.510
 I think it's a good feeling , so I think it will be a part of Okube 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.819
 Yappa feeling single-focus lens is the eye such background receiving the Poro' 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:38.439
 I think the feeling is very good 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:42.819
 I think it is very good with a very bright raisin with a lens of 2.8 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:46.350
 Lens may have been about 2 years ago for free in the month 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:51.170
 relatively in stm lens 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.170
 I play a sounding sound 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.350
 Still after all compared to lens which does not have stm 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.220
 It's really quiet and 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:32.210
 The focus will also match one pit 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:34.110
 It was introduced very clean Futrell f 2.840 millimeter st Friends There bird 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.710
 So say 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.460
 Hmm 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.460
