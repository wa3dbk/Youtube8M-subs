 the delivery van 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.479
 nobody wants to make 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.409
 then drinking turns orange into a state he knows there

 moorish wish 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.430
 there he was at barcelona made ease the letter was the white beaches 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:37.419
 although at the moment he thinks there is a fairly limited building 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.230
 I think so 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.559
 Apple's steel patents are out of the question 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.969

 brian why it now decays further 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.599
 lilac and friendly and lyre and that margin further prove 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.129
 that changed hours 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.129
 floris van der garde change 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:27.370
 come 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.550
 no 16 the lost match 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.749
 but I think that Wednesday is a constant champion 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:33.939
 to world 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:37.089
 You can be proud of a defeat but I have to compete with 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:41.779
 or this number of players the worlds 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.779
 Then I have to say that the research done on what we should be honest with 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:48.659
 when goals were made then we had the route that we have to make 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.199
 have a huge chance of shrinking in the match 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.849
 and if you do then do the pope a mass in difficulty 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.740
 that is now also the courage in the shoes at certain moments we finally have 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.569
 worked hard to get results 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.080
 hear as well as possible 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.789
 He thinks the game top class football antec could be incredible 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.659
 we must have substantial effect, we must not complain, we have to accept it 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:09.659
 that does 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:10.990
 the level difference was 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.249
 yes a huge profit 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:17.869
 pro internet heikal the missed opportunities is that the fatigue is that tns of 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:20.789
 Schiphol I could not get lucky to walk 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.789
 I suspect it wasn't in his score until the first five minutes 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.249
 That can be a meeting of Richter 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:31.249
 incredibly good goalkeeper percent on goalkeepers 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.039
 then you also have to be two 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.060
 the great quality and the top players of the sum a special plan 

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:40.460
 b mistreat in some especially a button to players when they suddenly don't 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.180
 but I have to say that the horse might now be full on an SME 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.259
 However, you have to do a good job, you really have to put up with it 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:49.279
 high level 

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:52.419
 and we have that with just a few really good players let's that 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:56.469
 Be clear but we don't have the absolute top sport it is on 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:57.960
 the perpetrators have and they have 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.219
 3 4 of these players and took over to resolve 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:04.319
 recently to a packet fight until you are extradited 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.089
 the macarena taste 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:09.089
 when she was in matte black of suspensions young 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:12.590
 but that's no problem 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.590
 remain a problem so we address the 

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:19.639
 as long as malmö can still walk around on the desk trying to work hard 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.369
 and do everything to make the last match as good as possible 

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:25.490
 try one anyway 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.050
 avoided a new car and yet with something after rest 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.849
