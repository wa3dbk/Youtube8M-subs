today<00:00:07.270> I'm<00:00:07.570> going<00:00:07.840> to<00:00:07.900> talk<00:00:08.109> about<00:00:08.260> a<00:00:08.680> little

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
today I'm going to talk about a little

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.730 
today I'm going to talk about a little
troubleshooting<00:00:10.150> with<00:00:10.360> bread<00:00:10.660> dough<00:00:10.930> some

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
troubleshooting with bread dough some

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.770 
troubleshooting with bread dough some
people<00:00:11.980> have<00:00:12.100> a<00:00:12.130> really<00:00:12.340> hard<00:00:12.730> time<00:00:13.030> and<00:00:13.420> are

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
people have a really hard time and are

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.260 
people have a really hard time and are
afraid<00:00:14.139> to<00:00:14.260> make<00:00:14.470> bread<00:00:14.950> for<00:00:15.250> many<00:00:16.000> many

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
afraid to make bread for many many

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.740 
afraid to make bread for many many
reasons

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
reasons

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.929 
reasons
some<00:00:16.960> are<00:00:17.110> afraid<00:00:17.230> of<00:00:17.410> yeast<00:00:17.800> and<00:00:18.189> some<00:00:18.700> have<00:00:18.910> a

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
some are afraid of yeast and some have a

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.690 
some are afraid of yeast and some have a
problem<00:00:19.509> with<00:00:19.930> the<00:00:20.349> dough<00:00:20.680> actually<00:00:21.070> not

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
problem with the dough actually not

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.580 
problem with the dough actually not
coming<00:00:22.029> together<00:00:22.210> they<00:00:22.840> have<00:00:22.960> this<00:00:23.110> shaggy

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
coming together they have this shaggy

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.979 
coming together they have this shaggy
kind<00:00:23.980> of<00:00:24.099> dough<00:00:24.279> in<00:00:24.520> the<00:00:24.669> mixing<00:00:25.029> bowl<00:00:25.060> so

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
kind of dough in the mixing bowl so

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.290 
kind of dough in the mixing bowl so
let's<00:00:26.230> just<00:00:26.500> talk<00:00:26.710> about<00:00:26.770> the<00:00:27.520> ingredients

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
let's just talk about the ingredients

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.229 
let's just talk about the ingredients
for<00:00:28.450> making<00:00:28.630> bread<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:30.250> started<00:00:30.669> with<00:00:30.790> a<00:00:30.820> flour

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
for making bread we started with a flour

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.900 
for making bread we started with a flour
and<00:00:31.660> you'll<00:00:32.050> add<00:00:32.230> some<00:00:32.590> liquid<00:00:32.800> usually<00:00:33.730> has

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
and you'll add some liquid usually has

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.060 
and you'll add some liquid usually has
yeast<00:00:34.180> and<00:00:34.420> water<00:00:34.540> that<00:00:35.020> kind<00:00:35.260> of<00:00:35.320> thing

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
yeast and water that kind of thing

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.869 
yeast and water that kind of thing
so<00:00:36.520> when<00:00:36.700> flour<00:00:37.030> and<00:00:37.420> water<00:00:37.690> mixed<00:00:38.170> together

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
so when flour and water mixed together

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.319 
so when flour and water mixed together
gluten<00:00:39.879> is<00:00:40.059> formed<00:00:40.890> which<00:00:41.890> allows<00:00:42.370> you<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:43.059> get

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
gluten is formed which allows you to get

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.479 
gluten is formed which allows you to get
the<00:00:43.480> elasticity<00:00:44.050> and<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.679> structure<00:00:45.190> for<00:00:45.370> the

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
the elasticity and the structure for the

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.729 
the elasticity and the structure for the
bread<00:00:45.699> dough<00:00:45.940> itself<00:00:46.480> so<00:00:47.440> it's<00:00:47.620> really

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
bread dough itself so it's really

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.380 
bread dough itself so it's really
important<00:00:48.280> that<00:00:48.429> those<00:00:48.609> things<00:00:48.969> mix<00:00:49.239> together

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
important that those things mix together

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.139 
important that those things mix together
well<00:00:49.809> and<00:00:50.109> you<00:00:50.559> create<00:00:50.949> these<00:00:51.640> protein

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
well and you create these protein

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.139 
well and you create these protein
molecules<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:53.260> will<00:00:53.649> be<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:54.699> gluten<00:00:55.030> that

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
molecules that will be the gluten that

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.419 
molecules that will be the gluten that
we<00:00:55.329> need<00:00:55.539> for<00:00:55.839> the<00:00:55.960> structure<00:00:56.410> so<00:00:57.129> when<00:00:57.280> you

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
we need for the structure so when you

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.340 
we need for the structure so when you
mix<00:00:57.579> flour<00:00:57.850> with<00:00:58.269> water<00:00:58.570> you'll<00:00:58.989> get<00:00:59.199> the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
mix flour with water you'll get the

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.259 
mix flour with water you'll get the
dough<00:00:59.530> there<00:01:00.489> are<00:01:00.579> different<00:01:00.940> kinds<00:01:01.210> of

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
dough there are different kinds of

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.869 
dough there are different kinds of
flours<00:01:01.719> there's<00:01:02.649> an<00:01:02.829> oil<00:01:02.920> purpose<00:01:03.399> flour<00:01:03.609> that

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
flours there's an oil purpose flour that

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.149 
flours there's an oil purpose flour that
we<00:01:04.030> use<00:01:04.210> all<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.809> time<00:01:04.989> and<00:01:05.260> then<00:01:05.950> there's

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
we use all the time and then there's

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.250 
we use all the time and then there's
bread<00:01:06.430> flours<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.210> then<00:01:07.780> there<00:01:07.960> are<00:01:08.050> cake

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
bread flours and then there are cake

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.410 
bread flours and then there are cake
flours<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:08.890> all<00:01:09.430> of<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.730> flowers<00:01:10.180> have

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
flours and all of the flowers have

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.660 
flours and all of the flowers have
different<00:01:10.810> amounts<00:01:11.140> of<00:01:11.290> protein<00:01:11.829> in<00:01:12.040> them<00:01:12.250> and

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
different amounts of protein in them and

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.480 
different amounts of protein in them and
that's<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.420> key<00:01:13.630> it's<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.770> protein<00:01:15.250> and

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
that's the key it's the protein and

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.880 
that's the key it's the protein and
different<00:01:16.360> amounts<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.079> protein<00:01:17.530> different

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
different amounts of protein different

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.480 
different amounts of protein different
flours<00:01:18.280> absorb<00:01:19.180> water<00:01:20.049> in<00:01:20.470> different<00:01:20.920> mill<00:01:21.310> in

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
flours absorb water in different mill in

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.910 
flours absorb water in different mill in
different<00:01:21.880> ways<00:01:22.000> so<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.840> high-protein<00:01:23.530> flour

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
different ways so a high-protein flour

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.730 
different ways so a high-protein flour
like<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.310> bread<00:01:24.579> flour<00:01:24.880> needs<00:01:25.360> more<00:01:25.719> water<00:01:26.020> to

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
like a bread flour needs more water to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.340 
like a bread flour needs more water to
come<00:01:26.950> together<00:01:27.100> as<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.520> dough<00:01:27.790> a<00:01:28.060> cake<00:01:28.840> flour<00:01:29.170> a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
come together as a dough a cake flour a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.429 
come together as a dough a cake flour a
softer<00:01:30.009> flour<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.549> lower<00:01:30.850> protein<00:01:31.270> flour<00:01:31.780> needs

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
softer flour a lower protein flour needs

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.399 
softer flour a lower protein flour needs
less<00:01:32.740> water<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.369> come<00:01:33.850> together<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.200> when

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
less water to come together so when

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.929 
less water to come together so when
you're<00:01:35.439> making<00:01:35.710> your<00:01:35.950> bread<00:01:36.250> dough<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.759> need

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
you're making your bread dough you need

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.149 
you're making your bread dough you need
to<00:01:37.060> pay<00:01:37.210> attention<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:38.079> what<00:01:38.560> kind<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.890> flour

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
to pay attention to what kind of flour

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.039 
to pay attention to what kind of flour
you're<00:01:39.490> using<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.360> amount<00:01:40.390> of<00:01:40.840> water

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
you're using and the amount of water

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.959 
you're using and the amount of water
you're<00:01:41.320> adding<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:42.219> if<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.460> have<00:01:42.610> a<00:01:42.640> problem

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
you're adding so if you have a problem

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.190 
you're adding so if you have a problem
where<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.360> dough<00:01:43.509> is<00:01:43.570> not<00:01:43.780> coming<00:01:44.079> together

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
where the dough is not coming together

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.080 
where the dough is not coming together
and<00:01:44.770> it's<00:01:44.890> sort<00:01:45.100> of<00:01:45.159> just<00:01:45.219> in<00:01:45.520> pieces<00:01:45.939> around

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
and it's sort of just in pieces around

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.620 
and it's sort of just in pieces around
you<00:01:46.750> might<00:01:47.020> either<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.979> some<00:01:48.610> more<00:01:48.789> water<00:01:48.850> or

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
you might either and some more water or

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.349 
you might either and some more water or
use<00:01:50.109> a<00:01:50.140> lower<00:01:50.530> protein<00:01:50.890> flour<00:01:51.549> if<00:01:51.939> you're

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
use a lower protein flour if you're

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.599 
use a lower protein flour if you're
using<00:01:52.509> that<00:01:52.780> same<00:01:52.960> recipe<00:01:53.439> and<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:53.710> should

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
using that same recipe and that should

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.340 
using that same recipe and that should
give<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:54.939> a<00:01:55.119> better<00:01:55.479> dough<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:56.049> will<00:01:56.170> come

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
give you a better dough that will come

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.340 
give you a better dough that will come
together<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.799> be<00:01:57.070> able<00:01:57.189> to<00:01:57.340> be<00:01:57.579> needed<00:01:58.350> so

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
together and be able to be needed so
