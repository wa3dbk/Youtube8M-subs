00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.700
 Hi, I'm going to show you my new 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.339
 Musical acquisition is a material 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.200
 alexis of m6 has very good 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:12.559
 features a good sound map 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.709
 internal usb connection with what is 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.560
 can assign sounds from the 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.160
 computer 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.960
 compose using any sequencer 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.820
 battery has good sensitivity with 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.820
 different intensity of blows 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.300
 the sensations are quite realistic 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.540
 is what I wanted because I used to 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.090
 the steps the specific buttons of the 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.090
 keyboard with fingers I'm going to teach 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.230
 you can make rhythms with your fingers 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.210
 perfectly but I wanted to be able 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.970
 express myself a more versatile tool 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.100
 with more professional and good although it is not 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.380
 the same as playing a real battery the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.780
 experience is quite satisfactory 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.570
 with the advantage that we will not be at 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.220
 neighbors if we put on helmets and 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.140
 that we can work perfectly with 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.420
 the computer at the time of contouring 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.320
 shows you the elements of texas the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.320
 pompo with its pedal 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.900
 Charles with his pear tree also to open 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.900
 and close the saucer 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.140
 the box with two sounds inside and 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.140
 Exterior 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.070
 behind 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.410
 middle and low acute stones 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.520
 today 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.170
 how the sounds are assignable from the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.010
 computer we can make the raid by 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.470
 example sound a cowbell a bell or 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.240
 what we want 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.990
 the brain of the machine is this 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.060
 little thing here 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.270
 with this driving in the different 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.240
 internal sound kits have samples 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.880
 of songs to practice 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.520
 we have to follow the rhythm as 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.430
 every stroke is shown what corresponds 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.040
 to this food the east is lit 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.980
 leds you can follow the rhythms 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.810
 and learn 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.340
 we can connect an ipod or any 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.470
 another sound source to practice with 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.780
 the songs that we have 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.680
 Well, that's all, I say goodbye 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.680
 touching something
