 conditions were written why one 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.680

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.510
 I love the classics 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.780

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.049
 back u just when i started to lead 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.400
 channel when I started writing all sorts of guides 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:09.760
 based on knowledge from 16 on all silver 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:13.320
