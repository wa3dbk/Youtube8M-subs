00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.200
 step 1 establish a plan of the zones of 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.120
 freedom you want allowed to your 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.090
 dog or areas you want 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.280
 protect 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.770
 step 2 installed the transmitter at the shelter 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.800
 in a dry place near a 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.619
 plug 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.390
 step 3 from the transmitter unroll 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.550
 the antenna wire that will delimit 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:38.179
 the environment of your dog as well as 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.829
 the areas you want to protect to 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.690
 some authorized waypoints 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.780
 you will need to twist the antenna wire 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.969
 round trip to cancel the signal 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.010
 step 4 connect the antenna wires to 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.909
 transmitter and then connect the transmitter to 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.120
 sector if the light is on 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.559
 system is ready to operate if 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.809
 the transmitter and but several bits 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.699
 consecutive and that the LEDs flashes 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.180
 there is an anomaly in your branch 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.000
 man or a cutoff of the antenna wire when 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.340
 of his installation 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.380
 step 5 check the operation of 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.420
 Installation 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.310
 first insert the battery into his 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.899
 compartment while respecting its 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:24.109
 polarity then replaced the battery door 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.039
 using the token the necklace and puts 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.770
 then a beep 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:32.390
 it is useless at this stage to complete the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.250
 device check the limits of the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.009
 zone of freedom of your dog in 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.659
 approaching the collar duffy the antenna the 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.240
 collar beeps 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.429
 the system is functional using the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.350
 transmitter's potentiometer you can 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.399
 increase or decrease the distance 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.399
 triggering the receiver 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.119
 materialize the boundaries of the area in 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.240
 placing the pennants at the place where the 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.619
 sound signal is heard 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.049
 respect an interval of three meters 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:07.270
 minimum between the pennants they will give 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:10.209
 a visual cue to your dog you 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:16.709
 can buried the wire up to 7 cm 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:20.050
 depth in the soil and apsys 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.730
 filling the receiver collar for 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.500
 fill the tank of the collar this loan 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.590
 we must introduce the tip of the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.380
 refill in the filling valve 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.920
 press firmly for 10 seconds 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.049
 release the pressure 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.130
 then repeat the operation one 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:38.049
 second time the necklace is filled you 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.799
 can check the level through the 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.799
 translucent background 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.670
 you can put the necklace around the neck of 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.439
 dog the nozzle resignation of the spray 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.439
 upwards towards his muzzle
