00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.090
 I will continue to run today 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.290
 Everyone is a runner 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.620
 I can't stop my watch 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:21.630
 Time only flows for a while 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.630
 It is a marathon course that can not go back 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.240
 While competing with rivals 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.590
 One ginkgo called the flow of time 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.590
 We keep on going 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.680
 Faster 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.510
 Even one step ago 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:43.370
 Believe that there is a future ahead 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.370
 Not sure goal World New 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.860
 Application is 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.250
 I'm hungry 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.300
 Ha 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.840
 But is it really so 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.890
 Water-based penetration like that 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.700
 Wrong 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.770
 Life is not a marathon 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.890
 That's the course I decided 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.970
 It's the goal I decided 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.380
 I want to run me 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.430
 Where did you go 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.890
 There is a way for only minutes 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.360
 There is also a way for myself 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.130
 I do not know 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.850
 The world we have not met is tremendously wide 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.380
 That's right I'm resting on the sea 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.050
 I was troubled and I was troubled 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.580
 I run through to the end 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.480
 May fail 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.030
 May I detours 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.950
 I have not compared with someone 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.050
 There is no one way 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.390
 We are not one 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.390
 That 's the number of humans 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.670
 All applications are great 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.670
 Even though the Who's long-established me Mara Son 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.780
 rude points start just not here encounter Recruit
