00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.579 

hey<00:00:00.900> guys<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.890> is<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:03.080> spent<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.110> past<00:00:04.319> few

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
hey guys this is I spent the past few

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.980 
hey guys this is I spent the past few
days<00:00:04.799> creating<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.430> plug-in<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:06.120> would<00:00:06.720> allow

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
days creating a plug-in that would allow

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.129 
days creating a plug-in that would allow
me<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.760> simulate<00:00:08.760> what<00:00:09.300> an<00:00:09.389> action<00:00:09.780> battle

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
me to simulate what an action battle

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.370 
me to simulate what an action battle
would<00:00:10.230> look<00:00:10.440> like<00:00:10.679> if<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.309> were<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.519> try<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:12.380> I

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
would look like if I were to try it I

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.580 
would look like if I were to try it I
just<00:00:13.860> now<00:00:14.040> finally<00:00:14.340> got<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.670> working<00:00:15.410> so<00:00:16.410> just

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
just now finally got it working so just

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.560 
just now finally got it working so just
to<00:00:16.710> illustrate<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.220> we're<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.359> just

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
to illustrate that we're going to just

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.550 
to illustrate that we're going to just
create<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:20.510> simulation<00:00:21.510> really<00:00:22.140> quickly<00:00:24.560> see

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
create a simulation really quickly see

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.970 
create a simulation really quickly see
what<00:00:25.710> would<00:00:25.800> happen<00:00:30.560> and<00:00:31.560> instead<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.920> putting

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
what would happen and instead of putting

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.319 
what would happen and instead of putting
the<00:00:32.250> attack<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:32.730> I'm<00:00:32.880> going<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> hit<00:00:33.149> this

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the attack but I'm going to hit this

00:00:33.329 --> 00:01:11.070 
the attack but I'm going to hit this
button<00:00:33.540> simulate

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.720 

okay<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:12.250> effect<00:01:12.610> is<00:01:12.730> over<00:01:13.030> looks<00:01:13.270> like<00:01:13.450> I<00:01:13.570> won

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
okay the effect is over looks like I won

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.400 
okay the effect is over looks like I won
but<00:01:15.730> it<00:01:15.940> hasn't<00:01:16.330> actually<00:01:16.450> happened<00:01:16.750> yet<00:01:17.200> as

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
but it hasn't actually happened yet as

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.800 
but it hasn't actually happened yet as
you<00:01:17.590> can<00:01:17.710> see<00:01:17.890> there<00:01:18.100> were<00:01:18.190> no<00:01:18.600> command<00:01:19.600> points

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
you can see there were no command points

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.320 
you can see there were no command points
that<00:01:20.320> were<00:01:20.410> actually<00:01:21.240> removed<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:24.180> I'm<00:01:25.180> going

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
that were actually removed so I'm going

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.200 
that were actually removed so I'm going
to<00:01:25.360> go<00:01:25.510> ahead<00:01:25.540> and<00:01:25.750> hit<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:27.990> attack<00:01:28.990> just<00:01:29.530> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
to go ahead and hit the attack just to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.940 
to go ahead and hit the attack just to
do<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:31.240> for<00:01:31.510> real<00:01:31.540> now<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:35.320> should<00:01:35.560> be<00:01:35.710> the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
do it for real now it should be the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.800 
do it for real now it should be the
exact<00:01:36.220> same<00:01:36.340> as<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.670> simulator<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:40.180> I<00:01:40.210> still

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
exact same as a simulator so I still

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.800 
exact same as a simulator so I still
will<00:01:40.960> lose<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.170> few<00:01:41.500> planes<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:42.250> some<00:01:42.400> cars<00:01:42.810> but

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
will lose a few planes and some cars but

00:01:43.810 --> 00:02:05.390 
will lose a few planes and some cars but
in<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.530> end<00:01:44.560> i'll<00:01:44.830> still<00:01:45.070> win

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.980 

alright

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.240 

now<00:02:09.620> as<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:09.950> can<00:02:10.070> see<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:11.630> worked<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.320> that's

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
now as you can see it worked and that's

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.280 
now as you can see it worked and that's
the<00:02:13.490> end<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:13.850> don't<00:02:14.690> think<00:02:14.750> I'm<00:02:14.990> going<00:02:15.170> to

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
the end I don't think I'm going to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.610 
the end I don't think I'm going to
release<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:15.860> plugin<00:02:16.190> simply<00:02:16.700> because<00:02:17.620> it

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
release this plugin simply because it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.100 
release this plugin simply because it
would<00:02:18.860> seriously<00:02:19.280> impact<00:02:19.780> everyone<00:02:20.780> on<00:02:21.020> the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
would seriously impact everyone on the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.210 
would seriously impact everyone on the
server<00:02:21.320> in<00:02:22.160> probably<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.820> negative<00:02:22.970> way<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:25.010> for

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
server in probably a negative way so for

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.350 
server in probably a negative way so for
now<00:02:25.310> I'm<00:02:25.520> just<00:02:25.580> going<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.850> keep<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.120> for<00:02:26.240> myself

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
now I'm just going to keep it for myself

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.920 
now I'm just going to keep it for myself
play<00:02:27.260> around<00:02:27.440> with<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.740> see<00:02:28.340> what<00:02:28.460> happens

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
play around with it see what happens

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.410 
play around with it see what happens
thanks<00:02:29.930> for<00:02:30.050> watching
