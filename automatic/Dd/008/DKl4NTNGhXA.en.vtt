and it will die one shot to the head and
would<00:01:54.260> die<00:01:54.470> it's<00:01:55.040> got<00:01:55.190> perfect<00:01:55.610> stability<00:01:56.000> so

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
would die it's got perfect stability so

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.240 
would die it's got perfect stability so
it<00:01:56.270> doesn't<00:01:56.570> matter<00:01:56.690> whatsoever<00:01:57.350> it's<00:01:58.100> an

playstyle with the phone is to sit back
mid<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.700> long<00:02:50.909> range<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.500> basically<00:02:52.500> pick<00:02:53.159> off

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
mid to long range and basically pick off

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.520 
mid to long range and basically pick off
enemies<00:02:53.549> but<00:02:53.879> it<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.209> be<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.390> beast<00:02:54.629> up<00:02:54.900> close<00:02:55.170> I

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
enemies but it can be a beast up close I

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.349 
enemies but it can be a beast up close I
just<00:02:55.920> feel<00:02:56.069> you're<00:02:56.280> like<00:02:56.370> more<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.819> risk<00:02:57.060> at

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
just feel you're like more of a risk at

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.569 
just feel you're like more of a risk at
close<00:02:57.660> range<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.290> stand<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.980> bigger<00:02:59.280> advantage

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
close range and stand a bigger advantage

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.339 
close range and stand a bigger advantage
further<00:03:00.150> back<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.720> that's<00:03:01.079> just<00:03:01.109> my<00:03:01.319> opinion

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
further back and that's just my opinion

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.890 
further back and that's just my opinion
so<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.280> are<00:03:02.519> go<00:03:02.730> with<00:03:02.879> more<00:03:03.060> armor<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.660> more

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
so you are go with more armor and more

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.890 
so you are go with more armor and more
