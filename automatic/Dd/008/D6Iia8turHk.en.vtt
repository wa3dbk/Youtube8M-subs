again today we're going to show you how
to<00:00:03.750> take<00:00:03.959> this<00:00:04.140> egg<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.710> get<00:00:04.799> it<00:00:04.920> inside<00:00:05.190> this

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
to take this egg and get it inside this

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.400 
to take this egg and get it inside this
milk<00:00:05.700> bottle<00:00:05.759> why<00:00:06.720> would<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.020> want<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.259> do

seal<00:00:30.390> around<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> opening<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.380> watch<00:00:31.980> what

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
seal around the opening and watch what

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.830 
seal around the opening and watch what
happens

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.510 

you

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.400 

hmm<00:00:47.030> didn't<00:00:47.600> quite<00:00:47.780> make<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:48.080> in<00:00:48.170> all<00:00:48.290> the<00:00:48.380> way

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
hmm didn't quite make it in all the way

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.340 
hmm didn't quite make it in all the way
let's<00:00:49.040> try<00:00:49.160> this<00:00:49.220> again<00:00:49.870> this<00:00:50.870> time<00:00:51.080> let's

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
let's try this again this time let's

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.660 
let's try this again this time let's
light<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.560> piece<00:00:51.800> of<00:00:51.980> paper<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:52.400> we<00:00:52.520> have<00:00:52.640> a

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
light a piece of paper so we have a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:01.350 
light a piece of paper so we have a
little<00:00:52.850> more<00:00:53.000> fire<00:00:53.240> in<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.540> bottle

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.270 

well<00:01:02.360> that<00:01:02.750> happened<00:01:03.080> fast<00:01:03.260> but<00:01:03.980> what's<00:01:04.129> going

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
well that happened fast but what's going

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.710 
well that happened fast but what's going
on<00:01:04.400> here<00:01:04.699> why<00:01:05.000> does<00:01:05.059> this<00:01:05.210> happen

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
on here why does this happen

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.830 
on here why does this happen
two<00:01:06.170> words<00:01:06.410> expansion<00:01:07.370> and<00:01:07.610> contraction<00:01:07.840> when

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
two words expansion and contraction when

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.510 
two words expansion and contraction when
things<00:01:09.020> heat<00:01:09.200> up<00:01:09.260> they<00:01:09.560> expand<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.220> enter

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
things heat up they expand and enter

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.460 
things heat up they expand and enter
molecules<00:01:10.970> are<00:01:11.120> no<00:01:11.240> exception<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.200> heated

molecules are no exception the heated

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.230 
molecules are no exception the heated
air<00:01:12.590> from<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.890> flame<00:01:13.130> expands<00:01:13.790> inside<00:01:13.940> the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
air from the flame expands inside the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.240 
air from the flame expands inside the
bottle<00:01:14.600> when<00:01:15.050> all<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.230> oxygen<00:01:15.710> is<00:01:15.830> used<00:01:15.860> up

bottle when all the oxygen is used up

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.740 
bottle when all the oxygen is used up
due<00:01:16.430> to<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.580> egg<00:01:16.760> covering<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.390> bottle

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
due to the egg covering the bottle

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.050 
due to the egg covering the bottle
opening<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.620> fire<00:01:18.890> dies<00:01:19.160> in<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.490> air<00:01:19.670> inside

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
opening the fire dies in the air inside

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.760 
opening the fire dies in the air inside
the<00:01:20.120> bottle<00:01:20.360> cools<00:01:20.810> again<00:01:21.170> causing<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.680> to

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
the bottle cools again causing it to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.860 
the bottle cools again causing it to
contract<00:01:21.910> now<00:01:22.910> that<00:01:23.090> there's<00:01:23.300> an<00:01:23.420> egg<00:01:23.630> in<00:01:23.810> the

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
contract now that there's an egg in the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.840 
contract now that there's an egg in the
way<00:01:23.990> of<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.260> opening<00:01:24.650> though<00:01:24.800> air<00:01:25.100> can't<00:01:25.610> get

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
way of the opening though air can't get

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.730 
way of the opening though air can't get
into<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.240> bottle<00:01:26.510> and<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.840> vacuum<00:01:27.050> is<00:01:27.320> created

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
into the bottle and a vacuum is created

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.710 
into the bottle and a vacuum is created
that<00:01:28.130> vacuum<00:01:28.640> is<00:01:28.760> what<00:01:28.910> sucks<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.330> egg<00:01:29.479> into

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
that vacuum is what sucks the egg into

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.830 
that vacuum is what sucks the egg into
the<00:01:29.810> bottle<00:01:30.760> so<00:01:31.760> on<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.940> first<00:01:32.150> attempt<00:01:32.600> since

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
the bottle so on the first attempt since

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.390 
the bottle so on the first attempt since
there<00:01:32.990> was<00:01:33.110> less<00:01:33.290> flame<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.920> air<00:01:34.100> didn't

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
there was less flame the air didn't

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.160 
there was less flame the air didn't
expand<00:01:34.729> as<00:01:34.850> much<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.420> vacuum<00:01:35.780> wasn't<00:01:36.080> as

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
expand as much and the vacuum wasn't as

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.719 
expand as much and the vacuum wasn't as
strong<00:01:36.380> which<00:01:36.830> is<00:01:36.860> why<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.130> egg<00:01:37.369> didn't<00:01:37.640> get

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
strong which is why the egg didn't get

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.289 
strong which is why the egg didn't get
pulled<00:01:37.940> all<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.240> way<00:01:38.330> in

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
pulled all the way in

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.389 
pulled all the way in
here's<00:01:41.049> a<00:01:41.109> more<00:01:41.289> visible<00:01:41.469> example<00:01:42.159> of<00:01:42.280> this

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
here's a more visible example of this

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:51.010 
here's a more visible example of this
effect<00:01:42.579> using<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.149> balloon

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.270 

notice<00:01:52.020> how<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.200> balloon<00:01:52.500> inflates<00:01:52.890> inwards

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
notice how the balloon inflates inwards

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.950 
notice how the balloon inflates inwards
as<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> air<00:01:53.760> inside<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.120> bottle<00:01:54.360> continues

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
as the air inside the bottle continues

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.990 
as the air inside the bottle continues
to<00:01:55.080> contract<00:01:55.310> pretty<00:01:56.310> cool<00:01:56.520> huh

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
to contract pretty cool huh

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.060 
to contract pretty cool huh
yet<00:01:57.630> another<00:01:57.870> neat<00:01:58.170> one<00:01:58.440> of<00:01:58.590> life's<00:01:58.890> little

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
yet another neat one of life's little
