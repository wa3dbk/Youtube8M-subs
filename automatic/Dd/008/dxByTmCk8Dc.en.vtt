drafts<00:02:37.630> inside<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.380> them<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.620> they<00:02:38.980> have<00:02:39.220> two

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
drafts inside of them and they have two

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.200

it<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.990> actually<00:02:44.230> if<00:02:44.890> we<00:02:44.950> were<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.610> step

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
it so it actually if we were to step

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.270 
it so it actually if we were to step
inside<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.660> would<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:47.080> about<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.320> 10<00:02:47.650> degree<00:02:47.800> or
