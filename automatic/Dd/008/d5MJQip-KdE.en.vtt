00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.749 

this<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.920> part<00:00:02.280> two<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:03.290> surface<00:00:04.290> repair<00:00:04.759> as

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
this is part two of surface repair as

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.610 
this is part two of surface repair as
you<00:00:05.970> can<00:00:06.120> tell<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.839> same<00:00:07.109> part<00:00:07.440> that

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
you can tell this is the same part that

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.360 
you can tell this is the same part that
we<00:00:07.710> worked<00:00:07.919> on<00:00:08.069> before<00:00:08.250> on<00:00:08.760> part<00:00:09.480> one<00:00:09.690> and

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
we worked on before on part one and

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.650 
we worked on before on part one and
today<00:00:11.370> we're<00:00:11.550> going<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.849> work<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.420> these

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
today we're going to work on these

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.220 
today we're going to work on these
corners<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.969> fixing<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.150> fill<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.570> edge<00:00:15.780> and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
corners on fixing this fill it edge and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.859 
corners on fixing this fill it edge and
the<00:00:17.100> bottom<00:00:17.400> surface<00:00:17.609> as<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.359> can<00:00:18.449> tell<00:00:18.510> it's

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the bottom surface as you can tell it's

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.010 
the bottom surface as you can tell it's
doing<00:00:19.770> something<00:00:20.240> very<00:00:21.240> strange<00:00:21.539> at<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
doing something very strange at the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.220 
doing something very strange at the
bottom<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:24.119> will<00:00:24.269> go<00:00:24.330> back<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.840> our<00:00:24.869> start

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
bottom so we will go back to our start

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.370 
bottom so we will go back to our start
point<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.849> do<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> delete<00:00:27.269> surface<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.289> we

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
point and do a delete surface and we

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.780 
point and do a delete surface and we
will<00:00:28.529> get<00:00:28.619> rid<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.060> bad<00:00:30.300> surfaces<00:00:31.790> from

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
will get rid of on the bad surfaces from

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.330 
will get rid of on the bad surfaces from
here<00:00:33.149> we'll<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.780> an<00:00:33.899> offset<00:00:34.320> 0<00:00:34.910> point<00:00:35.910> 188<00:00:37.340> as

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
here we'll do an offset 0 point 188 as

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:47.450 
here we'll do an offset 0 point 188 as
well<00:00:38.879> as<00:00:39.739> extending<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> edges

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.010 

and<00:00:48.460> we'll<00:00:48.610> do<00:00:48.760> this<00:00:48.880> for<00:00:49.149> all<00:00:49.180> three<00:00:49.690> surfaces

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
and we'll do this for all three surfaces

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.080 
and we'll do this for all three surfaces
you<00:00:50.230> have<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.440> do<00:00:50.530> it<00:00:50.649> independently<00:00:51.090> because

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
you have to do it independently because

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:03.010 
you have to do it independently because
there<00:00:52.450> are<00:00:52.629> different<00:00:53.110> bodies

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.150 

that<00:01:03.650> back<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:03.890> little<00:01:04.100> bit<00:01:05.380> and<00:01:06.380> offset<00:01:06.920> this

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
that back a little bit and offset this

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:24.380 
that back a little bit and offset this
face

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.230 

it's<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.020> little<00:01:25.490> low<00:01:26.490> right<00:01:28.670> now<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
it's a little low right now we can do a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.210 
it's a little low right now we can do a
trim<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:32.190> mutual<00:01:32.580> trim<00:01:32.909> between<00:01:33.510> these<00:01:33.750> three

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
trim the mutual trim between these three

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.620 
trim the mutual trim between these three
this<00:01:35.220> time<00:01:35.430> we'll<00:01:35.580> use<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> keep<00:01:36.090> sections

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this time we'll use the keep sections

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.930 
this time we'll use the keep sections
and<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.710> keep<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.220> three<00:01:38.430> section<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:38.850> you

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
and just keep the three section if you

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.440 
and just keep the three section if you
want<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.990> let<00:01:40.140> me<00:01:40.229> get<00:01:40.350> rid<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> rest

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
want and let me get rid of the rest

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.969 
want and let me get rid of the rest
that's<00:01:42.450> faster<00:01:44.390> from<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.780> what<00:01:46.650> we<00:01:46.770> need<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
that's faster from here what we need to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.249 
that's faster from here what we need to
do<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.369> need<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.580> create<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.150> sweep<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.170> we

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
do is we need to create a sweep so we

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.920 
do is we need to create a sweep so we
will<00:01:49.320> know<00:01:49.530> how<00:01:50.400> this<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:51.060> defined<00:01:51.540> around

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
will know how this is defined around

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.050 
will know how this is defined around
this<00:01:52.080> edge<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.280> I'll<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.640> we'll<00:01:53.850> just

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
this edge so I'll do that we'll just

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.639 
this edge so I'll do that we'll just
start<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.570> new<00:01:54.720> sketch<00:01:55.280> our<00:01:56.280> new<00:01:56.729> 3d<00:01:57.090> sketch

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
start a new sketch our new 3d sketch

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.389 
start a new sketch our new 3d sketch
convert<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.830> entity<00:01:59.690> click<00:02:00.690> OK<00:02:01.190> same<00:02:02.190> thing

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
convert this entity click OK same thing

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.690 
convert this entity click OK same thing
for<00:02:02.550> this<00:02:02.729> edge<00:02:03.560> create<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> new<00:02:04.979> 3d<00:02:05.430> sketch

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
for this edge create a new 3d sketch

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.330 
for this edge create a new 3d sketch
convert<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.539> but<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:07.320> time<00:02:07.500> we'll<00:02:07.680> extend<00:02:07.890> XP

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
convert it but this time we'll extend XP

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.850 
convert it but this time we'll extend XP
went<00:02:08.519> to<00:02:08.640> go<00:02:08.729> past<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.899> area<00:02:10.760> click<00:02:11.760> OK<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.860> a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
went to go past this area click OK to a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.550 
went to go past this area click OK to a
surface<00:02:14.220> sweep<00:02:16.700> just<00:02:17.700> like<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:19.350> now<00:02:19.500> we

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
surface sweep just like so so now we

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.620 
surface sweep just like so so now we
know<00:02:19.709> how<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:20.370> intersects<00:02:20.940> with<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.209> bottom

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
know how this intersects with the bottom

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.190 
know how this intersects with the bottom
and<00:02:22.260> how<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.709> comes<00:02:22.920> through<00:02:23.190> at<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.519> point

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
and how it comes through at this point

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.150 
and how it comes through at this point
however<00:02:25.200> we're<00:02:25.350> going<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.620> bring<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
however we're going to bring it to the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.710 
however we're going to bring it to the
point<00:02:26.480> right<00:02:27.480> here<00:02:28.579> so<00:02:29.579> from<00:02:29.910> here<00:02:30.209> what<00:02:30.570> we

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
point right here so from here what we

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.069 
point right here so from here what we
need<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.930> do<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.920> we<00:02:32.070> can<00:02:32.280> some<00:02:32.430> split<00:02:32.730> lines<00:02:33.079> to

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
need to do is we can some split lines to

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.150 
need to do is we can some split lines to
use<00:02:34.320> as<00:02:34.590> reference<00:02:34.980> points<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.720> before<00:02:37.709> we<00:02:37.920> can

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
use as reference points so before we can

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.860 
use as reference points so before we can
go<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.579> we<00:02:39.060> need<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.709> create<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:41.130> section

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
go to that we need to create a section

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.440 
go to that we need to create a section
since<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.110> sits<00:02:43.850> since<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.000> right<00:02:45.180> plane

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
since this sits since the right plane

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.170 
since this sits since the right plane
sets<00:02:45.750> here<00:02:46.140> all<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.010> can<00:02:47.160> do<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.310> we<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:47.730> simply

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
sets here all we can do is we can simply

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.380 
sets here all we can do is we can simply
to<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> plane<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:50.070> we<00:02:50.310> will

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.610 

show<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.599> sketch<00:02:55.129> go<00:02:56.129> to<00:02:56.189> this<00:02:56.400> point<00:02:58.159> okay

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
show the sketch go to this point okay

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.280 
show the sketch go to this point okay
from<00:03:01.620> here<00:03:01.920> we<00:03:02.129> can<00:03:02.159> do<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> sketch<00:03:03.290> section

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
from here we can do a sketch section

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.789 
from here we can do a sketch section
view<00:03:05.060> okay<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.209> we<00:03:06.299> can<00:03:06.450> simply<00:03:06.750> hide<00:03:06.989> these

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
view okay and we can simply hide these

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.840 
view okay and we can simply hide these
two<00:03:08.069> items

from<00:03:14.480> his<00:03:14.810> point<00:03:15.560> we<00:03:15.830> can<00:03:16.010> pick<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.640> right

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
from his point we can pick on the right

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:24.190 
from his point we can pick on the right

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
ok same for this one that face now we

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.700 
ok same for this one that face now we
have<00:04:50.330> our<00:04:50.360> border<00:04:50.960> for<00:04:51.350> our<00:04:52.479> build<00:04:53.479> surface<00:04:53.960> so

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
have our border for our build surface so

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.529 
have our border for our build surface so
we<00:04:54.770> can<00:04:54.979> pick<00:04:55.250> that<00:04:57.220> and<00:04:58.220> those<00:04:58.760> two<00:04:59.060> so<00:04:59.300> now<00:04:59.330> we

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
we can pick that and those two so now we

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.250 
we can pick that and those two so now we
have<00:04:59.660> our<00:04:59.810> boundary<00:05:00.289> filled<00:05:01.780> you<00:05:02.780> simply<00:05:03.080> come

in here with the delete surface and
delete<00:05:05.870> these<00:05:07.690> and<00:05:08.690> now<00:05:08.900> we<00:05:08.960> have<00:05:09.200> our<00:05:09.229> fill<00:05:09.590> it

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
delete these and now we have our fill it

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.810 
delete these and now we have our fill it
to<00:05:11.150> finish<00:05:11.360> up<00:05:11.630> this<00:05:11.810> model<00:05:12.200> we<00:05:13.190> need<00:05:13.370> to<00:05:13.580> fill

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
to finish up this model we need to fill

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.570 
to finish up this model we need to fill
in<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.120> back<00:05:14.330> surface<00:05:14.570> here<00:05:15.280> now<00:05:16.280> I<00:05:16.310> can

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
in the back surface here now I can

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.270 
in the back surface here now I can
simply<00:05:16.789> run<00:05:17.060> a<00:05:17.120> 3<00:05:17.419> 3d<00:05:18.289> sketch<00:05:18.669> with<00:05:19.669> a<00:05:19.700> line

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
simply run a 3 3d sketch with a line

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.750 
simply run a 3 3d sketch with a line
going<00:05:22.280> from<00:05:22.400> point<00:05:22.789> to<00:05:23.120> point<00:05:24.729> exit<00:05:25.729> the

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
going from point to point exit the

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.450 

if<00:05:32.450> you<00:05:32.600> know<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:32.870> surface<00:05:33.230> is<00:05:33.410> flat<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:34.070> planar

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
if you know the surface is flat a planar

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.150 
if you know the surface is flat a planar
surface<00:05:34.940> will<00:05:35.120> do<00:05:35.300> fine<00:05:35.710> if<00:05:36.710> you're<00:05:36.860> not<00:05:37.100> sure

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
surface will do fine if you're not sure

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.900 
surface will do fine if you're not sure
if<00:05:37.490> it's<00:05:37.760> flat<00:05:38.410> using<00:05:39.410> a<00:05:39.500> fill<00:05:39.740> surface<00:05:40.190> is<00:05:40.400> the

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
if it's flat using a fill surface is the

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.210 
if it's flat using a fill surface is the
best<00:05:41.150> technique

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.150
