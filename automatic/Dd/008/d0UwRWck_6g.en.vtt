00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 this that is next to the archer more 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.839
 scorer in the history of football but 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.950
 the reason for today's visit among the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.450
 which are we going to talk about other topics 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.049
 It is also an anniversary 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.089
 of that goal to burgos velez against river 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.770
 on a rainy Friday consume how 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.199
 you are very good it is a pleasure to be with 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.380
 thank you friends so many years have 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.230
 past a goal 15 that we said 15 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.960
 goals of the 60 because they were spent many 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.760
 many times already sometimes in life one 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.980
 says good things that have achieved 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.480
 within the field of play see it today 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.480
 on television thanks to technology 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.040
 it's a privilege because today it's 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.489
 very difficult for archers to do those 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.770
 that play so wonderful that all the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.890
 world expected the fault that commits 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.270
 francescoli waiting there to see what happens 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.280
 that is discounted good appears in the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.370
 medium and hit him and well then that's why 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.050
 it was very remembered I remember that night 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.629
 rainy rainy it's a bit cold 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.250
 there is the lack about French in 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.610
 francesco in which the purser 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.610
 suspects about this jog and is empty 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.130
 pellegrino and good and noticed bold 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.800
 erasing 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.960
 I shouted to him mastrángelo the referee him 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.420
 admonishes him take it because the court and 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.490
 it is not and that's what jose tells me 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.680
 giving in beloved what I was looking for 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.990
 divert attention from everyone because I 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.610
 saw german that came out of his bow in the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.409
 point of the penitentiary and spoke with his central 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.720
 in that moment of the gomez then 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.060
 disregarding to follow the play then 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.039
 when it reaches a meter it accelerates the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.289
 base rhythm of pellegrino tells me to 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.240
 I told him to do it soon run 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.340
 both when I'm going to hit the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.619
 ball I say mastrángelo agache only 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.920
 Give him killed daughter at this time and 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.899
 remember something else there is a slip of 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.490
 Burgos and you holler if the goal before 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.080
 the ball enter you noticed 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.210
 that with that slip of the goalkeeper 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.080
 river was already what happens is that 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.270
 quique of all the trainings I 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.679
 practiced in vélez there's the position and 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.900
 some colleagues I know why you do it 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.290
 If you're never going to throw it away 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.700
 then life has to be proved 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.740
 then that opportunity was given I tried it 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.660
 the reality is that he passed the ball 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.610
 the left side by the crossbar by 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.020
 the one on the left side I always say 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.600
 I grabbed him and threw an angel for 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.400
 other side and that generates Germanic that 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.170
 slip and fall 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.880
 you saw that game and it ends 3 to 2 a 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.280
 vélez but for everyone 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.900
 remember of course this this much 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.210
 there was something that the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.520
 trainings that important this is 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.880
 will do today in the archers 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.190
 there is practically a barrier that I bought 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.290
 in Japan that the dolls have 190 a 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.240
 barrier buy yourself caps and the doll has 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.000
 a 90 of the soccer player when he jumps 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.220
 can reach 190 then I 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.200
 he practiced 80 balls on the left side 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.709
 from the middle 80 balls the right side 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.600
 you also pass the barrier is goal if it is 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.480
 near the area how important that 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.610
 barrier is sleeping in vélez there is 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.080
 work then without work is not 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.540
 get anything important because 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.640
 thanks to this goal you remember that 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.489
 the world cup of france-98 the tickets are 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.890
 they sold promoting this clear goal or 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.720
 be that for me it has been fantastic but 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.490
 I repeat again in football it's all 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.490
 invented but without work I do not know how
