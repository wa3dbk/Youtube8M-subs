00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.450 
right here you notice a little glass key
with<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> bubble<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.960> that's<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.199> level<00:00:31.460> so

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
with the bubble in that's the level so

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.560 
with the bubble in that's the level so
you<00:00:32.550> replace<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.180> ledge<00:00:34.969> on<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.000> surface

you replace this ledge on the surface

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.490 
you replace this ledge on the surface
and<00:00:36.840> find<00:00:37.320> out<00:00:37.500> if<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.980> area<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.520> level<00:00:39.500> also

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
and find out if the area is level also

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.569 
and find out if the area is level also
it<00:00:40.680> has<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.660> 45<00:00:42.660> degree<00:00:42.989> angle<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.219> side

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
it has a 45 degree angle on this side

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.000 
it has a 45 degree angle on this side
that<00:00:45.480> makes<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.020> easy<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.850> determining<00:00:49.010> don't

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010

that I use it for if I need to make a

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.580 
that I use it for if I need to make a

point<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.300> even<00:02:15.569> better<00:02:15.780> than<00:02:16.050> using<00:02:16.530> a

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
point it's even better than using a

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.100 
point it's even better than using a
pencil<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.930> can<00:02:19.140> use<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.319> too<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.870> make<00:02:22.050> a

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
pencil and I can use that too to make a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.830 
pencil and I can use that too to make a
line<00:02:22.470> across<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.370> cut<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.270> very<00:02:24.480> fine<00:02:24.780> line

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
line across to cut it's a very fine line
