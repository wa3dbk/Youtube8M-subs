00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
is a really cool glitch see the things

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.779 
is a really cool glitch see the things
we<00:00:28.410> did<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.769> glitch<00:00:29.010> where<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.429> play<00:00:29.609> us

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.999 
we did the glitch where you play us
Peter<00:00:30.090> Parker<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:30.750> once<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.050> do<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.260> you

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
Peter Parker but once you do that you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.069 
Peter Parker but once you do that you
have<00:00:32.130> very<00:00:32.340> little<00:00:32.640> options<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.480> what's

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
have very little options like what's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.350 
have very little options like what's
ringing<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.770> could<00:00:35.010> only<00:00:35.100> swing<00:00:35.640> through<00:00:36.120> web

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
ringing you could only swing through web

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.979 
ringing you could only swing through web
instead<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.809> one<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:38.129> what<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.399> did<00:00:38.610> was<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.300> did

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
instead of one so what I did was I did

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.630 
instead of one so what I did was I did
one<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.260> those<00:00:40.379> side<00:00:40.680> missions<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.520> know

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
one of those side missions you know

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.930 
one of those side missions you know
those<00:00:41.879> one<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.239> just<00:00:42.420> pop<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.899> sometimes<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
those one that just pop up sometimes and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.209 
those one that just pop up sometimes and
once<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> those<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.469> more<00:00:47.039> than

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
once you do one of those you more than

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.760 
once you do one of those you more than
likely<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.910> all<00:00:48.239> spider-man's<00:00:49.140> powers<00:00:49.230> like

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.080 
web swinging and climbing so you know if
anyone<00:00:54.920> asking<00:00:55.920> how<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.460> get<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.730> glitch

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
anyone asking how do you get this glitch

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.410 
anyone asking how do you get this glitch
I<00:00:57.300> might<00:00:57.570> make<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> diff<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.199> how<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.739> so

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420
