00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.110
 the people i find again and prussia there is the second part of the 32 one 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.439
 videos 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.699
 However, I've thought about doing the order a little differently 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.559
 and that's why we start today with the dock 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.189
 yes, many of them wanted the dock too 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.009
 Of course, this VNC offers that it's not quite as fast a transfer 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.809
 It's just about showing how old you look at the moment 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.230
 that's the problem we have so far 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.100
 then I say no 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.020
 So first 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.300
 Of course we have to stop our image processing program 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.170
 And there are two ways to go 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.060
 and on 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.150
 You can go directly once 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.010
 but make point Pinky and that's also if I show you the beautiful 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 variant 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.860
 created and two new order the two folders evaluated 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.050
 Incidentally, still need relatively Prof, I have to say 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.950
 therefore 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.840
 yes, if it does with me that rather makes it as I do 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.830
 I can show you now we will get another one there 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.110
 Jazz started and we first create a new file 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.180
 currently the St 320 pixels wide and 91 pixels high 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.210
 and the background color 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.210
 transparent 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.840
 I do not want to have any important but I want one 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.450
 can be more transparent 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.010
 WEZ the DOK would like the can here a picture we like to do 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.510
 would like to make his Docker 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.510
 bring me afterwards save on "file" 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.990
 go directly to the% Desktop 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.480
 in the City Night Main Market 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.550
 and create here a nine victims and the Ortner if Germany lets itself 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.000
 okay, a band that is open at the place again because finally come 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.799
 APA 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.849
 Stratton Sport 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.849
 same way 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.799
 if i was here in other page could save this file here and that 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.259
 a very specific name which in sight St Bikes bring word thanks 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.929
 BG for backup and 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:34.129
 and then of course always point PD and save 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.319
 like that and already a dock 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.219
 that was it for the dock b passports in it you can do all this now on yours 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.219
 Push off your iPhone or iPod and you're done 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.309
 a transparent dock
