 above the storm of silvretta 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.839
 Montafon is currently in a busy phase 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.969
 because here is diligent one 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.089
 material ropeway for the new construction of 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.610
 panorama track worked together with 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.890
 usurious helicopter is andreas jochum of 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.250
 the company of the same name in the piece for 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.940
 We will be responsible for the construction 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.500
 prop up to the flight each 30 meters high and 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.549
 there are five bursts of safe working 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.410
 that is most important if that 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.920
 Many helicopters come 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.840
 stress that may remain calm and safe 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.240
 but also work if the cable car 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.330
 land is waiting a lot of work 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.759
 andreas and his coworkers the first 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.539
 times the construction site only the 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.759
 Shuttering emphasizes this and concludes it 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.100
 condor of the mountain station in front of the company 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.810
 Doppelmayr and is the weakest part 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.569
 six- ton gearbox 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.310
 that 's it the material ropeway the 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.069
 has some to tour how long she and 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.270
 what's the strength of the fourth length of approx 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:48.049
 1000 meters in front of the transport capacity 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.780
 six tons per hour 56 curls 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.829
 the parts of the cable car were with the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.909
 truck at 2120 meters altitude above the 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.909
 tunnels driven 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.220
 and now flew to kreuzjoch saddle 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.650
 At this altitude, the helicopter can only 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.259
 transport up to 900 kilograms 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.410
 in comparison, in the valley he creates 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.290
 helicopter up to 1200 kilograms without 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.709
 problems also increases due to the thinner ones 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.600
 air the fuel consumption the company 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.850
 by andreas young has been on cable car 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.340
 transports and material ropeways 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.380
 specialized one sees this also at the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.640
 placing the supports in the montafoner 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.989
 kreuzjoch or lake taal here must 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.060
 every handgrip is sitting 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.130
 within seconds, the parts must 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.000
 connected and the ropes 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.000
 be tense 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.840
 when everything is seated, the props are 30 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.880
 meter high and it can take up to six 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.880
 tons of material to be transported 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.220
 also at the future valley station of the 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.269
 Panorama run the preparations 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.400
 at full speed 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.310
 between the Blessed and the Chapel 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.080
 around 4,150 meters of solid wood were felled 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.480
 so that the winter sportsman in the 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.940
 coming season comfortably in the longest 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.950
 sport track vorarlbergs 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.569
 until then, but still hardworking 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.580
 especially at the 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.370
 future mountain station of the panoramic cable car 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:24.129
 at 2,360 meters 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.129
 it will look like this 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.870
 who experience the construction progress themselves 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.030
 he wants to have everyone for the fifth of july 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.760
 Saturday at the construction site hike with 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.890
 guide the possibility more information 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.540
