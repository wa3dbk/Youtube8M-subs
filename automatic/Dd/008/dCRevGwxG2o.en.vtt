00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
just more about getting instructions and

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.140 
just more about getting instructions and
seeing<00:02:58.310> how<00:02:58.489> it's<00:02:58.700> done

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
seeing how it's done

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.120 
seeing how it's done
so<00:02:59.720> let's<00:02:59.930> say<00:03:00.080> for<00:03:00.110> example<00:03:00.319> this<00:03:00.769> is<00:03:00.950> in<00:03:00.980> the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
so let's say for example this is in the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.280 
so let's say for example this is in the
box<00:03:01.310> for<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.549> couple<00:03:01.819> of<00:03:01.910> days<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:03.019> wanted

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
box for a couple of days and you wanted

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.410 
box for a couple of days and you wanted
to<00:03:03.380> wear<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.560> it's<00:03:03.769> a<00:03:03.890> nice<00:03:04.040> sunny<00:03:04.400> day<00:03:04.489> out<00:03:04.819> so

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
to wear it it's a nice sunny day out so

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.090 
to wear it it's a nice sunny day out so
what<00:03:05.540> do<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.660> do<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:05.930> open<00:03:06.019> up<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.319> box<00:03:09.100> you

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
what do you do you open up the box you

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.180 
what do you do you open up the box you
take<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.430> ring<00:03:10.640> out<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:12.620> now<00:03:12.890> what<00:03:13.070> we<00:03:13.160> have

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
take the ring out and now what we have

take the ring out and now what we have
to<00:03:13.340> do<00:03:13.579> is<00:03:13.910> do<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.269> reversal<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:15.109> popping<00:03:15.980> it

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
to do is do the reversal of popping it

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.449 
to do is do the reversal of popping it
back<00:03:16.100> out<00:03:17.590> now<00:03:18.590> when<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:18.799> pop<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.010> out<00:03:19.250> don't

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
worry there's always going to be a line

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.440 
worry there's always going to be a line
a<00:03:20.989> crease<00:03:21.530> line<00:03:21.829> in<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.130> middle<00:03:22.459> okay<00:03:22.880> that's

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
a crease line in the middle okay that's

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.360 
a crease line in the middle okay that's
no<00:03:23.630> problem<00:03:23.900> that<00:03:24.260> will<00:03:24.380> come<00:03:24.590> out<00:03:24.620> eventually

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
no problem that will come out eventually

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.030 
no problem that will come out eventually
in<00:03:25.489> about<00:03:26.060> an<00:03:26.150> hour<00:03:26.299> or<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:27.049> already<00:03:27.920> you

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040
