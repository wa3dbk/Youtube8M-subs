right here in the back you notice that
the<00:01:05.280> holes<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> honeycomb<00:01:06.420> pattern

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the holes this is a honeycomb pattern

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.570 
the holes this is a honeycomb pattern
now<00:01:07.140> honeycomb<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> much<00:01:07.979> more<00:01:08.159> efficient

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
now honeycomb is much more efficient

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.950 
now honeycomb is much more efficient
than<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> little<00:01:09.210> dots<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
than the little dots that you see in a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.960 
than the little dots that you see in a
lot<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.170> them<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.470> far<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:10.920> airflow<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.490> also

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
lot of them as far as airflow and also

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
lot of them as far as airflow and also
on<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> bottom<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.630> hundred<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
on the bottom we have a hundred and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.390 
on the bottom we have a hundred and
thirty-five<00:01:13.290> millimeter<00:01:13.500> fan<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.100> keep<00:01:14.250> this

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
thirty-five millimeter fan to keep this

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.580 
thirty-five millimeter fan to keep this
cool<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.850> fan<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.150> extremely<00:01:15.930> quiet

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
cool and this fan is extremely quiet

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.140 
cool and this fan is extremely quiet
it's<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.009> same<00:01:17.189> fan<00:01:17.369> they<00:01:17.490> used<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> 800

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
it's the same fan they used on the 800

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.760 
it's the same fan they used on the 800
watt<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.080> going<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> be<00:01:19.290> virtually

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
watt so it's going to be virtually

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.770 
watt so it's going to be virtually
almost<00:01:20.340> silent<00:01:20.880> now<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> back

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
almost silent now you can see the back

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
almost silent now you can see the back
here<00:01:21.990> there<00:01:22.229> are<00:01:22.350> no<00:01:22.710> stupid<00:01:23.100> cords<00:01:23.520> going
