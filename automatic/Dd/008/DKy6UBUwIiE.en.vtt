but<00:01:52.479> well<00:01:53.439> in<00:01:53.649> this<00:01:53.829> issue<00:01:53.950> he<00:01:54.130> seemed<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.340> be

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
but well in this issue he seemed to be

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.620 
but well in this issue he seemed to be
completely<00:01:54.850> preoccupied<00:01:55.270> with<00:01:55.569> just

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
completely preoccupied with just

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.819 
completely preoccupied with just
escaping<00:01:56.499> and<00:01:58.079> Jameson<00:01:59.079> and<00:01:59.229> everyone<00:01:59.679> else

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
escaping and Jameson and everyone else

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.760 
escaping and Jameson and everyone else
seemed<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.219> be<00:02:00.340> an<00:02:00.429> afterthought<00:02:00.939> so<00:02:01.929> that's<00:02:02.619> a

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
seemed to be an afterthought so that's a

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.219 
seemed to be an afterthought so that's a
very<00:02:02.799> good<00:02:03.009> question<00:02:03.159> why<00:02:03.759> wait<00:02:04.030> um<00:02:04.389> it<00:02:05.139> was

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
very good question why wait um it was

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.319 
very good question why wait um it was
very<00:02:05.439> cool<00:02:05.709> that<00:02:05.740> Spiderman<00:02:06.579> was<00:02:06.609> actually<00:02:07.149> at

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
very cool that Spiderman was actually at

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.510 
very cool that Spiderman was actually at
the<00:02:07.749> execution<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.740> like<00:02:09.220> while<00:02:09.399> he's

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
the execution and like while he's

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.190 
the execution and like while he's
watching<00:02:09.700> there's<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.479> great<00:02:10.690> line<00:02:10.899> where<00:02:11.140> is

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
watching there's a great line where is

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.920 
watching there's a great line where is
talking<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.620> nor<00:02:12.010> winters<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.730> lifelong<00:02:13.360> killer

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
talking to nor winters a lifelong killer

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.920 
talking to nor winters a lifelong killer
a<00:02:14.200> murderer<00:02:15.000> doesn't<00:02:16.000> suddenly<00:02:16.209> become<00:02:16.720> a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
a murderer doesn't suddenly become a

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.630 
a murderer doesn't suddenly become a
different<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.590> then<00:02:17.830> he<00:02:17.920> stops<00:02:18.190> himself

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
different and then he stops himself

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.910 
different and then he stops himself
because<00:02:19.330> he<00:02:19.450> realizes<00:02:19.810> not<00:02:20.620> only<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:20.860> he

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
because he realizes not only is he

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.920 
because he realizes not only is he
describing<00:02:21.430> spider-slayer<00:02:22.120> he's<00:02:22.480> describing

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
describing spider-slayer he's describing

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.050 
describing spider-slayer he's describing
himself<00:02:23.140> though<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:23.980> don't<00:02:24.189> think<00:02:24.730> he's<00:02:24.909> going

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
himself though I don't think he's going

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.550 
himself though I don't think he's going
to<00:02:25.120> actually<00:02:25.450> show<00:02:25.599> him<00:02:25.780> mercy<00:02:25.989> because

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
to actually show him mercy because

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.110 
to actually show him mercy because
of<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:27.040> slight<00:02:27.400> connection<00:02:27.700> between

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
himself and the spiders lair so you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.070

the raft so the ones that remain may
only<00:03:03.610> be<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.819> handful<00:03:04.269> I<00:03:04.480> was<00:03:04.840> actually

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
only be a handful I was actually

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.900 
only be a handful I was actually
thinking<00:03:05.140> there's<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.590> chance<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:05.980> he<00:03:06.670> might

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
thinking there's a chance that he might

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.240 
thinking there's a chance that he might
ally<00:03:07.569> with<00:03:07.780> some<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:08.080> them<00:03:08.230> if<00:03:08.530> things<00:03:08.950> get<00:03:09.190> too

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
ally with some of them if things get too

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.729 
ally with some of them if things get too
out<00:03:09.459> of<00:03:09.489> control<00:03:09.610> perhaps<00:03:10.540> Connors<00:03:11.410> maybe

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
out of control perhaps Connors maybe

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.460 
out of control perhaps Connors maybe
because<00:03:12.519> he<00:03:12.670> seems<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:13.000> be<00:03:13.090> good<00:03:13.390> from<00:03:13.900> like

that<00:04:31.990> he<00:04:32.080> wants<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:32.880> obviously<00:04:33.880> he's

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
that he wants and obviously he's

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.779

fighting<00:04:34.960> crime<00:04:35.289> the<00:04:35.560> way<00:04:35.680> he<00:04:35.860> wants<00:04:36.190> I<00:04:36.370> think

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
fighting crime the way he wants I think

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:37.890 
fighting crime the way he wants I think
what's<00:04:37.000> going<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.240> be<00:04:37.300> important<00:04:37.659> is<00:04:37.750> I<00:04:37.840> think

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
what's going to be important is I think

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.859 
what's going to be important is I think
he<00:04:38.140> will<00:04:38.320> actually

00:04:38.859 --> 00:04:38.869 
he will actually

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:41.540 
he will actually
eventually<00:04:39.869> break<00:04:40.649> down<00:04:40.860> these<00:04:41.039> walls<00:04:41.279> like

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
eventually break down these walls like

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.919 
eventually break down these walls like
he<00:04:41.699> won't<00:04:41.819> work<00:04:41.999> at<00:04:42.179> verizon<00:04:42.509> anymore<00:04:42.779> because

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:42.929 
he won't work at verizon anymore because

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:44.179 
he won't work at verizon anymore because
it<00:04:43.050> looks<00:04:43.199> like<00:04:43.259> he's<00:04:43.439> about<00:04:43.529> to<00:04:43.679> get<00:04:43.770> fired<00:04:43.889> I

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
it looks like he's about to get fired I

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:46.100 
it looks like he's about to get fired I
mean<00:04:44.789> it's<00:04:44.909> already<00:04:45.270> sort<00:04:45.689> of<00:04:45.749> on<00:04:45.839> the<00:04:45.959> outs

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
mean it's already sort of on the outs

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.350 
mean it's already sort of on the outs
with<00:04:46.289> the<00:04:46.830> superhero<00:04:47.249> community<00:04:47.520> like<00:04:48.179> the

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
with the superhero community like the

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.649 
with the superhero community like the
Avengers<00:04:48.889> but<00:04:49.889> I<00:04:50.069> think<00:04:50.219> once<00:04:51.089> he<00:04:51.209> tears<00:04:51.539> them

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
Avengers but I think once he tears them

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:53.600 
Avengers but I think once he tears them
down<00:04:51.899> he'll<00:04:52.229> realize<00:04:52.649> his<00:04:53.009> life<00:04:53.219> is<00:04:53.429> going<00:04:53.550> to

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
down he'll realize his life is going to

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.399 
down he'll realize his life is going to
be<00:04:53.669> empty<00:04:54.119> without<00:04:54.240> them<00:04:54.449> I<00:04:54.839> think<00:04:55.319> he'll

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
be empty without them I think he'll

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.019 
be empty without them I think he'll
realize<00:04:55.709> that<00:04:55.860> Peter<00:04:56.099> actually<00:04:56.429> wasn't

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:57.029 
realize that Peter actually wasn't

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.749 
realize that Peter actually wasn't
restricted<00:04:58.020> by<00:04:58.589> these<00:04:58.860> walls<00:04:59.159> he<00:04:59.639> was

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
restricted by these walls he was

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.249 
restricted by these walls he was
actually<00:04:59.909> empowered<00:05:00.479> by<00:05:00.659> his<00:05:00.809> friends<00:05:01.110> and

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
actually empowered by his friends and

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.779 
actually empowered by his friends and
family<00:05:01.529> and<00:05:01.679> that's<00:05:01.830> worded<00:05:02.219> by<00:05:02.339> them<00:05:02.520> that's

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
family and that's worded by them that's

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.189 
family and that's worded by them that's
where<00:05:02.939> he<00:05:02.999> drew<00:05:03.179> his<00:05:03.300> strength<00:05:03.599> from<00:05:03.839> and<00:05:04.139> I

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
where he drew his strength from and I

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.480 
where he drew his strength from and I
don't<00:05:04.379> think<00:05:04.559> doc<00:05:04.770> is<00:05:04.949> gonna<00:05:05.129> realize<00:05:05.459> that

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
don't think doc is gonna realize that

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.179 
don't think doc is gonna realize that
until<00:05:05.879> he's<00:05:06.270> lost<00:05:06.479> it<00:05:06.719> Doc's<00:05:07.229> major<00:05:07.499> problem

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:08.189 
until he's lost it Doc's major problem

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:10.879 
until he's lost it Doc's major problem
when<00:05:08.849> it<00:05:08.969> comes<00:05:09.179> to<00:05:09.360> just<00:05:09.569> analyzing<00:05:10.349> his<00:05:10.649> life

when it comes to just analyzing his life

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.389 
when it comes to just analyzing his life
is<00:05:11.099> that<00:05:11.490> he's<00:05:11.759> way<00:05:12.119> too<00:05:12.199> arrogant<00:05:13.199> and<00:05:13.499> that

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:14.399 
is that he's way too arrogant and that

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:16.159 
is that he's way too arrogant and that
does<00:05:14.669> make<00:05:14.909> him<00:05:15.149> a<00:05:15.300> character<00:05:15.659> i'd<00:05:15.779> like<00:05:15.990> to

his life i was actually a little bit

his life i was actually a little bit
surprised<00:05:26.550> in<00:05:26.729> this<00:05:26.849> issue<00:05:26.999> that<00:05:27.300> we<00:05:27.389> didn't

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
surprised in this issue that we didn't

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.749 
surprised in this issue that we didn't
see<00:05:27.689> any<00:05:27.719> of<00:05:27.929> green<00:05:28.199> goblin<00:05:28.589> or<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:29.309> goblin

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759

king as he's known now yeah very

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:34.279 
king as he's known now yeah very
surprising<00:05:32.339> and<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.519> think<00:05:32.789> slot<00:05:33.449> is<00:05:33.689> going<00:05:34.199> to

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289

set<00:05:34.649> it<00:05:34.679> up<00:05:34.889> such<00:05:35.249> that<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:36.179> goblin<00:05:36.689> king<00:05:37.199> is
