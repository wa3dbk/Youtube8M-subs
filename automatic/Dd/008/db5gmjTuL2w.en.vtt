00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hi today i'm taking a valentine's day 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.450
 look for you on February 14 is then 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.250
 a valentine's day 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.290
 and this is the look that I came up with 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.000
 the products that will use you 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.500
 now you see in the picture but you really have 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.059
 not exactly the same products too 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.190
 use as long as you get a little 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.140
 the same color from a little pink lilac 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.670
 a bronzer and blush it is not necessary 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.220
 the same between and keep a little bit 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.080
 do inspiration so let's get started 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.880
 and first and care i am going one 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.800
 little liquid bronzer 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.720
 apply all over my face so that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.710
 I am a little bit darker and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.500
 not quite 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.239
 appears pale and I lubricate this very well 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.969
 out or my whole face 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.030
 and my neck so well I'm a little bit 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.770
 browner and oh the lips must be good 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.360
 were cared maybe you'll go a 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.129
 give someone a joom 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.200
 so I put a little lip balm on it 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.760
 and that leaves me now foundation 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.680
 because i bond you have then use it 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.809
 use a slightly darker foundation 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.180
 so see it whole this way 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.219
 natural looks and a foundation 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.340
 I put in with a barbarian over it 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.290
 whole face look completely is weird 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.570
 and now I do a little concealer 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.400
 my eyes and very liquid concealer 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.750
 which is 2 shades lighter than the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.340
 foundation 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.670
 I have under my eyes I bring on 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.500
 my nose my chin and also a piece of mine 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.350
 forehead worth battle of release 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.659
 highlighter works and optically everyone 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.659
 very fresh and bakery 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.090
 slightly more good end with my ring finger 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.100
 and I fix everything still loose powder 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.409
 as good all day on his 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.630
 place stays in place 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.369
 well then i continue with the eyelid first 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.799
 apply some eye shadow base so that 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.409
 everything stays very well 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.000
 and now the eye shadow I start with one 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.210
 highlighter 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.800
 henry's i use a flat thicker one 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.660
 brushes I do not know why limited so 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.250
 nice I put this under the 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.770
 eyebrow steele and I fade that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.870
 down and now I take a bright pink 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.700
 eyeshadow by joining our rather awkward 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.310
 work but I leave you mine 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.000
 combination and I bring the pink 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.610
 color on my eyelid until just below 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.800
 the arcade arch actually 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.450
 and now I take a bit of a purple color 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.180
 medium purple and which brings with a 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.800
 blending brush in my arcade arch 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.340
 fade very well so you go pink 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.560
 to purple to the highlighter up there 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.540
 gently from left to right so that you 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.610
 is completely colored 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.380
 and recently I also go a little more than 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.760
 my nose it on me with the color of the 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.950
 arcade arch I am very sorry 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.150
 so look nice on the outside but also 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.959
 certainly inwards 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.820
 more purple now I take a soft one 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.500
 blending brush and with that I blur the 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.489
 top of the purple shade in the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.440
 highlighter 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.810
 this makes the whole thing softer without it 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.480
 all those hard lines and murmuring advice 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.970
 ambition now I have the first happy less 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.299
 sun black and with this I go over the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.160
 outer v quite tricky especially if the 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.810
 black is matt but just go very small 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.750
 build up a bit so add a little 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.540
 add a little bit and blandit in that corner 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.459
 and up a little bit 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.989
 even the corner on the other side you 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.820
 makes a kind you know or a half 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:11.250
 circle and apply it with your brush 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.720
 So now if I take the same costs 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.549
 I dipped in drones that I dip 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.709
 in a light teacher color and this brings 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.930
 in my eyes it is of lilac 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.340
 to bright red 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.350
 now I take a cotton swab that is small 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.260
 get a little wet here with boulder 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.650
 tight line that I do here on 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.230
 communicate small errors 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.410
 I get this all my finger says so 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.299
 cotton swab and take take out video library 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.370
 was that dip I in the purple color that 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.410
 used boogerd and with this I put one 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.329
 line under my eyes 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.120
 the easiest way is by doing this 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.829
 look up in the mirror and now 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.830
 I dip the same guy in the black color 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.450
 and that brings about half 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.130
 You can also correct pieces if necessary 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.780
 on the side 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.550
 time for eye pencil I use and can 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.750
 your pencil and with this I draw a line 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.850
 to around half 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.160
 the inside of my eye i close my 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.520
 eyes and actually push the pencil in 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.260
 where it is very easy and after that it is 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.250
 time for liquid eyeliner you can be one 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.050
 make it beautiful 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.240
 well after that i didn't feel like it afterwards 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.340
 I just take classic basic black 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.260
 lijntje and I always work from it 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.600
 the middle inwards and inwards 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.570
 never how much does he start 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.750
 I start in the middle and then I continue 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.430
 to my eye and went to work 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.230
 time for mascara in this case it is 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.400
 a base layer you because I will fake later 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.130
 you have to apply eyelashes 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.170
 of course you have to do if you do 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.300
 just the whole layer of mascara takes care of it 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.600
 that lashes stay in place 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.300
 measure the lashes fine lash line on my 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.630
 dog eyelashes hanging through it so far 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.570
 Exactly enough it looks like your eyelashes 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.490
 and apply and now they are on me 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.980
 find some lashes on the outside 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.980
 I think it's a very sexy cat eye 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.780
 so if i have a nice of fast time for that 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.070
 the bronzer i brings a bit more bronzer 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.840
 then normal to shape 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.660
 because if you give that also gives one 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.460
 kind of sexy 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.440
 yeah kiss you get there fall 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.890
 because your entire face looks sleek and 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.520
 nice and I bring this to my 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.830
 ear 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.810
 say to my mouth and above it 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.490
 a table and use it diagonally 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:24.040
 cut off it seems at first sometimes 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.390
 fierce but that falls from I think god 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.710
 I know it with a brush 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.360
 and if you really like it 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.390
 Use small powder brush to make it one 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.920
 little more to blur 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.060
 And don't forget your chin too 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.150
 ate 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.740
 Certainly now a little blush and I thought 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.780
 uses light pink 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.090
 that is a sweet soft color for sure shop 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.370
 floor us on your eyes has too much role 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.710
 like gossip about alcohol and spray 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.870
 light color and a little highlighter 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.669
 and that gives such a nice pleated effect 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.260
 time the difference right with left on the 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.590
 engine 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.480
 so that brings over the blush and now 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.669
 continue with the lip lip balm 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.710
 has since been withdrawn and I am going now and then 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.480
 put a little line in a pink 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.880
 color this is about the color of mine 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.410
 lips and with it corrects 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.900
 make a mistake what is my own lips 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:14.860
 they don't really have a line and now 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:17.590
 I make it nice with ls well 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.990
 pink lipstick very pretty not the 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.490
 bright color and I go over it 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.070
 with a light pink 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.870
 could not design goals that are beautiful 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.120
 effect 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.190
 the lip gloss is almost over and this is it 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.360
 this is my valentine's day now i hope 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.180
 that you liked him 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.440
 have fun on valentine's day and even though 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.530
 don't have a date 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.180
 no matter go cozy jordy videos 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.100

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.440

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.610
 getting acquainted is heating d
