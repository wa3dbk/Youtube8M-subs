grip<00:00:28.680> starts<00:00:29.609> off<00:00:29.820> by<00:00:30.210> finding<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.109> nice

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
grip starts off by finding a nice

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.410 
grip starts off by finding a nice
fulcrum<00:00:32.040> point<00:00:32.070> with<00:00:32.610> your<00:00:32.790> stick<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> nice

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
fulcrum point with your stick a nice

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.930 
fulcrum point with your stick a nice
balance<00:00:33.780> point<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.530> hold<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
balance point and you hold it in the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.170 
balance point and you hold it in the
joint<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.170> your<00:00:37.410> index<00:00:37.950> or<00:00:38.219> first<00:00:38.489> finger<00:00:38.790> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
joint of your index or first finger and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.840 
joint of your index or first finger and
your<00:00:39.420> thumb<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:40.770> place<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
your thumb so we place it like that and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.819 
your thumb so we place it like that and
we<00:00:42.329> find<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.719> good<00:00:42.870> balance<00:00:42.930> point<00:00:43.649> if<00:00:43.739> you

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
we find a good balance point if you

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.860 
we find a good balance point if you
choke<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.309> too<00:00:44.610> far<00:00:45.000> there's<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.539> enough

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
choke it up too far there's not enough

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.080 
choke it up too far there's not enough
action<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> front<00:00:46.980> end<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.820> choke

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
action on the front end if you choke

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.450 
action on the front end if you choke
back<00:00:48.329> too<00:00:48.660> far<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:49.260> too<00:00:49.500> heavy<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.160> front

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
back too far it's too heavy on the front

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.970 
back too far it's too heavy on the front
end<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.300> find<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.750> good<00:00:51.960> fulcrum<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.620> that

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
end so you find a good fulcrum for that

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.639 
end so you find a good fulcrum for that
and<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.449> take<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> other<00:00:54.960> three<00:00:55.230> fingers

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
and then we take the other three fingers

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.310 
and then we take the other three fingers
and<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.949> curl<00:00:56.280> them<00:00:56.460> gently<00:00:57.030> underneath<00:00:57.480> so

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
and we curl them gently underneath so

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.830 
and we curl them gently underneath so
they<00:00:58.469> do<00:00:58.530> provide<00:00:59.280> some<00:00:59.910> control<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
they do provide some control in the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.229 
they do provide some control in the
future<00:01:01.199> they'll<00:01:01.379> provide<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.910> fine<00:01:02.910> motor

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
future they'll provide a fine motor

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.200 
future they'll provide a fine motor
movement<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:04.559> keep<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.949> keep<00:01:05.430> them<00:01:05.700> very

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
movement but we keep this keep them very

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.810 
movement but we keep this keep them very
lightly<00:01:06.510> curled<00:01:07.110> around<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.590> stick<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.100> that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
lightly curled around the stick and that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.929 
lightly curled around the stick and that
is<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.570> match<00:01:09.990> grip<00:01:10.500> now<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.400> do<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> same

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
is the match grip now we do the same

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.230 
is the match grip now we do the same
thing<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.479> other<00:01:12.510> hand<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:14.240> first
