 the presence in my writing 30 to date 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.430
 counting the in several story clips 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:14.610
 to show the essence of the city and 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.270
 we show natural viewpoints that are a 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.270
 sentence 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.780
 what are the sheets of the houses of 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.780

 aggregation to see what was on top of the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.209
 anteroom then when pulling boats that 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.060
 the discharge was marked and discarded 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.180
 but here as they were heard by the people 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.379
 it goes the wind that rains on the side it 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.359
 they started to form houses with these 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.359
 cans to protect them from water 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.569

 in another place that we went more or less by 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.420
 the same route and here we are 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.450
 curiously in jumps when what 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.750
 we found it was just painted the combi 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.879
 and a guy who is a professional painter will 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.880
 he made a real wonder a work of 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.240
 art 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.790

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.380
 through the streets of villa del mar and let's go 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.210
 towards the botanical garden where we have been 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.710

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.710
 vans for us in chile 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.750
 and they took advantage of all the space 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.610
 maximum for example this here always 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.420
 we call bottles to take advantage of 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.450
 spaces 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.670
 of operated this the refrigerator 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.770
 and where we kept covered 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.770
 has the silver 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.409
 in the kitchen that all the 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.490
 values ​​and gets in there the kitchen and 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.490
 clear if it goes up 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.530
 the goods merchandise 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:00.400
 although it seemed semantic 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.520
 we had a party style of the 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.290
 seventies and stores then had not 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.620
 arranged his vans with flowers 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.840
 painted 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.650
 and I as organized and did not have time 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.470
 I did not know what to do then what I did 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.770
 I went and cut twigs of carmine from all 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.770
 kind 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.029
 let's take play that I had out there and 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:24.029
 company with locals 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.920
 instead the twig then 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.840
 I turned around it was supposed to be 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.550
 but a varnish over protective 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.040
 and there is the result 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.350
 that my first encounter particularly 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.200
 I had never been with other combi and 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.670
 well but that's how he hates one of several like 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.430
 there is here 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.980
 happy to participate and the 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.020
 Decoration is completely like 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.420
 abstract I do not know if it has any 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.800
 explanation or not I started him 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.900
 discover some things as 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.900
 example here as a face 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.090
 these are the eyes of the nose as a 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.380
 face of an avatar if you can 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.320
 get to two in things and seeing it like that 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:29.320
 and like the one that forges a random thing 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:33.500
 It is a rainbow of multiple colors 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.310
 Valparaíso main room 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.750
 the women 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:42.080
 the daisies 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:47.289
 all of them torn from their sea 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.289
 when looking at this post 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.230
 Marine 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:10.380
 ever 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:27.000
 but no 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.000
 with the heart 

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.850
 with the other sectors 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.510
