00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hello, I'm a movie nose and welcome 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.000
 to my channel 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.429
 recently on a walk I saw a donut here 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.019
 with such a war and attractive face 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.150
 I wanted to do the same from 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.029
 polymer clay and today you will see 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.090
 what did I get out of it 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.340
 stay with me to work me 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.960
 will need several polymer colors 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.849
 clay 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.130
 I take a beige color similar to the color 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.099
 dough and knead it thoroughly 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.099
 tear off a small piece and roll the ball 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.899
 i will make a chocolate donut so 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.539
 I take a small piece of brown 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.539
 I roll into a ball and flatten a pancake 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:57.270
 I put the pancake on a beige ball and 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.910
 then kata together I get 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.010
 two-colored ball here do not need to roll 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.989
 to the extent that the border is completely 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.520
 the blurred border should remain 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:12.330
 visible i take a piece of paper impose 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.850
 on top of the ball and press it this way 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.770
 I get a flattened bun in 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.820
 which need to make a hole like 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.680
 donuts i make a hole modeling 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.140
 tool but the exact same hole 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.700
 can be done and ordinary toothpick and 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.700
 reverse side of the brush 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.770
 the edges of the hole I smooth a little 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.200
 modulating in the tool so they 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.200
 were more rounded more gentle 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.350
 now turn over donut and reverse 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.869
 the sides make the texture of an ordinary dental 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.140
 brushing the whole thing well 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:06.430
 the surface is the place where the beige color is 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:08.979
 eat dough take dry art 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.069
 a bed of red-brown color and a knife 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.350
 I paint in dust this dust I am toning dough 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.270
 so she took a more ruddy look 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.270
 like a donut is fried 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.360
 Here is a donut I get 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.910
 but my donut will be with a pretty face 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.950
 and at this stage I will do it with 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.120
 ball modeling tool on 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.440
 late i make two holes for eyes 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:52.070
 cut off two small pieces of black 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:54.830
 colors and I roll these little balls 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.380
 balls put in holes where should 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.790
 be eyes 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.590
 I roll a thin black sausage 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.120
 cut off a small piece that will become 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.530
 mouth put the mouth in his place and 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.530
 round off a little smile 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.080
 hot pink magenta mixed with white 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:27.990
 and get a soft pink hue for 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.480
 counter roll a small sausage cut off 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:36.000
 two identical parts each of the parts 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.950
 roll the ball and these balls flatten out 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.040
 donuts in places where they should 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:46.380
 be white cheeks 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.630
 I cut a long sausage into small ones 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.630
 small pieces and roll these pieces in 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.020
 small balls these balls will become 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.020
 highlight 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.450
 I place highlights on the cheeks and eyes 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.970
 I want to make a bitten donut this 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.310
 You can make any round molds and 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:21.170
 cut off the side of a small part of this 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.630
 Donut cut the place I process 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:29.480
 a toothpick just loosened the surface 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:36.590
 to receive an invoice dough here such 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:38.840
 here's a donut I get a pin 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.610
 to insert the mount pin 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.370
 it is necessary to insert a little bit at an angle 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.530
 lest he cut a hole inside 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.590
 donut so that it does not stick out the center and 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.030
 neatly insert the pin now donut 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.980
 can bake temperature and 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.200
 bake duration look at 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.900
 the packaging of that polymer clay from which 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.210
 you sculpt 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.000
 in company to my chocolate donut i 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.220
 also made bright pink and both 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.770
 the tip you need to glue the pins I have it 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.200
 I make with the help of super glue I take out the pin 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.190
 dipping into glue and inserting fast 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.190
 backward movement 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.199
 and after that I cover products with glossy 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.160
 only the glaze of the dough is coated with varnish 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.160
 stays matte 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.280
 when the varnish dries I fix the bases for 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.530
 hanging 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.410
 and then you can insert a chain or 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.830
 some ribbon here are such cuties 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.960
 I got 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.480
 I really like such a cute kawaii 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.270
 style i like food with funny faces 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.630
 and hope you enjoyed this one as well. 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.850
 lesson 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.100
 Of course, I use this method 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.740
 can not necessarily make a donut with 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.780
 muzzle can not do without and 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.210
 You can make a donut completely not 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.090
 bitten it all depends on your 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.140
 fantasy wish you creative success and 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.240
