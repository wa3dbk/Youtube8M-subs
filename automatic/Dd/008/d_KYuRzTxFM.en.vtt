00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.859
 the recipe must be a giant penis 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.859
 marinade with beef fillet 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.830
 it's a very simple recipe first thing 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.560
 what we are going to do will be our marine 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.199
 steak for that I'm going to take 2 teeth from 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.689
 garlic to be able to peel them quickly 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.579
 you just need to crush them 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.590
 slightly and then the shell goes 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.830
 to detach very easily a 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.770
 glass of red wine 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.940
 some olive oil some 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.140
 Salt 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.510
 and pepper 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.130
 Now we are going to liquefy it until we get 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.130
 a smoother preparation possible 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.540
 I already have here the piece of steak 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.150
 I'm just going to empty the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.940
 I'm going to cover it with a 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.320
 plastic film and we are going to put it to 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.130
 marinate in the refrigerator for a 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.130
 two hour space 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.989
 now yes since the time of 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.540
 marinated then let's seal it 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.210
 let's add a little oil 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.190
 olive 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.680
 we're just going to teach it, that is 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.330
 I want to be browned on the outside 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.340
 Sealed meat is tastier and more nutritious 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.530
 because it keeps all the nutrients to 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.600
 the extra costs I will use the same 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.150
 pan to prepare the sauce for that 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.670
 I will occupy serrano peppers and tomatoes 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.290
 cherry matches in quarters the tomatoes 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.970
 They are very healthy because they contain 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.680
 antioxidants that help you maintain 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.360
 the cells of your body always young 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.610
 and we are going to cut off the sky now 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.640
 we pricked two cloves of garlic 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.990
 finally we go first they make thunder the 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.299
 Garlic 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.729
 already once I was focused on garlic 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.680
 we are going to add the chill and 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.780
 you also have to take jerry and we're going to 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.909
 cook over low heat with a little salt 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.189
 and pepper while I'm going to put 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.420
 cook the pasta the shiny comb what 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.710
 We are going to sew following the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.659
 packing instructions so that 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.110
 always be al dente direct the pan 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.830
 let's mix the pasta with the sauce 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.170
 later we are going to place 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.880
 we put the beef filet that is already 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.920
 we call and sprinkle with cheese 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.349
 parmesan the one who supervising as the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.239
 pepper but kings at the moment 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.210
 better and decorate with a little parsley 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.100
 pica 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.800
 a correct pairing what is going to 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.540
 to carry is that the taste of the wine does not 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.550
 completely covers the taste of the food 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.780
 or vice versa but these have to 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.370
 combine so that you have a 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.770
 wonderful experience at the time of 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.600
 food you have to remember that when 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.910
 the food is a moment to share 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.710
 with the family, talk about things 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.880

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.050
