 different teams at feyenoord 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.030
 it's a riot it was difficult in the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.030
 prophase 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.250

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.140
 political position play only mine 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.050

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.060
 first game a bit reasonable 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.220
 but what good I have the teeth and tanks 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.610
 Secondly, we all actually don't like that 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.610
