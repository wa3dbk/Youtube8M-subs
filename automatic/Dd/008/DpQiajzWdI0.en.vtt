pedigree adoption drive helped us to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.140 
pedigree adoption drive helped us to
build<00:01:33.360> these<00:01:33.540> yes<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.070> it's<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.490> quieter<00:01:35.970> area

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
build these yes so it's a quieter area

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.390 
build these yes so it's a quieter area
for<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.509> dogs<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> suppose<00:01:37.770> grams<00:01:38.159> like

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
for the dogs so I suppose grams like

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.100 
for the dogs so I suppose grams like
that<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:38.700> very<00:01:38.729> important<00:01:39.390> vital<00:01:39.869> especially

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
that are very important vital especially

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.590 
that are very important vital especially
at<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> moment<00:01:41.670> where<00:01:41.850> people<00:01:42.299> are<00:01:42.420> really

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
at the moment where people are really

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.179 
at the moment where people are really
not<00:01:42.869> able<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.229> give<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.500> much<00:01:43.619> perhaps<00:01:43.860> they

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
not able to give as much perhaps they

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.420 
not able to give as much perhaps they
used<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:45.619> what<00:01:46.619> would<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.920> sort<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.220> say<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
used to what would you sort of say to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.069
