00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.770
 Good evening to everyone, the recipe that 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.830
 represents a very simple song today 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.210
 to make easy to do and takes a few 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.620
 Ingredients 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.830
 I will not say it's cheap because 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.560
 today nothing cheaper but is few 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.050
 ingredients in the dough where you can see 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.800
 You're going to have to model and pamphlet 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.900
 but revenue this simple and well accepted 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.269
 you found by finding the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.699
 My blog just access the link in the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.369
 video description goes straight to recipe 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.120
 You can print well so let's go. 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.559
 today's revenue has started the revenue already 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.870
 I put the wheat flour here in the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.340
 bowl 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:49.500
 I'm going to add sugar to margarine now. 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.780
 that can be sexy or jumping makes the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:02.039
 Eggs I'll knock before 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:06.210
 put the baking powder in here and now 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.860
 I'll mix the ingredients well here already 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.930
 I had all the ingredients and stayed 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.270
 so in the form of farofa now I go 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.760
 add in the milk gradually until you reach 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.040
 at a point in the mass so there is no 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.049
 a certain measure of milk depends on the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.570
 you egg size were placed in 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.700
 lose all and duty of the amount 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.290
 emergency you were used 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.869
 so you put it to the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.780
 little bit will stir little show the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.180
 mass point 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.259
 well here I've been adding the milk until 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.140
 give the point 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:46.229
 So the point is this from here when you 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.020
 make a little ball next to it and not in 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.729
 hand looks only this is the point of mass and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.770
 also he can not be hard he has 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.670
 than a dough that is very soft to 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.860
 to move 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.860
 looks like it gets pretty easy medium and 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.920
 now when I have this point here I 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.399
 I add the walnuts to the nuts and I am 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.280
 using acinturada now just add 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.250
 here in the mass 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.010
 now just mix the new ones you have 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.070
 that leaves it is last can not move 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.380
 before the teaching was focus 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.120
 story all mass then talked 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.410
 incorporate right here in the mass and 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.210
 ready but I go here I mixed all the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.610
 our and so was the mass have a 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.360
 little darker and now gets a 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.120
 part of the mass will have to open it 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.680
 now in principle there was a little bit alone 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.990
 a little wheat flour does not 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.760
 It needs to be a lot not only to stay longer 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:52.350
 easy to open a roll 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.350
 now you have to open the cake 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.680
 well here I've seen the whole mass now you 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.500
 It is with such a cup size 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.500
 to prefer doing so circles 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.930
 there after I made all the circles 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.510
 I get a modeler I have you 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.690
 can have any such shape 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.970
 of smaller circle if that 's me I'll get 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:27.100
 this one a modeler I have is 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:29.959
 same here in the middle we this part is 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.709
 from the middle only that part of the middle you are 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:36.380
 I always take advantage of a break up 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.890
 so look how she looks like this 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.459
 plump and then makes the girl so I will 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.600
 do it all like that now 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.400
 here I've done all and making 38 sa 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.100
 units of these large to this 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.730
 small render more 48 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.890
 So now I 'm going to fry and then you're 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.780
 always puts so separate does not place 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.420
 one on top of the other not because it sticks 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.920
 and then it late then 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.040
 always disposes of it the way I did 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.040
 on here 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.519
 well now I'm going to fry 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.610
 I'm going to stay in that electric pot that 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.650
 I have to own the city hall 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.489
 so it turns out fine then 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.769
 also 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.030
 I like it but you can be in 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.460
 any type of pan 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.110
 so when it's hot, it's quick. 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.800
 perfect 'quite well after 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:35.540
 This goal looks only by getting 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.460
 and then you have to come to the side when you 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.320
 this thing and signed up can come 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.320
 to wrap mine here 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.910
 Well here I'm going to take mine, not me. 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.979
 I can leave a lot burned so I 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.210
 I like this thing here but you 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.610
 try to leave a small one as well 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.949
 It needs to taste bad afterwards and 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.300
 now I'll stay the rest 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:03.270
 in a little while our income 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.910
 That worked well here and I already faced everyone 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.250
 who is here and then you can eat 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.770
 so this is how to get past just being 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.300
 here is nice but I like with 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.120
 sugar and cinnamon 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.699
 so I 'll turn with sugar and cinnamon and 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.190
 you when it is affecting you can 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:23.940
 you can trust the time it is affecting so 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:27.330
 has 19 team has been relying more more 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.199
 quick here I already sprinkle with sugar and 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.150
 cinnamon 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:33.110
 I'm going to cut a promotion now, if you 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.110
 communicate inside 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.669
 especially since I like to put 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.030
 because it 's very good 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:48.229
 so it 's very easy to do not have 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:52.050
 You shut down is to make the recipe and 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:56.520
 tasty start and together with a tomava 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.380
 a coffee a chazinho also take from 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.300
 snack is very tasty he 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:05.120
 I hope you can get on 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.120
 home and who likes the recipe even more
