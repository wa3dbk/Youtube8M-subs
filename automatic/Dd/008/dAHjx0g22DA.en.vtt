00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.529
 well we are here now I'll try 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.730
 make answer from the other way it goes 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.440
 and we're filming because he's 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.230
 want to see the engine running sir 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.330
 I'll go there to start the engine and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.330
 how to take a quick fastener to connect 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:43.579
 I will set out the key without accelerating're 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.120
 is this engine the only business he 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.219
 try 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 Talk about putting up difficult engine 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.960
 even it is that it has the retainer of the balls 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.230
 I would have to move because of time 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.379
 When, at the time of the call, a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.979
 smoke but the engine is not perfect 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.640
 low eyes I want to taxi his system 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.850
 the whole was changed the candles were touched 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.530
 with the entire distributor motor part 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.090
 first line material 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.119
 the start was made to zero coil 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:25.250
 carburetor run from the side of a 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.250
 perfect system our journey 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.540
 it's a machine 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.170
 the brand 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.820
 but we 'll try to pass the gas is just 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.650
 See you there how it works 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.940
 he 's in gas because gas 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:02.010
 finished as you can see here in the 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.010
 manometer shows end of gas 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.540
 the year zero has to have the well 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.610
 The button 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.269
 a little bit of gas we'll try 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.510
 spend it pro spend here see if it gives 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.510
 right 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:27.239
 works as follows 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.640
 here an increase to be able to consume 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.530
 carburetor gas 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.379
 so now you can not pass the gas 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.599
 when the truck has gas in the 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.389
 carburetor because there is no risk of mixing 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.989
 gets very rich getting rich she starts 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:48.470
 the escape will not arrive a moment he 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.760
 will fail 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.389
 only failed 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.810
 I passed by now is in the cock returned with 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:03:00.599
 gas does not have a 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.849
 mark at the bottom of the last step and 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.849
 now it is working in case 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.099
 she still gives a little fairy a 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.099
 mix does not get very rich but it's 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.590
 It is already working cattle within 15 in 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.030
 drowner who gives the right 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.940
 butterfly 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:30.730
 tÃ¡ is gas soon will end this 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.890
 small engine failure due to the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.890
 gasoline in the west 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:40.360
 carburetor with gas 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:43.540
 Ideally, it should only be in the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.900
 gas system in no gasoline 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.900
 OK
