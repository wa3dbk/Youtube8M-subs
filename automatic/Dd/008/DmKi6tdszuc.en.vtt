00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
in terms of aesthetic is completely

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.609 
in terms of aesthetic is completely
different<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.960> how<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.200> design<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
different and this is how we design the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.550 
different and this is how we design the
path<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.130> how<00:01:41.460> he<00:01:41.520> treated<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.259> wood<00:01:43.259> stock

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
path and how he treated that wood stock

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.530 
path and how he treated that wood stock
of<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.100> auto<00:01:44.369> loosely<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.090> when<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.390> talk

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
of the auto loosely so when we talk

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.679 
of the auto loosely so when we talk
about<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.869> form<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.710> get<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.850> main<00:01:48.060> features

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
about the form you get the main features

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.440 
about the form you get the main features
obviously<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.920> dome-shaped<00:01:50.450> sapphire

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
obviously if the dome-shaped sapphire

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.620 
obviously if the dome-shaped sapphire
crystal<00:01:52.070> it's<00:01:53.070> not<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.430> slightly<00:01:54.420> domed

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
crystal it's not like slightly domed

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.300 
crystal it's not like slightly domed
like<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.079> could<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.619> pass<00:01:55.860> washers

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
like you could see it in pass washers

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.310 
like you could see it in pass washers
it's<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.299> Duomo<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.750> Florence

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
it's like in Duomo in Florence

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
it's like in Duomo in Florence
ference<00:01:59.399> in<00:02:00.290> San<00:02:01.290> Sophia<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.710> Istanbul<00:02:02.130> this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
ference in San Sophia in Istanbul this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.899 
ference in San Sophia in Istanbul this
is<00:02:02.460> exactly<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.969> kind<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
is exactly the kind of

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.559 
is exactly the kind of
integrated<00:02:04.689> so<00:02:04.899> you<00:02:05.320> get<00:02:05.469> this<00:02:05.829> huge<00:02:06.569> sapphire

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
integrated so you get this huge sapphire

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.050 
integrated so you get this huge sapphire
crystal<00:02:08.200> on<00:02:08.440> top<00:02:08.500> of<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.009> watch<00:02:09.160> case<00:02:09.190> you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
crystal on top of the watch case you

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.420 
crystal on top of the watch case you
don't<00:02:10.269> really<00:02:10.780> know<00:02:11.019> where<00:02:11.379> your<00:02:11.739> watch<00:02:12.040> to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
don't really know where your watch to

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.070 
don't really know where your watch to
