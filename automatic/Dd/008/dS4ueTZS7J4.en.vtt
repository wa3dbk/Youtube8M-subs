if<00:00:00.900> a<00:00:01.079> four<00:00:01.350> five-foot<00:00:02.070> pike<00:00:02.310> can<00:00:02.550> eat

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
if a four five-foot pike can eat

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.730 
if a four five-foot pike can eat
waterfowl<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.240> mammals<00:00:03.780> it<00:00:04.170> seems<00:00:04.529> logical

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
waterfowl and mammals it seems logical

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.780 
waterfowl and mammals it seems logical
that<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.220> 12-footer<00:00:05.910> could<00:00:06.509> be<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.720> maneater<00:00:07.790> so

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
that a 12-footer could be a maneater so

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.890 
that a 12-footer could be a maneater so
what<00:00:08.940> I've<00:00:09.030> got<00:00:09.059> here<00:00:09.210> I've<00:00:09.480> got<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.630> lure

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
what I've got here I've got a lure

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.959 
what I've got here I've got a lure
that's<00:00:10.170> sending<00:00:10.800> out<00:00:11.070> very<00:00:11.429> very<00:00:11.490> strong

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
that's sending out very very strong

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.860 
that's sending out very very strong
signals<00:00:12.450> it's<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.469> very<00:00:13.799> bright<00:00:14.490> flash<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.240> a

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
signals it's a very bright flash and a

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.950 
signals it's a very bright flash and a
very<00:00:16.080> strong<00:00:16.500> vibrating<00:00:17.369> frog<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.750> guess

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
very strong vibrating frog and I guess

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.269 
very strong vibrating frog and I guess
actually<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.650> was<00:00:19.800> probably<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.250> was

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
actually that was probably what was

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.560 
actually that was probably what was
happening<00:00:20.640> when<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.820> fish<00:00:21.119> went<00:00:21.330> for<00:00:21.449> that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
happening when that fish went for that

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.170 
happening when that fish went for that

predator you can really see here these

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.830 
predator you can really see here these
sighting<00:01:26.439> grooves<00:01:26.830> sort<00:01:27.820> of<00:01:27.880> converging<00:01:28.630> on

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
sighting grooves sort of converging on

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.990 
sighting grooves sort of converging on
the<00:01:29.409> prey<00:01:29.619> here<00:01:29.950> so<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.280> bit<00:01:30.490> like<00:01:30.610> sighting

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
the prey here so a bit like sighting

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.020 
the prey here so a bit like sighting
grooves<00:01:31.240> on<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.420> on<00:01:31.689> a<00:01:31.750> rifle<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.950> they<00:01:33.790> can

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
grooves on a on a rifle and they can

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.390 
grooves on a on a rifle and they can
just<00:01:34.300> judge<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.320> distance<00:01:35.620> to<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:35.950> prey<00:01:36.190> and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
just judge the distance to the prey and

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.670 
just judge the distance to the prey and
they're<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:37.540> wonderfully<00:01:37.960> camouflaged<00:01:38.410> here

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
they're so wonderfully camouflaged here

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.710 
they're so wonderfully camouflaged here
just<00:01:38.890> blending<00:01:39.190> into<00:01:39.310> we'd<00:01:39.580> very<00:01:40.480> long

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
just blending into we'd very long

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.720 
just blending into we'd very long
streamlined<00:01:41.380> shape<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:41.950> then<00:01:42.220> you've<00:01:42.490> got

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
streamlined shape and then you've got

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.610 
streamlined shape and then you've got
the<00:01:42.940> dorsal<00:01:43.870> fin<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.080> right<00:01:44.290> at<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.470> back<00:01:44.590> of

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
the dorsal fin and right at the back of

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.140 
the dorsal fin and right at the back of
the<00:01:44.770> body<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.220> you've<00:01:45.340> got<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.460> big<00:01:45.670> propulsion

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
the body so you've got a big propulsion

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.750 
the body so you've got a big propulsion
unit<00:01:46.450> soon<00:01:47.140> as<00:01:47.230> that<00:01:47.380> prey<00:01:47.680> comes<00:01:48.550> within

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
unit soon as that prey comes within

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.510 
unit soon as that prey comes within
range<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:49.750> lunges<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.590> once<00:01:51.190> it's<00:01:51.340> in<00:01:51.430> those

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
range it lunges and once it's in those

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.340 
range it lunges and once it's in those
teeth<00:01:51.820> there's<00:01:52.210> just<00:01:52.450> no<00:01:52.750> getting<00:01:52.930> away<00:01:53.170> so

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
teeth there's just no getting away so

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.030 
teeth there's just no getting away so
just<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:54.010> perfect<00:01:54.640> predator<00:01:55.360> this<00:01:55.840> fish

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.740 

say<00:02:01.040> that<00:02:01.280> if<00:02:01.369> that<00:02:01.549> if<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:01.880> actually<00:02:02.030> see<00:02:02.509> one

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
say that if that if you actually see one

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.870 
say that if that if you actually see one
of<00:02:02.869> these<00:02:03.020> big<00:02:03.229> fish<00:02:03.470> is<00:02:03.649> actually<00:02:04.040> it's<00:02:04.700> like

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
of these big fish is actually it's like
