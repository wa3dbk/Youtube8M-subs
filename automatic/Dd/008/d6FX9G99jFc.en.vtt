00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
then this one is not absolutely

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.910 
then this one is not absolutely
necessary<00:00:31.189> but<00:00:32.140> for<00:00:33.140> me<00:00:33.230> it<00:00:33.380> is<00:00:33.500> it's<00:00:33.829> just

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
this and this gives me another 25 feet

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.549 
this and this gives me another 25 feet
to<00:00:46.489> go<00:00:46.910> from<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.359> center<00:00:47.539> of<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.750> stage<00:00:47.989> over

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
to go from the center of the stage over

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.349 
to go from the center of the stage over
to<00:00:48.829> the<00:00:49.429> side<00:00:49.640> of<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.789> stage<00:00:50.030> where<00:00:50.269> the

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
to the side of the stage where the

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.930 
to the side of the stage where the
computer<00:00:50.839> will<00:00:51.559> now<00:00:51.829> reside<00:00:54.699> okay<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:55.760> the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
computer will now reside okay so the

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.340 
computer will now reside okay so the
first<00:00:56.179> step<00:00:56.480> is<00:00:57.219> to<00:00:58.219> create<00:00:58.660> or<00:00:59.660> to<00:00:59.839> jailbreak

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
first step is to create or to jailbreak

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.349 
first step is to create or to jailbreak
your<00:01:00.379> iPad<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:01.429> I'm<00:01:01.670> not<00:01:01.820> going<00:01:01.969> to<00:01:02.030> provide<00:01:02.300> a

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
tutorial on that because there are many

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.700 
tutorial on that because there are many
much<00:01:05.239> better<00:01:05.480> tutorials<00:01:06.050> out<00:01:06.200> there<00:01:06.409> already

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
much better tutorials out there already

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.360 
much better tutorials out there already
but<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:07.520> used<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.660> program<00:01:08.900> absinthe<00:01:09.590> 2.0

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
but I used the program absinthe 2.0

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.550 
but I used the program absinthe 2.0
which<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.760> free<00:01:10.940> program<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.660> you<00:01:12.260> want<00:01:12.410> to

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
which is a free program and you want to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.050 
which is a free program and you want to
make<00:01:12.740> sure<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:13.460> follow<00:01:13.790> their

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
iTunes first because it does involve

trial<00:02:19.660> period<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.350> my<00:02:20.500> way<00:02:20.710> app<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.310> you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
trial period for the my way app so you

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.770 
trial period for the my way app so you
can<00:02:23.610> try<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.640> out<00:02:24.760> for<00:02:24.970> yourself<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.480> make<00:02:25.600> sure

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
can try it out for yourself to make sure

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.450 
can try it out for yourself to make sure
this<00:02:25.930> technique<00:02:26.380> works<00:02:26.650> for<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.280> your

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
this technique works for you and your

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.710 
this technique works for you and your
setup<00:02:27.820> but<00:02:29.970> you'll<00:02:30.970> probably<00:02:31.180> want<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.480> buy<00:02:31.660> it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
setup but you'll probably want to buy it

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.410 
setup but you'll probably want to buy it
once<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.290> find<00:02:32.710> that<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:33.370> works<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.820> when<00:02:34.390> I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
once you find that it works and when I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.300 
once you find that it works and when I
bought<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.870> was<00:02:34.900> 1999<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:35.980> unless<00:02:36.190> the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
bought it it was 1999 so unless the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.100 
bought it it was 1999 so unless the
price<00:02:36.520> has<00:02:36.670> changed<00:02:37.150> that's<00:02:37.750> what<00:02:37.960> you're

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
price has changed that's what you're

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.730 
price has changed that's what you're
looking<00:02:38.380> at<00:02:38.500> here<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:41.170> I'm<00:02:41.560> going<00:02:41.680> to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.440 
looking at here so this I'm going to
using<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:42.160> for<00:02:42.490> exactly<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.060> intended

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.650 
using this for exactly the intended
purpose<00:02:43.660> but<00:02:44.110> kind<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:45.700> what<00:02:46.390> we'll<00:02:46.510> do

is you see here there's an option for

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.080 
is you see here there's an option for

your<00:04:33.640> USB<00:04:33.970> cable<00:04:34.330> hooked<00:04:35.050> up<00:04:35.290> then<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:36.310> want

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
your USB cable hooked up then you want

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.340 
your USB cable hooked up then you want
to<00:04:36.640> open<00:04:36.760> up<00:04:37.060> audio<00:04:37.540> MIDI<00:04:37.810> setup<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:40.330> then<00:04:41.170> go

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
to open up audio MIDI setup and then go

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.990 
to open up audio MIDI setup and then go
into<00:04:41.470> network<00:04:41.890> now<00:04:42.070> this<00:04:42.190> is<00:04:42.310> very<00:04:42.520> similar<00:04:42.820> to

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
into network now this is very similar to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.830 
into network now this is very similar to
my<00:04:43.480> last<00:04:43.690> video<00:04:43.990> that<00:04:44.170> showed<00:04:44.380> how<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:45.840> connect

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
my last video that showed how to connect

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.960 
my last video that showed how to connect
the<00:04:47.290> sound<00:04:47.440> prism<00:04:47.860> map<00:04:48.010> to<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.340> micro<00:04:48.670> chord

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
the sound prism map to the micro chord

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.790 
the sound prism map to the micro chord
and<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:49.840> just<00:04:50.020> want<00:04:50.230> to<00:04:50.290> make<00:04:50.440> sure<00:04:50.650> that

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
and so you just want to make sure that

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.910 
and so you just want to make sure that
that<00:04:51.150> your<00:04:52.150> iPad<00:04:53.140> should<00:04:53.380> show<00:04:53.560> up<00:04:53.680> there<00:04:53.890> in

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
that your iPad should show up there in

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.580 
that your iPad should show up there in
the<00:04:54.040> directory<00:04:54.960> then<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.020> should<00:04:56.170> be<00:04:56.320> able<00:04:56.470> to

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
the directory then you should be able to

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.010 
the directory then you should be able to
connect<00:04:56.950> and<00:04:57.340> then<00:04:58.150> you<00:04:58.240> have<00:04:58.420> participants

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
connect and then you have participants

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.980 
connect and then you have participants
over<00:04:59.410> here<00:04:59.680> showing<00:05:00.040> that<00:05:00.160> your<00:05:01.120> iPad<00:05:01.690> is

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
over here showing that your iPad is

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.690 
over here showing that your iPad is
connected<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:02.890> have<00:05:03.040> your<00:05:03.190> local<00:05:03.370> name

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
connected and you have your local name

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.080 
connected and you have your local name
here<00:05:04.150> right<00:05:05.400> so<00:05:06.400> let's<00:05:06.550> just<00:05:06.760> give<00:05:06.880> that<00:05:07.060> a

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
here right so let's just give that a

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.470 
here right so let's just give that a
quick<00:05:07.240> test<00:05:07.720> and<00:05:08.340> so<00:05:09.340> let's<00:05:09.490> say<00:05:09.670> we<00:05:09.880> want<00:05:10.120> our

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
quick test and so let's say we want our

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.710 
quick test and so let's say we want our
many<00:05:11.080> from<00:05:11.410> Ableton<00:05:11.850> to<00:05:12.850> go<00:05:13.030> to<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.360> network

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
many from Ableton to go to the network

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.260 
many from Ableton to go to the network
poly<00:05:14.050> chord<00:05:14.470> now<00:05:15.250> channels<00:05:15.640> are<00:05:15.760> important

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
poly chord now channels are important

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.010 
poly chord now channels are important
and<00:05:16.420> like<00:05:16.630> I<00:05:16.750> said<00:05:16.810> I<00:05:18.300> have<00:05:19.300> been<00:05:19.450> using<00:05:19.660> this

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
and like I said I have been using this

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.280 
and like I said I have been using this
MIDI<00:05:20.950> cyntha<00:05:21.460> which<00:05:21.790> is<00:05:21.970> very<00:05:22.690> simple<00:05:23.140> but

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
MIDI cyntha which is very simple but

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.970 
MIDI cyntha which is very simple but
very<00:05:23.350> very<00:05:24.130> nice<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.430> straightforward

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
very very nice and straightforward

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.260 
very very nice and straightforward
traveling<00:05:26.980> there

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.230 

okay<00:05:33.009> and<00:05:34.009> we'll<00:05:34.190> go<00:05:34.310> over<00:05:34.400> to<00:05:34.520> system<00:05:34.940> and

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
okay and we'll go over to system and

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.710 
okay and we'll go over to system and
MIDI<00:05:36.050> and<00:05:36.259> just<00:05:36.590> make<00:05:36.800> sure<00:05:36.830> that<00:05:37.539> we<00:05:38.539> know

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
MIDI and just make sure that we know

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.870 
MIDI and just make sure that we know
what<00:05:38.960> channel<00:05:39.320> that<00:05:39.710> MIDI<00:05:40.039> is<00:05:40.220> receiving

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
what channel that MIDI is receiving

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.390 
what channel that MIDI is receiving
there<00:05:41.120> so<00:05:41.449> it<00:05:41.630> says<00:05:41.840> channel<00:05:42.110> seven<00:05:42.590> it's<00:05:43.190> over

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
there so it says channel seven it's over

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.159 
there so it says channel seven it's over
here<00:05:43.550> on<00:05:43.669> Ableton<00:05:44.150> we'll<00:05:44.570> go<00:05:44.690> over<00:05:44.750> to<00:05:44.870> Channel

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
here on Ableton we'll go over to Channel

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.730 
here on Ableton we'll go over to Channel
seven<00:05:45.199> and<00:05:46.160> give<00:05:46.699> it<00:05:46.789> a<00:05:46.850> test<00:05:50.530> so<00:05:51.530> that

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
seven and give it a test so that

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.460 
seven and give it a test so that
connection<00:05:52.009> is<00:05:52.340> solid<00:05:52.759> and<00:05:53.000> working

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
connection is solid and working

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.880 
connection is solid and working
so<00:05:56.470> let's<00:05:56.680> say<00:05:56.830> we<00:05:56.980> also<00:05:57.130> want<00:05:57.580> to<00:05:58.290> utilize<00:05:59.290> a

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
so let's say we also want to utilize a

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:17.070 
so let's say we also want to utilize a
touch<00:06:00.250> osc<00:06:00.760> connection<00:06:01.270> as<00:06:01.420> well<00:06:15.990> sorry<00:06:16.990> if

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
touch osc connection as well sorry if

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.580 
touch osc connection as well sorry if
that's<00:06:17.170> a<00:06:17.320> little<00:06:17.470> annoying<00:06:17.830> but<00:06:19.470> we'll<00:06:20.470> just

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
that's a little annoying but we'll just

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:28.320 
that's a little annoying but we'll just
open<00:06:20.710> up<00:06:20.920> live<00:06:21.160> control<00:06:26.850> and<00:06:27.850> I'm<00:06:28.060> gonna<00:06:28.210> make

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
open up live control and I'm gonna make

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:38.460 
open up live control and I'm gonna make
sure<00:06:28.360> we<00:06:28.600> open<00:06:28.870> up<00:06:28.960> touch<00:06:29.260> osc<00:06:29.830> here<00:06:34.050> okay<00:06:37.470> and

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
sure we open up touch osc here okay and

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.210 
sure we open up touch osc here okay and
then<00:06:38.560> we<00:06:38.650> have<00:06:38.800> our<00:06:38.980> host<00:06:39.190> their<00:06:39.520> live<00:06:39.790> control

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
then we have our host their live control

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:47.660 
then we have our host their live control
and<00:06:42.220> we're<00:06:42.370> done<00:06:42.610> whoops<00:06:45.030> sorry<00:06:46.030> about<00:06:46.330> that

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670 
and we're done whoops sorry about that

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.400 
and we're done whoops sorry about that
and<00:06:50.280> so<00:06:51.280> as<00:06:51.370> you<00:06:51.460> can<00:06:51.520> see<00:06:51.850> we<00:06:52.180> now<00:06:52.570> have<00:06:52.810> an<00:06:52.930> OSC

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.410 
and so as you can see we now have an OSC

00:06:53.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
and so as you can see we now have an OSC
connection<00:06:53.950> as<00:06:54.850> well

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.510 

so<00:07:11.430> I'm<00:07:11.580> controlling<00:07:11.940> Ableton<00:07:12.630> from<00:07:12.930> the<00:07:13.050> iPad

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
so I'm controlling Ableton from the iPad

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.820 
so I'm controlling Ableton from the iPad
Ableton<00:07:14.520> is<00:07:14.700> controlling<00:07:15.390> the<00:07:15.810> analog<00:07:16.260> synth

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
Ableton is controlling the analog synth

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.690 
Ableton is controlling the analog synth
mini<00:07:17.700> app<00:07:17.970> so<00:07:18.690> it's<00:07:18.900> achieved<00:07:19.590> both<00:07:19.860> an<00:07:20.070> OSC

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700 
mini app so it's achieved both an OSC

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.330 
mini app so it's achieved both an OSC
and<00:07:20.910> a<00:07:21.270> MIDI<00:07:21.480> connection<00:07:22.110> through<00:07:22.710> a<00:07:22.740> secure

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 
and a MIDI connection through a secure

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.380 
and a MIDI connection through a secure
wired<00:07:24.120> connection<00:07:24.990> and<00:07:25.230> so<00:07:25.910> if<00:07:26.910> you<00:07:27.030> find<00:07:27.210> an

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.390 
wired connection and so if you find an

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.120 
wired connection and so if you find an
easier<00:07:27.780> cheaper<00:07:28.020> way<00:07:28.350> of<00:07:28.470> doing<00:07:28.770> this<00:07:28.920> I'd

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.130 
easier cheaper way of doing this I'd

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.260 
easier cheaper way of doing this I'd
love<00:07:29.370> to<00:07:29.520> know<00:07:29.700> about<00:07:29.730> it<00:07:30.030> but<00:07:32.060> this<00:07:33.060> is

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.270 
love to know about it but this is

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.180 
love to know about it but this is
something<00:07:33.480> that<00:07:34.020> I<00:07:34.320> think<00:07:34.470> really<00:07:35.010> worked

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.190 
something that I think really worked

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.920 
something that I think really worked
well<00:07:35.430> I've<00:07:35.640> done<00:07:35.790> quite<00:07:36.150> a<00:07:36.210> few<00:07:36.270> extended

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:36.930 
well I've done quite a few extended

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.750 
well I've done quite a few extended
practice<00:07:37.380> sessions<00:07:37.800> with<00:07:38.070> this<00:07:38.280> technique

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:38.760 
practice sessions with this technique

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.830 
practice sessions with this technique
and<00:07:39.230> I<00:07:40.230> found<00:07:41.220> there<00:07:41.490> are<00:07:41.520> no<00:07:42.090> connectivity
