00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
upgrading a lot of the equipment some of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
upgrading a lot of the equipment some of
the<00:01:15.030> equipment<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.900> room<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the equipment in this room as the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
the equipment in this room as the
teacher<00:01:17.280> has<00:01:17.549> said<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.880> older<00:01:18.150> than<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.450> am

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
teacher has said is older than I am

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.870 
teacher has said is older than I am
which<00:01:19.259> means<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.920> was<00:01:20.070> probably<00:01:20.580> built

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
which means that it was probably built

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.800 
which means that it was probably built
in<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.509> 30s<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.770> he<00:01:22.890> estimates<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
in the 30s is what he estimates so it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.060 
in the 30s is what he estimates so it
would<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:25.020> nice<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.500> some<00:01:25.560> modern

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
would be nice to have some modern

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.289 
would be nice to have some modern
equipment<00:01:26.520> we're<00:01:26.820> currently<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
equipment we're currently in the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.899 
equipment we're currently in the
agriculture<00:01:27.869> classroom<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:29.369> also<00:01:29.549> quite<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
agriculture classroom it's also quite a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.510 
agriculture classroom it's also quite a
classroom<00:01:30.450> end<00:01:30.659> or<00:01:30.810> shop<00:01:31.140> again<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.310> would

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
classroom end or shop again this would

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.850 
classroom end or shop again this would
be<00:01:32.700> linked<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.329> other<00:01:33.659> two<00:01:34.020> classrooms

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
be linked to the other two classrooms

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.039 
be linked to the other two classrooms
such<00:01:35.040> as<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> woods<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.909> metals<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
such as the woods and metals so that the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.510 
such as the woods and metals so that the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
teacher could have a classroom for

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.240 
teacher could have a classroom for
application<00:01:39.420> processes<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.320> then<00:01:40.950> after

application processes and then after

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.340 
application processes and then after
that<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.909> students<00:01:42.420> would<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.689> an<00:01:42.810> area<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
that the students would have an area to
