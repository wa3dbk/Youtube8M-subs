over again and I don't know where the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.630 
over again and I don't know where the
genesis<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> idea<00:00:46.590> comes<00:00:46.950> from<00:00:47.039> perhaps

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
genesis of the idea comes from perhaps

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.720 
genesis of the idea comes from perhaps
from<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.120> AD&amp;D<00:00:48.539> Commodore<00:00:49.170> 64<00:00:49.680> game<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.489> was

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
from the AD&amp;D Commodore 64 game it was

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.990 
from the AD&amp;D Commodore 64 game it was
far<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.680> only<00:00:52.860> thing<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.399> possibly<00:00:53.910> think

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
far the only thing I can possibly think

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.720 
far the only thing I can possibly think
that<00:00:54.440> perhaps<00:00:55.440> produce<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.640> blight<00:00:57.120> of

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
that perhaps produce this blight of

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.549 
that perhaps produce this blight of
senselessness<00:00:59.730> upon<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.719> RPG<00:01:01.199> world<00:01:01.410> I've
