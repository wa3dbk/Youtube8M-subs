00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
hammer editor and it's basically just

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.420 
hammer editor and it's basically just
one<00:00:20.160> big<00:00:20.220> box<00:00:20.759> and<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:22.470> each<00:00:22.649> corner<00:00:22.980> there's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
guess you could say each one have the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.700 
guess you could say each one have the
same<00:00:32.579> weapons<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.690> different<00:00:33.870> spots<00:00:34.320> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
they're all differently arranged this

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:50.340 
they're all differently arranged this
one<00:00:39.000> looks<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.360> this

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.679 

there's<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.009> one<00:01:05.309> pretty<00:01:05.700> much<00:01:05.939> walk<00:01:06.329> around

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
there's this one pretty much walk around

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.399 
there's this one pretty much walk around
to<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> top<00:01:09.200> crossbows<00:01:10.200> there<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
to get to the top crossbows there and

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.440 
to get to the top crossbows there and
RPGs<00:01:13.409> there

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.069

little shack over here and there's

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.770 
little shack over here and there's
should<00:01:27.710> be<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.950> weapon<00:01:28.159> there<00:01:28.490> where<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.210> is<00:01:29.299> I

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
should be a weapon there where it is I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.490 
should be a weapon there where it is I
should<00:01:30.320> be<00:01:30.469> a<00:01:30.500> weapon<00:01:30.829> that<00:01:30.860> oh<00:01:32.229> well<00:01:33.229> as<00:01:33.439> a

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
should be a weapon that oh well as a

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.590 
should be a weapon that oh well as a
health<00:01:34.009> pack<00:01:34.250> which<00:01:34.549> is<00:01:34.759> kind<00:01:35.119> of<00:01:35.179> better<00:01:35.329> than

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
health pack which is kind of better than

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.359 
health pack which is kind of better than
all<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.960> other<00:01:36.140> ones<00:01:36.970> then<00:01:39.159> war<00:01:40.159> in<00:01:40.280> the

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369

Middle in each like middle corner I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.240 
Middle in each like middle corner I
guess<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:43.520> could<00:01:43.670> say<00:01:44.289> inside<00:01:45.289> there's<00:01:45.740> fire

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
middle of those there's stair steps to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.680 
middle of those there's stair steps to
get<00:02:13.099> on<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.340> top<00:02:13.549> of<00:02:13.760> them<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.180> can<00:02:14.329> cross

get on the top of them and you can cross

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.809 
get on the top of them and you can cross
all<00:02:15.019> over<00:02:15.410> these

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.449 

then<00:02:18.909> in<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> middle<00:02:19.420> there's<00:02:20.319> paths<00:02:20.859> to<00:02:21.310> get

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
then in the middle there's paths to get

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.220 
then in the middle there's paths to get

for my first map and if once I make

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.059 
for my first map and if once I make
another<00:02:46.209> map<00:02:46.389> or<00:02:46.540> whatever<00:02:46.780> plan<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:47.799> like

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
another map or whatever plan on like

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.039 
another map or whatever plan on like
looking<00:02:48.459> at<00:02:48.519> some<00:02:48.730> tutorials<00:02:49.359> making<00:02:49.840> like

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
looking at some tutorials making like

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.879 
looking at some tutorials making like
water<00:02:50.969> trees<00:02:51.969> elevators<00:02:52.870> doors<00:02:53.200> ladders

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
water trees elevators doors ladders

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.610 
water trees elevators doors ladders
would<00:02:54.189> ever<00:02:54.370> make<00:02:55.329> it<00:02:55.480> more<00:02:55.599> complex<00:02:56.230> than

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
would ever make it more complex than

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.839 
would ever make it more complex than
this<00:02:56.799> one<00:02:57.099> but<00:02:57.400> my<00:02:59.939> clan<00:03:00.939> that<00:03:01.299> I<00:03:01.359> met<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:02.849> dwell
