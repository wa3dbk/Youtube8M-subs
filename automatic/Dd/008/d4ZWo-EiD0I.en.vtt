00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080
 now you shoot to give such a projection 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:13.019
 project dynamics 24 on proportional 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.849
 control without collector system 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.289
 brushless asynchronous motor 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.619
 there is a servo on the steering redone 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.199
 wheel hub bearings installed 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.359
 back side bearings are here 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:32.460
 data transfer protocol 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:36.300
 fns here's the bing button we have an oboe 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.960
 coming in clear the instrument can be sewn so 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.960
 he glows 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.400
 dashboard light 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.600
 types of communication now from key 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.600
 characters 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.949
 Now the regulator will sing with us 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.120
 under the hood, too, all saved 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:04.920
 absolutely untouched 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.920
 to ride on 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.760
 milk normalek 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.540
 when it seems 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.670
 all 11 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.670
 may need 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.690
 you said a couple 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.510
 meaning is behind you 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.980
 So 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.440
 thank 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.230
 By that time the little ring we will start to do 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.230
 repair all focus separately 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.319
 project dynamics 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.970
 true la league affiliate further 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.130
 looking at us. 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.320
 believe or 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.320
 see bathroom 1 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.420
 model rockets are cut 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.030
 but 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.390
 the evil of creating online 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.500
 go through 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.240
 OK . - 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.229
 planet 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.229
 you 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.460
 hardly ever needed 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.780
 as if to you case that is any paw 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.190
 when i have my equipment 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:05.840
 can and hem bing button here it is 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:08.150
 displayed on the bottom was so imperceptible that 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.890
 you can bind any of your own 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.050
 hardware 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.470
 which one will like our transfer protocol 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.470
 data 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.689
 a photo 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.929
 need 1 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:05.929
 Where 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.770
 fireman 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.770
 whether 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.320
 I 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:22.469
 cap which battery 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.469
 to lead 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.610
 along 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:40.599
 such a project dynamics dynamics 24 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.599
 project 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:48.890
 moon's not warmed up had not even though 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:52.780
 It is without a collector nickname even Gazman OS 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.780
 Well, in general, something like this
