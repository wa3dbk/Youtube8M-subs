00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.940
 kimberly people have questioned a lot 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.650
 the section of questions that is asked to 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.440
 the candidates of the miss republic 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.990
 Dominican because of the answers that 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.750
 the candidates give at that moment that you 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.970
 would you say to those people look at me 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.949
 I understand that it is much easier to judge 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.050
 behind what happens we are 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.820
 all women regardless of the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.949
 beauty that we have smart 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.169
 prepared and professionals that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.790
 we work for three months giving what 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.250
 best of us and preparing in a 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.920
 week we submit to countless 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.980
 activities and work without salaries and 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.680
 efforts for these lists of them and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.590
 ready for you 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.900
 we are also human beings who 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.420
 We mistake that we feel means and that 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:55.540
 we feel emotions at a given moment 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.540
 that night this whole number comes together 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.890
 in you that we are representatives of the one 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.660
 brief we arrived the Dominican and that 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.300
 we have to be well prepared but 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.650
 really at that moment anyone does not 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.979
 only to us anyone is 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.180
 Can Xavier be a question? 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.190
 exchange words like a forum that 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.110
 it happened to me that I apologize to the people 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.910
 Dominican but it was more than nerves 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.220
 the excitement of arriving at five 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.410
 finalists 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.750
 the one that each comes in to this 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.910
 type of contest does it with a dream and 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.640
 give all the best of himself or she is 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.560
 normal that as human beings or 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.020
 we just let ourselves be carried away by the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.150
 emotions as it happened to me I understand that 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.390
 you can not simply cross us out for a 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.220
 Question 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.110
 and all the work the effort that we have 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.540
 fact they are recorded and simply 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.850
 focus on something that any being 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.700
 human in social networks many 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.770
 people have even commented on the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.060
 proposed that the section be eliminated 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.060
 of questions I would agree 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.280
 not because that with the questions the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.560
 people have the facility to listen 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.409
 that maybe I take games maybe like you 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.789
 I said of the public also simply 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.500
 I understand that they say a little more 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.920
 tolerant to understand that there are countless 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.920
 of factors 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.980
 and of things that influence tonight and that 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.599
 today we are girls are not drivers is the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.610
 first time we face an audience 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.860
 so great above all all of our 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.390
 relatives and a panel of judges that 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.370
 is pending to every detail of 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.470
 we already have to be aware 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.299
 to countless things and really 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.720
 just be a little more tolerant 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:34.060
 of maybe a little bit the trajectory of 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.079
 us and so you realize and you can 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.799
 judge more than by one in the case of 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:44.410
 production has already been much commented that 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.950
 you had a lot of mistakes in the 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.720
 moment of the event show 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.609
 they realized those errors that the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.290
 people could perceive in the transmission of 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.290
 television and everything exactly 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.060
 half is really we are 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.200
 and they have a team of professionals 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.879
 from us 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.550
 that we really did not realize 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.220
 nothing of that me after that in the 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.450
 Olave contest took me the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.190
 organization 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.860
 and we begin the preparations the 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.690
 interviews and Monday afternoon is 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.640
 because I realized and listening 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.440
 really we none of us 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.120

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.220
 another day they were writing me and 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.790
 talking and then why do I
