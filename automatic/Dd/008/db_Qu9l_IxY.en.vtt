like an arrow once you fired it it went

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.290 
like an arrow once you fired it it went
in<00:02:57.349> one<00:02:57.530> direction<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.580> one<00:02:58.879> second<00:02:59.239> on

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
in one direction so that one second on

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.150 
in one direction so that one second on
the<00:02:59.420> earth<00:02:59.540> was<00:02:59.900> one<00:03:00.140> second<00:03:00.500> on<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.650> moon<00:03:00.830> was

the earth was one second on the moon was

the earth was one second on the moon was
one<00:03:01.370> second<00:03:01.879> on<00:03:01.970> Jupiter<00:03:02.510> time<00:03:03.290> beat

then<00:03:06.650> along<00:03:06.920> comes<00:03:07.160> Einstein<00:03:07.760> who<00:03:08.120> says<00:03:08.330> not

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
then along comes Einstein who says not

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.860 
then along comes Einstein who says not
so<00:03:08.690> fast<00:03:08.900> not<00:03:09.709> so<00:03:09.950> fast<00:03:10.209> time<00:03:11.209> is<00:03:11.239> like<00:03:11.599> a<00:03:11.810> river

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
so fast not so fast time is like a river

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.800 
so fast not so fast time is like a river
a<00:03:12.530> meandering<00:03:13.489> river<00:03:13.760> that<00:03:14.090> meanders<00:03:14.569> are<00:03:14.720> on

stars and galaxies speeds up and slows
down<00:03:18.310> now<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:20.120> new<00:03:20.390> wrinkle<00:03:20.959> in<00:03:21.019> all<00:03:21.200> this<00:03:21.440> is

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
down now the new wrinkle in all this is

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.789 
down now the new wrinkle in all this is
that<00:03:22.190> we<00:03:22.580> physicists<00:03:23.000> believe<00:03:23.569> that<00:03:23.799> the

that we physicists believe that the

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.270 
that we physicists believe that the
river<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.310> time<00:03:25.610> may<00:03:26.000> have<00:03:26.080> whirlpools<00:03:27.280> the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
rivers time as a dimension but it's so

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.180 
rivers time as a dimension but it's so
