 Defense is too needle rise was I'm perfect or trying to ne etc. stomach a little longer 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.390

 3 Volunch from the right 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.350
 Such a capture ability is high, but there is a place where you dribble with your needle and go up too much 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.460
 I will 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.830
