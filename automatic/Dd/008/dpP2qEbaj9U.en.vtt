 patient and we want her 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.329
 the seminars concerts have already realized it also bull of this one 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.419
 they fear just as they endorse that they come here

 I'm going to do I want to see for example optimization through the reports 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.889
 theater ago click here 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.869

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:41.869
 age or click on watch now 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:47.759
 I get another screen contaminate that information and duration 43 minutes 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.759
 I tell him to play click on the button 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.029
 and here he will not ask us to register 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:58.029
 of her because the pse-ee had previously done 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.879
 here I will return 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:07.349
 here is important to ask 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.720
 mckee introduce the code and that you have in fact account 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.089
 junqueras 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:16.340
 If you still do not have an account in Cuba and LatBus 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.049
 you can avila 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.319
 you can open it simply not the orange activities to the point of 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:23.770
 what 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.849
 from that received your colic idea that they are code 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:29.330
 10 digits 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.340
 who will know 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.379
 here on the right here is mine 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.819
 and of customer 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.819
 I copy the room frame copy 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.080
 enter this box 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.059
 and that's it 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.849
 even though 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.079
 then a scholarship filled everything can something simply 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.880
 and the current position 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.880
 in day 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.169
 and here, then 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.159
 inma start downloading c what I do good plane 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:09.319
 in thermal has been quite fast because I had done it before 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.319
 and well, here you will receive 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.439
 na information 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.439
 Miguel about the topic you have selected 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.559
 I'm going to stop a moment so they do not bother you feel that 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.479
 this type of 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.710
 this type of webinar and 2 seminars 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.729
 this accumulation of information is really not going to produce any 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.839
 income if you have a business on the internet 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:44.949
 Per hundred what I do if it serves as advice while I say what I assume and 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.029
 binaries 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:51.200
 well, other activities that produce income as it can be 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.490
 ossa generation of traffic 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.780
 they have less in my case because maybe 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.780
 percent write comments on other products like 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.650
 or wrote some articles in it 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:06.000
 I do not know always 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.900
 to today's bread when you do a hundred when you are learning how you can 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.520
 in this case the seminar you can 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.849
 hear while doing other tasks that cite Havana 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.969
 generate income 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:22.949
 Basque mining one thing with the other that the council votes 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.550
 again more because I really did not state that tension 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.159
 when there is a plot and 3 and 4 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.020
 me then even next week 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.310
 but it is important that we know that having an internet business 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:40.399
 will not grow for the simple fact that we are experts in google has 

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:44.909
 exposed in theory yes do not put it into practice 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.460
 and that's why, maybe also that they fly because they have 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.060
 In order to access this type of seminars, he has asked you to open your 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.499
 google account tries to break that code 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:04.120
 Well, I hope that this advice, because they sign a pity and we are scared 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.800
 we see 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.060
 in the next 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.350
 charo
