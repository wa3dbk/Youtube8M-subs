00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 all youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.130
 new technology builds your video I owe 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.940
 you have a video about the new ones 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.400
 features of android 4.3 jelly bean 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.790
 We're doing that here on the nexus 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.529
 7 not white is so nice big but 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.460
 because you have the one particular function 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.710
 can show 4.3 so there was something on it 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.890
 it's new in the update description because 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.779
 directly mentioned the new google tip 1 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.760
 notes system 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.669
 Well, who needs I use 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.219
 probably continue to evernote or 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:41.610
 wunderlist then we get opengl 3.0 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.309
 So more graphic language for better 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.960
 to make graphics well I doubt times 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.510
 that again from not much 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.850
 will also see a bluetooth update 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.530
 There were text ads for now 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.079
 for bluetooth headphones 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.309
 Of course that's nice as well as new 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.469
 bluetooth smart low energy after that is 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.390
 just behind the scenes you can tell 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.479
 not really what we know about 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.760
 What's new is the new camera app who 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.650
 she was not worried before hello 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.810
 He has gotten it with the new one now 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.619
 keep the menu pressed and then simply 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.939
 high through the different options 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.460
 Hop this then gives and then easy 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:26.009
 back down again to come back 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.420
 that's what we have then then is me 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.770
 I also noticed that, too 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.070
 first read if you do not quite 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.759
 sure the font is the same 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.860
 a little bit slimmed down so 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.640
 if you have more than one device, you can 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.579
 look if he noticed something there but so 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.280
 to the main update for many android 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.040
 Tablet owners are now in the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.740
 location we have the users you could yes 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.110
 also create a profile earlier 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.390
 or share the tablet second profiles 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.159
 third profile like that and then they could 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.840
 Do everything with the tablet 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.119
 main user could also do 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.229
 but now there are restrictions 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.560
 probably have enough 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.390
 Parents or whatever you say danger 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.470
 my on my tablets and not on 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.110
 everything can 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.900
 that's why google had a look and 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.240
 now has the restricted profiles 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.220
 So you can access it 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.090
 on apps and content on your account 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.870
 restrict 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.690
 so I do not need to set up now 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:32.520
 it is enough if you know that the whole 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.550
 there is still the message that 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.650
 even if you change your wlan around here 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.540
 the short setting will turn it off 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.970
 still slightly active in the background 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.020
 remains unlikely googles 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.550
 card service or your gps service 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.110
 to improve a bit 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.000
 on the one hand you get more 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.010
 information on energy-efficient 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.020
 Information about euro location only 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.700
 about the wlan location on the other 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.270
 google probably benefits 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.820
 about that 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.400
 because it makes them better again 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.959
 Overview of the individual wlans 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.470
 Well, actually everywhere in the world 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.800
 what I have to say but what that 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:15.269
 biggest or biggest advantage of 4.3 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:18.870
 update is the tablet trend as it is 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.750
 is amazing how supple that here 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.760
 everything works again 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.709
 There was a message from enough people 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.110
 or by owning enough tablet or 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.100
 especially nexxo 7 tablet own the 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.190
 have said 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.769
 my nex-7 will be slow over the months 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:40.560
 then there was reports about slow 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:42.269
 battery slow memory or or 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.769
 any apps supposedly in the 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.230
 Background should play crazy 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.440
 but then the first rumors start 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.040
 Was there then what is then but at the end 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.870
 probably just was 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.150
 google has now synonymous with the update 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.230
 trim command introduced ssd disks 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.690
 better performance better 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.100
 maintenance mode installed here then what 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.470
 he wants it again the place next to it 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.650
 is not used because it must by the 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.959
 The system is looking for longer 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.360
 just how to defrag for ssds 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.000
 Otherwise, lee is in the topic 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.410
 trims em and the trim command 1 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.840
 that was updated with now 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.170
 hewn in here and apparently makes 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.420
 again for old and improved 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.380
 performance so I have to say in person 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:36.430
 I have never had such a quick and 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:41.230
 even smoothies nexus 7 is getting better 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.700
 the update on android 4.3 battery runtime 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.890
 I can not do anything right now 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.590
 negative to say I personally think 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:51.340
 it behaves normally as before 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:55.360
 also and yes I think so I am 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.010
 by several innovations at 4.3 are 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.840
 I have not noticed so far 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.730
 there's something else I can give you now 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.390
 can not say with a wipe with 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:07.600
 an additional launcher can you 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.410
 Still the apps right even more targeted 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.160
 restrict 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.450
 it is not yet that google 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.950
 that has unlocked that one 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.590
 can do directly over the setting 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.240
 but how do you google it? 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.920
 it just probably comes then 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.930
 at the next update it will be synonymous 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.090
 directly struck out all free of google 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.430
 that you then stop over the apps 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.350
 setting the apps to 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.710
 for example, expensive access to the internet 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.760
 or to deny your contacts 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.310
 and not just everything 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.980
 but also have to accept the apps 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.390
 could further restrict so that should 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.580
 there have been only once 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.310
 the smartphone falls to me even 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.820
 what is there already found there 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.160
 There are new ips for missed calls 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.740
 or am you a call 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.030
 you get several 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.040
 selection options directly have the sms 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.540
 rauszuhauen as I just can not 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.330
 I call back in five minutes call me 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.470
 in five minutes again or something 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.510
 prefabricated commands but also 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.970
 not yet active which are but 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.700
 apparently already in the system somewhere 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.860
 hide it so it should have been 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.990
 with the innovations of android 4.0 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.460
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.460
 and until the next video
