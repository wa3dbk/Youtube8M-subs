00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.639 
accidentally released a natural texture
pack<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> couple<00:00:36.930> people<00:00:37.170> were<00:00:37.320> able<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
pack so a couple people were able to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.380 
pack so a couple people were able to
download<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.309> probably<00:00:38.820> still<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
download and able to play it while

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.040

others<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.940> course<00:00:42.180> not<00:00:42.570> because<00:00:42.690> they<00:00:42.899> took

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
others of course not because they took

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.470 
others of course not because they took
it<00:00:43.110> down<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:44.000> Microsoft<00:00:45.000> made<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> mistake<00:00:45.450> on

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
it down but Microsoft made a mistake on

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.630 
it down but Microsoft made a mistake on
that<00:00:45.750> by<00:00:46.200> releasing<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.739> natural<00:00:47.370> texture

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that by releasing the natural texture

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.020 
that by releasing the natural texture
pack<00:00:47.789> early<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> wasn't<00:00:49.350> able<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.739> get<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
pack early so I wasn't able to get it to

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.029 
pack early so I wasn't able to get it to

looks<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.699> lot<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.059> sphax<00:01:00.480> which<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.020> think

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
looks a lot like sphax which I think

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.080 
looks a lot like sphax which I think
that<00:01:02.010> was<00:01:02.190> probably<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> number<00:01:03.059> one

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that was probably one of the number one

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.210 
that was probably one of the number one
