00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
call it fanfiction on Wattpad and so

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.150 
call it fanfiction on Wattpad and so
we'll<00:01:35.290> know<00:01:35.410> it<00:01:35.530> from<00:01:35.680> there

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
we'll know it from there

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.020 
we'll know it from there

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
and since I started writing just

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.060 
and since I started writing just
anything<00:01:40.570> I've<00:01:40.720> always<00:01:41.080> wanted<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.470> have<00:01:41.710> a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
anything I've always wanted to have a

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.700 
anything I've always wanted to have a
printed<00:01:43.030> or<00:01:43.119> published<00:01:43.360> just<00:01:43.960> physical<00:01:44.500> copy

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
printed or published just physical copy

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.090 
printed or published just physical copy
paperback<00:01:45.430> copy<00:01:45.700> of<00:01:45.970> my<00:01:46.690> book<00:01:46.899> in<00:01:47.140> my<00:01:47.440> hands

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
paperback copy of my book in my hands

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.340 
paperback copy of my book in my hands
and<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:49.680> managed<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.710> find<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.310> way<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.880> do<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.660> now

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
and I managed to find a way to do it now

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.520 
and I managed to find a way to do it now
this<00:01:53.800> way<00:01:54.070> isn't<00:01:54.940> necessarily<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.869> exact<00:01:56.229> way

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
this way isn't necessarily the exact way

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.359 
this way isn't necessarily the exact way
I<00:01:56.860> can<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.619> print<00:01:59.890> multiple<00:02:00.100> copies

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
I can do it to print multiple copies

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.280 
I can do it to print multiple copies
because<00:02:01.090> it's<00:02:01.240> obviously<00:02:01.600> an<00:02:01.750> expensive

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
because it's obviously an expensive

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.170 
because it's obviously an expensive
process<00:02:02.560> because<00:02:03.399> I<00:02:03.490> know<00:02:03.550> some<00:02:03.880> of<00:02:03.910> you<00:02:04.149> guys

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
process because I know some of you guys

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.410 
process because I know some of you guys
