the<00:01:20.700> game<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.939> course<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:22.140> special<00:01:22.530> attack

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the game of course it's special attack

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.190 
the game of course it's special attack
isn't<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.729> highest<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:24.630> still<00:01:24.900> more

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
isn't the highest but it's still more

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.710 
isn't the highest but it's still more
way<00:01:25.890> more<00:01:25.920> than<00:01:26.340> average<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
way more than average and it's just a

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.330 
way more than average and it's just a
little<00:01:27.900> bit<00:01:27.990> less<00:01:28.140> than<00:01:28.380> physical<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:29.189> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
little bit less than physical like I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.480 
little bit less than physical like I
said<00:01:29.400> earlier<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.770> then<00:01:31.770> there's<00:01:31.950> head<00:01:32.220> smash

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
said earlier and then there's head smash

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.429 
said earlier and then there's head smash
which<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> strong<00:01:33.420> rock<00:01:33.869> type<00:01:34.110> move<00:01:34.259> that

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
which is a strong rock type move that

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.050 
which is a strong rock type move that
does<00:01:34.590> recoil<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.340> guarantee<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> KO

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
does recoil but you can guarantee a KO

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.999 
does recoil but you can guarantee a KO
but<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.810> move<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.409> em<00:01:37.560> boars<00:01:37.799> high

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
attack lastly there's flare blitz flare

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.770 
attack lastly there's flare blitz flare
blitz<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.220> fiscal<00:01:41.670> base<00:01:42.090> move<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.570> does

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
blitz is a fiscal base move that does

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.510 
blitz is a fiscal base move that does
recoil<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.770> has<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> ton<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> power

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
recoil but it has a ton of power

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.370 
recoil but it has a ton of power
especially<00:01:44.790> when<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.240> stabbed<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.750> highly

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
especially when it's stabbed I highly

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.480 
especially when it's stabbed I highly
recommend<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.070> move<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.369> your

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
recommend you have this move on your

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.429 
recommend you have this move on your
emboar<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.659> get<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.990> hole<00:01:49.049> 62

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
emboar if you can get it to the hole 62

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.289 
emboar if you can get it to the hole 62
would<00:01:49.770> probably<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.159> about<00:01:50.369> where<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:51.119> get

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
would probably be about where you get

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.179 
would probably be about where you get
into<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> after<00:01:51.960> games<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.439> yeah<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.040> won't

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
into the after games so yeah you won't

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.580 
into the after games so yeah you won't
get<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.759> while<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:55.320> know<00:01:55.409> it's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
get it for a while but you know it's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
get it for a while but you know it's
still<00:01:55.740> worth<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.070> when<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.399> there<00:01:56.610> emboar

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
bad thing about this move is that it

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.839 
bad thing about this move is that it
lowers<00:02:43.590> your<00:02:43.709> attack<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.190> defense<00:02:44.430> by<00:02:44.579> one

lowers your attack and defense by one
stage<00:02:45.120> after<00:02:45.299> using<00:02:45.599> it<00:02:45.750> pretty<00:02:46.319> much<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.560> can

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
stage after using it pretty much you can
