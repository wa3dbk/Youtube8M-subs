00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.560 
especially you know vol especial
something's<00:02:09.260> is<00:02:09.380> there<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:11.090> they're

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
something's is there so and they're

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.430 
something's is there so and they're
going<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.750> change<00:02:11.960> it<00:02:12.050> so<00:02:12.140> they're<00:02:12.290> at<00:02:12.350> least

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
going to change it so they're at least

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.320 
going to change it so they're at least
drawing<00:02:12.770> ones<00:02:12.950> at<00:02:13.130> least<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.430> one<00:02:13.760> for<00:02:13.970> one<00:02:14.000> and

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
drawing ones at least a one for one and

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.240 
drawing ones at least a one for one and
they're<00:02:14.810> stopping<00:02:15.230> in<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.470> disrupt<00:02:15.830> card<00:02:16.070> I

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
they're stopping in to disrupt card I

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.010 
they're stopping in to disrupt card I
think<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.210> lot<00:02:17.330> better<00:02:17.450> than<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.750> did<00:02:17.810> when

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
think it's a lot better than I did when

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:27.340 
think it's a lot better than I did when
it<00:02:18.080> first<00:02:18.170> came<00:02:18.440> out<00:02:18.590> it's<00:02:19.370> not<00:02:19.490> bad<00:02:19.640> car<00:02:26.020> so<00:02:27.020> um

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
it first came out it's not bad car so um

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.770 
it first came out it's not bad car so um
I<00:02:28.100> play<00:02:28.550> was<00:02:28.970> not<00:02:29.710> operational<00:02:30.710> with<00:02:30.830> fable

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
I play was not operational with fable

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.110 
I play was not operational with fable
myself<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.320> Oh<00:02:35.110> Maxine
