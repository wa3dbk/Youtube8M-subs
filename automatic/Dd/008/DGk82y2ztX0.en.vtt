00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
a 5/16 piece of rod

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.619 
a 5/16 piece of rod
and<00:03:26.110> this<00:03:27.110> shape<00:03:27.879> took<00:03:28.879> about<00:03:29.060> five<00:03:29.329> minutes

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
and this shape took about five minutes

and this shape took about five minutes
to<00:03:29.840> do<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:31.430> doesn't<00:03:31.700> hit<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.849> floor<00:03:32.090> now

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
to do and it doesn't hit the floor now

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.390

when<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.480> put<00:03:32.689> it<00:03:32.750> in<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.900> parts<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:33.379> is<00:03:34.159> much

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
when I put it in the parts and is much

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.660 
when I put it in the parts and is much
easier<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.819> use<00:03:34.939> then<00:03:35.650> whatever<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:36.860> that

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
easier to use then whatever that that

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.770 
easier to use then whatever that that
was<00:03:37.879> because<00:03:38.329> it's<00:03:38.510> terrible<00:03:38.989> design<00:03:40.780> other

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
was because it's terrible design other

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.759 
was because it's terrible design other
than<00:03:42.109> the<00:03:42.170> fact<00:03:42.379> that<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:42.620> moms<00:03:42.829> the

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
than the fact that it moms the

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.699 
than the fact that it moms the
transmission<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:47.030> was<00:03:47.329> not<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:48.290> best<00:03:48.470> of

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
transmission it was not the best of

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.000 
transmission it was not the best of

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.380 
see he just welded it solid which was a
bad<00:06:48.940> idea<00:06:48.970> for<00:06:49.510> this<00:06:49.600> this<00:06:50.080> year<00:06:50.260> of<00:06:50.350> caddy<00:06:51.390> but

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.390 
bad idea for this this year of caddy but

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.420 
bad idea for this this year of caddy but
see<00:06:52.870> right<00:06:53.170> here<00:06:53.440> this<00:06:53.770> is<00:06:53.830> where<00:06:54.100> it<00:06:54.310> goes

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
see right here this is where it goes

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:00.600 
see right here this is where it goes
into<00:06:54.640> a<00:06:54.730> thief<00:06:55.570> from<00:06:56.440> right<00:06:56.650> here<00:06:56.890> back<00:06:59.610> but

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
into a thief from right here back but

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.610 
into a thief from right here back but
instead<00:07:00.970> of<00:07:01.030> actually<00:07:01.600> just<00:07:01.780> going<00:07:02.170> in<00:07:02.320> and

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
instead of actually just going in and

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.830 
instead of actually just going in and
dimpling<00:07:03.460> it<00:07:03.640> right<00:07:03.790> here<00:07:04.000> so<00:07:04.150> it<00:07:04.270> pulled<00:07:04.660> up

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
dimpling it right here so it pulled up

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.640 
dimpling it right here so it pulled up
he<00:07:05.770> just<00:07:05.950> welded<00:07:06.280> it<00:07:06.400> and<00:07:06.490> called<00:07:06.670> it<00:07:06.790> good

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650 
he just welded it and called it good

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.220 
he just welded it and called it good
this<00:07:09.160> one<00:07:09.370> was<00:07:09.580> starting<00:07:10.390> to<00:07:10.420> really<00:07:10.750> collapse

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.230 
this one was starting to really collapse

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.130 
this one was starting to really collapse
too<00:07:11.530> but<00:07:11.800> it<00:07:11.860> wasn't<00:07:12.010> all<00:07:12.220> the<00:07:12.250> way<00:07:12.370> there<00:07:13.140> but

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.140 
too but it wasn't all the way there but
