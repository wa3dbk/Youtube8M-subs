00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.009
 Hello, I'm Tiago Difficult is the recipe for 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.490
 today will be a delicious barbecue of 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.490
 rib 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.189
 that here the rib for us 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.269
 start barbecue I'll do it 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.269
 wait for her 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.149
 and now I'm going to put the jump 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.250
 now that I already knew meat that I'm going 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.989
 I 'll catch her leaving her mouth 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.000
 from the barbecue for the two minutes 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.230
 what is it that the fiber gives away and the sun 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.820
 enters the carton 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.129
 so we do not have to put that 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.850
 salt in the barbecue and then 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.850
 hit the meat 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.000
 We already let the two of you rest. 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.950
 minutes in the mouth of the barbecue there 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.500
 I'm going to do it and I'll put it for three 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.600
 minutes below in the lower part of the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.939
 barbecue to seal the three rib 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.939
 minutes on one side three minutes on the other 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.350
 the rib 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.050
 she is nice that needs a little bit 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.910
 more time in the fire that is white as 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.500
 it's a thicker piece 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.820
 She's going to stay a little longer than she is. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.820
 to finish the whole kitchen
