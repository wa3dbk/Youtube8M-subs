the<00:00:07.200> best<00:00:07.530> products<00:00:08.189> we've<00:00:08.370> ever<00:00:08.639> designed

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:08.969 
the best products we've ever designed

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.270 
the best products we've ever designed
and<00:00:09.480> it's<00:00:10.019> gone<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.499> become<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.799> number

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.089 
and it's gone on to become the number
one<00:00:11.459> smartphone<00:00:11.999> in<00:00:12.209> the<00:00:12.299> world<00:00:12.769> so<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:13.889> had

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
one smartphone in the world so we had

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.129 
one smartphone in the world so we had
this<00:00:14.249> challenge<00:00:14.570> how<00:00:15.570> do<00:00:15.629> you<00:00:15.780> improve<00:00:15.990> on

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
this challenge how do you improve on

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.350 
this challenge how do you improve on
something<00:00:16.410> that's<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:16.830> extraordinary<00:00:17.360> well

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
something that's so extraordinary well

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.440 
something that's so extraordinary well
with<00:00:18.480> iPhone<00:00:18.900> 4s<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.890> did<00:00:20.040> exactly<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.550> I'm

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
with iPhone 4s we did exactly that I'm

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.180 
with iPhone 4s we did exactly that I'm
taking<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.900> amazing<00:00:22.530> design<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
taking this amazing design and

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.900 
taking this amazing design and
completely<00:00:23.760> rethinking<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.050> inside<00:00:25.910> we

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
completely rethinking the inside we

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.900 
completely rethinking the inside we
started<00:00:27.270> by<00:00:27.390> adding<00:00:27.690> the<00:00:27.780> dual<00:00:27.960> core<00:00:28.230> a5<00:00:28.470> chip

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
started by adding the dual core a5 chip

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.340 
started by adding the dual core a5 chip
which<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.180> to<00:00:30.210> twice<00:00:30.510> as<00:00:30.570> fast

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
which is up to twice as fast

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.190 
which is up to twice as fast
then<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.369> completely<00:00:33.030> redesign<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.780> camera

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
then we completely redesign the camera

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.160 
then we completely redesign the camera
which<00:00:34.560> not<00:00:34.829> only<00:00:34.860> has<00:00:35.310> 8<00:00:35.640> megapixels<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.930> all

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
which not only has 8 megapixels but all

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.030 
which not only has 8 megapixels but all
