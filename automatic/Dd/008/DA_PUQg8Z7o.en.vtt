00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:15.690
 Hi guys, beauty serve and it was also today 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.740
 I'm back here with the slit series 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.710
 the bikini series the very old grade and then 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.189
 It's quiet here with you can see 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.960
 very little but it's because I 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.090
 was focusing more on the other projects 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.040
 that was taking on the channel but the staff 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.360
 got me asking me a lot I decided to bring 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.960
 the account for you 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.180
 and so I was thinking of continuing 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.950
 with this firmer series in the channel but 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.340
 I really wanted your feedback. 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.610
 it's in the bikini slit video because there's 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.870
 a lot of work not because here it is 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.550
 all sand 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.039
 but why do I have to analyze these 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.440
 beds in hand so why not the same 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.149
 has how to do this in reddit and gives a lot 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.100
 work even if you can see me 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.149
 I got it all I got all the cops 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.189
 Why is this all straight and in the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.290
 trip to the world with nothing but anyway 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.030
 and I had to run and mountains and 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.640
 any relief somewhere by 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.500
 example here is a duty is money is 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.140
 two blocks to above normal then 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.570
 not to get too all equal then 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.850
 I think it was really cool, but anyway. 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.869
 You can see I think today they have seen 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.710
 but anyway 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.829
 here was i did the lagoon tugo a is she there 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.100
 goal which is a pond inside the sea 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.270
 It has nothing to do optical is not a pond 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.810
 more on a pond bar pool bar 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.950
 bar beach bar is because it is a beach 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.080
 pond and even because it is a beach in the middle 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.350
 of the week of the sea 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.990
 You can not explain these examples. 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.940
 But here, tomorrow, because many have 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.740
 Days like this because I thought I 'd stay 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.660
 very focused to get stranger and gives to 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.000
 see a lot then I left it alone 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.970
 some separated it anyway and I did until 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.760
 here the cabana of the affection that remain 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.399
 save lives here and so 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.140
 but anyway I thought the map that part 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.660
 That was really cool because I sank 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.330
 he two goals the three blocks down 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.550
 and she won stayed there in the middle and tals 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.920
 but anyway people were more or less this 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.690
 I wanted to talk to you. It 's the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.220

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.230

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.200

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.610
 making the hospital read and we already 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.770
