00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.230
 new video from me today is about it 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.480
 He wears tu kabul case for iphone 6 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.830
 and iphone 6 plus go I see you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.259
 have my iphone 6 plus here 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.849
 area so a case attached and me 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.279
 would like to see you in this video once 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.550
 present this case and show how 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.109
 you this on your iphone 6 or 16 plus 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.720
 I can wish you now 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.490
 we have fun with this video 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.439
 First of all with the packaging if we 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.570
 us the carbon case for our iphone 6 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.489
 or 6 plus order we see here 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.989
 this packaging we get 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.050
 quite simple in black who me 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.370
 company name to attack and 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.559
 otherwise this packaging is really 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.570
 just black and we start 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.059
 Just let's open it 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.950
 I put the top side aside 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.750
 and then we also see the directly 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.890
 carbon casey now on this example 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.230
 for the iphone 6 with a hole 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.699
 there's no apple for the apple 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.289
 hole shows the same again 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.210
 then we also have one here 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.949
 Operating instructions we need 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.650
 attach both and then here 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.990
 two more tools so paper tools 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.210
 which we also need so that we 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.670
 the pace is also reasonable in ours 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.460
 iphone iphone 6 or 6 plus attach 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.259
 we can now start with the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.210
 montage that is not that difficult 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.310
 First of all, you should get your iphone 6 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.049
 or iphone 6 plus clean the dust 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.780
 or create other particles scratch 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.909
 if the carbon case could be on it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.159
 and then we start too 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.869
 Simply put this for the carbon case 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.360
 on the back and then we take our 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.600
 iphone and push that on the side 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.700
 into where the volume rocker is so 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.130
 this page will be pushed here and 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.600
 then pressed directly into the case on the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.110
 the other side we take the here 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.720
 Assistance and this will be complete 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.880
 just here at the power button purely 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.200
 and now you can do it all 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.030
 Press down 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.920
 I'll show you that again here 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.380
 a little closer you can see here now 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.320
 this assembly help and on the other 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.280
 here just the volume rocker and 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.840
 Now we just push the whole thing in 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.910
 very slow and careful so not 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.150
 by force or very carefully 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.220
 just push in 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:22.930
 and the whole thing is not easy 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:27.970
 but if you see, click 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.280
 that here and also above the 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.349
 clicked here that can happen 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.470
 your device wants to switch off and 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.599
 Now the carbon case sits tight you see 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:43.000
 everything has worked we can now 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:46.150
 pull out this tool here and already 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.760
 everything is ready the case is perfect 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.099
 The device was not that complicated 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.530
 So it only takes a few seconds 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.209
 and you already have this case on yours 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.290
 device attached and now we look 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.939
 the whole thing again from names 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.319
 if we look at the case of names 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.989
 we also see this typical directly 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.459
 carbon pattern and that it is real 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.530
 carbon which for example also in 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.659
 Airplanes or cars is installed so 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.689
 here very high quality materials 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.849
 the wall is only 0 4 mm thick so 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:18.250
 really extremely thin and at the same time 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.049
 very stable and therefore has yours 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.220
 iphone is protected in any case 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.810
 Now we look at times very briefly 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.190
 recesses we have here once 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.660
 a recess for the apple 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.250
 This version is also available without 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.769
 recess for the apple then we have 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.299
 here just a complete carbon back 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.250
 then we have recesses for the 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.379
 lightning for the microphone and for the 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.120
 camera and the camera still looks 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.849
 a little bit out but if you 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.150
 your iphone is lying down then the 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.949
 Do not really shine for that anymore 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.470
 make sure your device is shaking 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.269
 See that is stable here now when I am 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.310
 this on the table upside down 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.280
 Laying and otherwise we have here yet 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.590
 longer on the sides after that 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.060
 cover again without removing the case 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.150
 to damage so here we have so 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.280
 small savings then look us 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.010
 now the pages on and have 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.159
 then right here on the right side 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.659
 the volume rocker and the new button 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.599
 the also still without problems 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:16.419
 can be reached on the other side 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.760
 of course, the very classic one around the 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.979
 power button now on the iphone 6 and 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.639
 6 plus on the side is at the front 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.260
 nothing and we have below 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.860
 recesses for the speakers 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.289
 conduct 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.539
 microphone and of course the 35 mm 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.610
 jack connection on the front side 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.069
 we have no recess except 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.680
 of course the display and you can see 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:42.219
 have no label design here so the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:46.090
 pace is really right on the device without 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:48.699
 that something overcomes and looks like that 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.979
 then from a distance again from the 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.090
 backside a really nice case 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.789
 and now let's compare again 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.879
 iphone 6 plus and iphone 6 as well as the 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:01.419
 Case with and without window for the apple 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:03.159
 logo the design between iphone 6 and 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.620
 Of course, iphone 6 plus is just about the same 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.389
 that the case is slightly larger due to 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.279
 the bigger display and the bigger one 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.500
 iphones but interesting is the 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:14.759
 compared to the version without window 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.860
 So logo for this logo here 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.270
 we have no recess here and that 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.460
 then looks like this 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.830
 Looks complete back completely 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.479
 carbon and that 's natural 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.860
 matter of taste what you like better 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.930
 Personally, I think that's pretty nice 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.460
 if you still see the apple logo but 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.800
 if you also protect the apple logo 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.629
 Of course I would like a case there too 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.069
 then you can of course also 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.370
 decide for this variant 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.870
 what to protect your complete kit 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.770
 is now generally about this 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.750
 case say 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.580
 It is made of real carbon what you have 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.979
 even more feels very high quality 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.539
 and generally the feel pretty cool 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.400
 So it really feels like 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.259
 this carbon and this carbon look 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.990
 I think I'm fine too 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:59.080
 see if we hear over here 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.689
 you probably even that we 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.370
 here have just this carbon look and 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:05.020
 accordingly, this case costs 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.939
 Of course, more than cheaper 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.860
 Alternatives with a carbon look 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.389
 but do not produce real carbon 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.430
 there are of course a matter of taste 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.620
 if you want to pay more for 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.479
 real carbon or just one 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.639
 resort to cheaper alternative 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.830
 But what the advantage of this real carbon 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.529
 variant is she is extremely skinny so 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.939
 we really only have 0 4 millimeters 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:27.129
 At the same time this case actually goes away 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.969
 nothing at all so you hardly notice it when 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:29.589
 she lies on the hand and 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:30.879
 accordingly, the iphone will neither 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:33.009
 thicker even heavier 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:34.810
 and at the same time this case is real 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:37.870
 stable I would come here again for you 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:40.390
 a little against for being only 0 4 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.790
 mm is thin 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.890
 her husband can turn but in the 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.630
 compared to any plastic capes 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.100
 her wall thickness in the same 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.990
 it really is already here 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.020
 difference and your iphone will too 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.250
 protected if you are here of course 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.080
 Your apple does not take any savings 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.390
 protected but without recess is yours 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.660
 complete back of the iphones protected 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.740
 and nothing can actually happen 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.660
 that would be it again 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.850
 from this video I personally find 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.070
 This case is pretty cool even if you 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.930
 comparatively not very favorable 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.940
 Of course it's a matter of taste whether you 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.280
 but a little more money for a case 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.960
 would like to spend out of real carbon or 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.460
 you do not have to decide for yourself 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.960
 you will definitely find the link 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.800
 the shop and in the video description 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.870
 if you just something 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.300
 want to inform about the case before 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.800
 ye you may At length that's it 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.910
 but then, but otherwise like one 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.200
 thumb up there leave one 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.360
 Comment what you write about this 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.640
 case holds and of course main channel for 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.930
 subscribe to more videos i thank you 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.280
 to see me with you and see 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:40.140
 Happy if you next time 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.140
 Turns back on until then it's good 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.970
 but
