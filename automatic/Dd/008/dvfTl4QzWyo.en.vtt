there<00:01:14.330> are<00:01:14.450> pigs<00:01:14.900> bottom<00:01:15.470> would<00:01:15.620> be<00:01:15.680> exported

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310

well<00:01:32.480> we<00:01:32.600> just<00:01:32.810> got<00:01:33.020> done<00:01:33.200> unloading<00:01:33.740> the

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
well we just got done unloading the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.860 
well we just got done unloading the
dried<00:01:34.610> distillers<00:01:34.760> rain<00:01:35.300> from<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.630> ethanol

dried distillers rain from the ethanol

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.000 
dried distillers rain from the ethanol
plant<00:01:36.260> it<00:01:36.770> goes<00:01:36.980> up<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.280> auger<00:01:37.580> into<00:01:37.730> the<00:01:38.000> bins

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
plant it goes up the auger into the bins

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.650 
plant it goes up the auger into the bins
in<00:01:40.010> one<00:01:40.340> bin<00:01:40.580> we<00:01:40.760> have<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.240> dried<00:01:41.510> distillers

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
in one bin we have the dried distillers

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.470 
in one bin we have the dried distillers
grain<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:42.740> another<00:01:43.070> one<00:01:43.250> we<00:01:43.400> have<00:01:43.580> corn<00:01:43.910> also

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
grain and another one we have corn also

00:01:44.480 --> 00:02:03.170 
grain and another one we have corn also
soybean<00:01:45.200> meal<00:01:45.410> and<00:01:45.650> minerals<00:01:46.370> and<00:01:46.490> vitamins

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.930 

once<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.110> there<00:02:04.530> our<00:02:04.740> feed<00:02:05.340> ingredients

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
once we have there our feed ingredients

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.970 
once we have there our feed ingredients
in<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.120> bins<00:02:06.300> outside<00:02:06.570> they<00:02:07.410> come<00:02:07.650> into<00:02:07.800> this

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
in the bins outside they come into this

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.350 
in the bins outside they come into this
building<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.490> this<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.640> where<00:02:08.790> I<00:02:08.940> make<00:02:09.180> all<00:02:09.330> my

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
building and this is where I make all my

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.050 
building and this is where I make all my
feet<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.410> for<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.770> pigs<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.760> one<00:02:11.940> right

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
feet for the for the pigs this one right

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.030 
feet for the for the pigs this one right
here<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.630> corn<00:02:12.990> is<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.620> corn<00:02:13.890> is

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
here is what corn is in the corn is

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.250 
here is what corn is in the corn is
ground<00:02:14.250> right<00:02:14.580> here<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.600> one<00:02:15.840> here<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
ground right here this one here is a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.590 
ground right here this one here is a
soybean<00:02:16.620> meal<00:02:16.950> comes<00:02:17.250> from<00:02:17.490> outside<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.180> it's

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
soybean meal comes from outside and it's

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.840 
soybean meal comes from outside and it's
right<00:02:18.810> here<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> soybean<00:02:19.410> meal<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.640> this

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
right here is a soybean meal and this

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.730 
right here is a soybean meal and this
one<00:02:21.060> has<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.270> dried<00:02:21.630> distillers<00:02:21.780> grain<00:02:22.380> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
one has a dried distillers grain the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.440 
one has a dried distillers grain the
byproduct<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.550> ethanol<00:02:23.820> plant<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.330> we

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
byproduct of the ethanol plant that we

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.020 
byproduct of the ethanol plant that we
were<00:02:24.570> talking<00:02:24.780> about<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:26.340> feed<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.730> mixed

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
were talking about the feed is mixed

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.610 
were talking about the feed is mixed
together<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.600> then<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> also<00:02:28.110> need<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.500> add

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
together and then I also need to add

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.950 
together and then I also need to add
vitamins<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.580> minerals<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.570> these<00:02:30.750> are

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
vitamins and minerals and so these are

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.570 
vitamins and minerals and so these are
containers<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.620> what<00:02:31.800> holds<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.190> vitamin

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
containers is what holds the vitamin

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.940 
containers is what holds the vitamin
minerals<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.210> add<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.630> pig<00:02:33.810> feed<00:02:34.080> also

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
minerals that I add to the pig feed also

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.560 
minerals that I add to the pig feed also
if<00:02:35.040> we<00:02:35.160> need<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.340> add<00:02:35.550> some<00:02:35.760> antibiotics<00:02:36.450> at

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
if we need to add some antibiotics at

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.780 
if we need to add some antibiotics at
times<00:02:36.840> that's<00:02:37.530> where<00:02:37.770> they<00:02:37.890> are<00:02:37.920> also<00:02:38.190> at<00:02:38.550> very

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
times that's where they are also at very

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.370 
times that's where they are also at very
small<00:02:39.120> amounts<00:02:39.450> everything<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.050> controlled

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
small amounts everything is controlled

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.530 
small amounts everything is controlled
by<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.650> computer<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.640> give<00:02:41.850> us<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.120> exact

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
by a computer to give us the exact

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.080 
by a computer to give us the exact
amounts<00:02:42.990> that<00:02:43.110> we<00:02:43.230> need<00:02:43.410> for<00:02:43.650> each<00:02:43.680> age<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.850> pig

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
amounts that we need for each age of pig

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.940 
amounts that we need for each age of pig
I<00:02:45.360> want<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.020> make<00:02:46.140> sure<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.470> provide<00:02:46.800> the
