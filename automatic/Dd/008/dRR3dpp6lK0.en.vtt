00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:11.030
 Good evening everyone 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:14.450
 g 3 All Women's Race 9th Lions Noh Cup Last Day 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:19.460
 Daily sports to watch the championship game 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.070
 Hiroto Kurihara and I would like to send it 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.940
 You wish 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:34.220
 So first I would like to look back on today's second-place win but 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:39.770
 Tsuchiya last week became a rock course, but there are many days in that production 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:43.580
 It's like floating, so it looks like it got worse in the pits 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:47.000
 It seems like it's easy to roll up from outside 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.740
 Let's put it in with a good offensive attack. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.160
 Car players start 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.520
 It was a top start with 0 comma 14, but it was 12 by escape 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.530
 Ne 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:09.090
 Yes, but it is 11 race car players in the other from the city high teacher in the street, which is this already have been yesterday's outlook 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:13.439
 It seems that mountain car player is in second suit by running away 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:18.210
 Yamashita or at least from the woman center of No. 3 boat 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:22.640
 e 3 a I've done it, but it seems that I was slightly stuck in the mark swell at one time 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:29.540
 Yes, I feel that it is over there Yamakawa players took advantage well in feeling 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:31.150
 It is 12 races , but Uno will be in second place with the head from Suzuki who was also said by the aim 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.909
 came 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:42.909
 Properly is I entered Naa has Huh patch but eyes went to or can not be helped I yes that 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:45.880
 By the way, Ota ward player of the first boat was a little too cautious 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.640
 I 'm a little bit sorry but 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.000
 The player to be 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.050
 -( 1) A good offensive attack came to light Yes So look at the members of the winner 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.540
 Let's go 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:04.380
 Mr. Kono , a No. 1 boat, was a great residence for the players. 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:09.270
 Suzuki player No. 4 boat mountain car player 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:15.569
 No. 5 boat Uno player No. 6 boat Tsuchiya became a player 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:23.189
 I do not have a flying possession Yes I would like motor evaluation Yes 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:25.990
 First of all , Mr. Tanikawa Noio, No. 1 boat, is a top class with a fairly good level, but a little 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:31.030
 Where the feet are sweet 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.890
 Well I was saying turnout want to put towards that championship game 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.280
 Well at present 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:42.160
 If it's a little more than 6.5, it's about 6.5 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.360
 Pretty good even here at a place called the mother of the players I think that's a good category in the turnout type 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.630
 It is finished 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.630
 It is a quasi-excluded that I attached the dirt 7 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:58.060
 Although Suzuki and Tsuchiya decided to roll the pod 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.860
 Suzuki is a growth type and good growth 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:06.230
 In Tsuchiya players 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:12.010
 Especially around the turn I say that feet per liter are also coming 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:17.079
 Well here and wonder if these two people fairly engine specifically good to finish 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:21.330
 I think Yamakawa 's players don't feel so noticeable 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.550
 The atmosphere was a bit better than the fourth day though 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.100
 Oh dear 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:32.560
 We made a high rating, and it is already seven players of Tanikawa already if the outing gets better 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:37.630
 Really put teeth Well turnout in this 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:43.900
 In a well about say Na or I go up to about 7 points luxury 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:47.569
 That day, I understand maybe it's the finish that Do would not lose value ordering in it 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.140
 I would like newcomers Yes 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:57.620
 If it moves, if it moves with Yamakawa 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:04:01.190
 It seems to be able to go by course course though it seems to be able to put in, but a little Nikkorukara house 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:08.720
 By the way, it's not like you can win 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:15.460
 I said it was a frame, so I think it's already a 3 to 3 form of a frame 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.460
 Ne Then, based on that, I would like the real hope house Suro direction 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.730
 Hit or player's 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.680
 Now if you trust escape 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:34.670
 If there is a reversal between them, it will be a little bit anxious, so the turn is a bit 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.910
 When the flow of the mother's player's booklet comes in 12 and 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.830
 We hear of the return to the city 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.270
 To 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.940
 For example Well 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:50.180
 Nice par 4 after the mountain car player with force 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.180
 Are kept in was a co-pulling Well 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:59.280
 City and Tamano 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:01.680
 The adhesion is 46 and the third is 246 and it is Tanigawa victory axis 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.310
 Maa like this 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:10.200
 I think that Sama Hayama also has 4 schools 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.220
 I think that it is quite interesting if Suzuki is going to attack 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.550
 Aizu 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.550
 So you sure you want towards the aim eyes Well 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.129
 Oh dear 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:30.289
 Really think before phlegm in the engine ones and Suzuki player 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.289
 Where say that I wonder if per Tsuchiya players 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.560
 Of assets 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:52.020
 It seems that it is the box of Shan 6236356 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:56.309
 A place where a good dividend can also be paid if it turns around for a moment 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:06:00.409
 Yes I would like Tsuchiya to expect a little roll like today 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:06:07.729
 That's right, well, mack car 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:10.320
 Such force also pointing roll up go beyond pretty undertow is also likely to think the interesting kana 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:17.010
 I say Thank you Yes 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:23.510
 Then everyone please refer to this and try to buy a ticket. 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:23.510
 Thank you very much for the reporter Kurihara who will end the program Thank you
