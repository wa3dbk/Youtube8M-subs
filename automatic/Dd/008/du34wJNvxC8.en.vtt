00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.559 

let's<00:00:03.840> talk<00:00:04.049> about<00:00:04.200> television<00:00:04.620> reception

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:05.569 
let's talk about television reception

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.179 
let's talk about television reception
when<00:00:06.569> one<00:00:06.720> experiences<00:00:07.560> in<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.799> analog<00:00:08.130> world

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
when one experiences in the analog world

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.850 
when one experiences in the analog world
a<00:00:08.670> strong<00:00:08.970> signal<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:10.080> would<00:00:10.200> expect<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.679> great

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
a strong signal you would expect a great

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.459 
a strong signal you would expect a great
picture<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.580> as<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.599> receiver<00:00:12.990> were<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.349> move

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
picture and as the receiver were to move

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.379 
picture and as the receiver were to move
farther<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.040> farther<00:00:14.250> away<00:00:14.610> from<00:00:14.790> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
farther and farther away from the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.720 
farther and farther away from the
transmitter<00:00:15.990> sight<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:17.250> signal<00:00:17.580> will<00:00:17.670> get

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
transmitter sight the signal will get

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.340 
transmitter sight the signal will get
weaker<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.210> weaker<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.690> expect<00:00:19.080> poorer

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
weaker and weaker and you expect poorer

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.560 
weaker and weaker and you expect poorer
and<00:00:19.590> poorer<00:00:19.830> signals<00:00:20.340> due<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.699> noise<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
and poorer signals due to the noise the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.140 
and poorer signals due to the noise the
noisy<00:00:21.960> picture<00:00:22.490> remember<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> analog

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
noisy picture remember that the analog

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.200 
noisy picture remember that the analog
TV<00:00:24.900> set<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.619> window<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> RF<00:00:26.670> world<00:00:26.939> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210

you<00:00:37.469> could<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.800> multi<00:00:38.370> path<00:00:38.700> from

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
you could have multi path from

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
you can have a bad picture but let's

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.670 
you can have a bad picture but let's
talk<00:00:44.670> about<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.539> next<00:00:45.570> diagram<00:00:46.230> the

talk about on the next diagram the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.400 
talk about on the next diagram the
digital<00:00:47.100> signal<00:00:47.750> when<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.960> look<00:00:49.170> at<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
digital signal when you look at the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.170 
digital signal when you look at the
digital<00:00:49.770> signal<00:00:50.219> instead<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.530> gradually

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
digital signal instead of the gradually

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.540 
digital signal instead of the gradually
degrading<00:00:54.230> picture<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.890> signal<00:00:56.250> level

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
degrading picture with with signal level

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.200 
degrading picture with with signal level
you<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.570> nice<00:00:57.899> perfect<00:00:58.469> picture<00:00:59.280> as<00:00:59.460> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
you get a nice perfect picture as the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.990 
you get a nice perfect picture as the
signal<00:01:00.570> decreases<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.289> level<00:01:01.620> up<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> some

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
signal decreases in level up at to some

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.450 
signal decreases in level up at to some
point<00:01:03.329> where<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.719> start<00:01:04.049> taking<00:01:04.260> errors<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
point where you start taking errors and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.190 
point where you start taking errors and
you<00:01:05.489> overcome<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.270> system<00:01:06.630> when<00:01:07.170> that

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
you overcome the system when that

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.560 
you overcome the system when that
happens<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.310> change<00:01:08.790> from<00:01:08.939> an<00:01:09.119> air-free

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
happens you change from an air-free

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
happens you change from an air-free
perfect<00:01:09.990> picture<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.409> sound<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.799> an<00:01:10.920> all<00:01:11.100> air

not<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.610> good<00:01:14.939> thing<00:01:15.080> therefore<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.259> want<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
not a good thing therefore you want to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800 
not a good thing therefore you want to
stay<00:01:16.799> away<00:01:17.070> from<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.549> cliff<00:01:17.970> effect<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.689> we

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
stay away from this cliff effect that we

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.460 
stay away from this cliff effect that we
refer<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.140> earlier<00:01:19.560> when<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.840> have<00:01:21.840> margin

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
refer to earlier when you have margin

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.340 
refer to earlier when you have margin
you<00:01:23.340> will<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.640> good<00:01:23.909> consistent<00:01:24.840> reception

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
you will have good consistent reception

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.410 
you will have good consistent reception
in<00:01:25.470> order<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.130> margin<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
in order to get that margin you want to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.140 
in order to get that margin you want to
have<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.810> very<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.470> antenna<00:01:29.009> properly<00:01:29.850> placed

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
have a very good antenna properly placed

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.020

channels are in the UHF band a few in

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.899 
channels are in the UHF band a few in
the<00:01:47.790> VHF<00:01:48.030> band<00:01:48.680> after<00:01:49.680> February<00:01:50.070> 17th<00:01:50.640> when

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
broadcasts are shut off their analog

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.740 
broadcasts are shut off their analog
channels<00:01:52.920> some<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.880> them<00:01:53.970> will<00:01:54.119> migrate<00:01:54.329> off

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
channels some of them will migrate off

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.530 
channels some of them will migrate off
of<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.990> UHF<00:01:55.399> service<00:01:56.399> back<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.939> their<00:01:57.060> VHF

channels simultaneously one of the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.959 
channels simultaneously one of the
concepts<00:02:01.799> that's<00:02:01.979> important<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.490> grasp<00:02:02.700> in

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
concepts that's important to grasp in

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.780 
concepts that's important to grasp in
all<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.479> called<00:02:03.719> virtual<00:02:04.200> channels

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
all of this is called virtual channels

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.449 
all of this is called virtual channels
since<00:02:05.790> there<00:02:05.939> were<00:02:06.060> two<00:02:06.299> channels<00:02:06.689> assigned

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
since there were two channels assigned

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.619 
since there were two channels assigned
virtual<00:02:08.459> channels<00:02:08.759> were<00:02:08.849> assigned<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.450> that

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
virtual channels were assigned so that

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.690 
virtual channels were assigned so that
you<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.959> viewer<00:02:10.229> did<00:02:10.890> not<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.489> learn<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
you the viewer did not have to learn a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.400 
you the viewer did not have to learn a
whole<00:02:11.849> bunch<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.330> new<00:02:12.420> channels<00:02:12.660> if<00:02:13.080> you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
whole bunch of new channels if you

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.750 
whole bunch of new channels if you
were<00:02:13.500> used<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.740> watching<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.250> station<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.670> a

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.860 
certain channel even on the DTV tuner
you<00:02:17.250> could<00:02:17.730> tune<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.060> channel<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.750> it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
you could tune to that channel and it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.870 
you could tune to that channel and it
would<00:02:18.990> find<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.500> even<00:02:19.950> though<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:20.520> not<00:02:20.580> the

this channel that and that's important
to<00:02:50.550> remember<00:02:50.640> because<00:02:50.910> after<00:02:51.720> February<00:02:52.110> 17th

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
to remember because after February 17th

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.530 
to remember because after February 17th
some<00:02:53.250> broadcasters<00:02:53.760> are<00:02:53.940> going<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.240> change

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
some broadcasters are going to change

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.020 
some broadcasters are going to change
and<00:02:54.900> go<00:02:54.990> back<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.350> their<00:02:55.470> channels<00:02:56.030> the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
and go back to their channels the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.880 
and go back to their channels the
problem<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:57.810> virtual<00:02:58.320> channels<00:02:58.710> are

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
problem is is that virtual channels are

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.340 
problem is is that virtual channels are
not<00:02:58.980> really<00:02:59.580> well<00:02:59.760> known<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:01.170> makes

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
not really well known so that it makes

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.960 
not really well known so that it makes
it<00:03:01.470> difficult<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.370> select<00:03:02.760> an

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
it difficult for you to select an

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.390 
it difficult for you to select an
antenna<00:03:03.300> because<00:03:03.540> if<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.320> real<00:03:04.830> channel<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.370> a

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
antenna because if the real channel is a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.850 
antenna because if the real channel is a
low<00:03:05.640> band<00:03:05.880> VHF<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.930> virtual<00:03:07.290> channel<00:03:07.680> is

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
low band VHF and the virtual channel is

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.100 
low band VHF and the virtual channel is
a<00:03:08.160> UHF<00:03:08.880> channel<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.600> they're<00:03:09.720> going<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.960> stay

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
a UHF channel and they're going to stay

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.980 
a UHF channel and they're going to stay
in<00:03:10.140> UHF<00:03:10.710> a<00:03:10.920> via<00:03:11.550> a<00:03:11.760> lobe<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.210> VHF<00:03:12.600> antenna

what<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.380> real<00:03:19.560> channels<00:03:19.980> are<00:03:20.100> you're<00:03:20.310> going

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
what the real channels are you're going

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.250 
what the real channels are you're going
to<00:03:20.490> be<00:03:20.550> receiving<00:03:20.880> are<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.390> what<00:03:21.780> antenna<00:03:22.140> you

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
to be receiving are and what antenna you

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.440 
to be receiving are and what antenna you
need<00:03:22.440> another<00:03:23.160> concept<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.880> grasp<00:03:24.000> is

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
need another concept to grasp is

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.050 
need another concept to grasp is
scanning<00:03:24.870> scanning<00:03:25.770> is<00:03:26.100> very<00:03:26.459> important<00:03:26.970> in

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
scanning scanning is very important in

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.910 
scanning scanning is very important in
digital<00:03:27.420> because<00:03:27.959> scanning<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.709> what

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
digital because scanning is what

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.310 
digital because scanning is what
determines<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:30.270> relationship<00:03:30.840> between<00:03:31.020> the

determines the relationship between the

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.320 
determines the relationship between the
actual<00:03:31.680> channel<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.580> virtual<00:03:32.940> channel

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
actual channel and the virtual channel

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.540 
actual channel and the virtual channel
