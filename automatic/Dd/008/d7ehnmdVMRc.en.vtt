00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.130
 further I show you how you the 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:09.719
 Vacuum pump at and 42 and 46 engine 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.799
 could overtake that means one and 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:18.170
 Expansion and overhaul in new 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.340
 sealing ring so that there again full 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.689
 direction ensures that and here 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.240
 no longer have the problem that you 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.269
 gold and oil under circumstances on the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.179
 grimme pot water problem beside the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.279
 The valve of the seal is for her 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.050
 a smoke development at the back end 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.450
 of the engine that is there about you 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:45.030
 and first we build here for the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.730
 interior air filter off so now goes 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.140
 it to the disassembly of the interior 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.989
 air filter for this you open here first 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:59.280
 the three screws left and right 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.329
 in the middle next to this part out and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.850
 grabs him aside 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.640
 after that you will already see the interior 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.659
 You also take this air filter 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.869
 then you remove this seal 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:20.810
 and take them off taxe as well 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:26.549
 then clips on this score four more 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:30.299
 careful that he is not plastic 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.659
 Encapsulation destroys you can 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.070
 completely lose weight and pack it as well 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.740
 by side 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:47.490
 and after takes your power supply and 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:52.320
 the engine electronics wiring out and 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.470
 now comes the last step for the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.479
 Removal of air in the interior air filter 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.680
 and in rom air filter box namely 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.290
 this plastic component 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.280
 For this, these four fox 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.039
 screwed loose so here you see 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.560
 the screw connection has three of them 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:16.890
 I already solved is a 30s talk 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:29.760
 in there fixes and all four torx 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:32.600
 Screw out once every four here 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.600
 you solve Screw tore her 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:46.530
 on both sides simply the interior 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:48.450
 air filter box out after you do that 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.709
 You should have done one more thing 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.510
 to have a little more space 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.620
 Take out the engine cover here 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:04.530
 For that you screwed the picture lid 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:08.430
 and then call him the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.430
 To remove the engine cover the 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.959
 just put it that's called it 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.519
 with a bit of drop the engine cover 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:19.549
 then you can go upstairs too 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.900
 already take out 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:28.530
 Afterwards, the lid was packed again 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.329
 simply for the reason that no 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.110
 pollution or me 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:36.090
 no parts fall in there if you 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.980
 you did it also goes to already 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.930
 the vacuum pump because you have 3 hex 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.519
 screwing solve this very much now 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.769
 hard to see from here, too 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.210
 mostly working blind so that 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.130
 she was 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.480
 and in the meantime, you can also do that 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:58.240
 hose here from the vacuum pump from the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.650
 it's clear that it's going to make a difference 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.270
 her for the reason that he then the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.720
 vacuum pump could take out again 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.280
 but that should be enough if you 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.930
 First dismantled the vacuum pump and 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.209
 then the hose decreases so see here 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.910
 We now have the dismantled vacuum pump 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.170
 The dismantled here in the here you the 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.510
 3 of these three represent the 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:29.410
 screw connection dissolves from behind with a 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.760
 very small slide I have one of 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.920
 taken the size because they really 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.230
 he uses it quite small for that 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.640
 anus best there is if you with 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.860
 nut the screws on and after 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:49.120
 Remove the nut from the chute and 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.470
 then by hand the screws is solved 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.140
 best stop there he gets the 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.970
 It is best to unscrew it afterwards 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.400
 the vacuum pump is probably not 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.810
 go out easy but we have to 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.810
 bit of screwdrivers pry something 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.060
 It's best to be very careful with that 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.620
 pump is not too transverse and if 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.590
 You've done that here 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.860
 above the ring of the 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.230
 vacuum pump and then can the 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:22.180
 Take out and renew the vacuum pump and 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:24.970
 I'll show you this right here 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.620
 now need the dismantled vacuum pump 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.669
 we now first the screw here 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:35.100
 here here and here 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.100
 and with 30 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:43.419
 that's 1 25 talk with them you 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:48.250
 it is first to solve five screws 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:51.669
 Dismantled vacuum pump there is how 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:55.500
 follows before that that you here the 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.500
 big or redone 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:01.749
 this piece then uses here 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.809
 I failed and afterwards 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:07.989
 screwed the vacuum pump again and 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:10.379
 the only part then still swapped 

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:14.499
 the ring is here 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:15.819
 and takes out yes and pried one 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:18.339
 there is enough 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.830
 attack points actually and 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:23.589
 screwed then everything means and after 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:27.909
 that your vacuum pump again 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:31.749
 take care and be refreshed so have here now 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:34.629
 the finished vacuum pump with new ones 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:36.849
 Sealing ring equipped this 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:40.329
 Let's close here again 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:43.509
 under pressure line and mount 

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:44.919
 then the 36 edge of the vacuum pump with it 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:48.879
 Fix it again with the engine block 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:51.279
 is connected and after that will be back 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:52.959
 Everything assembled means you 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:56.949
 behind here is the performance 

00:06:52.959 --> 00:07:01.949
 the cable is installed in the air filter 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:01.949
 box so the air filter from the interior 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:09.990
 the engine cowling and then in the 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.990
 principle already done
