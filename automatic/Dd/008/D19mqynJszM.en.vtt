what<00:00:01.280> we're<00:00:01.460> looking<00:00:01.730> at<00:00:01.910> here<00:00:02.449> is<00:00:02.509> a<00:00:03.370> building

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
what we're looking at here is a building

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.300 
what we're looking at here is a building
looks<00:00:04.970> like<00:00:05.060> a<00:00:05.450> pre<00:00:05.990> manufactured<00:00:06.620> building

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.310 
looks like a pre manufactured building

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.350 
looks like a pre manufactured building
that<00:00:07.729> was<00:00:07.970> brought<00:00:08.210> in<00:00:08.450> and<00:00:08.860> set<00:00:09.860> on<00:00:10.160> top<00:00:10.490> of<00:00:10.849> a

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
that was brought in and set on top of a

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.829 
that was brought in and set on top of a
bunch<00:00:12.049> of<00:00:12.259> wood<00:00:12.620> blocks<00:00:13.070> and<00:00:13.639> these<00:00:14.450> wood

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
bunch of wood blocks and these wood

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.820 
bunch of wood blocks and these wood
blocks<00:00:15.200> are<00:00:15.559> starting<00:00:16.430> to<00:00:16.930> rot<00:00:17.930> you<00:00:18.439> can<00:00:18.590> see

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
blocks are starting to rot you can see

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.200 
blocks are starting to rot you can see
right<00:00:19.039> here<00:00:19.100> that<00:00:20.230> sections<00:00:21.230> of<00:00:21.439> it<00:00:21.619> are

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
right here that sections of it are

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.820 
right here that sections of it are
already<00:00:23.210> damaged<00:00:24.050> and<00:00:24.470> you're<00:00:24.710> probably

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
already damaged and you're probably

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.630 
already damaged and you're probably
thinking<00:00:25.430> why<00:00:25.760> what<00:00:26.449> what<00:00:26.750> could<00:00:26.990> possibly

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
thinking why what what could possibly

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.660 
thinking why what what could possibly
cause<00:00:28.640> this<00:00:29.060> damage<00:00:29.599> just<00:00:29.840> weather<00:00:30.670> well

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
cause this damage just weather well

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.240 
cause this damage just weather well
maybe<00:00:32.150> it's<00:00:32.570> that<00:00:32.720> gutter<00:00:33.230> downspout<00:00:33.560> there

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
maybe it's that gutter downspout there

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.440 
maybe it's that gutter downspout there
that's<00:00:34.520> dropping<00:00:35.240> water<00:00:36.200> on<00:00:36.680> a<00:00:37.400> regular<00:00:37.910> basis

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
that's dropping water on a regular basis

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.520 
that's dropping water on a regular basis
on<00:00:38.660> to<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.320> wood<00:00:39.620> now<00:00:40.130> let's<00:00:40.430> also<00:00:41.470> take<00:00:42.470> a

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
on to the wood now let's also take a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.190 
on to the wood now let's also take a
look<00:00:42.800> at<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.520> fact<00:00:43.850> or<00:00:44.570> take<00:00:44.930> into

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
look at the fact or take into

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.950 
look at the fact or take into
consideration<00:00:45.950> that<00:00:46.160> we<00:00:46.490> have<00:00:46.760> moss<00:00:47.270> growing

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
consideration that we have moss growing

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.410 
consideration that we have moss growing
on<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.770> wood<00:00:48.980> here<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:49.460> that's<00:00:49.610> not<00:00:49.760> good<00:00:50.180> any

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
on the wood here and that's not good any

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.500 
on the wood here and that's not good any
time<00:00:50.630> you<00:00:50.780> have<00:00:50.870> moss<00:00:51.200> growing<00:00:52.210> anywhere<00:00:53.210> on<00:00:53.480> a

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
time you have moss growing anywhere on a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.100 
time you have moss growing anywhere on a
building<00:00:54.230> especially<00:00:55.130> on<00:00:55.370> wood<00:00:55.850> it<00:00:56.210> should

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
building especially on wood it should

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.280 
building especially on wood it should
give<00:00:57.380> you<00:00:57.710> your<00:00:58.010> first<00:00:58.430> clue<00:00:58.850> that<00:00:59.630> there<00:01:00.050> is<00:01:00.080> a

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
give you your first clue that there is a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.119 
give you your first clue that there is a
moisture<00:01:00.710> problem<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:02.600> with<00:01:03.470> something<00:01:03.770> like

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
moisture problem so with something like

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.670 
moisture problem so with something like
this<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:04.699> know<00:01:04.730> I<00:01:05.020> whenever<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:06.200> see<00:01:06.440> something

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
this you know I whenever I see something

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.410 
this you know I whenever I see something
like<00:01:06.860> this<00:01:07.040> I<00:01:07.220> think<00:01:07.460> if<00:01:07.580> God<00:01:07.760> couldn't<00:01:08.180> they

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
like this I think if God couldn't they

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.740 
like this I think if God couldn't they
just<00:01:08.900> extend<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:11.500> downspout<00:01:12.850> six<00:01:13.850> inches<00:01:14.270> you

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
just extend the downspout six inches you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.900 
just extend the downspout six inches you
know<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.770> in<00:01:15.890> this<00:01:16.010> case<00:01:16.280> maybe<00:01:16.550> it<00:01:16.760> would

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
know and in this case maybe it would

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.300 
know and in this case maybe it would
create<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.330> trip<00:01:17.720> hazard<00:01:18.350> but<00:01:18.590> realistically

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
create a trip hazard but realistically

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.570 
create a trip hazard but realistically
let's<00:01:19.670> face<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:19.910> you<00:01:20.330> could<00:01:20.570> run<00:01:20.870> another<00:01:21.020> pipe

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
let's face it you could run another pipe

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.910 
let's face it you could run another pipe
along<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:23.060> side<00:01:23.300> of<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.480> building<00:01:23.920> drain

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
along the side of the building drain

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.780 
along the side of the building drain
this<00:01:25.190> gutter<00:01:26.090> downspout<00:01:26.360> into<00:01:27.230> a<00:01:27.260> pipe<00:01:27.620> and<00:01:28.010> or

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
this gutter downspout into a pipe and or

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.649 
this gutter downspout into a pipe and or
even<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.180> more<00:01:30.310> downspout<00:01:31.310> material<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.270> drain

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
even a more downspout material and drain

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.950 
even a more downspout material and drain
it<00:01:32.900> away<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.790> another<00:01:35.120> section<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:35.900> the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
it away to another section of the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.170 
it away to another section of the
building<00:01:36.500> now<00:01:36.650> where<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.190> this<00:01:37.580> end<00:01:37.940> of<00:01:38.090> the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
building now where the this end of the

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.460 
building now where the this end of the
building<00:01:38.360> is<00:01:38.780> actually<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:40.810> at<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.050> upper

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
building is actually the at the upper

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.380 
building is actually the at the upper
end<00:01:42.680> of<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.010> slope<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:43.610> any<00:01:43.880> water<00:01:44.240> that

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
end of the slope so any water that

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.530 
end of the slope so any water that
drains<00:01:45.020> off<00:01:45.409> of<00:01:45.770> this<00:01:46.190> downspout<00:01:46.909> could

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
drains off of this downspout could

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.930 
drains off of this downspout could
actually<00:01:47.900> end<00:01:48.409> up<00:01:48.590> going<00:01:48.830> underneath<00:01:49.520> the

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
actually end up going underneath the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.450 
actually end up going underneath the
building<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:52.750> allowing<00:01:53.750> any<00:01:53.990> blocks

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
building and allowing any blocks

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.649 
building and allowing any blocks
underneath<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.640> building<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.240> absorb

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
underneath the building to absorb

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.480 
underneath the building to absorb
moisture<00:01:56.960> also<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.940> know<00:01:59.200> the<00:02:00.460> main<00:02:01.460> thing

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
moisture also so you know the main thing

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.550 
moisture also so you know the main thing
I<00:02:01.880> think<00:02:01.909> that<00:02:02.150> bothers<00:02:02.720> me<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.020> most<00:02:03.200> about

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
I think that bothers me the most about

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.760 
I think that bothers me the most about
something<00:02:04.190> like<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:06.409> could

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
something like this is you could

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.980 
something like this is you could
actually<00:02:07.070> do<00:02:07.549> something<00:02:07.909> here<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.509> prolong

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
actually do something here to prolong

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.010 
actually do something here to prolong
the<00:02:09.229> life<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:10.030> wood<00:02:11.030> blocks<00:02:11.420> or<00:02:11.840> the

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
the life of the wood blocks or the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.440 
the life of the wood blocks or the
foundation

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
foundation

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.330 
foundation
and<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:14.290> wouldn't<00:02:14.560> really<00:02:14.830> you're<00:02:15.250> not

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
and it wouldn't really you're not

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.490 
and it wouldn't really you're not
talking<00:02:15.819> an<00:02:15.940> expensive<00:02:16.510> repair<00:02:16.660> let's<00:02:17.290> just

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
talking an expensive repair let's just

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.390 
talking an expensive repair let's just
say<00:02:17.650> let's<00:02:18.010> just<00:02:18.069> say<00:02:18.340> it's<00:02:18.489> $300<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:21.220> can

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
say let's just say it's $300 and you can

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.970 
say let's just say it's $300 and you can
prolong<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:22.000> life<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.569> building<00:02:23.020> or<00:02:23.800> the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
prolong the life of the building or the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.420 
prolong the life of the building or the
foundation<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:25.720> know<00:02:25.870> five<00:02:26.380> years<00:02:26.830> or<00:02:27.160> ten

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
foundation you know five years or ten

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.640 
foundation you know five years or ten
years<00:02:27.459> would<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:27.970> be<00:02:28.180> worth<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.630> in<00:02:29.020> my<00:02:29.410> opinion

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
years would it be worth it in my opinion

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.920 
years would it be worth it in my opinion
it<00:02:30.400> absolutely<00:02:31.150> would<00:02:31.600> be<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.850> with<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.420> said

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
it absolutely would be so with that said

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.460 
it absolutely would be so with that said
if<00:02:35.500> you're<00:02:36.040> thinking<00:02:36.819> about<00:02:37.470> installing

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
if you're thinking about installing

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.680 
if you're thinking about installing
something<00:02:39.040> like<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.850> building<00:02:40.269> on<00:02:40.450> your

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
something like this a building on your

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.290 
something like this a building on your
property<00:02:41.319> wouldn't<00:02:42.069> be<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.190> bad<00:02:42.400> idea<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.940> put

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
property wouldn't be a bad idea to put

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.870 
property wouldn't be a bad idea to put
some<00:02:43.480> thought<00:02:43.690> behind<00:02:43.980> where<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.310> extra

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
some thought behind where the extra

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.690 
some thought behind where the extra
water<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.510> going<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.930> go<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:48.010> if<00:02:48.580> you

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
water is going to go and if you

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.030 
water is going to go and if you
currently<00:02:49.090> have<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.450> situation<00:02:49.750> like<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.769> it

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
currently have a situation like this it

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.770 
currently have a situation like this it
wouldn't<00:02:51.250> be<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.400> bad<00:02:51.640> idea<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:52.299> put<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.630> little

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
wouldn't be a bad idea to put a little

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.289 
wouldn't be a bad idea to put a little
thought<00:02:53.019> into<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.590> quick<00:02:53.980> fix<00:02:54.250> can<00:02:54.670> something

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
thought into a quick fix can something

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.059 
thought into a quick fix can something
like<00:02:55.330> this<00:02:55.780> be<00:02:56.100> fixed<00:02:57.100> or<00:02:57.459> at<00:02:58.180> least<00:02:59.069> something

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
like this be fixed or at least something

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.410 
like this be fixed or at least something
installed<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:01.390> slow<00:03:01.959> down<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:03.310> wood<00:03:03.880> rot<00:03:04.150> or

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
installed to slow down the wood rot or

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.800 
installed to slow down the wood rot or
the<00:03:04.630> damage<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.350> in<00:03:05.680> most<00:03:06.280> cases<00:03:06.549> it<00:03:07.510> can<00:03:07.750> be

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
the damage and in most cases it can be

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.270 
the damage and in most cases it can be
like<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.319> said<00:03:08.560> something<00:03:08.980> like<00:03:09.069> in<00:03:09.220> a

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
like I said something like in a

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.070 
like I said something like in a
situation<00:03:09.519> like<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.299> it<00:03:10.480> just<00:03:10.510> needs<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:10.989> be

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
situation like this it just needs to be

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.250 
situation like this it just needs to be
extended<00:03:11.799> a<00:03:11.980> little<00:03:12.700> further<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.810> if<00:03:14.140> you

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
extended a little further and if you

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.080 
extended a little further and if you
really<00:03:14.530> want<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.799> take<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.730> next<00:03:15.970> level

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
really want to take it to the next level

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.509 
really want to take it to the next level
then<00:03:16.690> run<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.019> drain<00:03:17.440> pipe<00:03:17.709> along<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.250> side<00:03:18.489> of

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
then run a drain pipe along the side of

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.830 
then run a drain pipe along the side of
the<00:03:18.640> building<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.359> get<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.350> water<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:22.810> a

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
the building and get the water to a

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.319 
the building and get the water to a
lower<00:03:23.590> spot<00:03:23.920> get<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.400> water<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.880> an<00:03:25.000> area

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
lower spot get the water to an area

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:26.759 
lower spot get the water to an area
where<00:03:25.480> it's<00:03:25.660> going<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:26.049> be<00:03:26.170> draining<00:03:26.620> away

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
where it's going to be draining away

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.880 
where it's going to be draining away
from<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.549> building<00:03:27.970> instead<00:03:28.269> of<00:03:28.540> through<00:03:29.290> the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
from the building instead of through the

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.110 
from the building instead of through the
building<00:03:30.430> or<00:03:30.640> through<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.950> underneath

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
building or through the underneath
