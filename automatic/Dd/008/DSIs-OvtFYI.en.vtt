00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
foundation I noticed that it's glass

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.020 
foundation I noticed that it's glass
that's<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> first<00:00:32.399> thing<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.610> noticed<00:00:32.880> when<00:00:32.940> I

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
that's the first thing I noticed when I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.990 
that's the first thing I noticed when I
got<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.600> with<00:00:34.320> glass<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:35.040> easy<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.670> break

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
got it and with glass it's easy to break

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.510 
got it and with glass it's easy to break
I<00:00:36.360> feel<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.809> was<00:00:36.930> plastic<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.770> probably

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
I feel like it was plastic I probably

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
I feel like it was plastic I probably
like<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.879> more<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.660> you're<00:00:39.930> not<00:00:40.050> that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
like it more but if you're not that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.319 
like it more but if you're not that
clumsy<00:00:40.440> or<00:00:40.710> anything<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.100> then<00:00:41.850> this

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
clumsy or anything like that then this

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.130 
clumsy or anything like that then this
would<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.600> great<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.829> pretty<00:00:44.340> small

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
would be great it is pretty small

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.569 
would be great it is pretty small
expecting<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.469> little<00:00:46.710> bit<00:00:46.860> bigger<00:00:47.039> but

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
expecting to be a little bit bigger but

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.190 
expecting to be a little bit bigger but
it's<00:00:47.820> pretty<00:00:48.090> small<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.690> price<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it's pretty small but for the price is a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.979 
it's pretty small but for the price is a
good<00:00:49.410> price<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.489> get<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> lot<00:00:50.910> of

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
good price you can get a lot of

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.200 
good price you can get a lot of
different<00:00:51.989> shades<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.590> match<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.129> feel<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.730> if

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
different shades to match I feel like if

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.020 
different shades to match I feel like if
you're<00:00:54.539> open<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.500> color<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:56.280> you're<00:00:56.460> Hispanic

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
you're open of color if you're Hispanic

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.319 
you're open of color if you're Hispanic
Asian<00:00:58.250> African<00:00:59.250> American<00:00:59.910> when<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.210> that

Asian African American when I like that

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.569 
Asian African American when I like that
for<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.899> might<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.649> hard<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
for like it might be hard to get the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.670 
for like it might be hard to get the
perfect<00:01:02.910> shade<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.690> match<00:01:03.870> your<00:01:04.110> complexion

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
little bit of hyperpigmentation so it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.550

two shades are kind of close to each

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.460 
two shades are kind of close to each
other<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.819> can<00:02:25.030> have<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.300> perfect<00:02:25.569> shade

then it doesn't really show up where you
can't<00:02:30.910> really<00:02:31.150> tell<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.720> foundation<00:02:32.019> is

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
in match to a tee but with me I feel

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.220 
in match to a tee but with me I feel

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.420 
didn't really cover that area or
anything<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.739> foundation<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:45.400> really

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
anything but the foundation is really

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.410 
anything but the foundation is really
good<00:02:45.970> for<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:47.170> price<00:02:47.500> if<00:02:48.010> i<00:02:48.340> were<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:49.000> think

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
good for the price if i were to think

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.020 
good for the price if i were to think
about<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.930> being<00:02:50.140> over<00:02:50.680> all<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.519> quality<00:02:52.000> i

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
about it being over all the quality i

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.910 
about it being over all the quality i
