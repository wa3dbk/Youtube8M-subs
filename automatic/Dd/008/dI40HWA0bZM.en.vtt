00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
nice win wasn't it it was was an

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.030 
nice win wasn't it it was was an
interesting<00:00:09.630> game<00:00:11.809> he<00:00:12.809> turned<00:00:13.080> out<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
interesting game he turned out the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.410 
interesting game he turned out the
opening<00:00:14.309> was<00:00:14.370> not<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:14.820> interesting<00:00:15.240> but

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
opening was not so interesting but

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.310 
opening was not so interesting but
afterwards<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:17.270> mean<00:00:18.270> if<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.480> just<00:00:18.690> castles<00:00:19.140> at

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
afterwards I mean if you just castles at

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.990 
afterwards I mean if you just castles at
this<00:00:19.470> point<00:00:19.710> for<00:00:19.980> instance<00:00:20.340> instead<00:00:20.880> of

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
this point for instance instead of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000 
this point for instance instead of
selfies<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.890> not<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.300> be

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
selfies and then it's not going to be

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.390 
selfies and then it's not going to be
should<00:00:26.010> such<00:00:26.369> an<00:00:26.400> exciting<00:00:26.820> game<00:00:26.939> perhaps<00:00:28.400> so

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
should such an exciting game perhaps so

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.759 
should such an exciting game perhaps so
any<00:00:29.789> was<00:00:30.000> active<00:00:30.420> changed<00:00:30.900> what<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.470> your

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
any was active changed what was your

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:41.660 
any was active changed what was your
judgment<00:00:33.200> no<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.880> thought<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.120> was<00:00:40.670> you

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
judgment no I just thought it was you

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.240 
judgment no I just thought it was you
know<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> could<00:00:42.329> play<00:00:42.540> 85<00:00:43.079> or<00:00:43.379> something<00:00:43.710> not<00:00:44.129> at

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
know I could play 85 or something not at

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.090 
know I could play 85 or something not at
this<00:00:44.370> point<00:00:44.579> person<00:00:45.000> mode<00:00:45.210> before<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.860> not

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
this point person mode before and not

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.619 
this point person mode before and not
probably<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> little<00:00:47.670> bit<00:00:47.850> better<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.329> I

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
probably a little bit better with I

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
probably a little bit better with I
thought<00:00:49.250> this<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> time<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.030> strike<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:52.969> I

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
thought this is the time to strike and I

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.189 
thought this is the time to strike and I
felt<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:55.140> wouldn't<00:00:55.620> be<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:57.059> any<00:00:57.629> danger<00:00:57.899> of

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
felt that I wouldn't be in any danger of

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.849 
felt that I wouldn't be in any danger of
losing<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.800> name<00:00:59.899> yeah<00:01:00.899> getting<00:01:01.469> some<00:01:01.649> fun

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
losing the name yeah getting some fun

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.579 
losing the name yeah getting some fun
some<00:01:02.180> initiative<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.539> his<00:01:03.750> King<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.199> always

some initiative and his King is always

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.880 
some initiative and his King is always
opening<00:01:05.309> king<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.729> always<00:01:06.000> avoids<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:07.260> instead

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
opening king is always avoids so instead

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.000 
opening king is always avoids so instead
of<00:01:07.950> taking<00:01:08.430> me<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> mf7<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:10.680> Machine

of taking me to the mf7 the Machine

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.730 
of taking me to the mf7 the Machine
suggests<00:01:11.490> g6<00:01:12.060> wasn't<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.140> probably<00:01:13.530> that

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
suggests g6 wasn't there probably that

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.120 
suggests g6 wasn't there probably that
was<00:01:13.830> better<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:15.500> guess<00:01:16.500> he<00:01:16.650> didn't<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.040> it

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
was better I guess he didn't do it

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.679 
was better I guess he didn't do it
because<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.430> Queen<00:01:17.729> e5<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:20.640> takes<00:01:21.030> Sandbrook

see<00:01:30.540> any<00:01:30.659> anything<00:01:30.990> Claire<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.869> think

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
see any anything Claire and I think

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.690

Queen<00:01:34.290> age<00:01:34.470> 6<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
Queen age 6 was a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.420 
Queen age 6 was a
maybe<00:01:36.390> cleaner<00:01:36.719> see<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:38.009> he<00:01:38.100> does<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
maybe cleaner see because if he does the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.100 
maybe cleaner see because if he does the
same<00:01:38.579> venue<00:01:38.880> together<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.420> take<00:01:39.630> fish<00:01:39.899> for

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
same venue together and I take fish for

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.889 
same venue together and I take fish for
problems<00:01:40.820> but<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.149> mean<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.360> didn't<00:01:42.659> I

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
problems but this I mean I didn't I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.630 
problems but this I mean I didn't I
didn't<00:01:43.259> look<00:01:43.469> at<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.680> very<00:01:43.829> deeply<00:01:44.219> it<00:01:44.340> just

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
didn't look at it very deeply it just

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.899 
didn't look at it very deeply it just
feels<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.689> always<00:01:46.289> going<00:01:46.469> to<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.909> more

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
feels like it's always going to be more

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.660 
feels like it's always going to be more
than<00:01:48.090> enough<00:01:48.210> compensation<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.460> was

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
than enough compensation and it was

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.039 
than enough compensation and it was
actually<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:53.390> was<00:01:54.390> not<00:01:54.509> too<00:01:54.659> sure<00:01:54.869> because

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
actually when I was not too sure because

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.620 
actually when I was not too sure because
i<00:01:55.350> thought<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:56.340> would<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.640> even<00:01:57.060> better<00:01:57.090> than

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
i thought this would be even better than

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.559 
i thought this would be even better than
it<00:01:58.020> was<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.219> maybe<00:01:59.460> maybe<00:01:59.939> there<00:02:00.179> was<00:02:00.270> nothing

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
it was but maybe maybe there was nothing

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.840 
it was but maybe maybe there was nothing
