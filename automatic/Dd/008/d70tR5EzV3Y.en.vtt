00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:09.500 

today<00:00:01.260> we're<00:00:01.469> doing<00:00:01.650> some<00:00:01.829> bondo<00:00:02.250> work<00:00:08.510> using

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
today we're doing some bondo work using

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:23.650 
today we're doing some bondo work using
a<00:00:09.570> piece<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.929> wood

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.380 

I<00:00:23.690> have<00:00:24.380> to<00:00:24.530> add<00:00:24.650> your<00:00:24.830> hardener<00:00:25.310> you<00:00:26.240> want

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
I have to add your hardener you want

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.900 
I have to add your hardener you want
about<00:00:26.570> a<00:00:26.600> half-inch<00:00:27.040> thick<00:00:28.040> stuff<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.700> your

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
about a half-inch thick stuff of your

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.310 
about a half-inch thick stuff of your
stuff<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:29.240> then<00:00:29.360> you<00:00:29.450> just<00:00:29.630> put<00:00:29.780> like<00:00:29.870> a<00:00:29.930> strip

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
stuff and then you just put like a strip

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.500 
stuff and then you just put like a strip
across<00:00:30.470> it<00:00:31.070> it's<00:00:31.490> better<00:00:31.760> to<00:00:31.940> have<00:00:32.119> less

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
across it it's better to have less

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.410 
across it it's better to have less
hardener<00:00:33.050> than<00:00:33.290> more<00:00:33.970> because<00:00:34.970> if<00:00:35.150> you<00:00:35.270> have

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
hardener than more because if you have

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.240 
hardener than more because if you have
too<00:00:35.660> much<00:00:35.810> it'll<00:00:36.110> harden<00:00:36.590> too<00:00:36.710> fast<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.160> you

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
too much it'll harden too fast and you

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.770 
too much it'll harden too fast and you
won't<00:00:37.400> be<00:00:37.489> able<00:00:37.610> to<00:00:37.700> get<00:00:37.880> it<00:00:37.970> spread<00:00:38.330> on<00:00:38.360> to

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
won't be able to get it spread on to

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.950 
won't be able to get it spread on to
your<00:00:38.960> metal<00:00:39.970> it'll<00:00:40.970> harden<00:00:41.390> no<00:00:41.510> matter<00:00:41.690> what

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
once it has hardener in it so even if

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.490 
once it has hardener in it so even if
you<00:00:44.330> have<00:00:44.450> less<00:00:44.690> it'll<00:00:44.900> just<00:00:45.110> take<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.290> little

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
you have less it'll just take a little

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.229 
you have less it'll just take a little
longer<00:00:47.530> you<00:00:48.530> want<00:00:48.680> to<00:00:48.890> mix<00:00:49.430> it<00:00:49.610> up<00:00:49.730> real<00:00:49.970> fast

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
and mix up some more otherwise you'll

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.670 
and mix up some more otherwise you'll
get<00:02:51.400> chunks<00:02:52.240> of<00:02:52.480> this<00:02:52.630> stuff<00:02:52.960> in<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.440> it'll
