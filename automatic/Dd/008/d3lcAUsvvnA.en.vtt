today<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.770> actually<00:02:47.890> rebuild<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.550> gap

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
today is to actually rebuild this gap

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.280 
today is to actually rebuild this gap
what<00:02:49.390> we're<00:02:49.510> going<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.690> do<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:50.050> we're<00:02:50.140> going<00:02:50.230> to

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.050 
what we're going to do is we're going to
take<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.860> stone<00:02:51.220> down<00:02:51.400> in<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.730> particular

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
take the stone down in a particular

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.600 
take the stone down in a particular
manner<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.690> we're<00:02:53.620> going<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.800> lay<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.070> out<00:02:54.160> so

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
manner and we're going to lay it out so

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.160 
manner and we're going to lay it out so
that<00:02:54.730> it's<00:02:54.850> going<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.030> be<00:02:55.120> easy<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.750> rebuild

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
that it's going to be easy to rebuild

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.110 
that it's going to be easy to rebuild
when<00:02:56.620> we've<00:02:56.920> got<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.310> Foundation's<00:02:57.760> dug<00:02:57.970> out

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
when we've got the Foundation's dug out

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.020 
when we've got the Foundation's dug out
and<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.810> wall<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.560> clear<00:02:59.830> these<00:03:00.430> old<00:03:00.670> wars<00:03:00.880> are

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
and the wall is clear these old wars are

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.550 
and the wall is clear these old wars are
often<00:03:01.269> got<00:03:01.420> sharp<00:03:01.660> objects<00:03:02.080> inside<00:03:02.350> them<00:03:02.530> so

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
often got sharp objects inside them so

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.590 
often got sharp objects inside them so
it<00:03:02.739> will<00:03:02.830> be<00:03:02.920> wise<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.160> wear<00:03:03.489> gloves<00:03:03.730> in<00:03:04.150> doing

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
it will be wise to wear gloves in doing

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.199 
it will be wise to wear gloves in doing
this<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.920> first<00:03:05.950> thing<00:03:06.220> we<00:03:06.430> need<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.610> do<00:03:06.820> is<00:03:07.060> to

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
this the first thing we need to do is to

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.759 
this the first thing we need to do is to
look<00:03:07.300> for<00:03:07.510> stones<00:03:07.750> that<00:03:07.959> will<00:03:08.019> actually<00:03:08.410> make

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
look for stones that will actually make

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.580 
look for stones that will actually make
the<00:03:09.190> top<00:03:09.519> of<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.730> wall<00:03:09.880> that's<00:03:10.300> a<00:03:10.450> stone<00:03:10.720> like

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
the top of the wall that's a stone like

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.000 
the top of the wall that's a stone like
this<00:03:12.840> about<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:13.989> sort<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.230> height<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.800> sort

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
this about that sort of height that sort

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.900 
this about that sort of height that sort
of<00:03:15.070> size<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.550> we'll<00:03:16.090> lay<00:03:16.239> them<00:03:16.390> out<00:03:16.510> in<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.840> line

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
of size and we'll lay them out in a line

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.310 
of size and we'll lay them out in a line
about<00:03:18.910> this<00:03:19.510> distance<00:03:19.900> maybe<00:03:20.019> a<00:03:20.110> little

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
about this distance maybe a little

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.069 
about this distance maybe a little
further<00:03:20.500> away<00:03:20.799> from<00:03:20.829> the<00:03:21.040> wall<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:21.930> try<00:03:22.930> and

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
further away from the wall and try and

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.319 
further away from the wall and try and
build<00:03:23.200> up<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.530> line<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.769> toppings<00:03:24.489> along<00:03:25.180> the

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
build up a line of toppings along the

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.000 
build up a line of toppings along the
wall<00:03:25.480> we're<00:03:26.170> then<00:03:26.290> going<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.590> take<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.860> rest

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
wall we're then going to take the rest

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.190 
wall we're then going to take the rest
of<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.190> stone<00:03:27.400> down<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:27.850> lay<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.630> inside<00:03:29.019> this

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
of the stone down and lay it inside this

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.860 
of the stone down and lay it inside this
but<00:03:29.560> we're<00:03:29.709> going<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:29.980> make<00:03:30.130> sure<00:03:30.430> on<00:03:31.420> both

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
but we're going to make sure on both

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.630 
but we're going to make sure on both
sides<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.290> wall<00:03:32.470> we've<00:03:32.920> got<00:03:33.070> about<00:03:33.250> two

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
sides of the wall we've got about two

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.960 
sides of the wall we've got about two
thirds<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.090> metre<00:03:34.299> gap<00:03:34.570> as<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:35.799> walking<00:03:36.579> area

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
thirds of a metre gap as a walking area

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.850 
thirds of a metre gap as a walking area
where<00:03:37.480> we<00:03:37.570> can<00:03:37.690> safely<00:03:38.049> walk<00:03:38.260> up<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.620> down<00:03:38.650> the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
where we can safely walk up and down the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.850 
where we can safely walk up and down the
section<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.250> wall<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.640> minimize<00:03:40.299> accidents

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
section of wall and minimize accidents

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.860 
section of wall and minimize accidents
now<00:03:41.860> then<00:03:42.070> it's<00:03:42.370> two<00:03:43.090> people<00:03:43.360> on<00:03:43.450> one<00:03:43.480> side<00:03:43.600> the

wall chill people on the other and we

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.850 
wall chill people on the other and we
will<00:03:46.660> only<00:03:46.810> lay<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.140> topping<00:03:47.440> zone<00:03:47.590> on<00:03:47.709> one

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
will only lay the topping zone on one

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.090 
will only lay the topping zone on one
side<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.690> we're<00:03:49.690> also<00:03:49.840> looking<00:03:50.260> for<00:03:50.709> long
