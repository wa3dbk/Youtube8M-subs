Hakeem modded soldiers have their own
unique<00:03:45.790> armor<00:03:46.239> style<00:03:46.629> this<00:03:47.260> gives<00:03:47.500> them<00:03:47.709> a

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
unique armor style this gives them a

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.830 
unique armor style this gives them a
distinctive<00:03:48.370> look<00:03:48.400> on<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.760> battlefield<00:03:49.269> but

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
distinctive look on the battlefield but

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.479 
distinctive look on the battlefield but
it<00:03:49.959> works<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.290> same<00:03:50.319> way<00:03:50.560> as<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.190> rest<00:03:51.370> of

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
it works the same way as the rest of

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.910 
it works the same way as the rest of
ex-cons<00:03:51.970> armor<00:03:52.299> technology

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.800 

so<00:03:58.459> thin<00:03:58.700> man<00:03:58.849> is<00:03:58.940> going<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.150> drop<00:03:59.300> in<00:03:59.480> behind

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
so thin man is going to drop in behind

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.589 
so thin man is going to drop in behind
us<00:03:59.930> so<00:04:00.230> worse<00:04:00.410> and<00:04:00.650> worse<00:04:01.030> but<00:04:02.030> our<00:04:02.270> met<00:04:02.450> can

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
us so worse and worse but our met can

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.330 
us so worse and worse but our met can
still<00:04:02.810> use<00:04:02.930> this<00:04:03.080> kinetic<00:04:03.380> strike<00:04:03.739> module<00:04:04.190> and

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
still use this kinetic strike module and

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.260 
still use this kinetic strike module and
tshirts<00:04:05.030> berserker<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.569> lesson

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.980 

alright<00:04:12.260> so<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.440> berserker<00:04:12.770> is<00:04:12.920> down<00:04:13.190> but<00:04:13.990> the

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
alright so the berserker is down but the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.260 
alright so the berserker is down but the
thin<00:04:15.170> man<00:04:15.350> is<00:04:15.470> still<00:04:15.620> there<00:04:15.860> now<00:04:16.790> our<00:04:16.970> sniper

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
thin man is still there now our sniper

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.300 
thin man is still there now our sniper
however<00:04:17.780> has<00:04:18.050> one<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.500> dr.<00:04:18.770> chenes<00:04:19.070> new

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
however has one of dr. chenes new

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.160 
however has one of dr. chenes new
inventions<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:20.209> that's<00:04:20.390> the<00:04:20.600> needle<00:04:20.870> grenade

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
inventions and that's the needle grenade

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.470 
inventions and that's the needle grenade
so<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.739> needle<00:04:21.980> grenade<00:04:22.250> is<00:04:22.490> like<00:04:23.180> a<00:04:23.210> regular

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
so the needle grenade is like a regular

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.160 
so the needle grenade is like a regular
grenade<00:04:23.900> but<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:24.860> has<00:04:24.980> a<00:04:25.010> huge<00:04:25.340> blast<00:04:25.640> radius

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
grenade but it has a huge blast radius

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.230 
grenade but it has a huge blast radius
however<00:04:27.170> it<00:04:27.500> also<00:04:27.590> obeys<00:04:27.980> cover<00:04:28.460> so<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.000> thin

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
however it also obeys cover so the thin

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:37.290 
however it also obeys cover so the thin
man<00:04:29.390> will<00:04:29.570> be<00:04:29.660> hurt<00:04:29.900> but<00:04:30.320> our<00:04:30.440> soldier<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:30.860> safe

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.330
