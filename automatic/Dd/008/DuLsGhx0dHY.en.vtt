00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.149 
pockets you have a lot more health at
this<00:03:12.659> point<00:03:12.930> here<00:03:13.169> and<00:03:13.379> you're<00:03:13.980> not<00:03:14.040> gonna

ammo<00:03:15.629> for<00:03:15.750> your<00:03:15.870> pistol<00:03:16.260> but<00:03:16.799> you'll<00:03:17.099> want<00:03:17.400> to

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
ammo for your pistol but you'll want to

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.969 
ammo for your pistol but you'll want to
get<00:03:18.419> as<00:03:18.510> many<00:03:18.599> points<00:03:18.780> as<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:18.989> can<00:03:19.229> so<00:03:19.829> what

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:19.979 
get as many points as you can so what

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:21.949 
get as many points as you can so what
you<00:03:20.040> probably<00:03:20.310> do<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.579> buy<00:03:20.729> a<00:03:20.760> gun<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.810> can

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
you probably do is buy a gun and you can

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.619 
you probably do is buy a gun and you can
either<00:03:22.079> buy<00:03:22.260> an<00:03:22.409> m14<00:03:22.949> off<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.250> wall<00:03:23.489> or<00:03:24.000> an<00:03:24.120> mp5

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
either buy an m14 off the wall or an mp5

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:25.939 
either buy an m14 off the wall or an mp5
up<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.079> room<00:03:25.260> over<00:03:25.409> there

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
up in the room over there

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.129 
up in the room over there
or<00:03:26.220> perhaps<00:03:26.430> if<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.329> mystery<00:03:27.599> box<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.870> over<00:03:28.049> in

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
or perhaps if a mystery box is over in

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.659 
or perhaps if a mystery box is over in
the<00:03:28.229> corner<00:03:28.409> by<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.769> mystery<00:03:29.189> box<00:03:29.370> what<00:03:29.609> we

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
the corner by the mystery box what we

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.039 
the corner by the mystery box what we
want<00:03:29.819> to<00:03:29.879> do<00:03:29.939> is<00:03:30.030> then<00:03:30.150> accumulate<00:03:30.629> even<00:03:30.840> more

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
want to do is then accumulate even more

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.460 
want to do is then accumulate even more
points<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:32.810> essentially<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.900> want<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.229> aim

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
points and essentially you want to aim

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.020 
points and essentially you want to aim
for<00:03:34.500> around<00:03:34.859> six<00:03:35.250> thousand<00:03:35.760> seven<00:03:35.909> hundred

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
for around six thousand seven hundred

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.390 
for around six thousand seven hundred
fifty<00:03:36.359> sounds<00:03:36.930> like<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.049> lot<00:03:37.379> but<00:03:37.979> once<00:03:38.159> you<00:03:38.250> get

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
fifty sounds like a lot but once you get

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.979 
fifty sounds like a lot but once you get
to<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:38.549> point<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:39.479> should<00:03:39.510> be<00:03:39.629> around<00:03:39.870> -

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
to that point you should be around -

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.960 
to that point you should be around -
maybe<00:03:40.139> it's<00:03:40.290> level<00:03:40.650> seven<00:03:40.979> or<00:03:41.069> eight<00:03:41.220> open<00:03:41.909> up

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
maybe it's level seven or eight open up

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.360 
maybe it's level seven or eight open up
this<00:03:42.150> door<00:03:42.209> here<00:03:42.629> and<00:03:42.900> then<00:03:43.409> pick<00:03:43.680> up<00:03:43.889> the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
this door here and then pick up the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.830 
this door here and then pick up the
knuckles<00:03:44.970> from<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.239> wall<00:03:45.389> here

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
knuckles from the wall here

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.629 
knuckles from the wall here
once<00:03:46.379> you<00:03:46.470> pick<00:03:46.590> up<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.919> knuckles<00:03:47.400> and

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
once you pick up the knuckles and

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.909 
once you pick up the knuckles and
knuckles<00:03:47.729> will<00:03:48.239> one-hit<00:03:48.689> ko<00:03:48.900> vers<00:03:49.259> on<00:03:49.379> beat<00:03:49.590> up

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
knuckles will one-hit ko vers on beat up

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.490 
knuckles will one-hit ko vers on beat up
until<00:03:50.280> very<00:03:50.549> very<00:03:51.209> good<00:03:51.509> round<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.139> you're

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
until very very good round and you're

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.929 
until very very good round and you're
going<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.650> be<00:03:52.739> getting<00:03:52.919> the<00:03:53.159> most<00:03:53.669> amount<00:03:53.849> of

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
going to be getting the most amount of

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.219 
going to be getting the most amount of
points<00:03:54.060> from<00:03:54.239> killing<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.689> zombies<00:03:55.049> because

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:55.229 
points from killing the zombies because

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.339 
points from killing the zombies because
it<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:55.829> melee<00:03:56.370> kill<00:03:56.819> and<00:03:57.030> once<00:03:57.959> you've<00:03:58.139> then

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
it is a melee kill and once you've then

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.949 
it is a melee kill and once you've then
done<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.189> you've<00:03:59.729> gotten<00:04:00.209> lots<00:04:00.780> of

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
done that and you've gotten lots of

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.830 
done that and you've gotten lots of
melee<00:04:01.290> kills<00:04:01.709> then<00:04:02.340> you're<00:04:02.489> basically

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
melee kills then you're basically

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.879 
melee kills then you're basically
enroute<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.900> having<00:04:04.199> lots<00:04:04.349> of<00:04:04.470> points<00:04:04.769> in<00:04:04.829> your

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
enroute to having lots of points in your

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
round somewhere on the ground floor so

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.500 
round somewhere on the ground floor so
I'm<00:04:23.190> on<00:04:23.279> the<00:04:23.400> ground<00:04:23.610> floor<00:04:23.849> you<00:04:24.029> can<00:04:24.210> sort<00:04:24.419> of

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
I'm on the ground floor you can sort of

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.180 
I'm on the ground floor you can sort of
them<00:04:24.840> work<00:04:25.380> out<00:04:25.590> where<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.830> zombies<00:04:26.099> are

through this building for example and

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.050 
through this building for example and
once<00:04:31.980> you<00:04:32.100> go<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.190> DC<00:04:32.490> matter<00:04:32.640> zombies<00:04:32.910> on<00:04:33.000> the

once you go to DC matter zombies on the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.300 
once you go to DC matter zombies on the
ground<00:04:33.300> floor<00:04:33.630> having<00:04:34.470> not<00:04:34.710> killed<00:04:34.980> them<00:04:35.190> or

ground floor having not killed them or
shot<00:04:35.490> them<00:04:35.640> you<00:04:35.730> want<00:04:35.880> them<00:04:35.970> just<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.210> come

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
shot them you want them just to come

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.880 
shot them you want them just to come
onto<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.660> map<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:37.230> want<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.470> wait<00:04:37.620> into<00:04:37.800> the

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
onto the map you want to wait into the

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.440 
onto the map you want to wait into the
maximum<00:04:38.250> number<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.550> zombies<00:04:38.700> are<00:04:39.000> on<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.270> map

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
maximum number of zombies are on the map

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.960 
maximum number of zombies are on the map
and<00:04:39.660> then<00:04:40.050> no<00:04:40.200> more<00:04:40.380> spawn<00:04:40.890> and<00:04:41.160> come<00:04:41.730> up<00:04:41.850> to

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
and then no more spawn and come up to

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.520 
and then no more spawn and come up to
this<00:04:42.060> point<00:04:42.300> here<00:04:42.540> we<00:04:42.630> can<00:04:42.690> do<00:04:42.840> is<00:04:42.960> shoot<00:04:43.170> few

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
this point here we can do is shoot few

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.500 
this point here we can do is shoot few
of<00:04:43.590> them<00:04:43.710> as<00:04:43.830> they<00:04:43.950> come<00:04:44.160> up<00:04:44.340> these<00:04:44.550> stairs<00:04:44.610> but

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
of them as they come up these stairs but

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.610 
of them as they come up these stairs but
it<00:04:45.570> got<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.750> be<00:04:45.840> aware<00:04:46.050> of<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.290> fact<00:04:46.530> that

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
it got to be aware of a fact that

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.750 
it got to be aware of a fact that
there's<00:04:46.830> going<00:04:46.920> to<00:04:46.980> be<00:04:47.070> zombies<00:04:47.490> spawning

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
there's going to be zombies spawning

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.280 
there's going to be zombies spawning
right<00:04:48.210> there<00:04:48.480> and<00:04:48.630> it's<00:04:48.720> going<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.870> be<00:04:48.960> zombie

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
right there and it's going to be zombie

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.080 
right there and it's going to be zombie
spawning<00:04:49.530> right<00:04:49.800> there<00:04:50.100> then<00:04:50.670> we<00:04:50.790> were<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.000> do

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
spawning right there then we were to do

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.360 
spawning right there then we were to do
is<00:04:51.150> prop<00:04:51.390> yourself<00:04:51.540> up<00:04:51.900> on<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.440> edge<00:04:52.710> of<00:04:53.010> the

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
is prop yourself up on the edge of the

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.640 
is prop yourself up on the edge of the
point<00:04:53.760> here<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.960> then<00:04:55.200> just<00:04:55.410> want<00:04:55.530> to

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
point here and you then just want to

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.950 
point here and you then just want to
shoot<00:04:56.100> at<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.370> zombies<00:04:56.700> as<00:04:56.880> they<00:04:57.120> come<00:04:57.390> up<00:04:57.570> -

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
shoot at the zombies as they come up -

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.410 
shoot at the zombies as they come up -
they<00:04:58.320> can't<00:04:58.710> jump<00:04:59.130> up<00:04:59.370> here<00:04:59.640> which<00:04:59.760> is<00:04:59.910> awesome

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
they can't jump up here which is awesome

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.180 
they can't jump up here which is awesome
that's<00:05:00.510> a<00:05:00.750> great<00:05:01.230> thing<00:05:01.350> about<00:05:01.470> this<00:05:01.710> strategy

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
that's a great thing about this strategy

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.550 
that's a great thing about this strategy
and<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.700> just<00:05:02.850> funneled<00:05:03.300> towards<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:03.960> if<00:05:04.350> you

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
and it just funneled towards you if you

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.320 
and it just funneled towards you if you
do<00:05:04.710> get<00:05:04.860> overrun<00:05:05.190> or<00:05:05.310> you<00:05:05.460> can't<00:05:05.700> quite<00:05:05.970> reload

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
do get overrun or you can't quite reload

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.120 
do get overrun or you can't quite reload
quick<00:05:06.600> enough<00:05:06.810> we<00:05:07.230> want<00:05:07.380> to<00:05:07.440> do<00:05:07.530> is<00:05:07.620> fall<00:05:07.830> down

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
quick enough we want to do is fall down

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.590 
quick enough we want to do is fall down
of<00:05:08.400> course<00:05:08.640> most<00:05:08.850> as<00:05:09.000> long<00:05:09.090> as<00:05:09.210> we're<00:05:09.360> going<00:05:09.420> up

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
of course most as long as we're going up

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.910 
of course most as long as we're going up
that<00:05:09.780> stairs<00:05:10.110> or<00:05:10.410> coming<00:05:10.680> through<00:05:10.830> the

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
that stairs or coming through the

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.900 
that stairs or coming through the
building<00:05:11.250> so<00:05:11.340> you're<00:05:11.430> not<00:05:11.490> going<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.670> run<00:05:11.790> into

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
building so you're not going to run into

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.170 
building so you're not going to run into
a<00:05:12.030> lot<00:05:12.210> of<00:05:12.240> zombies<00:05:12.450> hopefully<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.290> then<00:05:14.180> work

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
a lot of zombies hopefully and then work

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.150 
a lot of zombies hopefully and then work
away<00:05:15.330> over<00:05:15.480> to<00:05:15.570> this<00:05:15.720> side<00:05:15.960> of<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.170> map<00:05:16.350> keep

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
away over to this side of the map keep

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.680 
away over to this side of the map keep
on<00:05:17.310> going<00:05:17.580> up<00:05:17.700> here<00:05:17.970> you<00:05:18.150> can<00:05:18.270> reload<00:05:18.480> few

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
on going up here you can reload few

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.000 
on going up here you can reload few
barriers<00:05:19.080> of<00:05:19.200> course<00:05:19.320> making<00:05:19.530> sure<00:05:19.710> there's

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
barriers of course making sure there's

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.830 
barriers of course making sure there's
no<00:05:20.040> zombies<00:05:20.370> coming<00:05:20.550> from<00:05:20.700> there<00:05:20.940> making<00:05:21.660> sure

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
no zombies coming from there making sure

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.270 
no zombies coming from there making sure
that<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.140> zombies<00:05:22.500> aren't<00:05:22.650> coming<00:05:22.950> from<00:05:23.070> down

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
that the zombies aren't coming from down

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.610 
that the zombies aren't coming from down
here<00:05:23.550> or<00:05:23.790> there<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:24.570> then<00:05:24.870> do<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.080> exact<00:05:25.380> same

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
here or there and then do the exact same

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.350 
here or there and then do the exact same
thing<00:05:25.890> but<00:05:26.040> from<00:05:26.160> this<00:05:26.460> edge<00:05:26.760> of<00:05:27.000> the<00:05:27.060> map<00:05:27.210> and

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
thing but from this edge of the map and

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.630 
thing but from this edge of the map and
then<00:05:27.450> shoots<00:05:27.750> him<00:05:27.870> from<00:05:28.140> here<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:28.590> here<00:05:29.430> and

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
then shoots him from here and here and

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.370 
then shoots him from here and here and
then<00:05:30.030> basically<00:05:30.390> switch<00:05:30.750> between<00:05:30.960> these<00:05:31.320> two

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
then basically switch between these two

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.020 
then basically switch between these two
points<00:05:31.980> here<00:05:32.130> hanging<00:05:32.430> around<00:05:32.640> on<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.790> ground

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
points here hanging around on the ground

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.970 
points here hanging around on the ground

enjoyed a strategy guide video if you

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.010 
enjoyed a strategy guide video if you
want<00:05:41.100> to<00:05:41.220> see<00:05:41.370> a<00:05:41.400> strategy<00:05:41.850> guide<00:05:41.970> in<00:05:42.450> action

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
want to see a strategy guide in action

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.180 
want to see a strategy guide in action
if<00:05:43.140> you<00:05:43.320> know<00:05:43.380> perhaps<00:05:43.590> me<00:05:43.860> run<00:05:44.040> you<00:05:44.160> through

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
if you know perhaps me run you through

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.860 
if you know perhaps me run you through
it<00:05:44.340> doesn't<00:05:44.520> make<00:05:44.610> a<00:05:44.640> lot<00:05:44.790> of<00:05:44.850> sense<00:05:45.060> and<00:05:45.300> then

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
it doesn't make a lot of sense and then

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.740 
it doesn't make a lot of sense and then
check<00:05:46.140> out<00:05:46.290> a<00:05:46.320> video<00:05:46.470> on-screen<00:05:47.420> and<00:05:48.420> there'll
