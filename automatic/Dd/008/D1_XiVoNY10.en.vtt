original guy who bought this or had this
truck<00:02:34.950> prior<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.490> me<00:02:35.610> he<00:02:36.600> pulled<00:02:36.810> all<00:02:36.960> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
truck prior to me he pulled all the

heater out of it cuz he was gonna
convert<00:02:38.490> this<00:02:38.610> over<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.060> AC<00:02:39.630> well<00:02:40.500> that's<00:02:40.710> a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
convert this over to AC well that's a

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.170 
convert this over to AC well that's a
little<00:02:40.890> bit<00:02:41.100> more<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.400> difficult<00:02:41.820> job<00:02:42.000> that

little bit more of a difficult job that
I<00:02:42.240> don't<00:02:42.420> feel<00:02:42.540> like<00:02:42.600> doing<00:02:42.870> right<00:02:43.020> now<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.470> I'm

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
I don't feel like doing right now so I'm

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.890 
I don't feel like doing right now so I'm
gathering<00:02:43.770> all<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.100> parts<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.610> put<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.480> put

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900

gathering all the parts to put the put
the<00:02:45.990> heater<00:02:46.200> back<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:46.980> what<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.190> got

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
the heater back in it and so what I got

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.190 
the heater back in it and so what I got
here<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:48.620> almost<00:02:49.620> everything<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.220> need<00:02:50.460> I<00:02:51.200> got

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.490 
here is almost everything I need I got
the<00:02:52.380> outer<00:02:52.890> heater<00:02:53.580> box<00:02:53.960> that<00:02:54.960> bolts<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.410> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
the outer heater box that bolts to the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.000 
the outer heater box that bolts to the
firewall<00:02:56.660> it's<00:02:57.660> got<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.930> fan<00:02:58.140> inside<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.620> it

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.420 

doors<00:03:02.010> right<00:03:02.190> there<00:03:03.830> almost<00:03:04.830> looks<00:03:05.160> like<00:03:05.220> the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
doors right there almost looks like the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.430 
doors right there almost looks like the
original<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.970> don't<00:03:06.960> even<00:03:07.050> think<00:03:07.170> I'm<00:03:07.350> gonna

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
original I don't even think I'm gonna

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.810 
original I don't even think I'm gonna
paint<00:03:07.710> it<00:03:09.950> got<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.040> out<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.310> junkyard<00:03:11.610> a

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
paint it got that out of the junkyard a

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.240 
paint it got that out of the junkyard a
couple<00:03:12.060> weeks<00:03:12.240> ago<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.800> got<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.950> wiring

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
couple weeks ago I got the wiring

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.120 
couple weeks ago I got the wiring
harness<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.730> goes<00:03:14.790> from<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:16.140> controls

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
harness that goes from the controls

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.040 
harness that goes from the controls
which<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.910> had<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.150> get<00:03:18.330> because<00:03:18.480> everything

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
which I had to get because everything

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.390 
which I had to get because everything
was<00:03:19.170> missing<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:19.770> is<00:03:19.920> just<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.250> standard

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
was missing so this is just the standard

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.210 
was missing so this is just the standard
heater<00:03:20.760> controls<00:03:21.210> without<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.870> a/c<00:03:22.050> I<00:03:22.470> got

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
heater controls without the a/c I got

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.620 
heater controls without the a/c I got
the<00:03:23.340> harness<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.640> plugs<00:03:23.910> into<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.390> switch

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
the harness that plugs into the switch

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.320 
the harness that plugs into the switch
here<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.460> plugs<00:03:26.460> into<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> main<00:03:26.880> harness<00:03:27.090> of

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
here and plugs into the main harness of

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.250 
here and plugs into the main harness of
the<00:03:27.390> truck<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.870> then<00:03:27.990> plugs<00:03:28.830> into<00:03:29.040> the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
the truck and then plugs into the

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.030 
the truck and then plugs into the
resistors<00:03:31.260> right<00:03:31.500> there<00:03:31.680> for<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.920> blower

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
resistors right there for the blower

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.770 
resistors right there for the blower
