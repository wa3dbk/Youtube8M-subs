because it helps it get up faster
because<00:03:32.110> if<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.320> don't<00:03:32.440> have<00:03:32.620> valuable<00:03:33.100> stuff

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
because if you don't have valuable stuff

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.560 
because if you don't have valuable stuff
then<00:03:33.490> you're<00:03:33.610> gonna<00:03:33.700> have<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:33.940> keep<00:03:34.240> getting

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
then you're gonna have to keep getting

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.910 
then you're gonna have to keep getting
into<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.870> chest<00:03:35.110> over<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:35.530> over<00:03:35.740> and<00:03:35.860> over

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
into the chest over and over and over

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.950 
into the chest over and over and over
again<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.550> it<00:03:37.000> just<00:03:37.030> takes<00:03:37.360> a<00:03:37.570> lot<00:03:37.810> longer

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
again and it just takes a lot longer

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.290 
again and it just takes a lot longer
than<00:03:38.290> if<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.530> had<00:03:38.680> more<00:03:38.980> valuable<00:03:39.430> things<00:03:39.670> see

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
than if you had more valuable things see

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.290 
than if you had more valuable things see
there<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.540> goes<00:03:40.690> again<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:45.760> get<00:03:45.910> out<00:03:46.120> of

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
there it goes again and to get out of

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.270 
there it goes again and to get out of
the<00:03:46.510> glitchy<00:03:46.930> area<00:03:47.470> all<00:03:47.710> you<00:03:47.830> have<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.040> do<00:03:48.160> is

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
the glitchy area all you have to do is

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.010

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
fast travel to a different location and

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.360 
fast travel to a different location and
