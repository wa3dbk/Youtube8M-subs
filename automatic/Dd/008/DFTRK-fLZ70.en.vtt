this<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:11.010> bulkhead<00:00:11.519> number<00:00:11.730> five<00:00:11.940> which<00:00:12.150> is

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
this is bulkhead number five which is

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.240 
this is bulkhead number five which is
the<00:00:12.420> largest<00:00:12.750> monthly<00:00:13.110> batch<00:00:13.320> bulkhead<00:00:13.799> that

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
the largest monthly batch bulkhead that

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.890 
the largest monthly batch bulkhead that
means<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.969> going<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.269> go<00:00:15.420> across<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
means this is going to go across the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.320 
means this is going to go across the
boat<00:00:16.080> at<00:00:16.320> its<00:00:16.470> widest<00:00:16.859> point<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.910> first<00:00:18.150> thing

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
boat at its widest point the first thing

boat at its widest point the first thing
I<00:00:18.420> need<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.630> do<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.170> get<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.619> set<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.100> proper

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
I need to do is get it set in the proper

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.820 
I need to do is get it set in the proper
location<00:00:20.490> before<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.270> aft<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:22.260> also<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:22.680> it

location before to aft but also get it

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.220 
location before to aft but also get it
standing<00:00:23.160> straight<00:00:23.640> up<00:00:23.869> even<00:00:24.869> though<00:00:25.019> only

bot here on my garage is not staying
perfectly<00:00:27.359> level<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.830> what<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.010> means<00:00:29.369> is

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
perfectly level and what that means is

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.490 
perfectly level and what that means is
that<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.760> can't<00:00:30.029> use<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> level<00:00:30.689> or<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.170> measure

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
that I can't use a level or just measure

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.740 
that I can't use a level or just measure
a<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> tape<00:00:32.850> measure<00:00:33.000> from<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.480> front<00:00:33.690> of

a with a tape measure from the front of
the<00:00:33.809> boat<00:00:33.989> instead<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.130> take

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the boat instead I have to take

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.880 
the boat instead I have to take
measurements<00:00:35.660> along<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.079> rail<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.620> chime

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
measurements along the rail the chime

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.819 
measurements along the rail the chime
and<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.430> keel<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:39.239> order<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.690> ensure<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
and the keel in order to ensure that the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.860 
and the keel in order to ensure that the
bulkhead<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.489> located<00:00:41.940> properly<00:00:42.180> at<00:00:42.540> each<00:00:42.750> of

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
bulkhead is located properly at each of

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.830 
bulkhead is located properly at each of
its<00:00:42.989> corners<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> helping<00:00:45.090> me<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.660> my

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
its corners so helping me here it's my

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.240 
its corners so helping me here it's my
trusty<00:00:46.170> notebook<00:00:46.500> I've<00:00:46.680> got<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> set<00:00:47.129> of

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
trusty notebook I've got a set of

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.430 
trusty notebook I've got a set of
measurements<00:00:47.550> from<00:00:47.789> my<00:00:47.940> CAD<00:00:48.180> model<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
measurements from my CAD model and the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.810 
measurements from my CAD model and the
so<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.680> first<00:00:49.890> step<00:00:49.950> will<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.460> marking

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
so the first step will just be marking

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.330 
so the first step will just be marking
out<00:00:50.969> where<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.210> thing<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:58.129> try<00:00:59.129> that

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
out where this thing to see try that

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.380 
out where this thing to see try that
again<00:00:59.460> maybe<00:00:59.789> from<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.210> outside<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.690> time

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.320 

and<00:01:06.390> strange<00:01:07.640> i'm<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.820> start<00:01:09.030> stitching

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and strange i'm going to start stitching

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.380 
and strange i'm going to start stitching
just<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.200> side<00:01:10.439> at<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.680> time<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.700> my<00:01:11.880> plan<00:01:12.150> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
just one side at a time and my plan is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.120 
just one side at a time and my plan is
I'm<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.840> put<00:01:13.049> holes<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> hull<00:01:13.619> for

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I'm going to put holes in the hull for

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.859 
I'm going to put holes in the hull for
the<00:01:14.220> stitching<00:01:14.580> wire<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.479> bit<00:01:15.600> lower

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the stitching wire a little bit lower

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.749 
the stitching wire a little bit lower
than<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> stitch<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> bulkhead<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.549> way

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
than the stitch on the bulkhead that way

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.700 
than the stitch on the bulkhead that way
when<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> tightened<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.500> pull<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
when I tightened it up it will pull the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.330 
when I tightened it up it will pull the
bulkhead<00:01:20.220> down

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
bulkhead down

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.789 
bulkhead down
or<00:01:21.460> and<00:01:21.700> also<00:01:22.119> the<00:01:22.390> size<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.170> all<00:01:23.320> onto<00:01:23.710> the

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
or and also the size of the all onto the

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.440 
or and also the size of the all onto the
boat<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:27.250> now<00:01:27.280> in<00:01:27.520> theory<00:01:27.729> if<00:01:28.000> we<00:01:28.210> just

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
boat and now in theory if we just

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.660 
boat and now in theory if we just
tighten<00:01:28.659> this<00:01:28.990> on<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.710> stitch<00:01:30.069> the<00:01:30.369> bulkhead

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
tighten this on the stitch the bulkhead

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.260 
tighten this on the stitch the bulkhead
will<00:01:30.880> be<00:01:31.000> perfectly<00:01:31.420> placed<00:01:31.719> on<00:01:31.990> come<00:01:32.170> in

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.690 

alright<00:01:37.270> looks<00:01:37.959> pretty<00:01:38.170> good<00:01:38.289> to<00:01:38.409> me<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.579> then

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
alright looks pretty good to me and then

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.550 
alright looks pretty good to me and then
to<00:01:42.880> finish<00:01:43.149> this<00:01:43.390> off<00:01:43.600> we're<00:01:43.899> back<00:01:44.079> to<00:01:44.319> well

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
to finish this off we're back to well

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.340 
to finish this off we're back to well
explored<00:01:45.069> territory<00:01:45.640> time<00:01:46.450> for<00:01:46.780> epoxy

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
explored territory time for epoxy

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.690 
explored territory time for epoxy
Phillip<00:01:47.890> legs<00:01:48.390> run<00:01:49.390> through<00:01:49.689> though<00:01:49.929> hated<00:01:50.700> so

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
Phillip legs run through though hated so

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.919 
Phillip legs run through though hated so
there's<00:01:51.880> one<00:01:52.030> little<00:01:52.149> test<00:01:52.450> we<00:01:52.600> can<00:01:52.719> do<00:01:52.810> to

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
there's one little test we can do to

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.359 
there's one little test we can do to
make<00:01:53.020> sure<00:01:53.079> that<00:01:53.349> this<00:01:53.500> bulkhead<00:01:54.099> is

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
make sure that this bulkhead is

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.550 
make sure that this bulkhead is
installed<00:01:54.759> correctly<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.780> because<00:01:56.380> we<00:01:56.470> only

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
installed correctly the because we only

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.889 
installed correctly the because we only
box<00:01:56.829> going<00:01:57.009> to<00:01:57.099> have<00:01:57.189> a<00:01:57.220> desk<00:01:57.549> on<00:01:57.759> top<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:58.450> top

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
box going to have a desk on top the top

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.949 
box going to have a desk on top the top
of<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.140> ball<00:01:59.319> kind<00:01:59.530> is<00:01:59.709> designed<00:02:00.099> to<00:02:00.959> simply

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
of the ball kind is designed to simply

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.529 
of the ball kind is designed to simply
flush<00:02:02.229> with<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.729> edge<00:02:03.909> of<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.149> hole<00:02:04.270> here

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
flush with the the edge of the hole here

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.080 
flush with the the edge of the hole here
so<00:02:04.840> I'll<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.319> bit<00:02:05.560> straight<00:02:05.829> across<00:02:06.189> it<00:02:06.489> if<00:02:06.879> it
