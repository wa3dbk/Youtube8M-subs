00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Now you can see our main 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.980
 achievement for today we 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.800
 started mounting 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.200
 The main sections of the fixed roof in 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.260
 particular we began to move the first block 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.720
 fixed roof in principle today 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.650
 he can see it very slowly 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.890
 there is literally 10 centimeters there in 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.340
 minute but the blog has already passed here half 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.500
 internal and external slipways 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.610
 card way we will these blocks 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.910
 move to design position 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.879
 the project position of the sector we changed 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.350
 load sharing system 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.350
 now the roof relies mostly on 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.710
 the stadium bowl of this lesser extent on 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.899
 guys and peonies i.e. it boosts 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.390
 resistance to wind snow 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.039
 loads well, I mean completely 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.449
 we have enough design reserve 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.550
 high margin of safety 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.649
 all the changes that you are now wearing 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.170
 they do not fundamentally affect the carrier 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.090
 ability yes then we are here now 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.710
 We work on the main carriers 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.390
 constructions we work within 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.670
 project 2. 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.920
 we have no amateur 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.920
 main bearing structures key 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.840
 all technological solutions they 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.010
 are in the right margin within already 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.710
 accepted examination 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.140
 all the changes we are making now 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.600
 this is due to the requirements of fifa 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.330
 basically that is for the composition 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.640
 the appointment of premises with the transfer I want to 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.070
 this room there are thousands of thousands of people 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.550
 closet there right here i want to express 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.460
 by lie 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.570
 here I want to see there temporary 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.979
 room for there ps and here 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.630
 previously it was not provided, and Ms. 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.520
 OK they publish a memorandum 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.300
 special where update their 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.179
 stadium requirements are constantly going 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.050
 coordination of key parameters 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.910
 principally for the year is not nothing 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.580
 I will change that is they too sensible 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.680
 people they didn't insist on us 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.650
 there were major changes to the controversial point 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.980
 what is the distance between the seats to 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.590
 use at matches that is with us 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.080
 Russian standards are the only ones here 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.640
 requires a more comfortable location 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.890
 while trying to not change seats 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.460
 total capacity of the stadium that is 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.530
 different on the chair we actually change 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.440
 capacity right well here and here it is 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.100
 such a controversial moment which is now in 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.980
 discussions 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.220
 Scythian customer confirms 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.250
 but we took into account the main points in 2011 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.530
 be a major adjustment related 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.850
 compatibility stadium with sloping tribune 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.850
 so then I ask everything earlier
