00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.830
 First of all, I will design the nature of the contents of the album 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:20.930
 This site is a template for easy design 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.930
 You can download it for free from the Paper Museum . 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.310
 Let's work with the template spread to make it easy to image the finish 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.809
 The first page of the album is this page with the cover open 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.600
 I will not design this page as it will be a turnaround of the album 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.970
 I will put in your favorite photos and texts 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.100
 I will print when the design is complete 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.930
 Only odd pages are divided into even pages and printed together 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:17.710
 Be careful of the position of the hole when setting the paper in the printer 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.710
 Set this way if you want to print a few pages 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.860
 When you set the size of the non-dl version appearance looks like here. 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.450
 Attention here 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:42.120
 Specify the page number when designing with a template and the printer when printing 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:48.180
 Page numbers are different 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:51.570
 To print 79 pages after odd page 13 when designing 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.760
 2468 to the printer 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.760
 You specify that you want to print a 10 page 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:11.009
 Print the even page next 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.009
 Turn over and set the printed paper as it is 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.230
 3579 for the printer 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.230
 Specifies to print 11 pages 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.379
 Print 40 pages in this way 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.860
 Design the cover of the album 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:46.900
 The paper used for the cover is thick and can not be printed directly by the printer 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.900
 Create and print the design to decoration seal 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.210
 Cut the sticker in the shape you want and peel off the backing paper 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.210
 Paste on the cover 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.990
 Since the cover is reversible , please select and attach a favorite side 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.870
 Arranged in order of the main pages and pinched by the cover and back cover 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.870
 Pass the feather through the hole 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.420
 Please cut and extra feathers with scissors when there is a long wings 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.700
 This is done
