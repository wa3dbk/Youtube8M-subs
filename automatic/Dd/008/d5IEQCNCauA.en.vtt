00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello all of you and I'm Templar 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.870
 pretty tired already because today 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.780
 Already removed two servo prism cards and herd 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.440
 but still there is one card from alexander 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.960
 Makarov 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.390
 This accidents and she well as say 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.080
 asked to do a review well i will 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.410
 review is not a problem and so he wrote something 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.840
 such as we were on a desert island and 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.529
 crashed on a desert island goal 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.910
 survive but let's say there is also a campaign it 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.829
 our skin yes here danny our skin is pretty 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.469
 cool skin but i still 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:47.039
 better your so the light does not turn on 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:51.320
 it is clear where the exit and exit here as well 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:56.460
 this cho type chests yes these are chests 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:00.270
 there are matches in the second chest is nothing 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.780
 type black boxes scattered around the world yet 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.990
 in the trunk the whole personal and chest 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.799
 magnet and compass which i miss 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.200
 now in survival in explay 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:18.680
 I think they will soon make two more boats 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.790
 so but in principle, the initial resources are 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:28.200
 there is still something like a column 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.909
 here we still have chests well chests already 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.240
 pretty much a warehouse, you can 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:38.759
 make it beautifully burn everything beautifully 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.210
 scattered metal blocks rather 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:47.670
 All this so there lava and need to it 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.810
 get there but hike there any really 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.210
 cool resources 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.299
 Now look at this chest, we kind of 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.470
 checked yes there is empty and here 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.890
 what else is there but 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:09.850
 I smell my smell something should be there neither 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:12.760
 the feature is not here so it pays already 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.330
 what is this coal block 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.720
 everything is clear so we will dial ourselves 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:26.200
 blocks and see what 's up in that 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:29.380
 456 so I think that's enough for everyone 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.540
 so here you can already start yourself 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.820
 take the resources of all the chests like this 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.780
 so here so here and so generally as 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:44.820
 kings go easy and what we have here 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:52.120
 empty chest just empty chest yes 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:55.000
 it's just a japanese scale file so 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.500
 but basically cards so i'm pretty 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.450
 not bad for whale start it will go 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.990
 I especially liked the compass they 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.740
 gave it really thanks well and then 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.100
 make a pickaxe first and break it all I 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.430
 I think it will not be difficult for you 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.459
 you will be just perfectly provided for 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.650
