00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
out the fact that this set is one of the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.010 
out the fact that this set is one of the
first<00:01:20.220> sets<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.790> designed<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:21.900> we

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
first sets that we designed with what we

around<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.150> if<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.869> kit<00:01:40.290> that's<00:01:40.470> built

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
around so if you have a kit that's built

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.109 
around so if you have a kit that's built
with<00:01:40.950> two<00:01:41.070> different<00:01:41.340> types<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.640> wood<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the advantage of two kits in one to do

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.450 
the advantage of two kits in one to do
that<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:54.509> use<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.810> gull<00:01:54.990> wing<00:01:55.020> spur<00:01:55.500> mounted
