00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.799
 possible different duels depending on 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.040

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.960
 comments if they did not find out in the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.840
 description there is a video with the new 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.030
 requirements a few entrants are the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.860
 extension of some rule but they entered 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.320
 new to be discussed 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.900
 now we go with the hurdes to use in 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.330
 this round is completely free the 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.430
 blue as it always has been but for 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.060
 those who do not want to break much the 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.820
 head thinking about unasur I leave these that 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.040
 nickel and spongebob in the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.960
 description will find links with all 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.750
 the chapters of Sponge Bob and Ken to 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.000
 mikel in mega in the hard section of 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.670
 bitches I leave the injured or rather 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.440
 free I am the section called hard of 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.020
 bitch because it's hard to be original 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.030
 with unasur are exploited so the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.820
 left and if someone wants it then there the 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.000
 you have in the complement section of 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:15.370
 risk I leave this scene 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.370
 wow, I'm going to dominate 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.260
 if you do it right you can win a couple of 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.110
 tenths more or up to half a point and if 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.020
 you do wrong you lose a better point go 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.390
 forgetting to retrain can be 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.599
 take one or several and combine with your 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.300
 Original the judges so far are 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.220
 mister alborÃ¡n every ni 100 monsters and the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.250
 more faithful and need to talk a little 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.950
 buy 12 mouse and terminator but almost 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.019
 are confirmed with the ones I have I think 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.819
 be able to tie well all styles of 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.760
 pepe or although adding another would not come 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.470
 wrong by the way has been postponed the 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.269
 duration of the tournament the pool for 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.940
 deliver can be done comfortably 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.519
 in two weeks and last between a minute and 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.910
 half and two and a half minutes only 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.160
 final putts can last longer with 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.620
 that we would have that the tournament would last two 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.870
 months but it has been decided to increase it 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.030
 little more since mostly for 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.540
 first round you will need 2 to 3 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.150
 days to avoid the video then the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.730
 Saturday April 25 is the last day for 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.090
 deliver a Hispanic pool and upload the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.129
 video on April 28 ironically it has 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.099
 after every ni said he would retire in 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.050
 this day remember if you think not 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.180
 can deliver a pup on time for 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.849
 any incident can deliver a 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.370
 putt already done this can be done only 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.340
 once in three possible rounds so 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.470
 think if you ask, we will not go down 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.530
 points for the simple fact that it is a 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.319
 putt already done that is all the information 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.799
 we will see then an epic tournament 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.799
 await
