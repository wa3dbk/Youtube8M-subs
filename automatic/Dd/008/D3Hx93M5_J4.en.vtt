trajectory come on all right over the
monster<00:02:24.180> but<00:02:28.080> that's<00:02:29.080> weird<00:02:29.380> like<00:02:29.709> if<00:02:29.890> you

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
monster but that's weird like if you

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
monster but that's weird like if you
flap<00:02:30.400> too<00:02:30.640> much<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:31.030> becomes<00:02:31.300> disadvantageous

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
flap too much it becomes disadvantageous

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.310 
flap too much it becomes disadvantageous
gotta<00:02:34.060> get<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.300> pro<00:02:34.510> time<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.990> got<00:02:35.170> them

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
gotta get that pro time and got them

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.630 
gotta get that pro time and got them

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.740

for<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.269> two<00:02:58.830> one<00:02:59.830> of<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.280> deal

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.660 

look<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:06.110> like<00:03:06.530> how<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.710> soundtrack<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.280> still

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
look I like how the soundtrack is still

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.660 
look I like how the soundtrack is still
akin<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.330> but<00:03:08.510> then<00:03:08.630> they<00:03:08.720> added<00:03:08.870> some<00:03:09.200> like

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
akin to it but then they added some like

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.140 
akin to it but then they added some like
funky<00:03:10.670> voice<00:03:10.850> acting<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:12.640> mean<00:03:13.640> I'm<00:03:13.790> just<00:03:14.030> so

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
funky voice acting I mean I'm just so

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.570 
funky voice acting I mean I'm just so
far<00:03:14.330> ahead<00:03:14.420> of<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.690> snow<00:03:14.960> right<00:03:14.990> now<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:18.520> have<00:03:19.520> a

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
far ahead of the snow right now I have a

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.580 
far ahead of the snow right now I have a
hard<00:03:19.760> time<00:03:19.910> distinguishing<00:03:20.150> between<00:03:20.630> trees

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
hard time distinguishing between trees

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.530 
hard time distinguishing between trees
and<00:03:22.160> then<00:03:22.940> actual<00:03:23.500> obstructions<00:03:25.030> wow<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.390> is

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
and then actual obstructions wow this is

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.260 
and then actual obstructions wow this is
getting<00:03:26.630> ridiculous<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.940> seemed<00:03:29.120> like<00:03:29.209> a

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
getting ridiculous that seemed like a

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.900 
getting ridiculous that seemed like a
bit<00:03:29.450> much<00:03:29.630> quadruple<00:03:30.380> backflip<00:03:32.920> what<00:03:33.920> oh<00:03:34.550> no

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
bit much quadruple backflip what oh no

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.560 
bit much quadruple backflip what oh no
oh<00:03:35.390> no<00:03:36.190> instead<00:03:37.190> of<00:03:37.250> snowmobile<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.120> wanted<00:03:38.450> a

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
oh no instead of snowmobile I wanted a

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:45.340 
oh no instead of snowmobile I wanted a
motorcycle<00:03:39.580> it's<00:03:40.580> so<00:03:40.760> beautiful<00:03:43.360> what<00:03:44.360> okay

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
motorcycle it's so beautiful what okay

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.140 
motorcycle it's so beautiful what okay
so<00:03:45.800> that<00:03:45.950> wasn't<00:03:46.160> even<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.520> snowmobile

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
so that wasn't even the snowmobile

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.440 
so that wasn't even the snowmobile
equivalent<00:03:47.690> that<00:03:47.840> was<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.080> rocket<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:49.520> I'm

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
equivalent that was the rocket and I'm

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.229 
equivalent that was the rocket and I'm
hitting<00:03:50.660> everything<00:03:51.080> I<00:03:51.880> can't<00:03:52.880> tell<00:03:53.030> if<00:03:53.060> this

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
hitting everything I can't tell if this

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.280 
hitting everything I can't tell if this
is<00:03:53.300> more<00:03:53.630> of<00:03:53.660> like<00:03:53.780> an<00:03:54.020> easy<00:03:55.750> easy<00:03:56.750> fun<00:03:57.080> time

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
is more of like an easy easy fun time

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.380 
is more of like an easy easy fun time
level<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:57.770> don't<00:03:57.890> even<00:03:57.950> know<00:03:58.100> what<00:03:58.190> that<00:03:58.250> one<00:03:58.520> is
