00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
3 times and then the part that is the

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:56.460

open<00:00:53.109> string<00:00:53.440> start<00:00:54.429> up

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
open string start up

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:06.450 
open string start up
is<00:00:57.040> that<00:00:57.280> twice<00:01:02.490> and<00:01:03.900> then<00:01:04.950> he<00:01:05.950> breaks<00:01:06.220> into

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
is that twice and then he breaks into

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.880 
is that twice and then he breaks into
the<00:01:06.610> most<00:01:06.850> complex<00:01:07.690> part<00:01:07.870> of<00:01:08.350> I<00:01:08.500> guess<00:01:08.680> you'd

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
the most complex part of I guess you'd

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.970 
the most complex part of I guess you'd
call<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.280> verse<00:01:09.660> which<00:01:10.660> is<00:01:10.840> that<00:01:11.050> same<00:01:11.410> chord

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
call the verse which is that same chord

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.070 
call the verse which is that same chord
where<00:01:12.280> you<00:01:12.370> flip<00:01:12.580> off<00:01:12.790> fingers<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.690> sixth

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
where you flip off fingers and the sixth

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.130 
where you flip off fingers and the sixth
fret<00:01:14.350> of<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:15.430> 3rd<00:01:15.880> string<00:01:16.090> your<00:01:16.690> ring<00:01:16.930> finger

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
fret of the 3rd string your ring finger

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.550 
fret of the 3rd string your ring finger
is<00:01:17.350> in<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:19.290> 7th<00:01:20.290> fret<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:21.160> 4th<00:01:21.610> string<00:01:22.000> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
is in the 7th fret of the 4th string and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.200 
is in the 7th fret of the 4th string and
the<00:01:23.560> trick<00:01:23.860> here<00:01:24.250> is<00:01:24.310> that<00:01:25.270> it's<00:01:25.690> all<00:01:26.170> four<00:01:26.650> of

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the trick here is that it's all four of

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.420 
the trick here is that it's all four of
these<00:01:28.210> strings<00:01:28.780> its<00:01:30.090> fifth<00:01:31.560> fourth<00:01:32.560> third<00:01:32.680> and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
these strings its fifth fourth third and

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.420 
these strings its fifth fourth third and
second<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:35.320> in<00:01:35.470> order<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.740> make<00:01:36.040> this<00:01:36.369> work

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
second but in order to make this work

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.830 
second but in order to make this work
you<00:01:37.330> have<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:38.020> pick<00:01:38.530> up<00:01:38.800> down<00:01:39.040> up<00:01:39.369> down<00:01:39.400> on<00:01:40.090> all

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
you have to pick up down up down on all

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.580 
you have to pick up down up down on all
of<00:01:41.050> them<00:01:41.290> so<00:01:41.740> it's<00:01:41.979> down<00:01:42.310> up<00:01:42.670> down<00:01:42.970> up<00:01:43.690> down<00:01:43.840> up
