00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.509
 charette the choice of a charter 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.860
 the cottage and the pet that goes up that is to say that in animals 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.169
 before the majority of people had a dog 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.529
 the cat is overtaking the dog because the cat is discovered 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:22.749
 by the owners 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:26.699
 the cat is an animal that before with a reputation and a little bit to 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.179
 the Egyptian purchases so that he stayed away who could stay 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.750
 in his corner and that could interest a little lonely what 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.240
 is not quite dog behavior the cat is a companion we know 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.250
 the companion 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.880
 history many painters of many writers and this is the 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.990
 sharing companion dominating many families with many 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.910
 children 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.100
 the Jackal 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.540
 very wise but cats who also do a lot of nonsense 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.880
 the cat presented a montage in town of not she went out 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.030
 so he can stay clean one can go into his greenhouse life actually with 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.140
 that what is called the great fashion of sharing free time the chariot to stay 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.990
 three days at home with her bedding with her kibble without being 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.280
 obliged to keep or exits you move to a shelter 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.299
 % to choose your choice 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.000
 do not hesitate to contact a professional I know his 

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:18.160
 specificity 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.770
 in different breeds of cats you are going to have people in employment 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.850
 indeed 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.860
 the face a little bit more addressed with long hairs so with a 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.810
 maintenance the most common type a little bit more important you're going 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.060
 have Siamese who tend to locate him 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.660
 at a good stroke by Congolese abos a little more flashy you have 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.490
 other cats that are going to be a little bit more i will engage a little bit more 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.400
 exuberant 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.890
 so again depending on your lifestyle according to the family 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.950
 family composition with children grandchildren children 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.940
 taller 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.820
 it will be rather better to take this or that dog breed 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.380
 here again 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.510
 to choose a cat you have to take it once it has been socialist 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.560
 that is, rope so that your cat is at least 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.100
 eight weeks its affiliates over two months 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.310
 that they were weaned by her mother so that she could have him 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.940
 learn the first instructions of cleanliness year to his life 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.829

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.749
 for alain perrin almost realized different 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.619
 breeds of cats so beyond also inquire with 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:21.969
 professionals to dig up even 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.299
 and then there are also many tanks at what is called the choice 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.669
 classical European 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.529
 like what I have here today in arms 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:34.629

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.039
 not go through internet ads do not go through shops 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.790
 unscrupulous but not also advertisers between individuals by the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.450
 Danish from our veterinarians acquire emanates from good old gutter cat 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.229

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:01.959
 recognized and complete in retirement homes everything compared to children 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:02.719
 ill 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.959
 like a time energy channelers and the cat and the soothing animal by 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:08.989
 Excellency 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.969
 so do not hesitate in these levels 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.350
 a chara and the new hitch the pet going up 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.130
 who exceeded the dog in terms of pet ownership in France 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.750
 and when the cat is a sociable animal is a sharing animal 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:24.829
 in Cairo
