good shake I'm shaking it so cold then
you<00:02:01.840> pull<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:03.130> headliner<00:02:03.520> down<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:03.970> just<00:02:04.000> pops

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
you pull the headliner down it just pops

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.040 
you pull the headliner down it just pops
right<00:02:04.480> down<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:05.100> flexes<00:02:06.100> enough<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.640> where<00:02:07.050> you

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
right down it flexes enough to where you

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.820 
right down it flexes enough to where you
don't<00:02:08.259> really<00:02:08.349> have<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.619> worry<00:02:08.739> about

don't really have to worry about

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.790 
don't really have to worry about
breaking<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.569> then<00:02:10.659> what<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:10.869> did<00:02:10.989> was<00:02:11.200> I

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
breaking it and then what I did was I

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.600 
breaking it and then what I did was I
got<00:02:12.250> up<00:02:12.489> on<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.640> roof<00:02:12.909> up<00:02:13.239> here<00:02:14.019> I<00:02:14.200> put<00:02:15.099> masking

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
got up on the roof up here I put masking

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.759 
got up on the roof up here I put masking
tape<00:02:15.819> all<00:02:16.060> along<00:02:16.599> and<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.900> will<00:02:17.080> try<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.319> include

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
tape all along and I will try to include

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.890 
tape all along and I will try to include
pictures<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.519> that<00:02:18.760> because<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.480> did<00:02:19.659> take<00:02:19.870> some

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
pictures of that because I did take some

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.589 
pictures of that because I did take some
