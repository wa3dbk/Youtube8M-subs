00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
video I'm going to be explaining how to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.810 
video I'm going to be explaining how to
get<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> Odin<00:00:28.349> strike<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.279> actually<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.730> very

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
get the Odin strike it's actually a very

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.540 
get the Odin strike it's actually a very
simple<00:00:30.660> process<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:32.189> might<00:00:32.430> be

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
simple process it just might be

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.790 
simple process it just might be
difficult<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.780> basically<00:00:34.230> as<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.649> see

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
difficult so basically as you can see

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.260 
difficult so basically as you can see
that<00:00:34.950> blue<00:00:35.130> briefcase<00:00:35.579> he<00:00:35.730> picked<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.090> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
kill an enemy while jumping so you have

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.610
