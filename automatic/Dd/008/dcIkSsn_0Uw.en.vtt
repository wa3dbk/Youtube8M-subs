runs<00:02:03.390> on<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.689> most<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.079> there<00:02:04.680> tend<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.100> Swami

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
runs on the most and there tend to Swami

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.490 
runs on the most and there tend to Swami
a<00:02:05.579> lot<00:02:05.880> more<00:02:06.090> than<00:02:06.360> Grenier<00:02:06.659> or<00:02:06.899> corpus<00:02:07.320> would

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
a lot more than Grenier or corpus would

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.380

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
so we do get to use life strike a lot

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.750 
so we do get to use life strike a lot
more<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.560> know<00:02:10.739> plenty<00:02:11.040> of<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.310> guys<00:02:11.459> run

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.570 
I guess as is spoil strike which I only
have<00:02:18.690> equipped<00:02:19.170> against<00:02:19.500> corpus<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> can

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
have equipped against corpus so I can

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.460 
have equipped against corpus so I can
smash<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.970> little<00:02:21.209> tin<00:02:21.360> can<00:02:21.569> helmet<00:02:21.989> in<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.290> lot
