00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
aiming for the lower shoulder I think I

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.530 
aiming for the lower shoulder I think I
hit<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> high<00:00:31.349> shoulder<00:00:32.000> pretty<00:00:33.000> sure<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
hit in the high shoulder pretty sure the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.910 
hit in the high shoulder pretty sure the
bullet<00:00:33.660> didn't<00:00:34.050> travel<00:00:34.230> through<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.590> animal

bullet didn't travel through the animal
but<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.550> can't<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:36.570> hundred<00:00:36.600> percent<00:00:36.809> on

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
but I can't be one hundred percent on

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.530 
but I can't be one hundred percent on
that<00:00:37.309> I'm<00:00:38.309> betting<00:00:38.640> he<00:00:38.700> got<00:00:38.910> lodged<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
decided I didn't like the red dot with

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.800 
decided I didn't like the red dot with
the<00:01:04.409> 3<00:01:04.619> x<00:01:04.830> magnifier<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> went<00:01:06.600> ahead<00:01:06.689> and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the 3 x magnifier so I went ahead and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.940 
the 3 x magnifier so I went ahead and
picked<00:01:07.020> me<00:01:07.140> up<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.530> really<00:01:08.520> inexpensive<00:01:09.950> bars

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
picked me up a really inexpensive bars

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.890 
picked me up a really inexpensive bars
good<00:01:11.250> scope<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.119> 3<00:01:12.990> 29<00:01:13.470> x<00:01:13.830> 42<00:01:14.720> like<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.840> said

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
good scope it's a 3 29 x 42 like I said

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.450 
good scope it's a 3 29 x 42 like I said
it's<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.170> cheap<00:01:16.439> scope<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.009> hopefully<00:01:17.310> this

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
it's the cheap scope but hopefully this

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.649 
it's the cheap scope but hopefully this
will<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:17.850> me<00:01:18.000> through<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> season

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
will just get me through the season

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.520 
will just get me through the season
maybe<00:01:19.049> more<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:21.259> noticed<00:01:22.259> we'll

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
maybe more if I like it I noticed we'll

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.010 
maybe more if I like it I noticed we'll
see<00:01:23.119> I've<00:01:24.119> considered<00:01:24.479> getting<00:01:24.659> rid<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
see I've considered getting rid of the

see I've considered getting rid of the
FLIR<00:01:25.229> had<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> blackout<00:01:25.740> after<00:01:25.979> this

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
FLIR had a blackout after this

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.789 
FLIR had a blackout after this
experience<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:27.210> was<00:01:27.450> very<00:01:28.080> disappointing<00:01:28.320> for

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
experience it was very disappointing for

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.240 
experience it was very disappointing for
me<00:01:29.060> to<00:01:30.060> watch<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> deer<00:01:30.630> walk<00:01:31.590> off<00:01:31.770> wounded

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
me to watch the deer walk off wounded

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950 
me to watch the deer walk off wounded
I'm<00:01:32.790> hoping<00:01:33.090> he<00:01:33.299> didn't<00:01:33.509> go<00:01:33.600> off<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.840> die

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
I'm hoping he didn't go off and die

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.980 
I'm hoping he didn't go off and die
somewhere<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.829> guess<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.100> might<00:01:35.250> never<00:01:35.369> know

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
somewhere but I guess I might never know

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.390 
somewhere but I guess I might never know
like<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.110> said<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.380> think<00:01:37.470> shot<00:01:37.890> placement<00:01:38.130> was

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
like I said I think shot placement was

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.550 
like I said I think shot placement was
an<00:01:38.520> issue<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.450> think<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.869> 30<00:01:40.140> i<00:01:40.200> still

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
an issue but I do think the 30 i still

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.069 
an issue but I do think the 30 i still
would<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.710> done<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> job<00:01:41.040> where<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.549> hit<00:01:41.729> him

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
would have done the job where I hit him

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.120 
would have done the job where I hit him
anyways<00:01:43.079> let<00:01:43.290> me<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.500> let<00:01:43.770> me<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:43.920> what<00:01:44.009> you
