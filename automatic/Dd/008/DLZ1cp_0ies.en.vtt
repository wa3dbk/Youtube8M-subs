 at the moment I do not have to pronounce 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.070
 millions 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.930
 we have not given all the possibilities 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.240
 so that for the dialogue they did not want 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.400
 of the home and the students we have to 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.010
 continue to manifest is the only way 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.660
 it is the only way where to the end 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.040
 until education is free is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.290
 impossible that you have to pay so much 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.720
 amount of money but they had if it 's 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 impossible because in other countries the 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.239
 Education is free and here in Chile I do not know 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.820
 why unfortunately there was never a 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.960
 return to real democracy a debt 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.489
 pending that I think the town 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.680
 Chilean as a whole feels it is 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.229
 say we are managing a model 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.519
 who left pinochet night died he died 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.540
 but nevertheless the model that 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.690
 established after the dictatorship 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.089
 military remains in force and more than ever and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.680
 very deepened in all the elements 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.680
 structuring of society

 ticket they also fought to transform 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.250

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.080
 when during the dictatorship a group of 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.970
 students as you claimed by 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.310
 the student ticket and they were 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.380
 disappeared were young people who left 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.319

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.949
 repression and death of manuel gutiérrez 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.380
 as a tribute in our school we say 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:45.020
 a minute of silence we learned by 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.319
 television and teachers and testimonials 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.900
 of camila vallejos of his struggle for a 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:53.810
 free quality education and without 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.909
 for profit because education is a 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.909
 fundamental right for all and must 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:01.909
 be equal to us from our 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:04.009
 player of interns and students 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:07.580

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:09.289
 I support that they do not surrender that soon 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.360
 return to resume their studies 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.819
 after they have triumphed in their struggle 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.550
 Greetings from Argentine students 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:20.979
 who are deprived of freedom and 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.979
