00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.779
 Hi, a lot of people ask me for 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.870
 reading movie songs I decided 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.889
 meeting that craving of photoshop prevents 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.340
 these tips 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.039
 then it 's every week on a different day from 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.289
 vlog from our comments I'm going 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.720
 to be here in this scene all white to 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.730
 It emphasizes precisely to our books and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.470
 They asked movie tips I'm going 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.720
 write a little about it on the blog is 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.090
 I 'm not a good person to give tips 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.030
 because I do not watch almost 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.980
 movies this I know there 3 in the year and very well 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.710
 selected at any time explained by 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.210
 that I will then owe you 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.530
 the more movies I watched something very 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.360
 interesting to be reminded that I 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.000
 I have seen earlier that I 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.090
 I came from this tip for you to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.890
 Music also already asks me for something. 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.570
 I have some things that I go 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.760

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.370
 I like to hear you speak then 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.180
 This little corner will be for the tips of the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.359
 fab we will basically start 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.309
 about books literature tips for 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.619
 to write anyway is what I want 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.799
 chat with you here 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.570
 And to debut, I want to talk about a book. 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.090
 that I read recently actually does 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.299
 a year I read but I re-read it because I 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.790
 I find it very interesting is the book the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.960
 incomparable jesus christ of the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:30.299
 PhD has run through it's phd that the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.579
 land of flame in theology and he is a 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.770
 so great a theologian so I really liked 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.049
 listen to what he preached he has a power 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 of huge synthesis then sometimes gives 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.310
 a lot of headache you heard him 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.090
 speaking preaching about the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.950
 Maybe I 'm stupid subject matter. 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.710
 has a very large synthesis power 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.320
 So he talks a lot in a few 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.509
 I think it's amazing who has this 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.420
 power of synthesis because a ceiling 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.100
 he had some sermons I liked 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.590
 a lot so once I asked him for a 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.509
 sermon that he had preached in the church 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.240
 the nascent Adventist University in 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.810
 interior of sÃ£o paulo he took over the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.759
 blind once and I said speak was 2003 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.760
 have idea 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.099
 This and last year I came across 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.049
 he and this request is his brother who 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.670
 I found the exploration fantastic and he 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.040
 crossed me fÃ¡bio remember that your 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.159
 Brother, you asked for another ten years, I remember. 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.110
 snow is that if it is so have now 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:30.260
 In my book, go and have a look there. 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.549
 I was the fact of this book that is not easy 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.349
 to find 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.870
 I do not know if it sells over the Internet has 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.340
 with the certainty that I did not pay I think 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.980
 which was 30 reais 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.480
 it's a very thin book, you'll read it 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.829
 wonderful reading the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.159
 knowledge you get about it 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.349

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.060
 they are incredible is the chance of you 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.159

 It's great for you to read so you know. 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.709
 You do not even believe in Jesus knowing 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.019
 a little more the historical aspect of 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.769
 His life if you do not believe and if you 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:15.530

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.220
 incredible dropped the marker there then beyond 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.519
