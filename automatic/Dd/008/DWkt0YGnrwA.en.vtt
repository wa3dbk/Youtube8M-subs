and I guess I'll do the setup on a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.520 
and I guess I'll do the setup on a
separate<00:03:27.569> time<00:03:28.700> not<00:03:29.700> during<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.090> vid<00:03:30.530> so

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
separate time not during the vid so

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.039 
separate time not during the vid so
