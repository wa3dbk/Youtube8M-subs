00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.000
 then removed the cape cars 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.130
 mass air flow sensor 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.310
 together with the case the sensor itself is located 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.690
 here here it is now we will try it 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:29.630
 rinse to remove it from the enclosure 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:33.290
 you can unscrew these two stars 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.470
 than this special key so why not 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.330
 we have therefore unscrew the usual 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.900
 pliers principle laid spinning 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.900
 easy and 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.790
 In principle, we will try to wash this thing 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:55.000
 look at the result of what happens here 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:03:03.440
 for flushing was bought 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:06.970
 what a regular carburetor cleaner than 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.090
 No, they do not have such an acetone Nitsche 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.350
 great carburetor cleaner means 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.980
 we will try to see what is out of this 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.980
 we will succeed 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:35.430
 then you will be promoted now 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:35.430
 take out the sensor will still try 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:47.549
 don't rush to anyone here 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:47.549
 why neatly quietly 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:04:01.500
 now here so neat for 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:07.650
 I think it's worth starting to wash the case itself 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.650
 here we will try the sensor now 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:17.189
 wash the sensor body itself to start 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.189
 experiment 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:26.940
 measure carburetor cleaner and try 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.710
 just fail 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:55.100
 wait for it to dry out and then repeat 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:05:00.270
 procedure again now take the sensor and 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:03.170
 then we will spill with you 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.170
 hole too
