farmers or - or rdp housing and other
starting<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.150> took<00:01:35.270> in<00:01:35.420> three<00:01:35.600> years<00:01:35.840> to

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
starting and it took in three years to

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.399 
starting and it took in three years to
get<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:36.950> where<00:01:37.070> it<00:01:37.190> is<00:01:37.280> today<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:38.050> yes<00:01:39.050> be

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
get it to where it is today and yes be

so
how<00:01:44.540> much<00:01:44.660> does<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.840> cost<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:45.320> mean<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.770> the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
how much does it cost I mean the the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.800 
how much does it cost I mean the the
shipping<00:01:46.460> containers<00:01:47.000> will<00:01:47.180> be<00:01:47.210> out<00:01:47.570> there

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
shipping containers will be out there

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.740 
shipping containers will be out there
yes<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.500> would<00:01:48.650> be<00:01:49.240> it<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.360> cheaper<00:01:50.720> than

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
yes it would be it is cheaper than

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.870 
yes it would be it is cheaper than
brick-and-mortar<00:01:51.290> yes<00:01:52.250> at<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.850> moment

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880
