petals daisies have quite a few some

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.259 
petals daisies have quite a few some
have<00:00:21.660> very<00:00:22.260> few<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:23.490> basically<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:23.939> talking

about any type of flower that has
several<00:00:29.699> straight<00:00:32.239> petals<00:00:33.239> radiating<00:00:35.360> from<00:00:36.360> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
several straight petals radiating from a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.209 
several straight petals radiating from a
basically<00:00:37.410> centered<00:00:38.149> circle<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:42.840> an<00:00:43.590> angles

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
basically centered circle and an angles

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.990 
basically centered circle and an angles
always<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.489> good<00:00:44.700> way<00:00:45.469> to<00:00:46.469> get<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.860> bit<00:00:47.640> more

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
always a good way to get a bit more

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.189 
always a good way to get a bit more
realism<00:00:48.680> get<00:00:49.680> your<00:00:50.390> your<00:00:51.390> light<00:00:51.600> source<00:00:51.870> we're

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
realism get your your light source we're

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.490 
realism get your your light source we're
gonna<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.530> top<00:00:52.860> left<00:00:53.219> slightly<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.090> front

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
gonna do top left slightly to the front

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.720 
gonna do top left slightly to the front
and<00:00:55.730> doing<00:00:56.730> some<00:00:56.969> little<00:00:57.510> curves<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:58.050> this

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
and doing some little curves like this

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.540 
and doing some little curves like this
for<00:00:59.730> your<00:00:59.879> shading<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.510> your<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:02.010> center<00:01:02.219> of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
for your shading on your the center of

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.270 
for your shading on your the center of
your<00:01:02.760> flower<00:01:03.260> gives<00:01:04.260> more<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> impression

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
your flower gives more the impression

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.980 
your flower gives more the impression
without<00:01:05.670> having<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.119> actually<00:01:06.390> draw<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.840> whole

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
without having to actually draw a whole

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.090 
without having to actually draw a whole
bunch<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> little<00:01:07.939> circles<00:01:09.799> but<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
bunch of little circles but what the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.570 
bunch of little circles but what the
pollen<00:01:11.580> part<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> flower<00:01:13.070> looks<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
pollen part of the flower looks like and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.890 
pollen part of the flower looks like and
you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.090> gives<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
you can see that gives you just the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.810 
you can see that gives you just the
impression<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> again<00:01:17.250> without<00:01:17.400> having

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
impression with it again without having

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.440 
impression with it again without having
to<00:01:17.909> draw<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.299> bunch<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.860> circles<00:01:20.240> put<00:01:21.240> some

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
to draw a bunch of circles put some

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.800 
to draw a bunch of circles put some
shading<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:22.020> some<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:22.590> petals

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
shading on some of your petals

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.510 
shading on some of your petals
you<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:24.960> your<00:01:25.140> basic<00:01:26.060> Daisy<00:01:27.979> or<00:01:28.979> sunflower

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you have your basic Daisy or sunflower

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
you have your basic Daisy or sunflower
sunflowers<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.390> several<00:01:30.689> layers<00:01:30.930> we'll<00:01:31.409> go

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
sunflowers have several layers we'll go

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.690 
sunflowers have several layers we'll go
ahead<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.740> I'm<00:01:32.040> going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.250> show<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.430> what

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
ahead and I'm going to show you what

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.289 
ahead and I'm going to show you what
that's<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.930> much<00:01:34.110> larger

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
that's like and they have much larger

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.859 
that's like and they have much larger
centers<00:01:37.310> they<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:39.210> layers<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.570> than

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
centers they have more layers and than

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
centers they have more layers and than
that<00:01:40.079> you're<00:01:40.439> gonna<00:01:40.530> go<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.770> show<00:01:41.009> shading<00:01:41.400> of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that you're gonna go to show shading of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.859 
that you're gonna go to show shading of
the<00:01:41.520> front<00:01:41.909> petals<00:01:42.299> onto<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:45.540> petals

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
the front petals onto the petals

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.740 
the front petals onto the petals
underneath<00:01:46.939> yeah<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:47.970> was<00:01:48.119> one<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.450> shading

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
underneath yeah I was one little shading

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.050 
underneath yeah I was one little shading
coming<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.229> from<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> center<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.369> well

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.130 

now<00:01:56.060> let's<00:01:56.240> try<00:01:56.420> something<00:01:56.869> that's<00:01:56.930> a<00:01:57.049> little

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
now let's try something that's a little

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.029 
now let's try something that's a little
more<00:02:00.189> complicated<00:02:01.189> or<00:02:01.789> seem<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:02.770> here<00:02:03.770> we<00:02:03.890> have

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
more complicated or seem so here we have

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.700 
more complicated or seem so here we have
our<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:05.810> course<00:02:06.049> if<00:02:06.289> you're<00:02:06.409> drawing<00:02:06.560> a

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
our of course if you're drawing a

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.990 
our of course if you're drawing a
particular<00:02:06.950> flower<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:07.520> probably<00:02:07.789> want<00:02:07.970> to

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
particular flower you probably want to

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.650 
particular flower you probably want to
get<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.149> photo<00:02:08.390> source<00:02:10.269> to<00:02:11.269> make<00:02:11.390> sure<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.599> get

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
get a photo source to make sure you get

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.210 
get a photo source to make sure you get
the<00:02:11.780> right<00:02:11.930> kinds<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.260> leaves<00:02:13.780> etc<00:02:15.040> now<00:02:16.040> let's

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
the right kinds of leaves etc now let's

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.330 
the right kinds of leaves etc now let's
say<00:02:16.340> we<00:02:16.489> do<00:02:16.610> something<00:02:16.849> like<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:18.069> lily<00:02:19.069> or<00:02:19.280> an

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
say we do something like a lily or an

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.620 
say we do something like a lily or an
iris<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:21.410> they<00:02:21.590> generally<00:02:21.890> are<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.459> lily<00:02:23.450> is

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
iris and they generally are a lily is

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:32.590 
iris and they generally are a lily is
like<00:02:23.840> basically<00:02:24.410> one<00:02:25.269> large<00:02:26.269> petal<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:32.510> a

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
like basically one large petal and a

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.660 
like basically one large petal and a
very<00:02:32.840> odd<00:02:33.049> shape<00:02:33.440> again<00:02:33.980> look<00:02:34.220> at<00:02:34.310> your<00:02:34.430> photo

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
very odd shape again look at your photo

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.350 
very odd shape again look at your photo
source<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.890> as<00:02:36.890> you're<00:02:37.640> looking<00:02:37.760> at<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.090> try

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
source and as you're looking at a try
