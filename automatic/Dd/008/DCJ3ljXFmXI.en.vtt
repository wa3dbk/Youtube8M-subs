00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.240 

my<00:00:30.150> most<00:00:30.330> interesting<00:00:30.890> experience<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.160> at

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
my most interesting experience here at

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.020 
my most interesting experience here at
Sinai<00:00:32.579> relates<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:34.010> 2009<00:00:35.010> h1n1<00:00:35.040> pandemic

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
Sinai relates the 2009 h1n1 pandemic

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.540 
Sinai relates the 2009 h1n1 pandemic
because<00:00:36.800> it<00:00:37.800> was<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.280> interesting

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
because it was really interesting

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.939 
because it was really interesting
because<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:40.019> was<00:00:40.140> another<00:00:40.350> time<00:00:40.440> where

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
because that that was another time where

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.889 
because that that was another time where
virality<00:00:41.519> was<00:00:41.940> also<00:00:42.300> kind<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
virality was also kind of in the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.139 
virality was also kind of in the
mainstream<00:00:43.110> media<00:00:43.470> because<00:00:44.190> there's<00:00:44.940> this

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
mainstream media because there's this

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.569 
mainstream media because there's this
new<00:00:45.420> influenza<00:00:46.350> virus<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.040> emerging

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
new influenza virus that was emerging

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
new influenza virus that was emerging
and<00:00:47.699> people<00:00:48.030> really<00:00:48.329> didn't<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:48.720> very<00:00:48.750> much

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and people really didn't know very much

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.780 
and people really didn't know very much
about<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.040> was<00:00:50.159> like<00:00:50.309> very<00:00:50.430> exciting

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
about it so I was like very exciting

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.590 
about it so I was like very exciting
because<00:00:51.300> well<00:00:52.460> dr.<00:00:53.460> Pelagian<00:00:54.089> and<00:00:54.329> Mount

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
because well dr. Pelagian and Mount

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.810 
because well dr. Pelagian and Mount
Sinai<00:00:54.839> were<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.040> first<00:00:56.220> people<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.670> be

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
Sinai were one of the first people to be

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000 
Sinai were one of the first people to be
able<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.269> rescue<00:00:57.540> influenza<00:00:58.470> viruses<00:00:58.860> so

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
able to rescue influenza viruses so

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.729 
able to rescue influenza viruses so
basically<00:00:59.370> take<00:00:59.670> DNA<00:01:00.089> and<00:01:00.540> make<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.110> virus<00:01:01.500> from

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
basically take DNA and make a virus from

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.039 
basically take DNA and make a virus from
that<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.790> is<00:01:03.059> very<00:01:03.210> interesting<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.900> see

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
that and so is very interesting to see

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.469 
that and so is very interesting to see
the<00:01:04.080> processes<00:01:04.680> people<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.430> kind<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.850> rushed<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the processes people I kind of rushed to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.990 
the processes people I kind of rushed to
rescue<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:07.110> virus<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.799> then<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.580> study

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
rescue this virus so then they can study

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.660 
rescue this virus so then they can study
it<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.380> fun<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
it and it was it's fun to be in that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940 
it and it was it's fun to be in that
like<00:01:11.880> unknown<00:01:12.390> period<00:01:12.990> where<00:01:13.200> they're

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
like unknown period where they're

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.060 
like unknown period where they're
working<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.720> biosafety<00:01:16.470> level<00:01:17.040> 3

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
working in the but the biosafety level 3

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.420 
working in the but the biosafety level 3
lab<00:01:17.960> because<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.500> no<00:01:20.009> one<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.250> really

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
lab because it's like no one was really

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.700 
lab because it's like no one was really
sure<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.329> was<00:01:21.540> your<00:01:22.229> run<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.590> mill

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
sure if this was your run of the mill

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.060 
sure if this was your run of the mill
influenza<00:01:23.640> or<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.140> dangerous<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.500> that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
influenza or this a dangerous one that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.890 
influenza or this a dangerous one that
really<00:01:26.340> needed<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.150> taken<00:01:27.659> care<00:01:27.869> of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
really needed to be like taken care of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.249 
really needed to be like taken care of
and<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:29.159> was<00:01:29.549> cool<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.020> lab

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and so it was cool to like here in lab

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.889 
and so it was cool to like here in lab
Ian's<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.340> pretty<00:01:33.180> much<00:01:33.360> up<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
Ian's in here like pretty much up to the

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.410 
Ian's in here like pretty much up to the
minute<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:35.130> updates<00:01:35.700> about<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.299> was

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
minute like updates about what was

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.880 
minute like updates about what was
happening<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.899> this<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.409> think<00:01:37.469> it's<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
happening with this I think it's a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.739 
happening with this I think it's a
graduate<00:01:38.280> student<00:01:38.399> sometimes<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.299> tend

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
graduate student sometimes you can tend

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:42.169 
graduate student sometimes you can tend
to<00:01:39.929> get<00:01:40.079> wrapped<00:01:40.530> up<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:40.950> like<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.969> own

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
to get wrapped up in like your own

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.230 
to get wrapped up in like your own
little<00:01:42.509> small<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.859> by<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:44.819> me<00:01:44.939> I'd<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.210> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
little small like by for me I'd be a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.359 
little small like by for me I'd be a
virus<00:01:45.689> micro<00:01:46.139> in<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.409> world<00:01:46.679> then<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.039> kind<00:01:47.249> of

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
virus micro in a world then it's kind of

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.980 
virus micro in a world then it's kind of
it's<00:01:47.880> nice<00:01:48.060> living<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.479> New<00:01:48.600> York<00:01:48.659> City

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it's nice living in New York City

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.080 
it's nice living in New York City
because<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.439> step<00:01:49.710> outside<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.579> kind<00:01:50.909> of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
because you step outside and you kind of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.120 
because you step outside and you kind of
gives<00:01:51.719> you<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.869> nice<00:01:51.990> context<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> work

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
gives you a nice context for the work

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.489 
gives you a nice context for the work
you're<00:01:53.340> doing<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.789> can<00:01:53.969> see<00:01:54.179> like<00:01:54.450> how<00:01:55.139> you're

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
you're doing you can see like how you're

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.279 
you're doing you can see like how you're
you're<00:01:56.399> contributing<00:01:56.789> to<00:01:57.569> this<00:01:57.689> little<00:01:58.049> thing

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
you're contributing to this little thing

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.739 
you're contributing to this little thing
but<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:59.189> fitting<00:01:59.579> into<00:01:59.729> like<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> big<00:02:00.240> picture

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:00.749 
but it's fitting into like a big picture

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.899 
but it's fitting into like a big picture
and<00:02:00.929> it's<00:02:01.139> like<00:02:01.350> things<00:02:02.340> aren't<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.880> well

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and it's like things aren't going well

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.760 
and it's like things aren't going well
if<00:02:03.270> they're<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.719> you're<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.409> not<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
if they're going you're it's not the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.499 
if they're going you're it's not the
end-all<00:02:05.159> be-all<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.119> they're<00:02:06.270> going

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
end-all be-all but if they're going

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.719 
end-all be-all but if they're going
great<00:02:06.840> then<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.259> kind<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.709> celebrate<00:02:08.520> it

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
great then you can kind of celebrate it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.050 
great then you can kind of celebrate it
in<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.119> great<00:02:09.750> city<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.140> New<00:02:10.530> York<00:02:10.679> City<00:02:10.950> is

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
in the great city that New York City is

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.400 
in the great city that New York City is
so<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.240> unique<00:02:12.630> about<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.990> cert<00:02:13.200> program

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so it's unique about the cert program

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.360 
so it's unique about the cert program
about<00:02:13.890> Sian<00:02:14.220> eyes<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.910> we<00:02:15.690> are<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.410> standalone

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
about Sian eyes that we are a standalone

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.790 
about Sian eyes that we are a standalone
medical<00:02:17.850> institution<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.840> when<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.200> come<00:02:19.530> as

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
medical institution so when you come as

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.020 
medical institution so when you come as
undergrads

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
undergrads

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.630 
undergrads
I<00:02:21.060> think<00:02:21.300> there's<00:02:21.480> 15<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.110> them<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.069> you're

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
I think there's 15 of them and so you're

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.300 
I think there's 15 of them and so you're
basically<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.120> only<00:02:24.420> 15<00:02:24.990> undergrads<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:25.860> at

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
basically the only 15 undergrads on at

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.790 
basically the only 15 undergrads on at
the<00:02:26.790> Mount<00:02:26.970> Sinai<00:02:27.180> campus<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.560> think

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
the Mount Sinai campus and so I think

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.280 
the Mount Sinai campus and so I think
that's<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.160> very<00:02:29.490> your<00:02:30.120> you're<00:02:30.690> not<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:31.050> a

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
that's like very your you're not like a

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.500 
that's like very your you're not like a
faceless<00:02:31.890> undergrad<00:02:32.490> in<00:02:32.700> an<00:02:32.790> institution<00:02:33.420> of

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
faceless undergrad in an institution of

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.080 
faceless undergrad in an institution of
like<00:02:33.660> 15,000<00:02:34.560> people<00:02:34.920> but<00:02:35.099> you're<00:02:35.490> you're

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
like 15,000 people but you're you're

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.860 
like 15,000 people but you're you're
like<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.510> undergrads<00:02:37.319> at<00:02:37.590> Sinai
