00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 it's everybody in this video I 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.290
 will show you how to play them 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.750
 water and soil chords 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.750
 so let's go then the water rope 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.120
 to start you will see there are 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.860
 several ways of doing things 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.150
 to block the ropes in doing you 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.740
 because when you see on diagram 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.869
 that there is salt in you see that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.340
 the milgram accord to a cross on it 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.250
 so we will not play it and I'll go 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.840
 actually show way to get to 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.000
 block this rope and therefore play your 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.000
 agree in a clean way but I 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.610
 started with the position already so we 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.110
 to our canceled in case this 3 on a 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.670
 body from there 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.570
 then our major will come in class 2 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:44.000
 on a dream body 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.000
 and our index will come in box 1 52 6 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.900
 this is your agreement of C major then 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.110
 when I told you little 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.460
 particularity about this agreement there is the 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.200
 minecraft rope that will not be able 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.090
 play there are several solutions for this 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.830
 agree nothing to two in fact 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.180
 without requiring the thumb as I go 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.309
 show on from previous test 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.120
 video sent a body of migrants 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.120
 had been affected 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.310
 is 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.020
 when you see it we have the finger the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.670
 ours our annular which is close in 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 made the milram accord is what we 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.670
 will try to do if you have a 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.259
 classic for example or if you 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.820
 do not get your thumb up 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.860
 just shift it a little bit towards the 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.119
 high just to brush the rope half 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.450
 clusters you see people like it on 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.299
 push one go and foil like that like 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.880
 that's going to suffocate just by positioning 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.080
 a little further up our ring finger we 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.850
 would have meerab's agreement to smother him 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.909
 finally if you take this habit as soon 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.840
 the beginning you will not have any problem after 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.020
 that's why I'm showing you 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.640
 now if we're right and it's 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.960
 show the ways to play clean 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.000
 because often it's like I say 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.550
 again the crosses on the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.840
 agreements and the trend in paris fergal 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.399
 so we play all the strings we say 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.960
 we put our agreement full right of 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.990
 to doubt rope but this is not the case and 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.460
 so there by pushing another ring finger 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.170
 a little above we will expand our 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.140
 bodies of migrants and therefore we will 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.780
 play especially 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.920
 and without thinking as yet peugeot the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.340
 right hand she will be choked so she 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.340
 will not sound 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.420
 that's the way with the ring finger and 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.120
 if not, but the thumb if I arrived we have 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.920
 could not of course we just do it 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.840
 same pose just touch the rope 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.000
 to double them as you see she 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.560
 sum of time then for the rest very 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.530
 classic ever closer to the frets 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.750
 possible to be careful that the wrist 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.960
 to be well like that we are 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.650
 fingers then the most lose nico 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.780
 perpendicular possible to the sleeves 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.380
 so that all our sony strings 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.880
 I do not like that you do not know 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.319
 see the part still vegetables we 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.060
 are 20 because you can 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.450
 perpendicular 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.450
 it's good 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.950
 this is your back deal and now 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.590
 the the ground agreement there will be two of 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.430
 two ways to do it and I'm going to 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.200
 show that then the ground rope actually 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.639
 he is playing fairs three fingers x 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.200
 4 actually what's called me this 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.700
 that I call the complete ground rope in 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.579
 did I show the first phase have 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.920
 so the first passion we start with 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.000
 hi hello my parents do not handle 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.530
 in box 3 on the serious mine rope our 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.739
 index will give in box 2 on the rope of 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:25.049
 the and then in a third must this 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.970
 will be the night yesterday clement kas 3 52 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.860
 million ground accord 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.890
 often dreaded by beginners it's 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.120
 not obvious at the beginning placed that one 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.970
 it is especially the sequences which poses 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.650
 problem but I will show in a 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.569
 next video also how can we 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.220
 working right now I'm talking to you 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.720
 already from the position of the agreements so 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.580
 your soil 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.320
 this is called soil finally the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.460
 classic jump let's say where there is that 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.410
 three days as you see 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.340
 again must perpendicular 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.260
 on the sleeves or closer to the frets 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.030
 and you pay attention to both keys 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.110
 floor body there you see full of 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.849
 empty ropes in the middle it must be well 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.680
 that it sounds molly and no cross ya 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.810
 although circles on this pattern we do not 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.370
 eat the ropes on the floor 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.349
 that's our agreement only two to three 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.400
 fingers one can also play and at 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.220
 the less I play often like that 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.640
 besides four fingers and in fact one 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.440
 just go at the beginning we start with our 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.139
 major in case this June 3 when dominate 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.110
 then the nex still down 50 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.700
 of the and ste foy will come now 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.590
 be canceled in case this 3 it connects 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.030
 of 6 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.560
 and the little finger will complete 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.620
 the agreement in class 3 on accor of 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.620
 lemon balm and that's your soil accord 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.050
 when once closer charges 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.950
 perpendicular that we hear well everything 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.650
 the gloves 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.270
 and to give you an idea it sounds ya 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.770
 not a language a huge difference 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.940
 between the two chords I make you 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.090
 to unite and where you want not 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.090
 even 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.150
 and if I agree three fingers 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.150
 gr 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.740
 and both are good and coffee them 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.469
 sail the ground to play it a 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.460
 way of law you will not have any 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:15.949
 problem with that 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.120
 the complete floor in fact with both 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.439
 fingers is that sometimes we have 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.059
 songs or indeed we will leave our 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:21.379
 just two fingers I give you a 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:23.719
 example quickly done or in a role by 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.249
 example of oasis both fingers like 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:27.729
 it will remain everyone's song in 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.729
 this occasion 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.529
 the console will be super efficient because 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.569
 we have our floor complete with both 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:44.909
 fingers that do not move the song 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.860
 it's a broken particular if game for 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.229
 show why we can use this soil 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.589
 complete so that's for the doha deal 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.589
 and the soil
