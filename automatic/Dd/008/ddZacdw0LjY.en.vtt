00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
but I have to say this one in my opinion

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.610 
but I have to say this one in my opinion
certainly<00:03:31.450> deserves<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.840> four<00:03:32.109> maybe<00:03:32.530> even

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
certainly deserves a four maybe even

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.080 
certainly deserves a four maybe even
four<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.040> half<00:03:33.099> it's<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.670> really<00:03:33.970> great

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
four and a half it's a really great

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.619 
four and a half it's a really great
whole<00:03:34.329> figure<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.720> like<00:03:35.109> it<00:03:35.639> I<00:03:36.639> particularly

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
whole figure I like it I particularly

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.890 
whole figure I like it I particularly
like<00:03:37.840> how<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.109> fact<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:38.889> is<00:03:39.389> very<00:03:40.389> iconic

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
like how the fact that it is very iconic

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.500 
like how the fact that it is very iconic
and<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.500> way<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.769> Hulk<00:03:41.949> looks<00:03:42.299> this<00:03:43.299> is

and the way the Hulk looks this is

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.439 
and the way the Hulk looks this is
probably<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.109> way<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:45.060> remember<00:03:46.060> our<00:03:46.180> picture

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
again this is certainly something that

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:26.430 
again this is certainly something that
gives<00:05:22.120> it<00:05:22.210> more<00:05:22.389> like<00:05:22.599> the<00:05:22.810> like<00:05:23.409> the<00:05:25.440> iconic

put on him you could have just attached
to<00:07:10.910> him<00:07:11.300> I<00:07:11.480> think<00:07:12.170> you<00:07:12.320> could<00:07:12.530> come<00:07:12.860> up<00:07:12.980> with

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.100 
to him I think you could come up with

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.610 
to him I think you could come up with
some<00:07:13.220> really<00:07:13.610> great<00:07:13.880> poses<00:07:14.390> of<00:07:14.750> the<00:07:15.410> Hulk

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:15.620 
some really great poses of the Hulk

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.530 
some really great poses of the Hulk
maybe<00:07:15.920> you<00:07:16.490> know<00:07:16.550> rearing<00:07:17.030> up<00:07:17.180> after

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:17.540 
maybe you know rearing up after

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.900 
maybe you know rearing up after
transforming<00:07:18.050> I<00:07:18.470> don't<00:07:19.160> know<00:07:19.250> if<00:07:19.430> I've<00:07:19.670> ever

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:19.910 
transforming I don't know if I've ever

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.050 
transforming I don't know if I've ever
seen<00:07:20.210> that<00:07:20.270> on<00:07:20.720> a<00:07:20.750> Hulk<00:07:21.140> figure<00:07:21.470> so<00:07:21.650> far<00:07:21.950> but<00:07:22.760> if

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.060 
seen that on a Hulk figure so far but if

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.940 
seen that on a Hulk figure so far but if
they<00:07:23.240> were<00:07:23.300> to<00:07:23.570> do<00:07:23.750> one<00:07:23.960> that<00:07:24.320> would<00:07:24.590> really

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:24.950 
they were to do one that would really

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.030 
they were to do one that would really
really<00:07:25.250> be<00:07:25.640> cool<00:07:26.000> and<00:07:26.410> and<00:07:27.410> I<00:07:27.710> think<00:07:27.770> you<00:07:27.920> go

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:28.040 
really be cool and and I think you go

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.090 
really be cool and and I think you go
really<00:07:28.280> well<00:07:28.460> with<00:07:28.520> this<00:07:28.760> Hulk<00:07:29.380> so<00:07:30.380> taking<00:07:31.070> a

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.100 
really well with this Hulk so taking a

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.580

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590 
look you know we've got the building

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.810 
look you know we've got the building
instructions<00:07:33.950> for<00:07:34.100> Galactus<00:07:34.430> which<00:07:34.580> will<00:07:34.700> do

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:34.820

kind<00:07:37.580> of<00:07:37.730> looked<00:07:37.880> at<00:07:38.919> other<00:07:39.919> than<00:07:40.070> that<00:07:40.250> it's

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.580 
kind of looked at other than that it's

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.090 
kind of looked at other than that it's
it's<00:07:41.120> just<00:07:41.360> a<00:07:41.480> nice<00:07:41.720> variant<00:07:42.230> I<00:07:42.410> would<00:07:42.890> say<00:07:43.010> if

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.100 
it's just a nice variant I would say if

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.590 
it's just a nice variant I would say if
you're<00:07:43.220> looking<00:07:43.520> for<00:07:43.700> a<00:07:43.760> first<00:07:44.210> appearance
