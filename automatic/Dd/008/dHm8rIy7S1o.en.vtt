like before I think of anything I just

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.050 
like before I think of anything I just
keep<00:00:34.680> moving<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.400> way<00:00:37.760> my<00:00:38.760> father

which gives a better protection but my

which gives a better protection but my
father<00:00:51.150> always<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:52.260> makes<00:00:52.500> something

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
father always what makes something

son<00:01:11.660> this<00:01:12.660> is<00:01:12.870> hard<00:01:13.080> work<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:15.260> if<00:01:16.260> it's<00:01:16.620> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
son this is hard work on so if it's a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.399 
son this is hard work on so if it's a
little<00:01:17.730> smaller<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.690> could<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.080> better<00:01:19.260> to

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
little smaller it could be better to

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.080 
little smaller it could be better to
your<00:01:19.710> head<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:20.190> so<00:01:20.940> let's<00:01:21.360> make<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.780> better

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
your head now so let's make it better

let me make it more comfortable let make

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.740 
let me make it more comfortable let make
it<00:01:27.510> in<00:01:27.690> their<00:01:27.870> nature<00:01:28.050> to<00:01:28.230> your<00:01:28.470> head<00:01:29.570> let's<00:01:30.570> do

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
it in their nature to your head let's do

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.590 
it in their nature to your head let's do
that<00:01:30.900> now<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.520> kind<00:01:32.760> of<00:01:32.880> words<00:01:33.120> as<00:01:33.360> we

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
that now so that kind of words as we

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.680 
that now so that kind of words as we
keep<00:01:33.840> giving<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.530> me<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:35.820> my<00:01:36.000> body<00:01:36.210> my

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
keep giving to me so it was my body my

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.350 
keep giving to me so it was my body my
blood<00:01:37.460> after<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.810> took<00:01:39.810> over<00:01:40.050> him<00:01:40.670> it's<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:42.330> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
blood after I took over him it's like a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.710 
blood after I took over him it's like a
