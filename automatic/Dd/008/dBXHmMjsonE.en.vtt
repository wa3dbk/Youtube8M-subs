not make a mortal kombat game you know
our<00:02:56.570> real<00:02:56.750> goal<00:02:56.930> is<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.170> give<00:02:57.320> this<00:02:57.440> game<00:02:57.650> its

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
our real goal is to give this game its

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.930 
our real goal is to give this game its
own<00:02:57.920> identity<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.460> really<00:02:58.730> kind<00:02:58.880> of

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
own identity and really kind of

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.820 
own identity and really kind of
separated<00:02:59.330> from<00:02:59.420> Mortal<00:02:59.690> Kombat<00:03:00.020> so<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.650> was<00:03:00.770> a

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
separated from Mortal Kombat so it was a

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.990 
separated from Mortal Kombat so it was a
completely<00:03:01.130> different<00:03:01.490> button<00:03:01.730> scheme

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
completely different button scheme

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.210 
completely different button scheme
completely<00:03:02.540> different<00:03:02.840> blocking<00:03:03.260> scheme<00:03:03.590> you

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
completely different blocking scheme you

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.010 
completely different blocking scheme you
know<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:04.670> much<00:03:04.940> bigger<00:03:05.210> and<00:03:05.330> scale<00:03:05.750> as<00:03:05.990> a

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
know this is much bigger and scale as a

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.890 
know this is much bigger and scale as a
lot<00:03:06.230> more<00:03:06.380> epic<00:03:06.890> kind<00:03:07.160> of<00:03:07.310> cinematic<00:03:08.120> events

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
lot more epic kind of cinematic events

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.270 
lot more epic kind of cinematic events
where<00:03:09.050> as<00:03:09.140> mortal<00:03:09.410> kombat<00:03:09.710> was<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.860> little<00:03:10.130> more

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
where as mortal kombat was a little more

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.550 
where as mortal kombat was a little more
tighter<00:03:10.970> this<00:03:11.300> has<00:03:11.480> multiple<00:03:11.690> arenas<00:03:12.380> and

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
tighter this has multiple arenas and

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.140 
tighter this has multiple arenas and
whatnot<00:03:12.800> so<00:03:12.830> it's<00:03:13.130> very<00:03:13.400> separate<00:03:13.850> game<00:03:14.030> from

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
whatnot so it's very separate game from

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.120 
whatnot so it's very separate game from
Mortal<00:03:14.390> Kombat<00:03:14.690> well<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.530> makes<00:03:15.680> sense<00:03:15.770> with

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
Mortal Kombat well that makes sense with

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.950 
Mortal Kombat well that makes sense with
all<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.370> different<00:03:16.730> characters<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.780> these

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
all the different characters and these

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.520 
all the different characters and these
huge<00:03:18.320> ranges<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.040> power<00:03:19.220> schemes<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:20.530> so

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
huge ranges and power schemes and so

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.600 
huge ranges and power schemes and so
tell<00:03:21.709> us<00:03:21.740> tell<00:03:22.190> us<00:03:22.250> a<00:03:22.340> bit<00:03:22.370> about<00:03:23.410> what<00:03:24.430> how<00:03:25.430> did
