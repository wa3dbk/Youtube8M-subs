00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.490 
which is really amazingly drapey and I
think<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.359> is<00:03:07.419> the<00:03:07.569> probably<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.319> most

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
think this is the probably the most

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:18.020 
think this is the probably the most
modern<00:03:09.010> shape<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:10.169> lace

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.230 

like<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.930> know<00:03:19.370> addressed<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.580> always<00:03:21.000> the

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
like you know addressed it always the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.040 
like you know addressed it always the
value<00:03:21.600> as<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.080> person<00:03:23.040> wearing<00:03:23.370> or<00:03:23.940> let's<00:03:24.840> say

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
value as the person wearing or let's say

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.170 
value as the person wearing or let's say
differently<00:03:25.650> address<00:03:26.130> only<00:03:26.580> gets<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.000> value

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
differently address only gets the value

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.809 
differently address only gets the value
when<00:03:27.930> it's<00:03:28.110> worn<00:03:28.380> by<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.680> toast<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:29.640> always

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
when it's worn by a toast it's always

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.300 
when it's worn by a toast it's always
together
