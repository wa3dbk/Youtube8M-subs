now<00:00:03.149> that<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.480> first<00:00:03.810> two<00:00:04.049> layers<00:00:04.230> are<00:00:04.560> solved

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
now that the first two layers are solved

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.909 
now that the first two layers are solved
our<00:00:05.100> goal<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:06.089> solve<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.690> top<00:00:06.930> layer<00:00:07.259> which

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
our goal is to solve the top layer which

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.700 
our goal is to solve the top layer which
is<00:00:08.130> done<00:00:08.370> in<00:00:08.580> two<00:00:08.820> steps<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.540> first<00:00:10.139> step<00:00:10.320> is

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
is done in two steps the first step is

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.070 
is done in two steps the first step is
where<00:00:11.010> we<00:00:11.160> focus<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.730> making<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.240> yellow<00:00:12.750> cross

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
where we focus on making a yellow cross

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.580 
where we focus on making a yellow cross
in<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.700> step<00:00:15.000> one<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.660> tips<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
in this step one of the tips is that the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.740 
in this step one of the tips is that the
yellow<00:00:16.920> edge<00:00:17.160> pieces<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> top<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.480> face

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
yellow edge pieces on the top you face

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.439 
yellow edge pieces on the top you face
do<00:00:19.350> not<00:00:19.680> need<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.160> match<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.369> side<00:00:20.910> center

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
do not need to match the side center

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:21.890 
do not need to match the side center
pieces

not<00:00:22.320> yet<00:00:22.590> anyway<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.430> don't<00:00:23.550> worry<00:00:23.760> about<00:00:24.000> them

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
not yet anyway so don't worry about them

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.839 
not yet anyway so don't worry about them
our<00:00:24.990> first<00:00:25.439> goal<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:26.070> match<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.310> yellow

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
our first goal is to match the yellow

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.120 
our first goal is to match the yellow

the cubes in the solution guide

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.139 
the cubes in the solution guide
illustration<00:00:34.230> if<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.850> yellow

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
illustration if you have the yellow

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.750 
illustration if you have the yellow
cross<00:00:36.390> pattern<00:00:36.930> then<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.160> skip<00:00:38.399> this

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
cross pattern then you get to skip this

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
cross pattern then you get to skip this
step<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.780> move<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.500> second

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
step and you can move on to the second

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.150 
step and you can move on to the second
step<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.399> stage<00:00:41.700> 5<00:00:42.230> if<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.440> don't<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:44.010> the

step of stage 5 if you don't have the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.430 
step of stage 5 if you don't have the
yellow<00:00:44.340> cross<00:00:44.670> then<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.840> match<00:00:46.020> your

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
yellow cross then you have to match your

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.430 
yellow cross then you have to match your
cube<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> other<00:00:47.820> states<00:00:48.329> keep<00:00:49.230> in

cube to one of the other states keep in

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.139 
cube to one of the other states keep in
mind<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.039> gray<00:00:50.280> cubes<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149

mind that the gray cubes in the
illustrations<00:00:51.870> mean<00:00:52.620> those<00:00:52.949> cubes<00:00:53.460> don't

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
illustrations mean those cubes don't

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.200 
illustrations mean those cubes don't
matter<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.899> long<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.340> yellow<00:00:56.850> cubes

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
matter as long as you have yellow cubes

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.479 
matter as long as you have yellow cubes
on<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> top<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.109> face<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.100> can<00:00:59.280> match

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
on the top you face that you can match

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.729 
on the top you face that you can match
to<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> four<00:01:00.510> states<00:01:00.870> then<00:01:01.559> you're

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
to one of the four states then you're

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.189 
to one of the four states then you're
ready<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> sequence<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.969> moves<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.989> let's

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
ready to do a sequence of moves so let's

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.310 
ready to do a sequence of moves so let's
give<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.589> try<00:01:04.970> if<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.299> cube<00:01:06.600> matches<00:01:07.049> state

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
give it a try if the cube matches state

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.010 
give it a try if the cube matches state
two<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:08.939> two<00:01:09.299> sequences<00:01:09.960> of

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
two then you have to do two sequences of

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.980 
two then you have to do two sequences of
moves<00:01:10.380> first<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.760> need<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.450> state<00:01:12.720> 2

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
to do that we have to make all the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.870 
to do that we have to make all the
corners<00:02:46.660> yellow<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.430> let's<00:02:48.640> see<00:02:48.760> what

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
yellow cross and that's perfect then

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.830

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
your cube matches it then great job

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.890 
your cube matches it then great job
we're<00:06:18.909> almost<00:06:19.120> there

we're almost there

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.309 
we're almost there
so<00:06:20.259> we<00:06:20.440> can<00:06:20.620> move<00:06:20.740> on<00:06:20.949> to<00:06:21.159> stage<00:06:21.520> six<00:06:22.080> if<00:06:23.080> your

cube doesn't look like the illustration

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.180 
cube doesn't look like the illustration
then<00:06:25.509> you<00:06:25.659> need<00:06:25.900> to<00:06:26.050> see<00:06:26.259> where<00:06:26.500> you<00:06:26.650> messed<00:06:26.919> up
