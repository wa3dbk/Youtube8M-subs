 jumped on the windows 8 train 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.980
 the wetab is the current top model with

 HD resolution and is very bright 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.460
 But if you want something more with it

 well-known keyboard to dispose the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.679

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.969
 opened on the website that is natural 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.329
 but also extends the battery life 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.079
 of the device for a total of 13 hours 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.520
 works together evotec is very thin 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.450
 It feels very good to the alu optics 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.450
 is very noble 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:58.310
 the wetab rtl very much his 108 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.310
 It also has a keyboard dock and 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.930
 opened it offers a 10.1 inches 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.770
 big hd screen equipped 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.210
 but not with the normal one 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.760
 windows 8 version but with 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.370
 interested stripped variant the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.650
 intended for the arm processors 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.930
 that processor comes to a tegra 3 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.890
 use and 1 gb ram are installed 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.020
 Also, the tablet can be very 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.810
 easy out of the company 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.490
 it's just 83mm thin and weighs 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.190
 a little over 500 grams and is thus 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.430
 very very easy for a device this 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.430
 size 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.350
 the asus eee is one of the 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.259
 most unusual - sees eight models 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.429
 like a normal notebook 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.069
 but a convertible 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.229
 on the back is like here 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.259
 to see just another touchscreen he 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.369
 exactly the same content again 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.200
 shows in this case the device is 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.349
 relatively thin and also offers usb 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.810
 3.0 ports and is with current ivy 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:12.430
 bridge nuclear technology 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.590
 The screen can be equipped 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:25.390
 but not just the same content 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:29.319
 can show mode but can at 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.849
 just needs the content mirror or the 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.799
 so can expand the screen 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.349
 Example presentations are displayed 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:39.150
 and another content can be done at the same time 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.150
 on the inner display 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.180
 the ux21 is the newest representative of the 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.520
 his book series and has windows for the first time 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.800
 8 on it but also has 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.720
 another innovation with the windows 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.570
 8 operating system 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.000
 It's the first show with touchscreen 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.960
 input 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.340
 otherwise almost all specifications 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.560
 known 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.350
 it is still a 11.6 inches tall 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.340
 apps display with full hd resolution and 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.770
 it is still uncommon that the 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.340
 tour is backlit and in the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.340
 chic design 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.410
 The device is expected to still with 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.709
 the windows 8 instead of the market 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.709
 come
