00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.000 
significant time investment the answer
is<00:02:23.460> quite<00:02:23.760> frankly<00:02:24.090> as<00:02:24.390> I'm<00:02:24.600> concerned<00:02:25.110> no<00:02:25.710> as

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
the enemy team the kill timer so they

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.470 
the enemy team the kill timer so they
can<00:04:34.410> never<00:04:34.530> know<00:04:34.680> when<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.190> responds<00:04:35.790> meaning

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.870 
sneaky benefit is the ability to set up
future<00:05:16.230> dragons<00:05:16.770> specifically<00:05:17.370> that<00:05:17.550> fifth

future dragons specifically that fifth
one<00:05:18.090> earlier<00:05:18.870> essentially<00:05:19.650> by<00:05:19.800> taking<00:05:20.160> a

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
one earlier essentially by taking a

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.620 
one earlier essentially by taking a
dragon<00:05:20.520> earlier<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:21.060> increase<00:05:21.419> your<00:05:21.570> chances

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
dragon earlier you increase your chances

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.140 
dragon earlier you increase your chances
of<00:05:22.050> getting<00:05:22.350> that<00:05:22.650> fifth<00:05:23.010> dragon<00:05:23.280> earlier<00:05:23.850> too

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
of getting that fifth dragon earlier too

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.240 
of getting that fifth dragon earlier too
now<00:05:24.510> I<00:05:24.540> don't<00:05:24.720> personally<00:05:25.080> like<00:05:25.380> this<00:05:25.950> strat

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
now I don't personally like this strat

you're basically trading off some of

into<00:05:35.070> a<00:05:35.100> one<00:05:35.550> game<00:05:35.970> thus<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:36.960> early<00:05:37.200> game<00:05:37.440> is

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
into a one game thus the early game is

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.040 
into a one game thus the early game is
very<00:05:37.979> important<00:05:38.790> it's<00:05:39.210> also<00:05:39.450> worth

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
very important it's also worth

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.170 
very important it's also worth
mentioning<00:05:40.080> that<00:05:40.650> even<00:05:40.919> with<00:05:41.370> this<00:05:41.640> early

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
mentioning that even with this early

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.690 
mentioning that even with this early
first<00:05:42.450> dragon<00:05:42.900> you<00:05:43.320> are<00:05:43.470> not<00:05:43.770> guaranteed<00:05:44.490> the

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
first dragon you are not guaranteed the

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.430 
first dragon you are not guaranteed the
future<00:05:45.060> ones<00:05:45.210> like<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:45.840> mentioned<00:05:46.260> in<00:05:46.380> my

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
future ones like I mentioned in my

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.320 
future ones like I mentioned in my
previous<00:05:46.770> point<00:05:47.220> so<00:05:47.640> with<00:05:47.790> all<00:05:48.030> this

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
previous point so with all this

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.840 
previous point so with all this
considered<00:05:49.020> do<00:05:49.380> I<00:05:49.410> think<00:05:49.710> soloing<00:05:50.550> early

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
considered do I think soloing early

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.300 
considered do I think soloing early
dragons<00:05:51.210> is<00:05:51.390> worth<00:05:51.840> it<00:05:52.080> in<00:05:52.229> the<00:05:52.830> vast<00:05:53.160> majority

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
dragons is worth it in the vast majority

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.719 
dragons is worth it in the vast majority
of<00:05:53.760> cases<00:05:54.060> surprise<00:05:54.720> surprise<00:05:55.140> no<00:05:55.860> I<00:05:56.130> don't<00:05:56.490> in

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
of cases surprise surprise no I don't in

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.060 
of cases surprise surprise no I don't in
fact<00:05:57.270> I<00:05:57.450> think<00:05:57.690> Steve<00:05:58.140> Carrell<00:05:58.530> put<00:05:58.770> it<00:05:58.890> quite

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
fact I think Steve Carrell put it quite

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.580 
fact I think Steve Carrell put it quite
elegantly<00:05:59.610> when<00:05:59.940> he<00:06:00.180> said<00:06:02.630> however<00:06:03.630> there<00:06:04.380> are

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
elegantly when he said however there are

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.219 
elegantly when he said however there are
actually<00:06:05.370> some<00:06:05.820> champions<00:06:06.479> I<00:06:06.660> would<00:06:06.810> say<00:06:07.050> this

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
actually some champions I would say this

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.890 
actually some champions I would say this
is<00:06:07.380> a<00:06:07.410> viable<00:06:07.919> strategy<00:06:08.370> on<00:06:08.940> champions<00:06:09.810> who

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
is a viable strategy on champions who

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.750 
is a viable strategy on champions who
aren't<00:06:10.200> as<00:06:10.440> affected<00:06:10.860> by<00:06:10.890> the<00:06:11.010> negatives<00:06:11.580> that

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
aren't as affected by the negatives that

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.240 
aren't as affected by the negatives that
I've<00:06:11.880> mentioned<00:06:12.240> for<00:06:13.020> example<00:06:13.050> Master<00:06:13.919> Yi<00:06:14.100> and

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
I've mentioned for example Master Yi and

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.730 
I've mentioned for example Master Yi and
Warrick<00:06:15.060> these<00:06:15.570> champions<00:06:16.020> don't<00:06:16.200> need<00:06:16.470> any

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
Warrick these champions don't need any

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.980 
Warrick these champions don't need any
funky<00:06:17.280> rune<00:06:17.490> or<00:06:17.610> mastery<00:06:18.060> pages<00:06:18.570> they're

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
funky rune or mastery pages they're

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.930 
funky rune or mastery pages they're
solid<00:06:19.470> enough<00:06:19.680> jungle<00:06:20.160> clears<00:06:20.520> that<00:06:20.640> they<00:06:20.760> can

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
solid enough jungle clears that they can

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.810 
solid enough jungle clears that they can
catch<00:06:21.210> up<00:06:21.450> easily<00:06:21.930> our<00:06:22.260> terrible<00:06:23.070> early<00:06:23.669> game

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
catch up easily our terrible early game

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.190 
catch up easily our terrible early game
champions<00:06:24.330> so<00:06:24.479> I<00:06:24.510> wouldn't<00:06:24.690> be<00:06:24.780> pressuring

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
champions so I wouldn't be pressuring

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.070 
champions so I wouldn't be pressuring

anyone anyway and our great late game so

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.110 
anyone anyway and our great late game so
would<00:06:28.169> want<00:06:28.470> to<00:06:28.650> play<00:06:28.860> for<00:06:29.400> that<00:06:29.550> long<00:06:29.790> hall

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120
