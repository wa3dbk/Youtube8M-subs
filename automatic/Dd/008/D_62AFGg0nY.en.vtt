well<00:00:00.390> then<00:00:00.659> you'll<00:00:00.930> probably<00:00:01.199> need<00:00:01.469> something

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
well then you'll probably need something

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.300 
well then you'll probably need something
like<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.540> mazdaspeed3<00:00:03.540> it's<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.650> hot<00:00:04.980> hatch

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
like this mazdaspeed3 it's a hot hatch

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.490 
like this mazdaspeed3 it's a hot hatch
and<00:00:05.609> basically<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:06.690> means<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:07.049> get<00:00:07.170> space

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
and basically that means you get space

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.140 
and basically that means you get space
for<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.770> family<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.309> things<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.730> back<00:00:08.880> and

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
for a family and things in the back and

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.570 
for a family and things in the back and
a<00:00:09.660> missile<00:00:10.080> launcher<00:00:15.080> it's<00:00:16.160> mind-numbing<00:00:17.160> ly

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
a missile launcher it's mind-numbing ly

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.279 
a missile launcher it's mind-numbing ly
fast<00:00:17.910> 0<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.840> 100<00:00:19.170> km/h<00:00:19.260> comes<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.430> after<00:00:20.670> only

fast 0 to 100 km/h comes in after only

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.349 
fast 0 to 100 km/h comes in after only
6.1<00:00:22.289> seconds<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.039> then<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.580> continues<00:00:24.180> to

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
6.1 seconds and then it continues to

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.000 
6.1 seconds and then it continues to
sail<00:00:24.660> up<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> limited<00:00:25.650> top<00:00:25.949> speed<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.510> 250

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
sail up to a limited top speed of 250

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.330 
sail up to a limited top speed of 250
that's<00:00:29.010> limited<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.269> 250<00:00:30.929> meaning<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.890> could

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
that's limited to 250 meaning it could

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.900 
that's limited to 250 meaning it could
go<00:00:32.969> faster<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:34.170> why<00:00:34.440> Brian<00:00:34.829> Fong<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.460> his

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
go faster it's why Brian Fong and his

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.440 
go faster it's why Brian Fong and his
girlfriend<00:00:36.149> bought<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.829> power<00:00:38.450> it
