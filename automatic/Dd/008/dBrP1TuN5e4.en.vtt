00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
cooker but we're afraid to use one this

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.180 
cooker but we're afraid to use one this
is<00:05:22.669> thing<00:05:22.970> to<00:05:23.090> have<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.570> my<00:05:23.750> my<00:05:24.650> family<00:05:25.010> calls

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
is thing to have and my my family calls

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.050 
is thing to have and my my family calls
it<00:05:25.340> my<00:05:25.460> magic

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
it my magic

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.360 
it my magic
because<00:05:26.470> everything<00:05:27.470> I<00:05:27.560> cook<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.010> it<00:05:28.130> turns

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
because everything I cook and it turns

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.300 
because everything I cook and it turns
out<00:05:28.550> great<00:05:29.260> can't<00:05:30.260> say<00:05:30.560> that<00:05:30.800> for<00:05:30.830> the<00:05:31.100> stuff

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
out great can't say that for the stuff

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.190 
out great can't say that for the stuff
that<00:05:31.460> I<00:05:31.490> cook<00:05:31.669> on<00:05:31.790> the<00:05:31.820> stove<00:05:32.210> or<00:05:32.570> in<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.840> oven

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
that I cook on the stove or in the oven

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.780 
that I cook on the stove or in the oven
because<00:05:33.350> it<00:05:33.680> doesn't<00:05:34.010> always<00:05:34.250> turn<00:05:34.400> out<00:05:34.580> so

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
because it doesn't always turn out so

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.180 
because it doesn't always turn out so
wonderful<00:05:35.270> so<00:05:35.990> anyway<00:05:36.380> just<00:05:36.830> thought<00:05:36.950> I'd

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
wonderful so anyway just thought I'd
