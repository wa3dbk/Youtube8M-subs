00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.750
 i 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.799
 very good to all boys and girls who 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.269
 so I am poker and welcome to the next 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.369
 draghi floor of weapons today we go 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.020
 to talk about the pe of w is the first weapon 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.029
 that we are going to touch inside die 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.619
 raise you already know that there are four new 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.689
 weapons so let's start with this 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.220
 I'm a rifle, the first thing we found 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.110
 when we buy it is that it has 50 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.369
 hours of 200 main charger 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.470
 secondary that the truth that to do 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.350
 a super sic without improving are many 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.450
 bullets and more and good if we look good as 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.370
 kill with the double shot of course then 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.530
 the truth that is a rifle that can give 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.840
 what to talk about, not as you see we are in the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.090
 round 21 and that's a high knee for 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.830
 that a weapon without improving then it starts 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.180
 to cost and yet the pw 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.520
 hold on and the guy like a champion 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.460
 killing even more than some weapons 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.380
 improved let's not forget the asm ere la cab 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.190
 40 improved weapons that do not have much 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.050
 damage because it is directly or exceed 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.850
 without improving but good as you 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.040
 is what interests you exactly the same 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.070
 that to me the same thing we're going to look at what 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.780
 such is going to be improved and is called a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.250
 name quite long as you will see now 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.509
 below but good what we 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.119
 we fix is ​​that it has 50 bullets 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.470
 350 main charger and not half look 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.360
 that's why I had it 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.240
 to improve with haste because you know 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.800
 that do not last long and gave me the look that 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.360
 I call him the multiplayer that we 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.610
 fix the targets directly the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.230
 objectives but since she is a friend to me I do not 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.460
 calls a lot since it occupies all the 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.070
 screen directly returned it to 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.290
 improve and I took this is that good 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.490
 inside the hand because it is something better from 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.020
 my point of view that the one that occupies us 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.090
 of the screen we see a little more the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.800
 outline of things and we can see 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.320
 perfectly if we are going to be hooked by 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.960
 some side has 50 bullets of charger 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.610
 350 main secondary charger is 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.229
 say a total of 400 to be a 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.720
 subsidy I think it's your rifle with more 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.240
 fire bullets and let's face it 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.400
 we are in a round 24 25 26 more or 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.020
 less testing it and it kills practically 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.880
 a boot to the zombie ball that 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.470
 we had done nonetheless I stayed with 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.960
 a little bit of desire and I tried it at the end 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.910
 the last click from round 29 and good 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.380
 I can advise you that you owe it to 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.660
 buy to climb rounds as a weapon 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.490
 secondary or as you want nothing 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.320
 more guys I hope you liked the 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.940
 analysis we'll see in future videos 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.940
 be happy and until next time 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.480
 They are the Mayans 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.140
 do not
