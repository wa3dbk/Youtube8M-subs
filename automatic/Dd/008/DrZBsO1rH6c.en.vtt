so I said that large cases on it the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.290 
so I said that large cases on it the
reading<00:02:07.500> IIIi<00:02:08.190> don't<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.090> bike

reading IIIi don't like that this bike

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.900 
reading IIIi don't like that this bike
is<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:11.120> windscreen<00:02:12.120> too<00:02:12.720> much<00:02:12.900> noise

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
is the the windscreen too much noise

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.210 
is the the windscreen too much noise
turbulence<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.150> my<00:02:15.360> helmet<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:16.040> really<00:02:17.040> don't

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
turbulence on my helmet I really don't

like<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:18.560> but<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.890> think<00:02:20.760> when<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.570> change<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
like it but I think when you change the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.780 
like it but I think when you change the
windscreen<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.820> can<00:02:24.000> make<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.110> better<00:02:25.290> and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.360 

this<00:02:29.790> bike<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:31.290> can<00:02:31.440> cut<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.709> several<00:02:32.100> colors

it's<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.550> color<00:02:32.760> white<00:02:33.230> but<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.709> blue

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
it's a color white but I like the blue

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.340 
it's a color white but I like the blue
one<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.550> most<00:02:35.730> few<00:02:36.570> years<00:02:36.720> ago<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:36.989> make<00:02:37.320> a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
one the most few years ago I make a

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.030 
one the most few years ago I make a
movie<00:02:37.830> about<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.520> bike<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:39.200> in<00:02:40.200> blue<00:02:40.560> and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.550 

then<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.190> look<00:02:44.340> better

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.880 

this<00:02:49.560> bike<00:02:50.840> have<00:02:51.840> good<00:02:52.080> handling<00:02:52.500> on<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.709> road

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
almost high road speeds you can notice

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.530 
almost high road speeds you can notice
that<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.630> bike<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.860> moving<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:03.060> little

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
that the bike is just moving a little

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.320 
that the bike is just moving a little
bit<00:03:04.100> but<00:03:05.100> it's<00:03:05.760> very<00:03:05.940> easy<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.420> maneuver<00:03:08.330> let's

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
bit but it's very easy to maneuver let's

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:17.330 
bit but it's very easy to maneuver let's
create<00:03:09.900> about<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:10.380> bike

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.000 

for<00:03:18.600> real<00:03:19.600> off<00:03:19.870> reduce<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.590> back<00:03:20.710> is<00:03:20.860> made

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
for real off reduce the back is made

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.320 
for real off reduce the back is made
maybe<00:03:21.370> too<00:03:21.940> heavy<00:03:22.330> but<00:03:23.230> for<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.680> most<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:24.040> us

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
maybe too heavy but for the most of us

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.590 
maybe too heavy but for the most of us
riding<00:03:25.330> in<00:03:25.540> City<00:03:25.780> for<00:03:25.990> your<00:03:26.110> work<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:27.210> on<00:03:28.210> not

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
riding in City for your work and on not

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:39.160 
riding in City for your work and on not
to<00:03:28.780> bet<00:03:28.930> overall<00:03:29.710> it<00:03:29.950> will<00:03:30.070> be<00:03:31.000> good<00:03:31.240> enough

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.240 

now<00:03:40.170> we<00:03:40.230> have<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.500> 1200<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.480> lot<00:03:42.480> more<00:03:42.690> power

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
now we have the 1200 a lot more power

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.570 
now we have the 1200 a lot more power
110<00:03:44.250> horsepower<00:03:45.110> with<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.980> fuel<00:03:47.250> tank

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
110 horsepower with the the fuel tank

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.070 
110 horsepower with the the fuel tank
the<00:03:48.270> same<00:03:48.480> capacity<00:03:49.200> F<00:03:49.740> like<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.520> six<00:03:50.730> CC

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
the same capacity F like the six CC

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.310 
the same capacity F like the six CC
about<00:03:52.080> 23<00:03:52.920> litres<00:03:56.000> when<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.090> can<00:03:57.240> only<00:03:58.110> thing

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
about 23 litres when you can only thing

about 23 litres when you can only thing
I<00:03:58.440> really<00:03:58.770> miss<00:03:58.800> on<00:03:59.190> this<00:03:59.460> both<00:03:59.880> bikes<00:04:00.150> there

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
I really miss on this both bikes there

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.540 
I really miss on this both bikes there
is<00:04:00.960> no<00:04:01.760> gear<00:04:02.760> indicator<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:04.550> only

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
is no gear indicator on it and only

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.160 
is no gear indicator on it and only

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
trial for that have a fuel consumption

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.480 
trial for that have a fuel consumption
notifier<00:04:10.170> on<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.590> dashboard<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:13.010> when<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.040> use

driving<00:04:15.470> it's<00:04:16.470> not<00:04:16.709> too<00:04:16.830> hard<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.280> drive<00:04:17.820> about

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
driving it's not too hard to drive about

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.289 
driving it's not too hard to drive about
about<00:04:18.600> one<00:04:18.810> liter<00:04:19.019> every<00:04:19.290> 20<00:04:19.709> kilometres<00:04:20.299> but

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
about one liter every 20 kilometres but

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.510 
about one liter every 20 kilometres but
when<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.720> make<00:04:22.170> a<00:04:22.230> few<00:04:22.710> sprints<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:25.190> yeah<00:04:26.190> use

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
when you make a few sprints and yeah use

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.690 
when you make a few sprints and yeah use
the<00:04:26.550> power<00:04:26.850> then<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.990> ya<00:04:28.680> get<00:04:29.040> one<00:04:29.220> later<00:04:29.610> on

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
the power then you ya get one later on

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.810 
the power then you ya get one later on
50<00:04:30.180> kilometer<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:34.050> success<00:04:34.410> is<00:04:34.620> use<00:04:35.190> a<00:04:35.220> less

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
50 kilometer the success is use a less

fuel<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:37.710> have<00:04:37.830> really<00:04:38.160> have<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.430> push<00:04:38.669> it<00:04:38.790> to

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
fuel you have really have to push it to

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.380 
fuel you have really have to push it to
the<00:04:38.880> limit<00:04:39.210> then<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:40.700> get<00:04:41.700> that<00:04:41.820> that's<00:04:42.030> fuel

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
the limit then you get that that's fuel

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.960 
the limit then you get that that's fuel

it's<00:05:41.080> a<00:05:41.199> great<00:05:41.500> bike<00:05:42.389> but<00:05:43.389> I<00:05:43.539> think<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.020> BMW<00:05:44.680> is

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
it's a great bike but I think the BMW is

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.550 
it's a great bike but I think the BMW is
better<00:05:47.340> this<00:05:48.340> bag<00:05:48.639> has<00:05:48.789> also<00:05:49.000> a<00:05:49.180> set<00:05:49.810> of<00:05:49.840> a<00:05:50.050> club

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
better this bag has also a set of a club

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.559 
better this bag has also a set of a club
full<00:05:50.710> of<00:05:50.919> a<00:05:51.069> exhaust<00:05:52.029> it<00:05:52.840> sounds<00:05:53.229> great

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
full of a exhaust it sounds great

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.719

this<00:05:55.569> back<00:05:55.750> half<00:05:55.960> an<00:05:56.199> opportunity<00:05:57.159> you<00:05:57.430> can

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
this back half an opportunity you can

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.550 
this back half an opportunity you can
choose<00:05:57.969> them<00:05:58.150> the<00:05:58.330> mapping<00:05:58.750> of<00:05:58.870> the<00:05:58.960> engine

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
choose them the mapping of the engine

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.360 
choose them the mapping of the engine
and<00:05:59.729> I<00:06:00.729> like<00:06:00.969> the<00:06:01.150> T<00:06:01.330> mapping<00:06:01.659> the<00:06:01.779> most<00:06:02.370> then

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
and I like the T mapping the most then

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.019 
and I like the T mapping the most then
is<00:06:03.520> the<00:06:04.120> back<00:06:04.300> not<00:06:04.599> that<00:06:04.779> snappy<00:06:05.669> but<00:06:06.669> this<00:06:06.849> bag

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:07.029 
is the back not that snappy but this bag

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:09.119 
is the back not that snappy but this bag
has<00:06:07.210> better<00:06:07.449> software<00:06:07.900> an<00:06:08.110> old<00:06:08.349> version<00:06:08.680> area
