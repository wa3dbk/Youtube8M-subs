00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:15.599
 one day hello to all of us today 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.820
 there will be a video review on the phone at 10 c &amp; c 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.390
 type shortened version slightly by 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.490
 more budget than p10 will just be like that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.359
 unusual volume will tell everything 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.840
 right away 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.840
 and the part that I see so let's start with 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.730
 the fact that the phone is very similar to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.640
 south 3 and more specifically here this buttons 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.510
 which glows already stunned by the office 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.500
 by 5 and then alkaline let's start 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.100
 now yes a very smooth screen without 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.420
 some 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.809
 as long as I could or notches that is very well 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.949
 what's bad about the phone market display 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.899
 not to fit then here we have lateral 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.350
 edge to will be a little bit of work and 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.330
 this is also the back panel 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.479
 soft touch can't understand what it is 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.729
 something like black moto 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.180
 so very smooth to touch here type 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.270
 elephant painted 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.430
 8 megapixel camera but honestly 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.220
 then she and hysterical camera 5 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.920
 Itâ€™s better to occupy two megapixels 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:31.950
 LEDs are a little yellowish 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.950
 the speaker is loud enough but the sound 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.740
 it is not something that is straight sucks but 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.369
 bad so small there is still there 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.000
 scratch scratch bulge when on 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.640
 the table is the speaker does not close but 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.520
 it's only on the open I will not 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.020
 we have two slots below 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:00.630
 SIM card one micro another regular slot 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.530
 under micro sd and batteries for 1955 1905 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.869
 o'clock 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.960
 I want to say that the battery is pretty 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.520
 hardy then I'll show you 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.770
 the screenshot on the right is our sidebar 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.040
 ochku is 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.730
 under the tree a little bit for koshi on such 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:24.750
 small pictures of wood on the left 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.090
 us on the volume key and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.560
 unlocking by the way when favor with 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.410
 one hand is very convenient microphone and 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.480
 the phone is very very very thin 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.700
 when to whom do you show yourself speaks about 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:45.560
 which tank and cool key 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:50.000
 no key hole for panel removal 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.790
 2 megapixel front camera seems 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.440
 Generally on the phone that we have so included 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:02.120
 phone and so on the display immediately want 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.350
 to say that dice produce fucking shit 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.180
 frightened noticeable as soon as 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.280
 turns on 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.140
 juicy picture let's show you 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.260
 brightness 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.400
 brightness in general is awesome very 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.400
 very bright phone 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.140
 and let's go straight for the gland and then to 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.120
 the minuses and I'll start i made up 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:32.100
 cons this multitest 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:38.190
 the most important thing was written 5 points 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:39.600
 tangency 2 maximum two points of tangency and in 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.930
 nothing can be changed in the settings 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.600
 what appeared more like this one in general 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.850
 so 2 2 1 1 2 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:59.490
 this is the biggest minus then 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:04:03.810
 about antutu he is here he is here he is here in antutu 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:07.740
 gaining 18,000 44 points that's enough 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:17.370
 good so on the phone or background for 10 c 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:23.960
 android 4 4 2 processor us mt6582 video 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:26.250
 accelerator mali 400 mp4 to 540 to 960 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.580
 kind of small but 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:34.380
 pixel is not visible and a good indicator 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:37.620
 for video on on marconi deal but this and 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.120
 so clear superuser rights us 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.370
 No, I wanted to set the rights 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.460
 did not find the superuser found these 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.620
 programs and 4 then we will not take too 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:52.770
 helped us on 1 gigabyte operational 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:57.990
 memory flash drive we have here for 8 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:00.900
 gigabyte and seemingly more to say and 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:06.390
 nothing well, let's see further percent 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.730
 our quad to 13 240 pixels 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.660
 . 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.600
 pixel density like this 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.630
 front camera 62 miles character 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.350
 so spelled and another plus of this 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.760
 phone he almost does not heat up 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:26.310
 almost not heated there is one more 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.249
 update for on android 4 2 cute but i 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.839
 until 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:35.619
 case enforcement we have there further 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:37.599
 sensors sensors sensors sensors close 

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:40.509
 let's close the application let's 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:43.959
 listen to music since I'm a music lover 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:51.129
 i love music phone to music not 

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:59.319
 good at already equalizer leg want 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:06:01.959
 tuned to the sound that we have sound 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:06.459
 we have no base absolutely forest 

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:09.729
 top and middle for the main speaker 

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:12.219
 if it's ok then headphone over there 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.709
 complete garbage is generally shorter 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:18.539
 very terrible this is what I can say about 

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:21.369
 music then 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:24.129
 it's in music for iron everything is fine 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:26.649
 except me constantly 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.539
 the display blinks they constantly on happens 

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:32.349
 such that the display flashes in general from 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:35.639
 virus is a bad sound display flashes 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:38.649
 for some reason I do not know why it blinks and 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:41.289
 Today she and the cameras are so hard 

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:45.819
 C grade with a plus should now come up 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:48.429
 from cameras and well stop us 100 gr offer 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:51.149
 don't know that either 

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:51.149
 take a picture 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:00.160
 very fast shutter release 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:03.550
 I liked this one 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:07.450
 photography at the edges is sometimes not 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.830
 you can see it will be written normally there are texts 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.290
 very good at all 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.450
 cool phone 

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.150
 what else was looking for the battery I did not tell you 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:19.680
 how does the battery work 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:25.810
 so galleries screenshots 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:28.720
 it swung the crane works 7:30 and but it 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:32.110
 on a little brightness and so on and so on 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.700
 similar but generally up to 4 hours 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:37.570
 running screen minimum brightness 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.200
 very well, in principle, to say 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.910
 nothing more 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.930
