00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
here but obviously at least she is

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.990 
here but obviously at least she is
trying<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.599> three<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:17.739> is<00:02:17.920> my<00:02:18.099> main

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
trying to the three and this is my main

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.199 
trying to the three and this is my main
point<00:02:19.269> here<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:20.470> next<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.550> recoil<00:02:21.970> we

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
point here the next is the recoil we

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.390 
point here the next is the recoil we
didn't<00:02:22.420> practice<00:02:22.630> or<00:02:22.930> equal<00:02:23.290> last<00:02:23.650> week<00:02:23.890> but

didn't practice or equal last week but
then<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.640> realized<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.810> very<00:02:26.050> important

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
dart position as well don't treat if she
