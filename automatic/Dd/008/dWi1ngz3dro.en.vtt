this will bring up a new Finder window
in<00:00:48.750> which<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.860> should<00:00:50.190> find<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:51.149> file<00:00:51.420> that

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
in which you should find your file that

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.260 
in which you should find your file that
you<00:00:52.980> want<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:55.050> move<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> file

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
you want to move it to so I have a file

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.790 
you want to move it to so I have a file
called<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.670> I<00:00:59.670> want<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> move<00:01:00.149> this

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
called to this and I want to move this

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.250 
called to this and I want to move this
to<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> step<00:01:04.920> three<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.810> to<00:01:06.810> move<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
to this so step three is to move the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.600 
to this so step three is to move the
file<00:01:08.210> now<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> hold

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
file now to do this you have to hold

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.249 
file now to do this you have to hold
down<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:13.080> mouse<00:01:13.320> button<00:01:13.610> if<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.229> a

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
trackpad then it's just one finger and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.770 
trackpad then it's just one finger and
it's<00:01:20.340> holding<00:01:20.850> down<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:23.810> at<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.990> same<00:01:25.200> time

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
it's holding down and at the same time

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.560 
it's holding down and at the same time

and of the command button at the same

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.139 
and of the command button at the same
time<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.979> there<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.909> now

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
time and there you have it you have now

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.990 
time and there you have it you have now
moved<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.810> file<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.649> another<00:01:50.460> location

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
moved your file to another location

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.630 
moved your file to another location
within<00:01:51.479> your<00:01:51.840> computer<00:01:52.250> as<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:54.930> side<00:01:55.380> note<00:01:55.640> when

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
within your computer as a side note when

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.819 
within your computer as a side note when
you're<00:01:56.820> doing<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.960> computer<00:01:58.200> with

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
you're doing this on a computer with

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.600 
you're doing this on a computer with
only<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.280> hard<00:01:59.579> drive<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:02.070> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.460> be

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
only one hard drive it is going to be

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.340 
only one hard drive it is going to be
very<00:02:03.540> very<00:02:03.899> short<00:02:04.320> times<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:05.100> transferring

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
very very short times of transferring

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.690 
very very short times of transferring
this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.590> because<00:02:07.979> you're<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.250> actually

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
this is because you're not actually

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.570 
this is because you're not actually
moving<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> different<00:02:11.009> hard<00:02:11.280> drive

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
moving it on to a different hard drive

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.230 
moving it on to a different hard drive
you're<00:02:13.480> moving<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.990> on<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.580> same<00:02:15.850> hard

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
you're moving it on to the same hard

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.730 
you're moving it on to the same hard
drive<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.830> just<00:02:18.130> in<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.400> different<00:02:18.430> location

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
drive but just in a different location

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.890 
drive but just in a different location
when<00:02:20.740> you're<00:02:20.890> moving<00:02:21.070> files<00:02:21.850> between<00:02:22.300> hard

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
when you're moving files between hard

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.650 
when you're moving files between hard
drives<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:24.310> going<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.760> take<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:24.970> lot<00:02:25.360> longer

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
drives it's going to take a lot longer

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.050 
drives it's going to take a lot longer
and<00:02:26.170> that's<00:02:26.680> because<00:02:27.160> when<00:02:27.460> you're<00:02:27.610> moving<00:02:27.790> a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
and that's because when you're moving a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.960 
and that's because when you're moving a
file<00:02:28.330> onto<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.170> different<00:02:29.440> hard<00:02:29.830> drive<00:02:30.160> it's

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
file onto a different hard drive it's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.840 
file onto a different hard drive it's
actually<00:02:31.480> writing<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.110> file<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.740> in<00:02:33.670> this

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
actually writing the file and in this

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.600 
actually writing the file and in this
case<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.750> were<00:02:34.870> just<00:02:35.200> using<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.740> only<00:02:35.980> one

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
case we were just using the only one

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.960 
case we were just using the only one
hard<00:02:36.970> drive<00:02:37.860> which<00:02:38.860> means<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.400> was<00:02:39.580> just

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
hard drive which means it was just

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.920 
hard drive which means it was just
moving<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.620> placement<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.400> where<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.750> was

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
moving the placement of where it was

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.010 
moving the placement of where it was
inside<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.950> hard<00:02:45.190> drive<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.690> if<00:02:49.810> you're

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
inside the hard drive so if you're

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.740 
inside the hard drive so if you're
moving<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.470> big<00:02:50.710> file<00:02:51.010> from<00:02:51.430> one<00:02:51.700> hard<00:02:52.030> drive<00:02:52.270> to

another<00:02:53.110> hard<00:02:53.440> drive<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:54.100> will<00:02:54.820> take<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> lot

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
another hard drive it will take a lot

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.530 
another hard drive it will take a lot
lot<00:02:56.290> longer<00:02:57.870> then<00:02:58.870> moving<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.680> big<00:02:59.920> file<00:03:00.540> within

lot longer then moving a big file within

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.560 
lot longer then moving a big file within
a<00:03:01.660> hard<00:03:01.900> drive<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.640> within<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.850> same<00:03:04.210> hard
