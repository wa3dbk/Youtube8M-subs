nobody got this is gonna fit into there

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.680 
nobody got this is gonna fit into there
like<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.860> then<00:02:32.400> that's<00:02:32.670> what<00:02:33.030> spins<00:02:33.420> on

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
like that and then that's what spins on

then we got a little shim each here a

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.380 
then we got a little shim each here a
little<00:02:46.680> thin<00:02:47.010> piece<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.250> metal<00:02:47.549> be<00:02:48.150> able<00:02:48.299> to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
little thin piece of metal be able to

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.229 
little thin piece of metal be able to
put<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.750> onto<00:02:48.930> there<00:02:49.260> then<00:02:50.160> your<00:02:50.400> cover

cover fit and right onto there now your

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.699 
cover fit and right onto there now your
stem<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.720> gonna<00:02:57.900> hold<00:02:58.079> everything<00:02:58.410> together

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
stem is gonna hold everything together

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.970 
stem is gonna hold everything together
now<00:02:59.750> here's<00:03:00.750> where<00:03:00.959> things<00:03:01.200> start<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.680> get<00:03:01.920> a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
now here's where things start to get a

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.620 
now here's where things start to get a
trick<00:03:03.350> notice<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.530> little<00:03:04.829> lip<00:03:05.820> right<00:03:06.090> there

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
trick notice that little lip right there

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.750 
trick notice that little lip right there
we<00:03:09.630> got<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.870> take<00:03:10.049> up<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.410> lip<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:12.090> now<00:03:12.209> that

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
we got to take up that lip so now that

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.590 
we got to take up that lip so now that
that<00:03:14.760> leads<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.390> our<00:03:16.880> shims<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.209> we'll<00:03:18.420> take

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
that leads to our shims and we'll take

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.180 
that leads to our shims and we'll take
care<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:19.049> we're<00:03:19.590> gonna<00:03:19.680> do<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.890> separate

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
care of that we're gonna do a separate

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.060 
care of that we're gonna do a separate
video<00:03:20.340> on<00:03:20.549> basis<00:03:21.420> on<00:03:21.570> our<00:03:21.870> spacers<00:03:22.470> as<00:03:22.650> well<00:03:22.829> I

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
video on basis on our spacers as well I

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.830 
video on basis on our spacers as well I
tried<00:03:23.640> that<00:03:23.760> 10<00:03:24.000> millimeter<00:03:24.420> let's<00:03:24.600> see<00:03:24.720> what

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
tried that 10 millimeter let's see what

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.099 
tried that 10 millimeter let's see what
that<00:03:24.930> looks<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.640> that's<00:03:26.640> pretty<00:03:26.970> good<00:03:27.299> suta

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
that looks like that's pretty good suta

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:35.550 
that looks like that's pretty good suta
5<00:03:28.350> looks<00:03:28.650> like<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:29.070> start<00:03:29.340> with

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.790 

five<00:03:36.560> is<00:03:36.830> apps<00:03:37.150> darn<00:03:38.150> close<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.450> flush<00:03:38.930> we

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
five is apps darn close to flush we

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.620 
five is apps darn close to flush we
could<00:03:39.950> probably<00:03:40.130> get<00:03:40.340> away<00:03:40.430> with<00:03:40.550> a<00:03:40.790> five

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
could probably get away with a five

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.990 
could probably get away with a five
I'm<00:03:42.500> not<00:03:42.830> keen<00:03:43.100> about<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:43.550> I'm<00:03:43.640> gonna<00:03:43.790> use<00:03:43.970> a

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
know what else we could do is use a five

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.100 
know what else we could do is use a five
and<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:51.250> two<00:03:52.250> yet<00:03:53.060> five<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:53.630> two<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:53.840> make<00:03:53.990> it
