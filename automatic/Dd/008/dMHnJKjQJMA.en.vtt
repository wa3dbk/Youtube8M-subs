it's brandon with campbell fitness in
today's<00:00:10.110> video<00:00:10.290> i'd<00:00:10.500> like<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.679> talk<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.980> little

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
today's video i'd like to talk a little

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.370 
today's video i'd like to talk a little
bit<00:00:11.400> about<00:00:11.550> sodium<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.240> there's<00:00:12.780> two<00:00:13.110> key

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
bit about sodium and there's two key

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.419 
bit about sodium and there's two key
things<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.769> we're<00:00:13.950> going<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.099> be<00:00:14.219> focusing

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
things that we're going to be focusing

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.330 
things that we're going to be focusing
on<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.509> first<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.960> which<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.830> sodium

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
on the first of which is the sodium

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.550 
on the first of which is the sodium
cause<00:00:17.580> high<00:00:17.910> blood<00:00:17.940> pressure<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.230> second

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
cause high blood pressure and the second

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.960 
cause high blood pressure and the second
of<00:00:19.650> which<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.949> talking<00:00:20.189> about<00:00:20.460> water

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
of which is talking about water

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.970 
of which is talking about water
retention<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.630> bloating<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.529> first<00:00:22.769> things

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
retention and bloating so first things

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.439 
retention and bloating so first things
first<00:00:23.070> let's<00:00:23.430> talk<00:00:23.670> about<00:00:23.850> high<00:00:24.240> blood

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
first let's talk about high blood

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.660 
first let's talk about high blood
pressure<00:00:24.779> now<00:00:25.500> research<00:00:25.920> has<00:00:26.099> shown<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
pressure now research has shown in the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.400 
pressure now research has shown in the
past<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.510> those<00:00:27.840> suffering<00:00:28.289> from

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
past that those suffering from

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.740 
past that those suffering from
hypertension<00:00:28.680> or<00:00:29.279> high<00:00:29.340> blood<00:00:29.519> pressure<00:00:30.029> have

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
hypertension or high blood pressure have

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.510 
hypertension or high blood pressure have
been<00:00:30.990> helped<00:00:31.349> by<00:00:31.380> reducing<00:00:32.070> their<00:00:32.219> sodium

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
been helped by reducing their sodium

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520 
been helped by reducing their sodium
intake<00:00:33.030> now<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.440> bit

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
intake now this is a little bit

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.410 
intake now this is a little bit
misleading<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.370> has<00:00:35.520> led<00:00:35.760> many<00:00:35.940> people<00:00:36.090> to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
misleading and has led many people to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.600 
misleading and has led many people to
assume<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.870> sodium<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.800> thus<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.370> cause<00:00:38.579> of

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
assume that sodium is thus the cause of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.520 
assume that sodium is thus the cause of
high<00:00:38.969> blood<00:00:39.239> pressure<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:40.050> isn't

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
high blood pressure this isn't

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.830 
high blood pressure this isn't
necessarily<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.309> case<00:00:41.520> people<00:00:42.420> who<00:00:42.510> suffer

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
necessarily the case people who suffer

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.910

from<00:00:42.870> high<00:00:43.110> blood<00:00:43.140> pressure<00:00:43.590> could<00:00:43.890> be

from high blood pressure could be

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.310 
from high blood pressure could be
salt-sensitive<00:00:44.700> by<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.390> point<00:00:45.690> however

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
salt-sensitive by this point however

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.319 
salt-sensitive by this point however
studies<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.340> shown<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.610> normal

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
studies have shown that normal

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.540 
studies have shown that normal
individuals<00:00:48.989> who<00:00:49.140> are<00:00:49.289> healthy<00:00:49.559> aren't

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
individuals who are healthy aren't

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.639 
individuals who are healthy aren't
affected<00:00:51.059> by<00:00:51.210> increasing<00:00:51.930> or<00:00:52.050> high<00:00:52.199> amounts

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.619 
affected by increasing or high amounts
of sodium<00:00:52.949> intake<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.149> same<00:00:54.360> side<00:00:54.510> of

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
of sodium intake on the same side of

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.610 
of sodium intake on the same side of
this<00:00:54.690> argument<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.230> not<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.590> much

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
this argument it's not so much

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.010 
this argument it's not so much
decreasing<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> salt<00:00:56.789> intake<00:00:57.210> itself<00:00:57.780> that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
decreasing the salt intake itself that

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.410 
decreasing the salt intake itself that
helps<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.469> much<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.520> doesn't<00:00:59.730> balancing

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
helps so much as it doesn't balancing

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.660 
helps so much as it doesn't balancing
out<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.570> ratio<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.199> sodium<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.949> potassium<00:01:01.980> in

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
out the ratio of sodium to potassium in

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.539 
out the ratio of sodium to potassium in
your<00:01:02.699> diet<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.809> being<00:01:04.080> said<00:01:04.430> people<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
your diet so that being said people that

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.160 
your diet so that being said people that
suffer<00:01:05.729> from<00:01:05.850> high<00:01:06.299> blood<00:01:06.330> pressure<00:01:06.810> could

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
suffer from high blood pressure could

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.929 
suffer from high blood pressure could
thus<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.590> fact<00:01:07.830> increase<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.610> amount<00:01:08.820> of

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
thus in fact increase the amount of

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.300 
thus in fact increase the amount of
potassium<00:01:09.500> relative<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> amount<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.040> salt

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
potassium relative to the amount of salt

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280 
potassium relative to the amount of salt
that<00:01:11.460> they're<00:01:11.670> currently<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.150> taking<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.720> see

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that they're currently in taking and see

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.020 
that they're currently in taking and see
a<00:01:13.320> lot<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> same<00:01:13.890> benefits<00:01:14.460> alright<00:01:14.909> so

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
a lot of the same benefits alright so

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.340 
a lot of the same benefits alright so
now<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.240> we've<00:01:15.360> talked<00:01:15.570> about<00:01:15.750> sodium<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
now that we've talked about sodium and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.570 
now that we've talked about sodium and
high<00:01:16.409> blood<00:01:16.680> pressure<00:01:16.950> let's<00:01:17.250> talk<00:01:17.430> about

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
high blood pressure let's talk about

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.850 
high blood pressure let's talk about
sodium<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.570> relates<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> retaining<00:01:19.530> water

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
sodium as it relates to retaining water

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
sodium as it relates to retaining water
or<00:01:20.100> bloating<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> lot<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.540> us<00:01:21.630> go

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
or bloating because when a lot of us go

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.480 
or bloating because when a lot of us go
on<00:01:21.810> diet<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.500> think<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.040> need<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.280> cut

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
on diet we think that we need to cut

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.640 
on diet we think that we need to cut
down<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.759> our<00:01:24.000> sodium<00:01:24.360> intake<00:01:24.750> because<00:01:25.290> what

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
down on our sodium intake because what

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.749 
down on our sodium intake because what
it's<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.580> make<00:01:26.729> us

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it's going to do is going to make us

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.539 
it's going to do is going to make us
hold<00:01:27.090> more<00:01:27.270> water<00:01:27.540> feel<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:28.619> bloated<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.250> as

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
hold more water feel more bloated or as

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.219 
hold more water feel more bloated or as
we've<00:01:29.700> already<00:01:29.909> discussed<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.840> high<00:01:31.049> blood

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
we've already discussed have high blood

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.660 
we've already discussed have high blood
pressure<00:01:31.590> well<00:01:31.920> not<00:01:32.070> me<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.250> say<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.549> this

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
pressure well not me to say that this

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.359 
pressure well not me to say that this
too<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.030> also<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> big<00:01:33.659> myth<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.680> far<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:34.920> salt

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
too is also a big myth so as far as salt

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.730 
too is also a big myth so as far as salt
intake<00:01:35.820> goes<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.079> much<00:01:37.290> how<00:01:37.560> much

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
intake goes it's not so much how much
