00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 making this video was possible 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.069
 thanks to cashback cash number one 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.569

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.280
 I return the percentage of all Chinese and not 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.200
 only gadget shops and full 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.210

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.949
 you can withdraw even one ruble only on 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.650
 cash for brands dot ru 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.020
 all links in the description hello to me 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.210
 name is maxim and you watch the 35th issue 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.609
 news chinese gadgets on the channel 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.170
 sets no world that is now 35 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.449
 weeks I release a video in which 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.820
 talk about current novelties rzhu over 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.920
 developers and sometimes talk about 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.200
 gadgets themselves so let's not 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.210
 depart from tradition drove 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.829
 probably many already know that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.550
 Apple has presented to the world its new 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.770
 macbook 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.480
 he is always the top of perfection and we all 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.910
 just envy the owner of these 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.280
 divine devices but the main 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.260
 the innovation of the new MacBook was 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.570
 that he no longer needs and cooling 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.000
 and as a result, the cooler that creates 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.989
 the noise is caused by a new processor from intel 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.030
 core m 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.890
 it is built on 14 nanometer 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.840
 process technology and does not need active 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.270
 cooled in my opinion very 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.580
 innovatively and in general a and na-na-na-na 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.320
 the chinese as always ahead of the rest 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.810
 they took as a basis this core 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.760
 temp built on its basis tablets and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.810
 rolled over the resulting device 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.479
 eighth windu 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.310
 I really liked it too 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.500
 already announced a number of new products 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.500
 the first one is this tablet from the company 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.090
 mind they decided to make a huge 11 6 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.470
 inch tablet with four gigabytes 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.490
 RAM on board 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.390
 of 128 gigabytes of internal storage 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.640
 the only pain is likely to be 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.990
 screen resolution she made up just 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.890
 only 1366 by 768 pixels but the screen itself 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.140
 gps 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.570
 what pleases the second novelty also from 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.540
 Chinese and also on intel core m 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.990
 but already from another manufacturer cube a of 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.899
 7 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.180
 he also has 11 6 inch gps screen but 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.850
 already with full hd 4 gigs 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.189
 RAM and 128 constant main 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.530
 chips will be support networks 4g 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.119
 and body thickness of only 5 9 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.310
 millimeters truth is not accurate yet 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.530
 data about exactly when and for what 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.840
 the price will be released these new items but news 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.370
 agree please write better in 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.920
 comments how do you feel about 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.080
 like 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.190
 innovation and what would you like from 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.650
 tablet on Windows 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.150
 but for now let's continue talking about 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.190
 plans to launch under its own brand 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.349
 smart watch with a round display 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.150
 but the main feature of the clock will be the function 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.010
 fast charging they will charge 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.930
 in just five minutes the truth is not yet 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.120
 reported inaccurate data about the rest 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.400
 specifications as well as 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.380
 you are not a release date and price of new items 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.850
 Therefore, it is possible that they will decide on 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.890
 stick a 100 milliamp battery 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.230
 hours and attach to the watch charger with 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.940
 output 3 amps but that's who can 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.230
 brag about numbers regarding 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.830
 battery so this is a novelty under 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.709
 by name 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.360
 im nose b6000 and as you can guess by 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.580
 his name is under his cover 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.560
 there are batteries with common 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.470
 volume of 6000 milliampere hours 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.430
 which is 3 times more modern 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.930
 average smartphone on 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.930
 other characteristics are also quite 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.209
 not bad display full hd 5 2 inches new 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.390
 qualcomm snapdragon 615 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.880
 two or three giga operative and 16 or 32 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.010
 GB of permanent memory depending on 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.830
 versions in the smartphone have implemented power 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.380
 at once from two batteries 1 with a capacity for 2000 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.209
 milliampere hours another at 4000 m with 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.799
 one side is clear why 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.120
 solution in the Chinese smartphone 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.560
 to make it easier to hide 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.079
 real battery capacity 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.359
 and minimize the chance of explosions 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.190
 because as you understand, China on the other 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.350
 sides we all know how do these 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.359
 batteries and real and capacity too 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.910
 may be questionable but also from 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.980
 the last interesting asus started in 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.630
 china selling its new zenfone 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.120
 four gigabytes of ram 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.850
 aboard ulefone picked up this trend 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.859
 and also wants to release something four 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.519
 gigabytes of RAM so far specifically 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.840
 really don't say it will be possible 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.819
 refrigerator in the latter case at all 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.069
 sense from these four gigabytes is not 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.440
 change what the issue turns out 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.440
 quite short so here's a song for you 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.829
 from the store you go in the egg pack you 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:21.790
 you carry spring in the yard 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:29.889
 Beauty is now everywhere but now it is warm 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:33.520
 yesterday it was cold don't forget thermal underwear 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:38.020
 because you have it yours 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:41.710
 it is useful to you is your handy 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.669
 and who will be useful to you? 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.810
 your 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:52.169
 it is useful to you it is useful where 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.169
 you're not cold to me
