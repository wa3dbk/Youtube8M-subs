00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.160
 great fighters my name is mikhail and 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.140
 today we'll talk about sniper 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.630
 armament and sniper gadgets in 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.970
 battlefield 4 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.430
 thanks to the gamespot site dot com to us 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.009
 it became known all the weapons and all 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.610
 equipment for all classes of battlefield 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.649
 four 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.710
 but today I will speak exclusively 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:36.920
 about snipers since this treasure to me 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.440
 most interesting and so basic 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.950
 rifles for each country will be 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.600
 respectively cs lr4 for chinese 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:50.739
 m40 again for Americans sv-98 for 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.400
 the Russian side all these caliber rifles 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:59.840
 762 mean so penetrating ability and 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.329
 have 10 rounds in the store also 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.710
 there are a little weaker in our arsenal 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:10.369
 rifles are European elite scout and 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.619
 chinese fyj with they have smaller 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.069
 caliber than listed at the beginning 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.619
 rifle but apparently higher 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.899
 accuracy and most interestingly scouts 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.179
 years has a store for 5 rounds 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.109
 although wolf he had a shop at 10 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.689
 cartridges 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.929
 but apparently characteristics still 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:33.770
 finalized further we go a little 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:36.409
 more powerful jng-90 rifle that you 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.459
 well know the battlefield 3 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.189
 it also has either 762 clip on 10 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.600
 chuck but higher damage and more 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.119
 high firing range 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.130
 and now the most interesting thing is further we 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.849
 go to the rifles that use 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.749
 more powerful cartridges magnum this is all already 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:59.060
 known m 98 dB compared to bf3 she 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.190
 changed a little she now has 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.600
 normal and 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:07.630
 for 10 rounds instead of 5 as it was before 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:11.410
 The next rifle is the 338 areca 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.420
 this rifle as I understand it have 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.300
 circuit bullpup that is 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.600
 the clip is not behind the trigger 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.520
 hooks and for dessert we have the most 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.370
 beautiful this rifle 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.920
 CPP 61 rifle designed to 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.100
 two or three extra long distances 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.560
 kilometer is a real treat for 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.750
 various campers for this rifle 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.530
 even a special one was developed 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.020
 ammunition allowing to fire on 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.680
 ultra long range rifles for now 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.150
 all now talk about sights 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.040
 sniper rifles in battlefield 4 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.540
 will have five kinds of sights for 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.300
 long distance this is a 6x goal 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.110
 respectively sixfold while I am from 07 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:07.690
 sevenfold rayfl staples eightfold a 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:10.989
 also sight hunter 20 fold and sight 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.510
 ballistic 40 multiple that is you 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.360
 imagine the battlefield 3 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.890
 the maximum multiplicity was 12 and here and 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.110
 20 of 40 is just awesome see 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.660
 cards in battlefield 4 really 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.640
 will be huge now let's talk about 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.050
 modules that can be installed on 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.739
 sniper rifles 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.010
 The first module is counted ironside then 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.370
 there is a standard side standard sight 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.840
 which can be used instead 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.420
 optical mainly 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.060
 then we have a flashlight that is 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.870
 standard flashlight as in bf3 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.590
 Further tactics are this kind of flash 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.730
 which is 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.450
 honestly did not understand how 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.060
 works but in the end it dazzles passed 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.950
 disgusting the next modules is 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.250
 laser sight that is laser 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.680
 designator as in bf3 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.980
 further 3 bim laser that is the same 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.069
 laser target designator but the scope consists 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.799
 from three points this is something like a sight 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.430
 like a predator if you remember such 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:20.859
 the film further we have a green laser sight then 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.169
 there is a green laser designator a 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.080
 Now an interesting little thing under 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:29.260
 called laser light combo that is it 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.510
 combination of flashlight and laser 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.160
 target designator wondering how it will be 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.160
 to look like 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:40.449
 then we have variable zoom that is 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:43.780
 variable zoom sight that is sight 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.510
 it will be possible to zoom in and out and the most 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.360
 interesting module that you can 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.110
 it was come up with this rangefinder that is 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.870
 laser distance meter 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.240
 it's just a beautiful thing now we do not 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.240
 will need to memorize all distances on 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.070
 the card will be enough to install this 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.139
 module 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.590
 in the second slot of improvements we can 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.550
 to put 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:13.240
 muzzle brake flame arrester and as many as four 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.639
 kind of different silencers than they are from each 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.950
 friend differ yet unknown and 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.950
 finally, let's talk about gadgets 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.950
 available scouts in battlefield 4 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:27.520
 This is pld i.e. portable laser 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.510
 a gunner with flom known to us by 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.070
 battlefield 3 is a stationary laser 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.530
 boy, that is, which is set 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.320
 1 place motion sensor 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.660
 such balls sensors that can 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.030
 scatter on the cards and they will 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.470
 show enemies running past them 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.420
 so this is one big sensor 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:53.100
 settable to one specific 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:56.120
 place move you already know it is managed 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.830
 remotely aircraft further 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.430
 radio beacon for rebirth in 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.340
 a certain place and finally 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.560
 explosive as we already knew 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.900
 bf4 sniper will be available again 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.770
 explosives like battlefield bad 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.460
 company 2 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.530
 it's all four and claymore mines so judging 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.590
 on all this information that you 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:23.580
 just told know the feast will 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:28.100
 the most interesting class of battlefield 4 and 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.100
 that's fine bye bye
