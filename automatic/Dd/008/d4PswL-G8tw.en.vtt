00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.140 
spider-man 3
I<00:00:18.260> like<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.500> statue<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.039> lot<00:00:20.310> more<00:00:20.640> than<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
I like this statue a lot more than the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.750 
I like this statue a lot more than the
one<00:00:21.330> from<00:00:21.890> Randy<00:00:22.890> Bowen<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:25.170> base<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.949> just

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
one from Randy Bowen I the base is just

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.510 
one from Randy Bowen I the base is just
as<00:00:27.269> good<00:00:28.369> I'll<00:00:29.369> show<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:31.520> spider-man

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
as good I'll show you that spider-man

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.910 
as good I'll show you that spider-man
does<00:00:32.940> not<00:00:33.120> come<00:00:33.300> attached<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:34.500> most

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
does not come attached like most

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.680 
does not come attached like most
sideshow<00:00:35.219> things<00:00:36.440> there's<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.590> pin<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.690> you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
sideshow things there's a pin and you

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
sideshow things there's a pin and you
put<00:00:39.899> into<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.200> slot<00:00:40.640> by<00:00:41.640> his<00:00:41.790> hand<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.309> Spider

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
put into a slot by his hand the Spider

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.720 
put into a slot by his hand the Spider
Man<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.710> think<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.010> more<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.390> proportion<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
Man I think is more in proportion to

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.569 
Man I think is more in proportion to
what<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.899> movies<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.710> comic

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
what we see in the movies and comic

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.099 
what we see in the movies and comic
books<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.870> paint<00:00:55.170> job<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:56.030> a<00:00:57.109> hundred

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
books and the paint job is a hundred

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.950 
books and the paint job is a hundred
times<00:00:58.350> better<00:00:58.620> than<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.879> one<00:01:00.090> from<00:01:00.480> Randy

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
times better than the one from Randy

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.910 
times better than the one from Randy
Bowen<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.110> sideshow<00:01:04.710> piece<00:01:05.070> is

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
Bowen so the sideshow piece is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.490 
Bowen so the sideshow piece is
definitely<00:01:07.970> really<00:01:08.970> nice<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.630> raise<00:01:09.869> webbing

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
definitely really nice to raise webbing

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.539 
definitely really nice to raise webbing
I<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.000> look<00:01:12.150> at<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:13.490> this<00:01:14.490> is

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
I really like to look at that this is

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.280 
I really like to look at that this is
actually<00:01:15.060> something<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.689> looks<00:01:15.930> much

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
actually something that looks much

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.870 
actually something that looks much
better<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.740> person

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
better in person

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.570 
better in person
I<00:01:18.290> think<00:01:19.290> then<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.400> does<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.630> video

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
I think then it does on the video

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.130 
I think then it does on the video
because<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:24.240> makes<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:26.220> colors<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:27.210> don't

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
because it makes the colors just don't

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.420 
because it makes the colors just don't
really<00:01:29.810> pop<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:31.229> much<00:01:32.060> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:34.049> video<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.829> they

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
really pop as much on the video as they

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.819 
really pop as much on the video as they
do<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:36.090> real<00:01:36.750> life<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.909> tell<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.829> that

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
do in real life and I can tell that that

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.010 
do in real life and I can tell that that
raised<00:01:41.189> webbing

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
raised webbing

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.929 
raised webbing
it<00:01:43.530> looks<00:01:43.710> quite<00:01:43.950> shiny<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:45.829> the<00:01:46.829> video<00:01:47.189> but

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
it looks quite shiny on the video but

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.609 
it looks quite shiny on the video but
it's<00:01:48.090> actually<00:01:50.090> not<00:01:51.090> like<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.290> more<00:01:52.560> of

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
it's actually not like that it's more of

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.120 
it's actually not like that it's more of
just<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:54.200> more<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.829> silverish<00:01:58.040> but<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
just a more of just a silverish but it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.850 
just a more of just a silverish but it
does<00:01:59.310> look<00:01:59.520> very<00:02:00.000> very<00:02:00.119> good

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
does look very very good

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.090 
does look very very good
I'd<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.880> recommend<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:04.860> anybody
