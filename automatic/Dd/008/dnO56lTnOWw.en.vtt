00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
of the car did start to wear out

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
apparently Orange I mean the higher

of<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.470> drivetrain<00:02:14.160> components<00:02:14.190> though

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150

of the drivetrain components though
there<00:02:15.299> was<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> very<00:02:15.660> deaf<00:02:15.870> point<00:02:16.440> where<00:02:16.799> we
