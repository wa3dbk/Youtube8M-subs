00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.920
 these three editions we are going to have 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.460
 access to an airship 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.710
 the atomic airship is called that is 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.839
 an aircraft that we can pilot for 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.329
 to sail the immense sky of the city of 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:53.019
 the saints as you see in the photo is about 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.030
 of a dirigible a vehicle that has 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.530
 good paints the truth to see the city 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.409
 from above it has to be quite 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.549
 cool so good the second edition 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:07.689
 it's the special edition that will cost 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:10.210
 around 82 with 50 euros already in 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:13.690
 Spain and that brings this edition because it brings 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.640
 the game gta 5 a steel book of 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.039
 collection with michael illustrations 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.740
 franklin and trevor that is a speed book 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.659
 a steel ship is a cover is the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.369
 typical hard plastic face in which 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.430
 ended games and it's not a cover 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.050
 special 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.510
 with characteristic images of the game 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.510
 not the cover art that divides 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.240
 the paper but personalized a cover 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.930
 personalized and then we have a map 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.800
 blueprint which is basically a map of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.630
 the city printed in color in blue 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.810
 and then we will also have an enhancer 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.840
 of skill the three characters 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.360
 main ones have in the mode of a 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.520
 player a skill then up to 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.590
 through this ponte of this enhancer 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.470
 so increase and increase to see 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:10.009
 we will increase by 25 because that ability does not 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.930
 is the advantage that more things bring this 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.450
 special edition then tests with a 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.790
 acrobatic plane we can perform 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.910
 tests with aerobatic aircraft in the 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.740
 single player mode 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.480
 and those tests because they are distributed to 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.270
 along the city of the saints and the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.930

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.380
 also brings extra costumes tattoos and 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.380
 much more 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.410
 much more refers to that we can 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.500
 I had exclusive clothes for each character 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.930
 exclusive tattoos and discounts 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.690
 specials in the stores of the saints 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.780
 and the blade county and finally brings 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.750
 additional weapons when the players 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.030

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.770

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.580
 player the sellers will have weapons

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.220
 and a hammer for body combat 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.930
 body these things are what are the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.230
 that are going to come included within the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.190
 special edition as I say this one will cost 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:24.110
 it will cost around 82 with 50 euros and 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:27.900
 then there is the collector's edition that 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.870
 It has a price of 129.99 euros 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.420
 we go 130 in a word and that brings this 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.190
 edition then bring everything it contained 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.890
 the special edition more 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.000
 a security bag of grand theft 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.250
 5 car with a key in the form of 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.230
 logo inspired by the blows that 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.480
 the blows apply in the game 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.400
 missions that are basically done 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.090
 it's about a backpack with one with a 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.340
 padlock with a personalized key and 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.520
 as you see in the photo and then bring a 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.830
 adba cap without leveling knife thing 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.920
 decant photo 5 we go a simple hour in 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:08.000
 the one that puts gta 5 special characters 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.000
 for large online photo 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.970
 it is basically that 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.720
 we can put some classic characters 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.810
 of other great auto cancer cars 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.780
 previous only for the multiplayer by 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.050
 what puts here new things of the 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.529
 collector's edition unique vehicles and 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.289
 garage in property 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:32.459
 will bring a couple of vehicles 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.980
 exclusive for those who buy this 

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:38.410
 edition and it will allow us to have a 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.260
 and a garage in the house where we live 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.630
 where we are to save 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.150
 basically these vehicles too 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.430
 we will have a garage in the mode 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.210
 multiplayer and finally the edition 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.620
 Collector comes a whole everything 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.100
 includes the collector's edition well 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.260
 included in a premium box that good 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.280
 over here that is it has a finish 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.920
 scratch-resistant matte laminate 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.750
 and honestly there is not much difference 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.000
 between the special edition and election 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.760
 collector rather the edition 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.430
 collector is a scam because 50 euros 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.920
 more for a cap or a backpack with 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.340
 other exclusive vehicles is pretty 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.040
 money so the best edition for me 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.890
 it's the special edition and probably 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.860
 is the one that caught me so good 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:33.249
 that this information has served you 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.539
 comment on the video you can give it a like 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.659
 and as I say I hope you liked it 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:40.179
 which has been helpful so good 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:43.409

00:05:40.179 --> 00:05:43.409
