 that only TV and kindergarten staff is 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.059
 This game on the other side of it is the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.129
 mouse here on this sheet here 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.370
 There you read what is written to you.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.829
 commercialization of such tasks or 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.699

 tasks on another page here and on 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.409
 something else here near and after and even 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.189
 in attribute training that is a 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.189
 very important thing 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.100
 here you come the next you go you 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.909
 going to train in 2011 is that it's the least I 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.790
 I think to take the first practice is 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.680
 you have you have 3 points you 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.900
 still have two skill points for 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.820
 work on your taxes as you are 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.649
 good that together and will distribute the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.689
 following is in the following 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.640
 here in the following talents attributes and 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.810
 will have a good kick because you 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.140
 It's a nice gesture distribute here 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.930
 distributing here you will distribute 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.030
 after Agility because it would generate 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.860
 thing that is together there is almost the same 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.409
 thing is going to distribute in agility 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.599
 for your character wins need both 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.470
 say type so you do not miss punches you 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.600
 train my agility and 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.570
 and if I had one more point to 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.050
 training that is also the basic 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:25.690
 taiji other is he wins attack got 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.690
 more attack when you train is strength 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.420
 but it is also who gains strength only 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.940
 It's for me fair and unfair so if you 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.200
 until then joined book along trainee in 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.420
 force 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.000
 after a while you will distribute 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:50.150
 resistance to win base defense and 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.560
 energy for you to earn is r ga ga p each 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.240
 every point of energy you said 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.440
 You'll get eight more here in this one. 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.770
 business of life and something else that 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:06.530
 he talk to you is every task 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:08.390
 task you do you accept here you 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.790
 need to stop 10 to become a game 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.760
 What is it or not to understand is a 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.510
 tutorial on here below shows 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.370
 villa had crew have basic table and 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.769
 each task tries to edit this task 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.050
 It's sad for you, you learn. 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.580
 so this is it was a basic books tutorial 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.390
