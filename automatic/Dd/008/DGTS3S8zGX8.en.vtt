time<00:03:12.099> I<00:03:12.670> guess<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.209> answer<00:03:13.720> I'm<00:03:13.840> looking<00:03:13.870> for

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
time I guess the answer I'm looking for

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.020 
time I guess the answer I'm looking for
in<00:03:14.379> this<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.799> that<00:03:14.980> it's<00:03:15.129> just<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.700> video<00:03:15.849> game

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
in this is that it's just a video game

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.270 
in this is that it's just a video game
but<00:03:16.750> with<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.930> very<00:03:17.139> dumb<00:03:17.500> concept<00:03:18.100> at<00:03:18.250> that

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
but with a very dumb concept at that

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.670 
but with a very dumb concept at that
anyway<00:03:19.269> like<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.600> was<00:03:19.630> saying<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.260> gameplay<00:03:20.620> is

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
anyway like I was saying the gameplay is

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.650 
anyway like I was saying the gameplay is
pretty<00:03:20.769> much<00:03:21.160> of<00:03:21.400> platforming<00:03:22.090> beat<00:03:22.389> him<00:03:22.540> up

bit too challenging I actually died a

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.550 
bit too challenging I actually died a
lot<00:04:57.639> of<00:04:57.790> more<00:04:57.970> times<00:04:58.240> than<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.479> expected<00:04:59.050> this

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
lot of more times than I expected this

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.010

is<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.740> good<00:05:00.010> thing<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.400> a<00:05:00.520> bad<00:05:00.550> thing<00:05:00.729> one<00:05:01.690> it's

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
is a good thing and a bad thing one it's

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.810 
is a good thing and a bad thing one it's
the<00:05:02.169> only<00:05:02.350> challenging<00:05:03.070> thing<00:05:03.370> to<00:05:03.400> play<00:05:03.729> in

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
the only challenging thing to play in

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.090 
the only challenging thing to play in
this<00:05:03.940> game<00:05:04.060> but<00:05:04.870> that's<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.260> good<00:05:05.500> thing<00:05:05.830> the

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
this game but that's the good thing the

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.100 
this game but that's the good thing the
bad<00:05:06.520> thing<00:05:06.790> is<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.150> boss<00:05:07.360> balls<00:05:07.660> are<00:05:07.900> so

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
bad thing is that the boss balls are so

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.110 
bad thing is that the boss balls are so
difficult<00:05:08.380> it<00:05:08.919> actually<00:05:08.979> might<00:05:09.669> make<00:05:09.880> people

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
difficult it actually might make people

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.030 
difficult it actually might make people
frustrated<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:11.139> I<00:05:11.290> wouldn't<00:05:11.560> be<00:05:11.650> surprised

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
frustrated and I wouldn't be surprised

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.159 
frustrated and I wouldn't be surprised
if<00:05:12.190> it<00:05:12.340> did<00:05:12.550> now<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:13.060> did<00:05:13.389> say<00:05:13.660> that<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.930> can

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
if it did now I did say that you can

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.230 
if it did now I did say that you can
collect<00:05:14.530> food<00:05:14.889> items<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.940> reason<00:05:16.210> for

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
collect food items and the reason for

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.550 
collect food items and the reason for
that<00:05:16.419> is<00:05:16.720> that<00:05:16.900> once<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.229> collect<00:05:17.500> enough

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
that is that once you collect enough

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.830 
that is that once you collect enough
food<00:05:17.950> items<00:05:18.310> you<00:05:18.610> can<00:05:18.789> go<00:05:18.910> back<00:05:19.120> to<00:05:19.270> Shaggy<00:05:19.750> in

pot of food mystery what I basically

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.390 
pot of food mystery what I basically
mean<00:05:26.139> by<00:05:26.350> that<00:05:26.530> is<00:05:26.740> that<00:05:26.949> if<00:05:27.070> you<00:05:27.160> collect

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
mean by that is that if you collect

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.310 
mean by that is that if you collect
enough<00:05:27.669> food<00:05:27.910> items<00:05:28.270> shaggy<00:05:28.720> will<00:05:28.990> give<00:05:29.139> you<00:05:29.260> a
