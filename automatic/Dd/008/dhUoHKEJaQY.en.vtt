just about all of these clones and it's
really<00:03:33.870> really<00:03:33.960> awesome<00:03:34.260> what's<00:03:34.590> great<00:03:34.740> about

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
really really awesome what's great about

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.290 
really really awesome what's great about
the<00:03:35.100> scene<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:35.880> she's<00:03:36.060> actually

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
the scene is that she's actually

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.630 
the scene is that she's actually
activating<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.800> same<00:03:38.040> ability<00:03:38.460> that

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
activating that same ability that

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.910 
activating that same ability that
Tsunade<00:03:39.030> uses<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.720> she's<00:03:40.290> using<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.710> to<00:03:40.800> an

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
Tsunade uses and she's using it to an

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.100 
Tsunade uses and she's using it to an
even<00:03:41.220> crazier<00:03:41.430> degree<00:03:42.150> in<00:03:42.270> shizune<00:03:42.780> even

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
even crazier degree in shizune even

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.930 
even crazier degree in shizune even
explains<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:44.100> she's<00:03:44.310> been<00:03:44.490> storing<00:03:44.790> up

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
explains that she's been storing up

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.790 
explains that she's been storing up
power<00:03:45.180> for<00:03:45.540> like<00:03:45.720> three<00:03:46.110> years

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
power for like three years

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.650 
power for like three years
so<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.400> her<00:03:47.580> really<00:03:47.910> awesome<00:03:48.330> technique

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
so this is her really awesome technique

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.210 
so this is her really awesome technique
and<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.200> doesn't<00:03:49.410> really<00:03:49.500> seem<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:49.950> have<00:03:50.070> any

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
and it doesn't really seem to have any

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.160 
and it doesn't really seem to have any
like<00:03:50.550> negative<00:03:50.970> effects<00:03:51.300> on<00:03:51.420> Sakura<00:03:51.720> either

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
like negative effects on Sakura either

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.410 
like negative effects on Sakura either
and<00:03:52.470> this<00:03:53.280> just<00:03:53.490> keeps<00:03:53.670> building<00:03:54.000> up<00:03:54.210> and

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
and this just keeps building up and

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.580 
and this just keeps building up and
building<00:03:54.450> up<00:03:54.750> because<00:03:55.020> then<00:03:55.170> another<00:03:55.410> the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
building up because then another the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.620 
building up because then another the
clones<00:03:55.830> tries<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.220> attack<00:03:56.460> stalker<00:03:56.820> but<00:03:57.480> then

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
clones tries to attack stalker but then

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.150 
clones tries to attack stalker but then
it<00:03:57.720> ends<00:03:57.990> on<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.200> final<00:03:58.530> panel<00:03:58.710> with<00:03:58.980> both
