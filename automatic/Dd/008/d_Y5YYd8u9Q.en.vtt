 stratosphere is thrown you cross there 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.840
 we have a historical moment followed by 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.760
 world level 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.060
 this launch from the stratosphere 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.760
 from a beginning it was thought 36,000 meters 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.700
 of height reaching 39 thousand meters and 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.739
 from there a free fall will be launched 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.469
 jump followed in the whole world 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.840
 come on let's go let's on the twitter are 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.899
 asking to jump already but you have to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.210
 make the necessary coordinations 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:52.410
 no good so there is no 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.320
 problem and can beat this record is 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.010
 record comes is going to launch is to 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.030
 scarce is launched was launched was launched felix 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.790
 baumgartner beating trying to beat a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.390
 world record there we have the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.280
 images 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.229
 the cameras are following him there 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.680
 have the time since it was released 12 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.580
 13 seconds moment to make history 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.330
 from this paratrooper Felix 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.720
 bound gardner was launched from 39 thousand 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.910
 meters high from the stratosphere 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.759
 aims to break several records between 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.830
 they be the human being in breaking the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.659
 sound barrier 'be there without 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.500
 parachute is an extremely moment 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.500
 important 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.370
 to the expectation that you are generated 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.350
 was launched was finally launched after 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.270
 several coordinations and what we have 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.060
 mentioned the greatest risk until the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.740
 moment is the possibility of turning off 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.110
 of control we have seen that the body 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.930
 there is applause 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.880
 there is applause broke the barrier of 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.850
 sound is the information then that 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.860
 arrives and the family of paul gardner 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.229
 that are in the usa to the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.370
 expectation celebrate of course the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.890
 first record of bread of part felix 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.830
 baumgartner is the first human being 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.060
 then we can say it like that with your 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:28.110
 feat in being the Headmaster what has 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:30.390
 been thousand 173 kilometers per hour the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.570
 maximum speed with the camera 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.570
 infrared 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.700
 from the earth there we see opens the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.739
 parachute 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.739
 and there is no record freefall 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.980
 it was four minutes and 36 seconds time 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.409
 free fall 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.409
 of happy voice by joe kittinger 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.300
 Felix Baumgartner 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.480
 has surpassed the king green speed and 988 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:21.910
 kilometers per hour 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.910
 kissinger has not gone through a wide margin 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.360
 keating 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.940
 late 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.629
 but there is more 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.170
 very well 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.090
 and there was a card 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.090
 touching the ground 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.110
 the shadow indicates
