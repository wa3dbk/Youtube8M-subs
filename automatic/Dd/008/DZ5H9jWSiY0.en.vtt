00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:11.580
 Yes very much Hello Today I am here. 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:15.450
 I think I did it last time, but with Wakozu's chain cleaner 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.810
 Does the delay dirt just fall a little 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.680
 I played the game but it fell off 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.680
 I'd fallen 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:32.640
 It's a slow and slow time when you're looking near the harbor 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:36.680
 It's there is a dirt is happening n Hey faintly at in this 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.920
 It gets darker because it is 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.480
 I feel that to ThatLookLikeThis 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.000
 After all this 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.530
 It was here 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.530
 I wonder if the dirt and here in this place still remain 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.940
 Matt nice easy yeah yeah 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.940
 drop down 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.300
 It makes no there is to say cleaner 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.010
 Because you can find 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.560
 When boiled 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:14.620
 There is an article that it seems to fall well, and that is certainly that one that will get on 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:20.470
 If there are knitted oil Tteyuu Ina Te Kikuchi round child but the chain oil is what 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:23.490
 When Tteyuu dirt should not be to capture it all and likeness completely in order to knead it 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:29.630
 Such as use in 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:36.600
 It was necessary for him to do something like that , and there was a person who was working sideways 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:41.790
 In I prefecture this time is actually Nee or rather verification toward the little bit I it Don house 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.310
 I thought it would be easier to do so, so let's try it now 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.100
 We will do it to say and boil the chain 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.290
 See you first this 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.159
 Before 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.210
 I have to do it but I can tell you 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.810
 I will go 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.070
 I was there 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.530
 Here is something like a fishing link here 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.010
 I kinda took it 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.370
 How is it taken 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.630
 Normally 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.140
 If the range it is the use and come Tan 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.140
 You say you I I 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.540
 I can not help 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.810
 Was it was normally Lessing Rinkyu easy to take 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.090
 Like this 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:28.510
 Remove the plate 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:31.590
 Do break it It is a part of the outside of the link Do the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.590
 I have always been thinking 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.300
 I 'm going to move the pad invalid 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.600
 The theme is nice and I will leave it here for the time being 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.670
 To 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.060
 Is this 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.060
 this 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.930
 I'm out of black 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.540
 Hassu if not did sapa 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.540
 It was off normally I counted 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:05.910
 At Eth, it became like this 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:09.630
 It was easy to come off this is a bit from now on 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.780
 I think that I want to do it with a feeling of being scolded 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.110
 Wow N 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.580
 I'm there has been Ogore in so because look 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.340
 Ne 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.670
 Ru before this is it 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:25.450
 One dish that had been overwhelmed 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:28.690
 I would like to work from now on whether it really falls down 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.780
 First let's put Well entered 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.020
 is 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.460
 You use 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.960
 If you try this dish like this 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.920
 If you're unsanitary you're dirty 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:46.400
 As I thought that it was unsanitary to put in, I bought it for 100 averages 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.990
 It's a store with 100 averages 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.650
 There Hey 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.740
 There 's no way to say that there is a fire at something 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.980
 It is multiplied over water 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:00.550
 Maybe I could continue 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:06.069
 In what I there is a possibility that bottom fall out Let's with there 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:12.069
 The place where I really came is also green, but I will work with this 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:13.280
 It's a battle like this, so I'm going to accept this 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.269
 Of in rare 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.739
 Since no one of the bottom becomes hot it laid the wood in this 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:26.229
 The chain does not directly affect the sun 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:28.710
 Doing in a place called or would have a little not fulfill the effect I'm considering I 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.710
 To go 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.930
 It is quite warm already 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.590
 Snap pin 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:45.409
 Connect machine fishing link type is also put together 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.610
 Let's wait for a moment of this seen barrel 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:51.550
 It is Well that has been Yuda' Yes 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.150
 I can see it from home 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.150
 I 'm welcome but 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.920
 To see whether it is neko 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.280
 Something black 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:09.550
 It's a black point this is by chance 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.550
 It feels like it's getting really dirty 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:19.290
 It's getting really dirty 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:22.689
 I now I'd think the Ueda Bligh that it is this is this is I mean Do people or oil stains of the 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:27.539
 What happens to the hops 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.539
 How about it now I tried to stop the fire 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.379
 Well it has frozen dirt 1 of the chain 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.639
 Weakened surface 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:43.129
 Tell you whether I do that 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:47.139
 Or that it is Shapa's such Nante or grease from when I went 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:47.139
 I do not know that kind of feeling 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.210
 Here and there 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.560
 After all countryside some cruse technology 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.630
 Hmm 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:01.460
 What 's wonder if taken properly if we more boiled down 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.460
 I just do a little more
