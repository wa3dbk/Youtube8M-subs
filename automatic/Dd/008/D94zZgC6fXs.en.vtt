00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.099
 the most interesting titles of 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.320
 playstation 4 launch catalog 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.599
 that platform and action title 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.789
 titled nac with this trailer has been 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.980
 presented in this tokyo game show a 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.560
 trailer that by the way looks like a 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.480
 true action movie and the true 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.120
 is that it is so nothing has to envy him 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.070

 which indicates that this title is going to 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.520
 have a lot of argument 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.930
 important and it has been demonstrated in 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.460
 the different sequences that we have 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.350
 seen well it's true that until the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.629
 moment we thought it was a 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.579
 pretty childish title but it seems to be 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.379
 that at least the sequences have not 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.999
 seen show that it is not a title 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.559
 only for children so we're 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.149
