00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.009 
the C chord and then we're going to go
down<00:03:17.430> up<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.940> when<00:03:19.120> we<00:03:19.209> come<00:03:19.420> up<00:03:19.629> we're<00:03:19.930> going

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
to put that pinkie in and then go down

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.009 
to put that pinkie in and then go down
again<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.650> take<00:03:23.829> it<00:03:23.950> out<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:25.120> down<00:03:25.480> up<00:03:25.510> down

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
again and take it out so down up down

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.920 
again and take it out so down up down
like<00:03:26.409> this

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.520 

and<00:03:29.730> then<00:03:30.730> on<00:03:30.909> the<00:03:31.030> next<00:03:31.209> court<00:03:34.079> down<00:03:35.079> down-up

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
and then on the next court down down-up

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:45.020 
and then on the next court down down-up
so<00:03:36.370> it's<00:03:37.439> just<00:03:38.439> like<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.220> we've<00:03:39.340> got<00:03:39.519> this

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.300 

and<00:03:45.270> then<00:03:45.720> we<00:03:45.840> start<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.260> whole<00:03:46.380> cycle<00:03:46.440> again

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
and then we start the whole cycle again

00:03:47.310 --> 00:04:08.060 
and then we start the whole cycle again
so<00:03:47.460> it's<00:03:47.610> slowly<00:03:48.330> it's<00:03:48.690> like<00:03:48.870> this<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:07.070> that's

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
so it's slowly it's like this and that's

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.130 
so it's slowly it's like this and that's
the<00:04:08.280> vamp<00:04:08.550> we're<00:04:09.150> going<00:04:09.270> to<00:04:09.330> use<00:04:09.690> throughout

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
the vamp we're going to use throughout

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.080 
the vamp we're going to use throughout

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
chorus we're going to go to a g7 chord

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.820 
chorus we're going to go to a g7 chord
down<00:04:18.090> here<00:04:19.790> just<00:04:20.790> like<00:04:20.940> that<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:22.590> we're<00:04:22.710> going

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
down here just like that and we're going

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.740 
down here just like that and we're going
to<00:04:22.890> strum<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.280> g7<00:04:24.180> like<00:04:24.510> this<00:04:29.540> just<00:04:30.540> like

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
to strum that g7 like this just like

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.000 
to strum that g7 like this just like
that<00:04:31.020> so<00:04:31.290> it's<00:04:31.470> one<00:04:31.950> two<00:04:32.580> three<00:04:32.930> four<00:04:33.930> one<00:04:34.560> two

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
that so it's one two three four one two

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.550 
that so it's one two three four one two
three<00:04:36.000> four<00:04:36.630> one<00:04:37.260> two<00:04:37.620> three<00:04:38.610> four<00:04:39.150> one<00:04:39.900> two

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
three four one two three four one two

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.560 
three four one two three four one two
three<00:04:40.860> four<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.780> on<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:44.010> four<00:04:44.340> be<00:04:44.610> right
