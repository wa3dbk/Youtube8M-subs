we<00:00:10.440> are<00:00:10.469> still<00:00:10.860> watching<00:00:11.070> our<00:00:11.400> tropical

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
we are still watching our tropical

we are still watching our tropical
depressions<00:00:12.540> or<00:00:12.719> ADA<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.380> very<00:00:13.950> well<00:00:14.160> could<00:00:14.400> be

depressions or ADA a very well could be

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.670 
depressions or ADA a very well could be
called<00:00:14.730> pull<00:00:15.030> duel<00:00:15.269> but<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:16.199> really<00:00:16.470> has

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
called pull duel but it really has

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.230 
called pull duel but it really has
remained<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> tropical<00:00:17.430> depression<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:18.029> some

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
remained a tropical depression for some

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.730 
remained a tropical depression for some
time<00:00:18.510> now<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:19.020> still<00:00:19.260> pulling<00:00:19.560> off<00:00:19.710> your

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
time now and still pulling off your

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.160 
time now and still pulling off your
torso<00:00:20.130> Wes<00:00:20.400> canoeing<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.939> maintain<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.900> trop

torso Wes canoeing to maintain that trop

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.920 
torso Wes canoeing to maintain that trop
with<00:00:22.410> prescient<00:00:22.769> intensity<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.750> there<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.900> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
with prescient intensity and there is a

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.259 
with prescient intensity and there is a
possibility<00:00:25.560> still<00:00:26.130> just<00:00:26.400> becoming<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.849> very

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
possibility still just becoming a very

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.910 
possibility still just becoming a very
weak<00:00:27.660> tropical<00:00:27.990> storm<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.619> think<00:00:28.769> that's

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
weak tropical storm and I think that's

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.529 
weak tropical storm and I think that's
where<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.189> going<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> remain<00:00:29.609> at<00:00:29.849> before<00:00:30.480> it

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
where it's going to remain at before it

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.479 
where it's going to remain at before it
makes<00:00:30.660> landfall<00:00:31.050> there<00:00:31.410> along<00:00:31.650> southeastern

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
makes landfall there along southeastern

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.049 
makes landfall there along southeastern
Vietnam<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:34.020> big<00:00:34.800> Rainmaker<00:00:35.190> that's<00:00:35.850> going

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
Vietnam as a big Rainmaker that's going

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.340 
Vietnam as a big Rainmaker that's going
to<00:00:36.120> be<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> big<00:00:36.420> problem<00:00:36.809> out<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to be the big problem out here of the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.110 
to be the big problem out here of the
risk<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.710> flooding<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.309> Vietnam<00:00:38.850> still

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
risk of flooding and Vietnam still

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.580 
risk of flooding and Vietnam still
picking<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> pieces<00:00:39.660> following<00:00:40.230> high<00:00:40.379> in

picking up the pieces following high in

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.560 
picking up the pieces following high in
as<00:00:40.739> well<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.879> remember<00:00:41.940> there<00:00:42.300> was<00:00:42.360> about

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
as well if you remember there was about

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.150 
as well if you remember there was about
12<00:00:42.870> deaths<00:00:43.170> reported<00:00:43.350> here<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.040> the

12 deaths reported here but the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.740 
12 deaths reported here but the
devastation<00:00:44.879> coming<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
devastation coming out of the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.010

Philippines once again today is still

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.740 
Philippines once again today is still
just<00:00:49.410> horrific<00:00:50.219> i<00:00:50.730> think<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.329> good<00:00:51.539> reward

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
just horrific i think is a good reward

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.840 
just horrific i think is a good reward
to<00:00:52.199> describe<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.160> actually<00:00:53.489> this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
to describe it it's actually this

after<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.199> devastation<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.280> can

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
after the devastation here and you can

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.700 
after the devastation here and you can
just<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.420> scroll<00:01:00.989> over<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.530> that's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
just see it just scroll over and that's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.290 
just see it just scroll over and that's
what<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.010> looked<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.280> before<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.940> had<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> lot

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
what it looked like before you had a lot

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.119 
what it looked like before you had a lot
of<00:01:03.390> these<00:01:03.480> smaller<00:01:04.140> homes<00:01:04.530> right<00:01:04.830> near<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
of these smaller homes right near the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.179 
of these smaller homes right near the
coastline<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.270> then<00:01:07.010> there's<00:01:08.010> nothing

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
coastline here and then there's nothing

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.420 
coastline here and then there's nothing
left<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.909> one<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> main<00:01:09.600> problems<00:01:09.900> ah<00:01:10.500> we

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
left and one of the main problems ah we

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.359 
left and one of the main problems ah we
have<00:01:11.820> been<00:01:12.030> seeing<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:12.810> at<00:01:12.960> least<00:01:13.369> reported

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
have been seeing here at least reported

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.580 
have been seeing here at least reported
by<00:01:14.490> people<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> ground<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.290> they<00:01:16.409> did

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
by people on the ground is that they did

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.340 
by people on the ground is that they did
not<00:01:16.680> understand<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> storm<00:01:18.119> surge<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.900> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
not understand what a storm surge is and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.070 
not understand what a storm surge is and
it<00:01:20.280> really<00:01:20.310> thought<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.810> moved<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it really thought of you just moved a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.350 
it really thought of you just moved a
little<00:01:22.229> bit<00:01:22.380> farther<00:01:22.710> inland<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.580> they

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
little bit farther inland and they

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.640 
little bit farther inland and they
thought<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.830> would<00:01:26.369> not<00:01:26.580> reach<00:01:26.939> them

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
thought that this would not reach them

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.740 
thought that this would not reach them
unfortunately<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> storm<00:01:29.040> surge<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:30.270> many

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
unfortunately a storm surge in many

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.810 
unfortunately a storm surge in many
aspects<00:01:31.350> looks<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> tsunami<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.670> not<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
aspects looks like a tsunami it's not a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.760 
aspects looks like a tsunami it's not a
tsunami<00:01:33.180> by<00:01:33.390> any<00:01:33.600> means<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.259> has<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.530> same

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
tsunami by any means but it has the same

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.789 
tsunami by any means but it has the same
outcome<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.689> not<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.320> sea<00:01:37.470> level

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
outcome and it's not just a sea level

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.390 
outcome and it's not just a sea level
rise<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.820> massive<00:01:39.180> wall<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.840> water

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
rise but just a massive wall of water

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.340 
rise but just a massive wall of water
continuous<00:01:41.400> wall<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.820> water<00:01:41.970> at<00:01:42.299> last<00:01:42.570> four

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
continuous wall of water at last four

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.260 
continuous wall of water at last four
hour<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.979> still<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.369> horrific<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
hour and it still is just horrific to
