00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
with a mirror it's not bad for abstract

with a mirror it's not bad for abstract
it's<00:01:12.950> kind<00:01:13.220> of<00:01:13.250> interesting<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:15.110> other<00:01:15.259> thing

that bothers me really is kind of the
weight<00:01:19.819> of<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.270> lines<00:01:20.539> there

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
not right right here I like to have just

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.649 
not right right here I like to have just
a<00:01:52.970> touch<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:55.729> making<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> water<00:01:57.119> go<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> this

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
a touch of making the water go to this

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:10.660 
a touch of making the water go to this
way<00:01:58.039> and<00:01:59.039> step<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.460> down<00:01:59.490> now

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.160 

and<00:02:11.270> I<00:02:11.300> think<00:02:11.630> um<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:14.660> know<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.810> should<00:02:15.020> always

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
and I think um you know I should always

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.309 
and I think um you know I should always
keep<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.770> working<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.459> this<00:02:16.780> but<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.810> think<00:02:18.170> I'm

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
keep on working on this but I think I'm

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.440 
keep on working on this but I think I'm
gonna<00:02:18.530> stop<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:20.390> call<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.990> done<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:22.450> didn't

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
gonna stop and call it done I didn't

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.130 
gonna stop and call it done I didn't
want<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.690> show<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:25.490> painting<00:02:26.000> as<00:02:26.240> it's

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
want to show you the painting as it's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.370 
want to show you the painting as it's
mattered<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.920> whole<00:02:28.130> thing<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.020> think<00:02:30.260> it

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
mattered the whole thing and I think it

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.040 
mattered the whole thing and I think it
turned<00:02:30.620> out<00:02:30.830> quite<00:02:31.720> attractive<00:02:32.770> it's<00:02:33.770> very

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
turned out quite attractive it's very

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.390 
turned out quite attractive it's very
abstract<00:02:36.550> but<00:02:37.550> yet<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.940> has<00:02:38.150> some<00:02:38.989> realism<00:02:39.410> and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
abstract but yet it has some realism and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.770 
abstract but yet it has some realism and
I<00:02:41.360> hope<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.410> have<00:02:42.650> enjoyed<00:02:42.860> this<00:02:43.660> thank<00:02:44.660> you

I<00:02:45.850> guess<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:47.030> could<00:02:47.270> show<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.540> some<00:02:47.900> close-ups

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
I guess I could show you some close-ups

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.259 
I guess I could show you some close-ups
oh<00:02:48.709> maybe<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.550> would<00:02:49.760> do<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.150> just<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.660> moment

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
show you this one area but I kind of

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.060 
show you this one area but I kind of
really<00:03:28.670> like<00:03:28.700> right<00:03:29.270> there<00:03:29.600> yeah<00:03:30.380> if<00:03:30.710> you<00:03:30.890> look

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
really like right there yeah if you look

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.250 
really like right there yeah if you look
closely<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.760> can<00:03:31.880> see<00:03:32.150> ships<00:03:32.450> way<00:03:32.720> back<00:03:33.020> in

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
closely you can see ships way back in

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.240 
closely you can see ships way back in
there<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:34.610> I<00:03:34.730> didn't<00:03:35.060> even<00:03:35.180> make<00:03:35.390> those<00:03:35.690> the

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
there and I didn't even make those the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.150 
there and I didn't even make those the
water<00:03:37.250> did<00:03:37.610> that<00:03:37.850> all<00:03:38.180> by<00:03:38.330> itself<00:03:38.960> I<00:03:39.320> think

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
water did that all by itself I think

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.970 
water did that all by itself I think
that's<00:03:40.730> really<00:03:41.090> neat

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
that's really neat

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.050 
that's really neat
so<00:03:43.120> all<00:03:44.120> those<00:03:44.540> different<00:03:44.570> things<00:03:45.760> just<00:03:46.760> came

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
so all those different things just came

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.790 
so all those different things just came
about<00:03:47.450> as<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:47.990> put<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.560> brush<00:03:48.710> to<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.420> paper

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
about as I put the brush to the paper

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.090 
about as I put the brush to the paper
and<00:03:51.800> some<00:03:52.160> um<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:54.230> kept<00:03:55.030> just<00:03:56.030> as<00:03:56.270> it<00:03:56.420> looks

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
and some um I I kept just as it looks

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.280 
and some um I I kept just as it looks

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
can make a pain by just putting paint on

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.580 
can make a pain by just putting paint on
and<00:04:30.670> it<00:04:31.670> takes<00:04:31.940> a<00:04:32.090> little<00:04:32.240> practice<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:32.900> find

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
and it takes a little practice to find

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.090 
and it takes a little practice to find
something<00:04:34.130> maybe<00:04:34.400> but<00:04:35.380> all<00:04:36.380> those<00:04:36.800> that<00:04:37.070> are

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.720 
something maybe but all those that are
beginning<00:04:37.700> it<00:04:38.860> it's<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:40.010> wonderful<00:04:40.490> way<00:04:40.700> to

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
beginning it it's a wonderful way to

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.110 
beginning it it's a wonderful way to
learn<00:04:41.240> how<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.600> use<00:04:42.050> watercolor<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:43.550> to

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
learn how to use watercolor and to

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.250 
learn how to use watercolor and to
loosen<00:04:44.780> up<00:04:45.400> instead<00:04:46.400> of<00:04:46.520> drawing<00:04:47.260> everything

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
loosen up instead of drawing everything

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.070 
loosen up instead of drawing everything
in<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.070> filling<00:04:49.580> around<00:04:50.030> it<00:04:51.340> it's<00:04:52.340> nice<00:04:53.080> but

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
in and filling around it it's nice but

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.470 
in and filling around it it's nice but
this<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:54.500> a<00:04:54.530> new<00:04:54.860> kind<00:04:55.430> of<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.669> new<00:04:55.850> version<00:04:56.210> for

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.360 
and sometimes when I'm painting like
this<00:05:06.740> I<00:05:07.070> will<00:05:07.910> find<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.960> abstract<00:05:09.650> um<00:05:10.070> much

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
this I will find the abstract um much
