00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
drink their blood it's very obvious

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.069

something<00:03:33.120> like<00:03:33.269> this<00:03:33.419> is<00:03:33.599> going<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.930> happen

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
something like this is going to happen

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.979 
something like this is going to happen
sooner<00:03:34.919> or<00:03:34.949> later<00:03:35.099> it<00:03:35.639> just<00:03:36.359> it's<00:03:36.689> the<00:03:36.840> main

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
sooner or later it just it's the main

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.259 
sooner or later it just it's the main
question<00:03:37.139> of<00:03:37.530> when<00:03:38.220> it's<00:03:38.609> gonna<00:03:38.819> happen<00:03:38.909> in

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
question of when it's gonna happen in

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.909 
question of when it's gonna happen in
how<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:39.959> gonna<00:03:40.049> happen<00:03:40.290> because<00:03:40.590> right<00:03:40.889> now

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
how it's gonna happen because right now

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.300 
how it's gonna happen because right now
he's<00:03:41.909> shown<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.419> lot<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.840> restraint<00:03:43.250> but<00:03:44.250> I

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
he's shown a lot of restraint but I

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.589 
he's shown a lot of restraint but I
highly<00:03:44.489> doubt<00:03:44.699> that's<00:03:44.939> gonna<00:03:45.000> hold<00:03:45.239> for<00:03:45.359> long

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
highly doubt that's gonna hold for long

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.330 
highly doubt that's gonna hold for long
I<00:03:45.840> really<00:03:46.530> doubt<00:03:46.709> that's<00:03:46.949> gonna<00:03:47.009> hold<00:03:47.250> for

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
I really doubt that's gonna hold for

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.830 
I really doubt that's gonna hold for
long<00:03:47.579> but<00:03:47.759> I'm<00:03:47.849> glad<00:03:48.000> he's<00:03:48.269> holding<00:03:48.509> restraint

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
long but I'm glad he's holding restraint

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.599 
long but I'm glad he's holding restraint
at<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.019> very<00:03:49.169> least<00:03:49.409> where<00:03:49.829> he's<00:03:50.280> trying<00:03:50.549> to

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
at the very least where he's trying to

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.129 
at the very least where he's trying to
help<00:03:50.729> out<00:03:50.849> people<00:03:51.090> but<00:03:51.359> also<00:03:51.389> holding<00:03:51.959> back

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
help out people but also holding back

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.679 
help out people but also holding back
his<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.500> her<00:03:52.590> urges<00:03:53.129> now<00:03:54.090> when<00:03:54.359> it<00:03:54.449> comes<00:03:54.479> to

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
his in her urges now when it comes to

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.199 
his in her urges now when it comes to
the<00:03:54.810> artwork<00:03:55.229> the<00:03:55.590> artwork<00:03:56.040> once<00:03:56.759> again<00:03:56.879> looks

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
the artwork the artwork once again looks

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.229 
the artwork the artwork once again looks
very<00:03:57.299> similar<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.799> artwork<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.519> aqua<00:04:00.120> no

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
very similar to the artwork of aqua no

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.179 
very similar to the artwork of aqua no
Hana<00:04:00.449> it<00:04:00.719> really<00:04:01.049> does<00:04:01.319> it<00:04:01.590> looks<00:04:01.799> very

Hana it really does it looks very

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.499 
Hana it really does it looks very
similar<00:04:02.459> to<00:04:02.669> it<00:04:02.909> but<00:04:03.060> that's<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.389> be<00:04:03.419> expected

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:03.509 
similar to it but that's to be expected

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.569 
similar to it but that's to be expected
when<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.109> comes<00:04:04.259> to<00:04:04.349> this<00:04:04.439> Monica<00:04:04.979> but<00:04:05.489> the

artwork I'm loving the way the shadowing
is<00:04:07.620> done<00:04:07.829> at<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.159> characters<00:04:08.639> I'm<00:04:08.759> loving

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
that I'm loving the panel work with

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.990 
that I'm loving the panel work with
shadowing<00:04:11.039> with<00:04:11.159> the<00:04:11.250> backgrounds<00:04:11.819> that<00:04:11.879> the

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
shadowing with the backgrounds that the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.360 
shadowing with the backgrounds that the
characters<00:04:12.479> do<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.139> way<00:04:13.289> the<00:04:13.650> scenes<00:04:14.159> of<00:04:14.310> the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
characters do the way the scenes of the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.039 
characters do the way the scenes of the
buildings<00:04:14.849> look<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.329> forest<00:04:15.719> when<00:04:15.930> you

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
buildings look to the forest when you

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.629 
buildings look to the forest when you
know<00:04:16.139> they<00:04:16.349> were<00:04:16.409> in<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.650> park<00:04:16.919> when<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.219> poor

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
know they were in the park when the poor

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.449 
know they were in the park when the poor
guy<00:04:17.789> was<00:04:17.849> getting<00:04:18.150> bullied<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:19.680> like<00:04:20.070> the

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
guy was getting bullied I I like the

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.939 
guy was getting bullied I I like the
artwork<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.659> chapter<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.019> think<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:22.710> far

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
artwork of this chapter I think so far

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.140 
artwork of this chapter I think so far
from<00:04:23.099> what<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.310> have<00:04:23.490> seen<00:04:23.520> from<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:23.969> past

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
from what I have seen from the past

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.720 
from what I have seen from the past
couple<00:04:24.360> chapters<00:04:24.599> I<00:04:24.840> think<00:04:24.990> this<00:04:25.110> is

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
couple chapters I think this is

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.160 
couple chapters I think this is
one<00:04:26.000> of<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.150> better<00:04:26.330> chapters<00:04:26.810> when<00:04:26.930> it<00:04:27.020> comes

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
one of the better chapters when it comes

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.360 
one of the better chapters when it comes
to<00:04:27.320> art<00:04:27.470> work<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.710> seems<00:04:27.920> like<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.190> long

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
to art work it seems like the long

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.830 
to art work it seems like the long
because<00:04:28.640> starting<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.120> figure<00:04:29.300> out<00:04:29.480> what<00:04:29.630> type

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
because starting to figure out what type

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.590 
because starting to figure out what type
of<00:04:29.870> style<00:04:30.320> of<00:04:30.560> artwork<00:04:31.100> he<00:04:32.030> or<00:04:32.150> she<00:04:32.180> wants<00:04:32.510> to

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
of style of artwork he or she wants to

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.910 
of style of artwork he or she wants to
go<00:04:32.720> with<00:04:32.750> like<00:04:33.050> for<00:04:33.230> instance<00:04:33.290> what<00:04:33.650> type<00:04:33.890> of

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
go with like for instance what type of

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.740 
go with like for instance what type of
style<00:04:34.280> they<00:04:34.850> want<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.120> go<00:04:35.240> with<00:04:35.450> throughout

the rest of this series the big question

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.200 
the rest of this series the big question

chapter 5 you have to wonder what

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.450 
chapter 5 you have to wonder what
direction<00:04:45.170> is<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.500> series<00:04:46.010> going<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.310> take
