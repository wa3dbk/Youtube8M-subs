tight-lipped when he came out I'm sure

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.670 
tight-lipped when he came out I'm sure
he<00:00:37.270> was<00:00:37.420> told<00:00:37.690> that<00:00:37.840> it's<00:00:38.289> probably<00:00:38.559> in

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680

everybody's<00:00:39.129> best<00:00:39.309> interest<00:00:39.789> not<00:00:40.109> to<00:00:41.109> talk<00:00:41.440> a

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
everybody's best interest not to talk a

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.650 
everybody's best interest not to talk a
whole<00:00:41.710> lot<00:00:41.770> about<00:00:41.949> it<00:00:42.190> but<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:43.000> Jerry<00:00:43.420> doesn't

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
whole lot about it but and Jerry doesn't

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.849 
whole lot about it but and Jerry doesn't
talk<00:00:43.870> a<00:00:43.899> whole<00:00:44.109> lot<00:00:44.170> about<00:00:44.289> those<00:00:44.649> things

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
talk a whole lot about those things

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:46.529 
talk a whole lot about those things
anyway<00:00:45.280> I've<00:00:45.460> learned<00:00:45.850> that<00:00:46.000> over<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.359> years

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
anyway I've learned that over the years

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.049 
anyway I've learned that over the years
so<00:00:46.870> I<00:00:47.050> think<00:00:47.769> it'll<00:00:47.890> be<00:00:48.010> an<00:00:48.250> ongoing<00:00:48.640> situation

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
so I think it'll be an ongoing situation

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.729 
so I think it'll be an ongoing situation
that<00:00:49.539> we<00:00:49.629> have<00:00:49.750> to<00:00:49.899> monitor<00:00:50.050> but<00:00:50.440> I<00:00:50.469> think

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
that we have to monitor but I think

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.090 
that we have to monitor but I think
it'll<00:00:50.859> be<00:00:51.180> monitored<00:00:52.180> behind<00:00:52.840> from<00:00:53.739> afar<00:00:54.039> a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
it'll be monitored behind from afar a

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.349 
it'll be monitored behind from afar a
little<00:00:54.489> bit<00:00:54.579> farther<00:00:54.789> than<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.149> has<00:00:55.329> been

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
little bit farther than it has been

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.139 
little bit farther than it has been
right<00:00:55.809> guys<00:00:56.320> if<00:00:56.710> you<00:00:56.890> want<00:00:57.129> to<00:00:57.190> talk<00:00:58.090> about

that's all well he was interesting

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.710 
that's all well he was interesting

all<00:01:58.179> I'm<00:01:58.479> trying<00:01:58.720> to<00:01:58.750> do<00:01:58.899> is<00:01:59.020> win<00:01:59.259> so<00:02:00.039> I'm<00:02:01.030> not

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
all I'm trying to do is win so I'm not

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.419 
all I'm trying to do is win so I'm not
exactly<00:02:01.390> sure<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:02.259> think<00:02:02.530> he's<00:02:02.799> been<00:02:03.069> given<00:02:03.369> a

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
exactly sure I think he's been given a

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.999 
exactly sure I think he's been given a
lot<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.640> think<00:02:04.000> about<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:04.659> I<00:02:04.929> think<00:02:04.959> he<00:02:05.590> he

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
lot to think about and I think he he

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.279 
lot to think about and I think he he
actually<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.849> hit<00:02:07.149> a<00:02:07.179> core<00:02:07.599> with<00:02:07.869> him<00:02:08.110> this

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
actually it hit a core with him this

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.229 
actually it hit a core with him this
time<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.829> he<00:02:08.920> might<00:02:09.160> actually<00:02:09.399> change<00:02:09.880> some

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
time and he might actually change some

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.569 
time and he might actually change some
of<00:02:10.269> these<00:02:10.450> ways<00:02:10.690> of<00:02:10.869> handling<00:02:11.079> Andre<00:02:11.739> really

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
of these ways of handling Andre really

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:13.830 
of these ways of handling Andre really
you<00:02:12.700> think<00:02:12.760> that's<00:02:13.090> good<00:02:13.390> thing<00:02:13.599> or<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> bad

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
you think that's good thing or a bad

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.140 
you think that's good thing or a bad
thing<00:02:13.959> Hank<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.709> good<00:02:14.890> night<00:02:15.130> all<00:02:15.880> the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
thing Hank it's a good night all the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.610 
thing Hank it's a good night all the

stuff that's usually said somewhere

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.840 
stuff that's usually said somewhere
along<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:17.950> line<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.160> know<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.549> doesn't

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
along the line you know it doesn't

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.550 
along the line you know it doesn't
really<00:02:18.970> make<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.269> a<00:02:19.420> basketball<00:02:19.989> player<00:02:20.140> but

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
makes you basketball players coming out

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.599 
makes you basketball players coming out
of<00:02:22.180> here<00:02:22.269> playing<00:02:22.540> hard<00:02:23.250> plan<00:02:24.250> with<00:02:24.430> your

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:24.609 
of here playing hard plan with your

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.640

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
teammates and that's the bottom line

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.500 
teammates and that's the bottom line
look<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.459> think<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.760> handle<00:02:31.060> every<00:02:31.269> player

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
look I think you handle every player

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.660 
look I think you handle every player
differently<00:02:32.019> you<00:02:32.650> know<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.769> mean<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.220> think<00:02:33.400> you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
differently you know I mean I think you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.580 
differently you know I mean I think you
handle<00:02:33.940> your<00:02:34.090> kids<00:02:34.329> differently<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:35.560> know

handle your kids differently you know

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.199 
handle your kids differently you know
however<00:02:36.489> you<00:02:36.730> do<00:02:36.940> that<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.329> you<00:02:38.260> know<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.410> think

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
however you do that and you know I think

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.000 
however you do that and you know I think
