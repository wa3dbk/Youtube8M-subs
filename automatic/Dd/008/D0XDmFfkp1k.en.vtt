aiming<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.630> was<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.049> me<00:01:31.200> holding<00:01:31.770> down<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
aiming that was just me holding down the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.170 
aiming that was just me holding down the
aim<00:01:33.030> button<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.540> firing<00:01:33.890> now<00:01:35.030> like<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.119> said

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
aim button and firing now like I said

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.999 
aim button and firing now like I said
this<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.479> really<00:01:36.509> good<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:36.960> fully<00:01:37.500> automatic

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
this is really good for fully automatic

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.569 
this is really good for fully automatic
fire<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.549> me<00:01:38.700> personally<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.299> tap<00:01:39.720> fire<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> lot

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
fire but me personally I tap fire a lot

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.639 
fire but me personally I tap fire a lot
so<00:01:41.780> one<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> things<00:01:43.110> with<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.290> sub<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.500> grip

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
so one of the things with a sub you grip

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.899 
so one of the things with a sub you grip
that<00:01:43.740> got<00:01:43.890> me<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.189> does<00:01:44.369> improve<00:01:44.640> fully

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
that got me it does improve fully

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.399 
that got me it does improve fully
automatic<00:01:45.299> fire<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.869> you're<00:01:45.990> gonna<00:01:46.140> make

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
automatic fire but you're gonna make

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.980 
automatic fire but you're gonna make
mainly<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.340> full<00:01:47.610> auto<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:48.119> close<00:01:48.329> range

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
mainly be going full auto at close range

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.069 
mainly be going full auto at close range
so<00:01:49.799> really<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.970> extra<00:01:51.299> aim<00:01:51.479> or<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
so really the extra aim or the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.810 
so really the extra aim or the
improvement<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.799> accuracy<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.520> fully

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
improvement of accuracy a fully

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.810 
improvement of accuracy a fully
automatic<00:01:54.030> fire<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.720> really<00:01:54.960> doesn't<00:01:55.820> benefit

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
automatic fire it really doesn't benefit

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.639 
automatic fire it really doesn't benefit
a<00:01:56.880> whole<00:01:57.090> lot<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.509> me<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:57.869> close<00:01:58.350> range

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
a whole lot to me because close range

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.620 
a whole lot to me because close range
you<00:01:58.770> should<00:01:58.920> know<00:01:59.219> how<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.460> keep<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.939> weapon

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you should know how to keep the weapon

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.859 
you should know how to keep the weapon
on<00:02:00.780> them<00:02:00.990> know<00:02:01.799> what<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.979> mean<00:02:02.159> oh<00:02:02.600> ankle<00:02:03.600> grip

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
on them know what I mean oh ankle grip

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.020 
on them know what I mean oh ankle grip
it<00:02:04.049> reduces<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.740> first<00:02:04.950> shot<00:02:05.250> recoil<00:02:05.520> right

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
it reduces the first shot recoil right

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.389 
it reduces the first shot recoil right
so<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.259> basically<00:02:07.500> means<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.129> get<00:02:08.220> two

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
so that basically means you can get two

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.240 
so that basically means you can get two
shots<00:02:08.729> very<00:02:09.170> accurately<00:02:10.229> back-to-back<00:02:10.920> which

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
shots very accurately back-to-back which

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.620 
shots very accurately back-to-back which
is<00:02:11.400> very<00:02:11.580> big<00:02:11.819> especially<00:02:12.239> if

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
is very big especially if

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.940 
is very big especially if
it<00:02:12.750> takes<00:02:12.960> four<00:02:13.170> bullets<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> kill<00:02:13.620> someone

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it takes four bullets to kill someone

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.350 
it takes four bullets to kill someone
getting<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.520> first<00:02:14.700> two<00:02:14.850> shots<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.240> it's

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
getting the first two shots and it's

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.650 
getting the first two shots and it's
very<00:02:15.690> important<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.850> I'm<00:02:17.850> trying<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.210> use<00:02:18.270> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
very important and I'm trying to use the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.820 
very important and I'm trying to use the
weapon<00:02:18.960> but<00:02:19.110> these<00:02:19.230> people<00:02:19.380> just<00:02:19.500> don't<00:02:19.770> know

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
weapon but these people just don't know

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.960 
weapon but these people just don't know
what<00:02:19.950> they're<00:02:20.040> doing<00:02:20.250> see<00:02:20.400> right<00:02:20.580> there<00:02:20.760> fully

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
what they're doing see right there fully

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.210 
what they're doing see right there fully
automatic<00:02:21.570> I<00:02:21.600> was<00:02:21.840> not<00:02:21.990> tapped<00:02:22.260> firing<00:02:22.650> you

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
automatic I was not tapped firing you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.310 
automatic I was not tapped firing you
could<00:02:23.400> keep<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.760> now<00:02:24.540> if<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.900> personally

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
could keep it on now if you personally

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.320 
could keep it on now if you personally
are<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.740> player<00:02:26.160> who<00:02:26.340> really<00:02:26.700> just<00:02:26.820> wants<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.210> go

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.040 
full auto you don't tap fire you don't
put<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.400> gun<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.640> burst<00:02:29.850> fire<00:02:30.060> I'd<00:02:30.870> probably

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
put the gun in burst fire I'd probably

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.920 
put the gun in burst fire I'd probably
suggest<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.620> stubby<00:02:31.920> grip<00:02:32.600> but<00:02:33.600> for<00:02:33.810> me

suggest the stubby grip but for me

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.470 
suggest the stubby grip but for me
personally<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.890> tap<00:02:35.310> fire<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.580> lot<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.030> if<00:02:36.360> you

I'm just simply talking I'm tapping the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.380 
I'm just simply talking I'm tapping the
trigger<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.610> is<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> lot<00:02:41.880> more<00:02:42.030> accurate

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
trigger and it is a lot more accurate

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.150

fifteen percent that's basically what we
just<00:02:54.390> talked<00:02:54.630> about<00:02:54.950> angle<00:02:55.950> grip<00:02:56.100> which<00:02:56.250> I'm

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
more than the stubby grip because me I

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.290

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
auto firing because at close range you

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.270 
auto firing because at close range you
yeah<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.870> you're<00:03:22.410> gonna<00:03:22.500> be<00:03:22.680> fully<00:03:22.890> auto<00:03:23.070> at

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
yeah you you're gonna be fully auto at

yeah you you're gonna be fully auto at
close<00:03:23.460> range<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.820> I'm<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> running<00:03:24.360> gun<00:03:24.450> player

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
for anybody new to the channel so I'm

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.130 
for anybody new to the channel so I'm
usually<00:03:26.550> up<00:03:26.970> close<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.510> personal<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:27.960> them

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
usually up close and personal to them

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.590 
usually up close and personal to them
but<00:03:29.040> fully<00:03:29.520> auto<00:03:29.730> as<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.060> can<00:03:30.180> see<00:03:30.300> there<00:03:30.480> it

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
but fully auto as you can see there it

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.000 
but fully auto as you can see there it
was<00:03:30.720> perfectly<00:03:31.080> fine<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.560> doesn't<00:03:31.890> really

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
was perfectly fine it doesn't really

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.920 
was perfectly fine it doesn't really
affect<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.520> that<00:03:32.550> much<00:03:32.850> if<00:03:33.060> they're<00:03:33.570> out<00:03:33.750> to

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
affect it that much if they're out to

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.480 
affect it that much if they're out to
any<00:03:34.080> sort<00:03:34.380> of<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.560> range<00:03:34.740> you<00:03:34.950> should<00:03:35.010> not<00:03:35.310> be

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
any sort of a range you should not be

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.370 
any sort of a range you should not be
going<00:03:35.640> fully<00:03:36.000> auto<00:03:36.210> tap<00:03:36.600> firing<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.170> lot

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
going fully auto tap firing is a lot

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.250 
going fully auto tap firing is a lot
better<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:38.640> again<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.240> just<00:03:39.270> I<00:03:39.600> don't<00:03:39.870> see<00:03:40.080> what

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
better so again it just I don't see what

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.020 
better so again it just I don't see what
the<00:03:40.380> big<00:03:40.410> advantage<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.490> using<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.790> stubby

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
the big advantage to using the stubby

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.790 
the big advantage to using the stubby
grip<00:03:42.060> is<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.690> good<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.140> is<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.380> good<00:03:43.470> grip

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
grip is it is a good it is a good grip

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.590 
grip is it is a good it is a good grip
do<00:03:43.950> not<00:03:44.130> think<00:03:44.640> I'm<00:03:44.790> saying<00:03:45.030> it's<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.240> bad<00:03:45.390> grip

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
do not think I'm saying it's a bad grip

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.449 
do not think I'm saying it's a bad grip
but<00:03:46.110> me<00:03:46.230> personally<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.740> just<00:03:46.860> rather<00:03:47.250> use<00:03:47.430> the

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
but me personally I just rather use the

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.100 
but me personally I just rather use the
ankle<00:03:48.060> grip<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.360> think<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:48.630> would<00:03:48.750> benefit

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
ankle grip and I think it would benefit

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.140 
ankle grip and I think it would benefit
me<00:03:49.320> more<00:03:49.590> because<00:03:50.400> they<00:03:50.580> close<00:03:50.790> range<00:03:51.060> you're

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
me more because they close range you're

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.550 
me more because they close range you're
gonna<00:03:51.240> be<00:03:51.420> firing<00:03:51.600> fully<00:03:51.870> automatic<00:03:52.350> and

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
gonna be firing fully automatic and

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.170 
gonna be firing fully automatic and
really<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.010> recoil<00:03:53.430> doesn't<00:03:53.850> matter<00:03:54.000> as<00:03:54.150> much

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
really the recoil doesn't matter as much

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.670 
really the recoil doesn't matter as much
at<00:03:54.480> close<00:03:54.630> range<00:03:54.870> because<00:03:55.050> you<00:03:55.110> have<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.290> way

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
at close range because you have a way

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.400 
at close range because you have a way
bigger<00:03:55.920> target<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.490> shoot<00:03:56.520> at<00:03:56.820> now<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.930> angled

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
bigger target to shoot at now the angled

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.170 
bigger target to shoot at now the angled
grip<00:03:58.470> I'm<00:03:58.980> gonna<00:03:59.250> be<00:03:59.340> deep<00:03:59.490> tire<00:03:59.670> right<00:03:59.850> area

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
grip I'm gonna be deep tire right area

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.150 
grip I'm gonna be deep tire right area
the<00:04:00.720> ankle<00:04:01.020> grip<00:04:01.170> like<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.410> says<00:04:01.560> reduces

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
the ankle grip like it says reduces

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.890 
the ankle grip like it says reduces
first<00:04:02.340> shot<00:04:02.520> recoil<00:04:02.700> now<00:04:03.480> that's<00:04:03.660> huge

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
first shot recoil now that's huge

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.060 
first shot recoil now that's huge
because<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.170> get<00:04:04.290> multiple<00:04:04.590> bullets<00:04:04.950> on

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
because you get multiple bullets on

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.010 
because you get multiple bullets on
target<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:05.550> for<00:04:05.760> medium<00:04:06.030> range<00:04:06.209> as<00:04:06.510> well<00:04:06.810> which

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
target so for medium range as well which

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.660 
target so for medium range as well which
you<00:04:07.050> see<00:04:07.320> mainly<00:04:08.010> those<00:04:08.250> are<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.430> two<00:04:08.520> you're

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
you see mainly those are the two you're

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.070 
you see mainly those are the two you're
gonna<00:04:08.730> be<00:04:08.910> shooting<00:04:09.180> at<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.390> most<00:04:09.570> short

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
gonna be shooting at the most short

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.540 
gonna be shooting at the most short
rains<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.440> meet<00:04:10.590> short<00:04:10.950> range<00:04:11.130> of<00:04:11.280> medium

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
rains and meet short range of medium

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.310 
rains and meet short range of medium
range<00:04:11.760> long<00:04:12.510> range<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:12.900> really<00:04:13.140> shouldn't

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
range long range you really shouldn't

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.810 
range long range you really shouldn't
even<00:04:13.470> be<00:04:13.620> trying<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.070> use<00:04:14.190> these<00:04:14.370> weapons<00:04:14.580> to

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
even be trying to use these weapons to

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.039 
even be trying to use these weapons to
be<00:04:14.970> honest<00:04:15.209> I<00:04:15.300> know<00:04:15.360> there's<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.660> burst<00:04:15.840> fire

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
be honest I know there's a burst fire

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.150 
be honest I know there's a burst fire
mode<00:04:16.080> and<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.470> know<00:04:16.590> there's<00:04:16.770> a<00:04:16.830> heavy<00:04:16.980> barrel

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
mode and I know there's a heavy barrel

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.410 
mode and I know there's a heavy barrel
but<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.459> just<00:04:17.640> really<00:04:17.910> should<00:04:18.090> not<00:04:18.150> even<00:04:18.299> be

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
but you just really should not even be

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.210 
but you just really should not even be
bothering<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:18.959> do<00:04:19.080> that<00:04:19.260> especially<00:04:19.920> in<00:04:20.160> the

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
bothering to do that especially in the

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.130 
bothering to do that especially in the
competitive<00:04:20.340> situations<00:04:21.120> it's<00:04:21.750> not<00:04:21.840> that

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
competitive situations it's not that

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.879 
competitive situations it's not that
helpful<00:04:22.890> to<00:04:23.880> be<00:04:23.970> honest

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
helpful to be honest

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.700 
helpful to be honest
um<00:04:25.240> but<00:04:26.240> I<00:04:26.270> just<00:04:26.449> prefer<00:04:26.539> the<00:04:26.780> anger<00:04:27.020> grip<00:04:27.199> to

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710

um but I just prefer the anger grip to
be<00:04:27.830> honest<00:04:28.159> um<00:04:28.340> since<00:04:28.879> the<00:04:28.939> game<00:04:29.090> came<00:04:29.270> out<00:04:29.389> I

be honest um since the game came out I
really<00:04:29.810> liked<00:04:29.990> using<00:04:30.199> it<00:04:30.469> the<00:04:30.860> stubby<00:04:31.129> grip

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
really liked using it the stubby grip

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.730 
really liked using it the stubby grip
like<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.460> said<00:04:31.639> it's<00:04:31.759> a<00:04:31.819> good<00:04:31.999> grip<00:04:32.300> but<00:04:33.169> I<00:04:33.409> just

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
like I said it's a good grip but I just

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.589 
like I said it's a good grip but I just
don't<00:04:33.889> feel<00:04:34.069> like<00:04:34.219> it's<00:04:34.400> needed<00:04:35.120> as<00:04:35.240> much<00:04:35.449> as

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
don't feel like it's needed as much as

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.959 
don't feel like it's needed as much as
the<00:04:35.689> angle<00:04:36.020> grip<00:04:36.229> me<00:04:36.770> I<00:04:36.800> want<00:04:37.159> accuracy<00:04:37.699> if<00:04:37.879> I

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:37.969 
the angle grip me I want accuracy if I

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:39.820 
the angle grip me I want accuracy if I
can<00:04:38.120> keep<00:04:38.240> my<00:04:38.300> sight<00:04:38.659> on<00:04:38.840> them<00:04:38.960> that's<00:04:39.499> great

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
can keep my sight on them that's great

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.559 
can keep my sight on them that's great
now<00:04:40.159> with<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.520> stubby<00:04:40.819> grip<00:04:40.849> at<00:04:41.150> close<00:04:41.300> range

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
now with the stubby grip at close range

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.209 
now with the stubby grip at close range
I<00:04:41.689> can<00:04:41.840> keep<00:04:41.990> my<00:04:42.110> sight<00:04:42.349> on<00:04:42.529> them<00:04:42.650> go<00:04:42.979> fully

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:43.219 
I can keep my sight on them go fully

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:45.119 
I can keep my sight on them go fully
auto<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:43.729> hit<00:04:43.879> most<00:04:44.029> of<00:04:44.150> my<00:04:44.210> shots<00:04:44.419> if<00:04:44.689> not<00:04:44.900> all

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
auto and hit most of my shots if not all

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.040 
auto and hit most of my shots if not all
same<00:04:46.129> with<00:04:46.669> the<00:04:46.819> angle<00:04:47.120> grip<00:04:47.270> I<00:04:47.389> can<00:04:47.629> use<00:04:47.840> them

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
same with the angle grip I can use them

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.719 
same with the angle grip I can use them
both<00:04:48.229> they<00:04:48.409> close<00:04:48.650> range<00:04:48.919> very<00:04:49.249> effectively

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
both they close range very effectively

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.850 
both they close range very effectively
and<00:04:49.969> very<00:04:50.029> similar<00:04:50.479> because<00:04:50.779> close<00:04:51.409> range<00:04:51.710> I

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
and very similar because close range I

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.719 
and very similar because close range I
mean<00:04:52.009> let's<00:04:52.189> be<00:04:52.249> honest

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
mean let's be honest

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.570 
mean let's be honest
you<00:04:53.090> got<00:04:53.270> a<00:04:53.300> way<00:04:53.689> bigger<00:04:53.870> target<00:04:54.379> now<00:04:55.039> angled

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
you got a way bigger target now angled

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.939 
you got a way bigger target now angled
grip<00:04:55.699> is<00:04:55.939> better<00:04:56.180> for<00:04:56.419> medium<00:04:56.719> range<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.409> you

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
grip is better for medium range and you

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.679 
grip is better for medium range and you
can<00:04:58.189> be<00:04:58.400> very<00:04:58.699> accurate<00:04:58.969> out<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.449> medium

00:04:59.679 --> 00:04:59.689 
can be very accurate out to medium

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:00.909 
can be very accurate out to medium
ranges<00:04:59.960> especially<00:05:00.319> if<00:05:00.409> your<00:05:00.500> tap<00:05:00.680> firing

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
ranges especially if your tap firing

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.379 
ranges especially if your tap firing
which<00:05:01.189> is<00:05:01.370> maybe<00:05:01.550> what<00:05:01.789> you're<00:05:01.879> gonna<00:05:01.969> do<00:05:02.180> so

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
which is maybe what you're gonna do so

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:03.730 
which is maybe what you're gonna do so
you<00:05:02.449> don't<00:05:02.689> need<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:02.990> fully<00:05:03.169> auto<00:05:03.379> of<00:05:03.680> a

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
you don't need the fully auto of a

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.589 
you don't need the fully auto of a
stubby<00:05:04.039> grip<00:05:04.069> but<00:05:04.849> then<00:05:05.029> you<00:05:05.120> could<00:05:05.270> also<00:05:05.389> be

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
stubby grip but then you could also be

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.390 
stubby grip but then you could also be
accurate<00:05:06.080> which<00:05:06.319> will<00:05:06.529> help<00:05:06.620> with<00:05:07.069> my<00:05:07.219> using

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
accurate which will help with my using

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.950 
accurate which will help with my using
angle<00:05:07.729> grip<00:05:07.879> because<00:05:08.090> it<00:05:08.210> reduces<00:05:08.569> first<00:05:08.779> shot

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
angle grip because it reduces first shot

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.110 
angle grip because it reduces first shot
recoil<00:05:09.110> so<00:05:09.860> you<00:05:09.919> can<00:05:10.099> get<00:05:10.250> multiple<00:05:10.520> hits<00:05:10.939> on

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
recoil so you can get multiple hits on

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.450 
recoil so you can get multiple hits on
them<00:05:11.270> and<00:05:11.419> if<00:05:11.900> you<00:05:12.020> tap<00:05:12.229> fire<00:05:12.560> you<00:05:13.279> can

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
them and if you tap fire you can

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.790 
them and if you tap fire you can
basically<00:05:13.639> get<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.930> burst<00:05:15.169> and<00:05:15.379> hit<00:05:15.560> them<00:05:15.680> with

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
basically get to burst and hit them with

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.969 
basically get to burst and hit them with
all<00:05:16.189> four<00:05:17.029> bullets<00:05:17.360> basically<00:05:17.810> so<00:05:18.469> for<00:05:18.860> people

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
all four bullets basically so for people

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.649 
all four bullets basically so for people
who<00:05:19.099> can't<00:05:19.400> fire<00:05:19.639> like<00:05:19.969> I<00:05:20.120> do<00:05:20.180> I've<00:05:20.509> been

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
who can't fire like I do I've been

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.240 
who can't fire like I do I've been
basically<00:05:20.900> preaching<00:05:21.529> that<00:05:21.680> in<00:05:21.800> my<00:05:21.889> videos

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
basically preaching that in my videos

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.429 
basically preaching that in my videos
the<00:05:22.789> angle<00:05:23.150> grip<00:05:23.300> definitely<00:05:24.020> is<00:05:24.139> a<00:05:24.169> better

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
the angle grip definitely is a better

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:26.320 
the angle grip definitely is a better
choice<00:05:24.680> because<00:05:24.979> close<00:05:25.520> range<00:05:25.819> like<00:05:25.879> I<00:05:26.089> said

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
choice because close range like I said

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.300 
choice because close range like I said
you<00:05:26.629> don't<00:05:26.839> really<00:05:26.990> need<00:05:27.229> to<00:05:27.439> have<00:05:27.560> fully

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
you don't really need to have fully

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.189 
you don't really need to have fully
automatic<00:05:28.789> recoil<00:05:29.120> contrived<00:05:29.419> control

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
automatic recoil contrived control

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.110 
automatic recoil contrived control
because<00:05:30.409> you<00:05:30.529> can<00:05:30.680> just<00:05:30.830> do<00:05:31.039> it<00:05:31.159> without<00:05:31.819> any

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
because you can just do it without any

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.879 
because you can just do it without any
grip<00:05:32.689> I<00:05:32.839> mean<00:05:33.020> close<00:05:33.199> range<00:05:33.469> you<00:05:33.620> should<00:05:33.710> be

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
grip I mean close range you should be

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.070 
grip I mean close range you should be
able<00:05:34.039> to<00:05:34.219> take<00:05:34.460> out<00:05:34.669> someone<00:05:35.120> doesn't<00:05:35.960> matter

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
able to take out someone doesn't matter

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.719 
able to take out someone doesn't matter
what<00:05:36.349> gun<00:05:36.500> you<00:05:36.529> have<00:05:36.800> to<00:05:37.069> be<00:05:37.189> honest<00:05:37.520> these

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
what gun you have to be honest these

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.269 
what gun you have to be honest these
that<00:05:38.000> close<00:05:38.270> so<00:05:39.050> I<00:05:39.080> just<00:05:39.439> feel<00:05:39.620> angle<00:05:39.949> grip<00:05:40.129> is

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
that close so I just feel angle grip is

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.309 
that close so I just feel angle grip is
personally<00:05:40.699> better<00:05:40.909> right<00:05:41.719> there<00:05:41.899> I<00:05:41.930> just<00:05:42.169> got

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:50.899 
I'm not saying the stubby is a bad grip

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:52.570 
I'm not saying the stubby is a bad grip
don't<00:05:51.199> get<00:05:51.349> me<00:05:51.469> wrong<00:05:51.500> I've<00:05:51.800> used<00:05:52.159> it<00:05:52.279> at<00:05:52.370> times

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
don't get me wrong I've used it at times

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.920 
don't get me wrong I've used it at times
too<00:05:52.819> just<00:05:53.060> when<00:05:53.210> you<00:05:53.300> want<00:05:53.449> to<00:05:53.509> change<00:05:53.659> things

too just when you want to change things

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.389 
too just when you want to change things
up<00:05:54.050> I<00:05:54.199> personally<00:05:54.620> I<00:05:54.649> like<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:54.919> way<00:05:55.039> it<00:05:55.129> looks

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:55.399 
up I personally I like the way it looks

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:57.490 
up I personally I like the way it looks
more<00:05:56.000> than<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.300> angle<00:05:56.569> grip<00:05:56.779> now<00:05:57.319> I<00:05:57.379> know
