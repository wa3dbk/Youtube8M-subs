 creativity has to do with the

 experimentation but an experimentation 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.539

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.540
 the artists believe that creativity

 heritage of them but the truth is 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.440
 that if you here walk around our 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.540
 laboratories are going to experience it with 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.989
 much force in fact in the motor of the 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.989
 science 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.040
 we are changing the rules of the game 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.540
 we want that there is a substantial change a 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.760
 interesting change we want the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.159
 creativity flourish and for that we're 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.710
 putting together a space where things 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.010
 can pass 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.070
 we want that here people can be 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.840
 I'm going to have fun, I can be happy and 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.030
 have fertile ground to be able to 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.310
 grow in what they like to do is a 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.509
 space that generates the possibility of 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.369
 develop the capabilities transform 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.580
 connect people in their different 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.580
 disciplines 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.900
 we design an academic structure 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.910
 dynamic and free which allows the 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.160
 student to transfer the disciplines and 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.160
 Build your own unique profile 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.310
 the creative field project 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.599
 and for us a project 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.640
 extremely important because not only 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.800
 We believe that it will modify in 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.860
 profound the teaching of these 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.540
 disciplines at the university but that 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.630
 I think it's going to impact in 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.489
 very important way in the community their 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.640
 walls will not be limited to 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.300
 center but they will do and cover the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.300
 complete city 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.670
 the creative field is 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.349
 something really revolutionize in our 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.640
 half I think it's going to be a 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.620
 opportunity to change the vision that 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.670
 has the art of the city and the culture 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.200
 in one place 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.930
 people do not go with their nails painted 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.310
 but to nicolÃ¡s hands you paint because 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.620
 make a place for a training of 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.379
 be what we have in the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.959
 creative field is the opportunity to 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.410
 perpetuate the culture of our country and 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.180
 improve it 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.670
 are those things that happen once in the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.010
 life and you have to take it to ghosn 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.480
 because it really will revolutionize 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.480
