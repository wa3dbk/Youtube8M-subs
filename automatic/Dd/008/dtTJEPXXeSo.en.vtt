 I say to the architect he has 

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:57.319
 position problems like you are using 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:00.559

 suppliers delta metal 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:38.470
 ronan is here with me architect sÃ©rgio 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.170
 great olive tree 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.550
 false delta technology and nothing better than 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.680
 him to talk a little about the 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.460
 new product lines also site Apr 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.350
 the night crowded technology and innovation 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.800
 everybody with that little taste of me 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.950
 more to know what's coming people 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.950
 knows that coming from today is being shown 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.690
 now comes with new products at 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.630
 To recognize my daughter is already very 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.210
 very efficient and with more 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.729
 technology and more efficiently with 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.090
 new colors of combination of things 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.170
 now we have is the delta worrying 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.470
 with the water saving part with the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.959
 Efficiency system is least wore better 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.709
 comfort and lower power consumption 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.320
 less water consumption and the whole 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.410
 factory laboratory is willing to do 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.080
 this study is making available the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.230
 products in an efficient way I 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.019
 I think today is the delta arrives in Brazil 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.650
 what a fantastic technology 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:48.880
 she comes not only concerned with beauty and 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.940
 He played for stereo Lincom exactly but 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.420
 rather with product efficiency or 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.489
 new availabilities for the user to 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.800
 so this functionality collapse 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.020
 these new systems that have a 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.100
 tank 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.980
 What you get near the turbine 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.230
 already the water come out and say all that are 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.710
 techniques that we feel 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.870
 concern is from the delta and 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.210
 provide this type of finish 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.250
 this type of work is a great 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.400
 differential in this uncertainty is a 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.500
 differential and very differentiated is a 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.740
 thing that architects made it woven 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.180
 with whom the line and see available 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.730
 everything that is available to us 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.890
 to work on the issue of the 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.810
 pressure control and 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.530
 bath temperature 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.720
 I make hotels in hotels decision comes from 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.730
 comfort and bathing is one thing 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.950
 very important in hosting then 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.470
 suddenly if you have this control that 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.690
 you have water still smart in the 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.710
 our idea is different not 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.800
 spend the water does not have it is exactly 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.950
 so I think it 's very important we 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.210
 we understand that the Delta's concern is 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.100
 technology and comfort 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.870
 I do not think it 's more than explained 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.610
 thank you Sergio for the presence 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.080
 here in our program that is not only 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.700
 beginning there is much more to come 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.380
 huh 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.510
 Thank you, Sergio, God the opportunity.
