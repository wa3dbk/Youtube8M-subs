00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.099
 in the last 50 years our way of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.369
 feeding ourselves has changed more than it is 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.349
 occurred in ten thousand years and yet for 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.880
 sell food products there 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.560
 still serves images of a world 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.560
 rural and rural 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.260
 in supermarkets many packs 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.019
 present peasants and stylish farms 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.640
 30s with wooden palisades and bay 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:48.269
 green meadows is based on an imaginary 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.269
 bucolic 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.010
 today in US supermarkets yes 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.790
 sell about 47 thousand products 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.790
 food 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.170
 the seasons do not exist anymore is possible 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.110
 buy tomatoes all year round 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.490
 grown on the other side of the globe 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.690
 crops and still unripe and facts 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.690
 mature with ethylene 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.729
 they look like tomatoes but they are 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.150
 only in appearance do they represent it 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.150
 the idea 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.300
 they are not found in the meat department 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.300
 more cuts with the bone 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.530
 was deliberately dropped 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.800
 curtain between us 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.630
 the place of origin of the foods 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.150
 industries do not want it known 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:15.180
 the truth if the consumer 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:17.340
 knew he would not buy by following a 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.440
 backward the production chain of these 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.960
 packs of meat we will not find of 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.880
 certainly a farm but a factory there 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.610
 reality is quite different from what one believes 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.070
 the meat is processed by adults 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.440
 multinationals that have little to do 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.440
 with agricultural estates and breeders 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.430
 today the food comes from gigantic 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.650
 assembly lines animals and 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.290
 workers are abused and 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.660
 exploited foods have become 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.720
 dangerous and that comes to us 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.370
 intentionally hidden 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.680
 there is a small group of 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.630
 multinationals that controls the whole 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.150
 food production from seed to 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.410
 supermarket and that is taking a 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.210
 growing power is not just one 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.220
 food issue are also at risk 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.920
 freedom of expression and the right 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.310
 information is not just ours 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.080
 health to be in danger 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.180
 multinationals do not want them 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.390
 breeders talk and that these things do 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.390
 know
