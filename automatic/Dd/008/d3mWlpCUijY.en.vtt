00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.050 
pan i just realized that in the first
brush<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.869> i<00:01:21.960> use<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.100> blush<00:01:23.400> brush<00:01:23.729> by

elf<00:01:24.229> because<00:01:25.229> i<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.799> how<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.009> has

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
elf because i really like how it has

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.410 
elf because i really like how it has
that<00:01:26.520> tapered<00:01:27.119> end<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.420> gets

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
that tapered end to it and it just gets

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.560 
that tapered end to it and it just gets
in<00:01:30.689> there<00:01:30.900> better<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.670> i<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.909> pick<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:33.119> some

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
of the bronzing powder first and what I

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.630 
of the bronzing powder first and what I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
do is I look straight ahead what I like

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.060 
do is I look straight ahead what I like
to<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.090> really<00:01:39.390> accentuate<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.560> area

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to do is really accentuate this area

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.450 
to do is really accentuate this area
right<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.619> if<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.740> were<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> fishy

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
right here and if I were to do the fishy

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.330 
right here and if I were to do the fishy
face<00:01:46.310> it's<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.520> same<00:01:47.759> area<00:01:49.070> it's<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
face it's that same area it's just a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520 
face it's that same area it's just a
long<00:01:50.549> gated<00:01:51.000> when<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.840> fishy<00:01:51.990> face<00:01:52.200> I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
long gated when I do the fishy face I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.620 
long gated when I do the fishy face I
don't<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> two<00:01:53.670> much<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.060> fishy<00:01:54.329> face

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
so what I do instead is I kind of do a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.819 
so what I do instead is I kind of do a
little<00:01:58.560> bit<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> fishy<00:01:59.070> face<00:02:00.560> but<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> just

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829

move<00:02:02.869> kinda<00:02:03.869> like<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.189> her

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.450 

just<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.060> connect<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.660> all<00:02:19.460> the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
just like that and I connect it all the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:34.150 
just like that and I connect it all the
way<00:02:20.580> up<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:24.740> then<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:27.890> brush<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:28.950> down<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:32.040> that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.760 

there<00:02:35.160> aren't<00:02:35.340> any<00:02:35.580> harsh<00:02:35.940> lines<00:02:36.110> or<00:02:37.110> it's

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
there aren't any harsh lines or it's

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
there aren't any harsh lines or it's
obvious<00:02:38.280> or<00:02:38.490> anything<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.340> here's<00:02:47.610> the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
obvious or anything so here's the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.580 
obvious or anything so here's the
difference<00:02:47.970> already<00:02:48.360> can<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.960> tell<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.320> I

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
difference already can just tell that I

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.490 
difference already can just tell that I
I<00:02:50.070> just<00:02:50.310> basically<00:02:51.030> made<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.540> look<00:02:51.900> even<00:02:52.140> more

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
I just basically made it look even more

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.300 
I just basically made it look even more
sunken<00:02:52.830> in<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:54.650> pick<00:02:55.650> up<00:02:55.770> more<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.100> product

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
sunken in I pick up more of the product

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:09.640 
sunken in I pick up more of the product
on<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.670> same<00:02:56.850> brush<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.250> my<00:02:59.790> temple

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.950 

that's

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
that's

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.840 
that's
the<00:03:12.560> difference<00:03:13.010> with<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:13.430> one<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.930> then<00:03:15.440> I

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
the difference with that one and then I

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.630 
the difference with that one and then I
pick<00:03:16.850> up<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.090> little<00:03:17.330> bit<00:03:17.450> more<00:03:17.630> product<00:03:18.110> and<00:03:18.860> I

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
pick up a little bit more product and I

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.800 
pick up a little bit more product and I
go<00:03:19.880> right<00:03:20.360> along<00:03:20.860> my<00:03:21.860> double<00:03:22.160> chin<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:23.540> that

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
go right along my double chin so that

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.100 
go right along my double chin so that
area<00:03:24.230> right<00:03:24.320> there<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:26.170> just<00:03:27.170> go<00:03:27.320> right<00:03:27.470> across

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
area right there I just go right across

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.950 
area right there I just go right across
just<00:03:30.110> so<00:03:30.320> that<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.950> kind<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:33.040> shapes<00:03:34.690> my<00:03:35.690> chin

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960
