00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
of this cup I'm going to add just a

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.930 
of this cup I'm going to add just a
little<00:00:58.309> bit<00:00:58.519> of<00:00:58.640> water<00:01:00.429> I'm<00:01:01.429> going<00:01:01.579> to<00:01:01.670> start

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
little bit of water I'm going to start

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.930 
little bit of water I'm going to start
out<00:01:02.090> a<00:01:02.120> little<00:01:02.329> bit<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:03.339> I'm<00:01:04.339> going<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.670> paint

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
out a little bit and I'm going to paint

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.390 
out a little bit and I'm going to paint
that<00:01:05.410> quickly<00:01:07.060> into<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.090> bottom<00:01:08.510> of<00:01:08.600> this<00:01:08.720> pan

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
and I hope this works because nothing is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.120 
and I hope this works because nothing is
worse<00:01:13.490> than<00:01:13.520> a<00:01:13.850> paper<00:01:14.090> mache<00:01:14.480> project<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.830> is

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
worse than a paper mache project that is

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.980 
worse than a paper mache project that is
not<00:01:16.340> going<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.550> pop<00:01:16.820> out<00:01:17.090> when<00:01:17.810> it's<00:01:17.990> done<00:01:19.990> I'm

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
not going to pop out when it's done I'm

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.950 
not going to pop out when it's done I'm
hitting<00:01:21.260> you<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.740> edges<00:01:22.130> too<00:01:22.510> because<00:01:23.510> you're

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
hitting you the edges too because you're

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.740 
hitting you the edges too because you're
going<00:01:24.050> to<00:01:24.140> wrap<00:01:24.260> around<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.680> sides<00:01:25.750> that's

the<00:02:36.620> shot<00:02:36.890> at<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.100> for<00:02:37.489> like<00:02:37.519> a<00:02:37.640> like<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.239> I

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
the shot at it for like a like that I

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.790 
the shot at it for like a like that I
must<00:02:39.560> look<00:02:39.650> good<00:02:39.860> on<00:02:39.950> film<00:02:40.250> mad<00:02:40.640> scientist<00:02:41.620> and

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800

that<00:02:45.910> looks<00:02:46.910> like<00:02:47.120> needs<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.600> be<00:02:47.690> wetter<00:02:50.500> the

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
that looks like needs to be wetter the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:02.170 
that looks like needs to be wetter the
package<00:02:51.980> was<00:02:52.130> wrong<00:03:00.430> okay<00:03:01.430> I'm<00:03:01.760> going<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:01.940> step

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
package was wrong okay I'm going to step

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.330 
package was wrong okay I'm going to step
out<00:03:02.360> we're<00:03:02.630> going<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.780> correct<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:03.350> this

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
out we're going to correct this this

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.390 
out we're going to correct this this
chemical<00:03:04.730> reaction<00:03:05.590> Thanks<00:03:07.810> all<00:03:08.810> right<00:03:09.400> turn
