seems like just when you think
California<00:02:22.250> chrome<00:02:22.370> cannot<00:02:22.850> get<00:02:23.090> any<00:02:23.329> better

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
California chrome cannot get any better

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.509 
California chrome cannot get any better
he<00:02:24.799> gets<00:02:24.920> better

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
he gets better

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.100 
he gets better
that's<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.970> de<00:02:26.060> Santa<00:02:26.299> Anita<00:02:26.390> Derby<00:02:26.540> he<00:02:26.989> was

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
that's the de Santa Anita Derby he was

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.289 
that's the de Santa Anita Derby he was
in<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.350> air<00:02:27.440> squealing<00:02:27.769> kick<00:02:28.340> in<00:02:28.549> acting<00:02:29.209> like

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
in the air squealing kick in acting like

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.280

he<00:02:29.480> never<00:02:29.600> even<00:02:29.690> run

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
he never even run

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.350 
he never even run
so<00:02:30.980> it's<00:02:31.459> each<00:02:32.060> race<00:02:32.390> gets<00:02:32.900> better

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
peaking at the right time and it shows

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.330 
peaking at the right time and it shows
