 We decided to Calabria on the topic in spring 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.279
 we have ten questions that we 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.069

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.749

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.160

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.710
 its usual on our when I do not have 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.659

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.980

 Well, of course, favorite perfumers spring 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.180

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.180

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.689

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.070
 I take out winter I somehow do n’t 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.750
 I want to use it more quickly 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.880
 probably spring and summer is very easy 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.619
 I advise you to try the aroma as I do 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.250
 music fan can't ask you what 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.439
 the same song was a favorite this spring 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.920
 do n't even know favorite spring song well 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.700
 let it be a neangels song by 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.049
 cells 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.700
 now does not mean to throw fireboxes but 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.549
 i really like this song 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.100
 probably because I saw enough 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.020
 television show bachelor want to ask you 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.750
 what was your main 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.030
 and there is a goal or task is spring to 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.120
 you wanted to reach the big plan 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.190
 of course beauty and health 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.830
 The main goal and task of this spring is 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.040
 of course successfully pass all exams 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.080
 finish your work long-suffering and 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.450
 probably find harmony in itself 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.760
 because they are often lacking and I 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.280
 I try to find some things that 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.170
 I'm probably inspired by another one 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.720
 question so i won't be it now 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.150
 answer the fifth question what was your 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.459
 love and accessories for spring well of course 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.290
 same accessory this spring it will be here 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.329
 such a necklace, I show it 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.100
 probably in almost every video they are his 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.410
 bought on one of the Chinese sites 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.510
 it cost literally maybe there 3 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.769
 or 4 dollars in it very much but 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.380
 madly cheers up we are bright and 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:56.480
 as neither is a most-most spring well 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.930
 and the next accessories will be here 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.000
 such glasses and tony ray ban I bought 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.220
 also on some site and about the fact 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.200
 so as not to feel sorry for dragging onto the beach 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.790
 eat such the most ordinary fish i 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.500
 I try not to take a flask that I 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.160
 sorry they are always in my sand 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.990
 and it seems like a great option for 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.000
 move the next accessory a little bit 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.640
 funny is the glasses from the company 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.710
 the diamond is not very spring of course I do n’t 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.170
 I wear it in this form I most often 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.960
 I use it as a hair accessory 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.520
 because they beautifully frame the hair 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.310
 left such floral bezel 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.530
 these i like the next question 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.750

 They are comfortable brushes although the varnishes themselves of course 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:46.070
 maybe not very persistent but for the sake of 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.860

 any one favorite color doesn't matter 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.639

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.090

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.680

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.080
