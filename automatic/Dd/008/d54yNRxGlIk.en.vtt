cha cha cha or the four and one however
you<00:00:24.599> count<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.259> is<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.519> side<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.789> side<00:00:26.820> motion

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
you count it is a side to side motion

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.329 
you count it is a side to side motion
let<00:00:27.750> me<00:00:27.839> show<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> mean<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:29.009> from<00:00:29.220> this

let me show you what I mean so from this

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.420 
let me show you what I mean so from this
perspective<00:00:29.580> you'll<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.449> go<00:00:30.839> one<00:00:31.529> rock

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
perspective you'll see I go one rock

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.600 
perspective you'll see I go one rock
step<00:00:33.300> where<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.540> go<00:00:33.750> cha<00:00:34.200> cha<00:00:34.590> cha<00:00:34.980> move<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
step where I go cha cha cha move to the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.170 
step where I go cha cha cha move to the
side<00:00:35.880> again<00:00:36.530> cha<00:00:37.530> cha<00:00:37.890> cha<00:00:38.340> moved<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> side

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
side again cha cha cha moved to the side

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.750 
side again cha cha cha moved to the side
so<00:00:39.870> every<00:00:40.020> time<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.289> put<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> cha<00:00:40.890> cha<00:00:41.160> cha<00:00:41.460> in

so every time I put the cha cha cha in
it<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.899> lateral<00:00:43.320> movement<00:00:43.890> moving<00:00:44.789> from

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
it is a lateral movement moving from

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.660 
it is a lateral movement moving from
side<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> side<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:46.469> cha<00:00:46.710> cha<00:00:46.949> progressive

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
side to side the cha cha progressive

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
side to side the cha cha progressive
means<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.690> cha<00:00:48.989> cha<00:00:49.260> cha<00:00:49.559> action<00:00:50.070> is

nothing<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.110> will<00:02:07.259> ever<00:02:07.560> per<00:02:08.160> say<00:02:08.490> and<00:02:08.789> I

nothing that you will ever per say and I

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.150 
nothing that you will ever per say and I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
guess it's bad to say never but that you

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.390 
guess it's bad to say never but that you
will<00:02:11.310> do<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.880> her<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:13.260> let<00:02:13.290> her<00:02:13.740> know<00:02:13.770> what<00:02:14.220> to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
will do to her to let her know what to

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
to do the progressive and lesson I do

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.839 
to do the progressive and lesson I do
the<00:02:22.019> progressive<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:23.159> as<00:02:23.340> an<00:02:23.459> idea<00:02:23.549> I'll

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
the progressive just as an idea I'll

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.069 
the progressive just as an idea I'll
show<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.120> I'm<00:02:24.209> not<00:02:24.239> going<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.569> touch<00:02:24.720> her<00:02:24.900> so

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
show you I'm not going to touch her so

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.740

much with his hand but she'll know that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.929 
much with his hand but she'll know that
I'm<00:02:27.900> doing<00:02:28.110> progressive<00:02:28.860> because<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.220> moved<00:02:29.549> at

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
I'm doing progressive because I moved at

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.479 
I'm doing progressive because I moved at
her<00:02:30.209> rock<00:02:30.629> step<00:02:31.349> where<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.530> moved<00:02:31.829> away<00:02:31.980> from

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
her rock step where I moved away from

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.089 
her rock step where I moved away from
her<00:02:32.760> or<00:02:33.299> she'll<00:02:33.629> know<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.900> do<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> box<00:02:34.739> because

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
her or she'll know to do the box because

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.819 
her or she'll know to do the box because
I<00:02:35.340> moved<00:02:35.579> to<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.849> side<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:37.049> it's<00:02:37.230> not<00:02:37.409> so<00:02:37.650> much

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
I moved to the side so it's not so much

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.670 
I moved to the side so it's not so much
that<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.159> do<00:02:38.220> something<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.359> the<00:02:39.599> lady<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.170> as

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
that I do something to the lady is as

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.399 
that I do something to the lady is as
much<00:02:40.829> as<00:02:41.040> she<00:02:41.310> reacts<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.939> what<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.329> do<00:02:42.510> to

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
much as she reacts to what I do to

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.460 
much as she reacts to what I do to
myself<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.359> difference<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.079> cha-cha

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
myself so the difference in the cha-cha

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.280 
myself so the difference in the cha-cha
box<00:02:46.799> or<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.519> progressive<00:02:47.780> just<00:02:48.780> means<00:02:49.049> that

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
box or the progressive just means that

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.849 
box or the progressive just means that
beats<00:02:49.590> 4<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.220> 1<00:02:50.549> or<00:02:51.139> cha-cha-cha<00:02:52.139> however<00:02:52.680> you

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
beats 4 and 1 or cha-cha-cha however you

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.610 
beats 4 and 1 or cha-cha-cha however you
count<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.480> changes<00:02:54.480> directions<00:02:54.930> if

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
count it changes directions if

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.460 
count it changes directions if
cha-cha-cha<00:02:56.579> or<00:02:56.849> 4<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.420> 1<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.959> moving

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
cha-cha-cha or 4 and 1 is moving

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.979 
cha-cha-cha or 4 and 1 is moving
laterally<00:02:59.159> then<00:02:59.940> you're<00:03:00.150> doing<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.569> cha-cha

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
laterally then you're doing the cha-cha

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.190 
laterally then you're doing the cha-cha
box<00:03:01.290> if<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:02.489> 4<00:03:02.849> and<00:03:03.000> 1<00:03:03.269> or<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.720> cha-cha-cha

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
box if the 4 and 1 or the cha-cha-cha

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
slight passing of the feet that's what

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.140 
slight passing of the feet that's what
we<00:03:09.239> call<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.959> cha-cha<00:03:10.409> progressive<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.819> want

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
we call the cha-cha progressive you want

we call the cha-cha progressive you want
to<00:03:12.299> add<00:03:12.450> both<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.590> don't<00:03:13.799> want<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.129> just<00:03:14.370> do

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
to add both you don't want to just do

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.179 
to add both you don't want to just do
one<00:03:15.000> now<00:03:15.629> just<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:16.049> pointer<00:03:16.439> gentlemen<00:03:16.859> it's

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
one now just a pointer gentlemen it's

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.490 
one now just a pointer gentlemen it's
easier<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.819> find<00:03:18.209> sometimes<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.900> get<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.260> lady

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
easier I find sometimes to get the lady

easier I find sometimes to get the lady
in<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.859> beginning<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.970> move<00:03:21.209> with<00:03:21.599> me<00:03:21.870> on<00:03:22.049> the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
in the beginning to move with me on the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.449 
in the beginning to move with me on the
cha-cha<00:03:22.650> progressive<00:03:23.340> as<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:24.030> move<00:03:24.329> backwards

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
cha-cha progressive as I move backwards

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.339 
cha-cha progressive as I move backwards
cha-cha-cha<00:03:26.459> it's<00:03:26.849> easier<00:03:27.629> for<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.900> lady<00:03:28.079> to

cha-cha-cha it's easier for the lady to
sense<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:29.069> change<00:03:29.629> because<00:03:30.629> I've<00:03:30.810> moved<00:03:31.199> away

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
sense the change because I've moved away

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.240 
sense the change because I've moved away
from<00:03:31.739> her<00:03:32.220> if<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:33.840> try<00:03:34.169> to<00:03:34.230> begin<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:35.040> progress

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
from her if I try to begin to progress

it I'm not saying it's impossible to

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.199 
it I'm not saying it's impossible to
begin<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.530> progressive<00:03:38.129> on<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.879> other<00:03:39.060> side

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
begin the progressive on that other side

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.280 
begin the progressive on that other side
where<00:03:39.870> I've<00:03:39.959> gone<00:03:40.139> Rock<00:03:40.440> step<00:03:41.430> cha<00:03:41.730> cha<00:03:42.180> cha<00:03:42.959> it
