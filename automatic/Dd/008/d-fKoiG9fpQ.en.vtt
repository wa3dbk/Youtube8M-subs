basically<00:02:00.610> just<00:02:01.290> stacking<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.920> parts

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
internal parts it may be tricky at first

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.710 
internal parts it may be tricky at first
or<00:02:13.120> looks<00:02:13.840> difficult<00:02:14.140> but<00:02:15.450> all<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.540> do<00:02:16.660> is

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
or looks difficult but all you do is

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.710 
or looks difficult but all you do is
just<00:02:16.870> stack<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.320> parts<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.480> lock<00:02:19.480> it<00:02:19.600> into

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
just stack the parts and lock it into

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.729 
just stack the parts and lock it into
place<00:02:21.180> it's<00:02:22.180> simple<00:02:22.540> once<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.930> get<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.500> idea

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
place it's simple once you get the idea

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.709 
place it's simple once you get the idea
how<00:02:23.980> how<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.090> works

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.339 

and<00:02:31.719> it<00:02:31.870> snaps<00:02:32.290> into<00:02:32.500> place<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.230> good

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
and it snaps into place and it's a good

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:51.569 
and it snaps into place and it's a good
school<00:02:48.629> other<00:02:49.629> than<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.220> all<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:51.489> is

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
school other than that all you do is

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.550 
school other than that all you do is
just<00:02:51.700> clip<00:02:51.909> on<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.480> spin<00:02:52.750> gear<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.079> add<00:02:53.260> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
just clip on the spin gear and add the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.300 
just clip on the spin gear and add the

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.159 
discs heavyweight this half their weight
centered<00:03:03.120> which<00:03:04.120> helps<00:03:04.450> with<00:03:04.569> endurance<00:03:05.049> and

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.169 
centered which helps with endurance and

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.369 
centered which helps with endurance and
offense<00:03:05.970> boy<00:03:06.970> boats<00:03:07.299> endurance<00:03:07.750> isn't<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
offense boy boats endurance isn't the

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.179 
offense boy boats endurance isn't the
best<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:08.829> this<00:03:09.340> weight<00:03:09.549> this<00:03:09.579> will<00:03:10.030> help<00:03:10.269> it
