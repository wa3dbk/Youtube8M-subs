it<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.979> bank<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.460> we're<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.909> get<00:01:48.030> it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
it on the bank and we're going to get it

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.880 
it on the bank and we're going to get it
about<00:01:48.479> five<00:01:48.780> feet<00:01:49.049> away<00:01:49.200> from<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.530> water's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
about five feet away from the water's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.510 
about five feet away from the water's
edge<00:01:50.030> but<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.299> recommend

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
edge but we do recommend

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.550 
edge but we do recommend
move<00:01:52.670> further<00:01:52.909> back<00:01:53.090> after<00:01:53.659> that<00:01:53.810> it's<00:01:54.229> a<00:01:54.289> very

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
move further back after that it's a very

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.410 
move further back after that it's a very
versatile<00:01:55.130> machine<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.850> getting<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.240> any

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
versatile machine and getting to any

versatile machine and getting to any
nook<00:01:56.689> and<00:01:56.869> cranny<00:01:57.140> it's<00:01:57.350> very<00:01:57.560> quick<00:01:57.799> very

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
nook and cranny it's very quick very

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.160 
nook and cranny it's very quick very
maneuverable<00:01:58.759> and<00:01:58.909> literally<00:01:59.750> can<00:01:59.899> get<00:02:00.049> in

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
maneuverable and literally can get in

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.289 
maneuverable and literally can get in
writing<00:02:00.469> under<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.799> trees<00:02:01.070> but<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.820> is<00:02:01.969> all

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
writing under the trees but it is all

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.270 
writing under the trees but it is all
about<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.840> management<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.649> water<00:02:03.799> rather

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
about the management of the water rather

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.819 
about the management of the water rather
than<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.640> one-stop<00:02:05.509> solution<00:02:05.719> and<00:02:06.679> we'll

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
than a one-stop solution and we'll

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.559 
than a one-stop solution and we'll
probably<00:02:07.100> get<00:02:07.490> somewhere<00:02:07.909> in<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.119> region<00:02:08.300> of

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
probably get somewhere in the region of

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.749 
probably get somewhere in the region of
30<00:02:08.629> to<00:02:09.110> 50<00:02:09.470> tons<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.920> cut<00:02:10.099> weed<00:02:10.310> out<00:02:10.489> of<00:02:10.640> this

30 to 50 tons of cut weed out of this

30 to 50 tons of cut weed out of this
its<00:02:11.060> water<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.629> three<00:02:11.840> days<00:02:12.080> which<00:02:12.769> is<00:02:13.489> an

its water in three days which is an

its water in three days which is an
awful<00:02:14.060> lot<00:02:14.209> of<00:02:14.330> weed<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.810> volume<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:15.470> it

awful lot of weed and the volume of it

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.350 
awful lot of weed and the volume of it
on<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.799> bank<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.280> much<00:02:16.549> more<00:02:16.760> than<00:02:16.970> anybody

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
on the bank is much more than anybody

on the bank is much more than anybody
