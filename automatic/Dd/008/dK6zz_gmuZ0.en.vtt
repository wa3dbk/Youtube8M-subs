00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.060 
and predominantly a Blues player but I
like<00:06:04.270> to<00:06:04.420> dabble<00:06:04.600> in<00:06:04.750> other<00:06:05.170> stuff<00:06:05.530> and<00:06:05.770> I

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
like to dabble in other stuff and I

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.590 
like to dabble in other stuff and I
think<00:06:06.280> this<00:06:06.460> is<00:06:06.610> one<00:06:06.730> of<00:06:06.760> those<00:06:06.910> amps<00:06:07.330> if<00:06:07.510> you

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
think this is one of those amps if you

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.500 
think this is one of those amps if you
get<00:06:08.080> a<00:06:08.110> lot<00:06:08.350> out<00:06:08.530> of<00:06:08.560> at<00:06:08.830> home<00:06:09.070> mic'd<00:06:09.910> up<00:06:10.120> it

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510
