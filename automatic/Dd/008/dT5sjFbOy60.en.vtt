00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510
 well, my name is an actor and a blog 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.950
 now the first thing to do was have breakfast 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.889
 but I do not have a meal so what do you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.059
 They accompany me think if we store 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.059
 apparently there is only 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.910
 condiments 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.140
 [Applause] 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.059
 put so I'm in shock I do not know 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.769
 how many people would you expect this or how much 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.899
 people surprise you just have to 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:47.739
 they found Amy winehouse dead in her 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.049
 department of london at age 27 is 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.390
 the perfect example that not always what 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:54.489
 main is the talent you have to have 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.339
 people around you who will take care of you and 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.510
 be consistent in what you do because 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.510
 his career did not last so long 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.780
 in this vote in the movies I have them 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.040
 to talk about many many many 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.960
 dreams that have come out during these 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.180
 last days my father's case a 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.970
 comedy with wild but diego luna and gael 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.790
 García looks excellent is in Spanish 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.560
 but with wii offering with a very Spanish 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.790
 strange but it's one of those comedies that 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.170
 you walk towards the world but yes to that 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.330
 you laugh races and really they 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.509
 worth more than you think critics 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.610
 mission impossible 4 with tom cruise looks 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.740
 great all the action so check 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.310
 a few days ago the official trailer came out 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.530
 of the new spider-man I have to 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.030
 saying that it does not come out is so exciting in 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.760
 this trailer does not even come out a villain 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.340
 Then it seemed like a 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.470
 movie of teenagers who fall in love 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.820
 and it turns out that you are bitten by a spider and 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.680
 also the difference between this 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.810
 spider-man and the other apparently it 's that 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.510
 he buys two catches as the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.060
 caricature for the web looks good 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.740
 the effects on suit and everything but who 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.280
 You know if you can beat the other also 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.040
 sale che guevara servín oms 2 looks very 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.510
 good one did not expect so much and 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.890
 I definitely was not disappointed 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.080
 very good in all minutes degrees 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.760
 It will also be pretty cool too 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.780
 yes by fabri that is a trailer that 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.490
 I found out there it made me pretty 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.560
 interesting if someone finds the 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.240
 movie and how to watch it let me know 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.130
 why I could not find our 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.600
 sometimes it's very cool too probably 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.570
 many of you no longer saw the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.270
 trailer batman the dark knight him 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.460
 teaches nothing you do not see anything but the voice 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.960
 she was so fucking 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.880
 we need to suffer but the teacher see 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.890
 that will be fine or at least wait 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.870
 that is fine as you want we already know that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.730
 we go to the villains the charter is 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.319
 how excited they are these 30 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.810
 seconds of nothing but good 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.190
 and finally here on youtube sent 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.440
 a trailer of the avengers 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.510
 recorded in a presentation so the 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.120
 horrible quality but it is achieved to 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.430
 appreciate the superiors together and a little 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:03:02.350
 of history but almost nothing if 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:07.669

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.669
