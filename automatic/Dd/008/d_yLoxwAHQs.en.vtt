world of craft server and this is way

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.680 
world of craft server and this is way
better<00:00:17.609> than<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> designer<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.539> had

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
better than the designer that I had

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.529 
better than the designer that I had
before<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.650> way<00:00:19.830> more<00:00:19.859> compact<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
before this is way more compact and the

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.359 
before this is way more compact and the
first<00:00:22.170> design<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.560> way<00:00:22.800> bigger<00:00:23.070> than<00:00:23.220> this

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
first design was way bigger than this
