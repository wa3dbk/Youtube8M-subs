00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.230
 we would also be a people of cooks 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.119
 pilots and fashionist players 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.950
 yet we have the incredible capacity of 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.689
 to be retrograde when it comes 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.460
 of technology and video games 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.140
 those who hang out among the videogames have, however, that 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.880
 Italian software houses exist e 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 one in particular is known among the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.630
 enthusiasts are talking about milestone 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.550
 historical securities developer 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.440
 courses that have succeeded year after year 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.570
 to survive in a nation that taxes 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.489
 even the keyboard keys and has it 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.309
 done at the speed of licenses 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.899
 officers and passion for racing the house 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.620
 is the first and biggest team of the bel 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.969
 country 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.370
 yet even this reality always has 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.260
 lived of ups and downs and paying almost 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.149
 always at the level of gameplay and collapsing 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.769
 often miserably in the technical sector 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.300
 or on the contents 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.010
 the curse of mediocrity he has 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.989
 hit the local team could 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.000
 nevertheless it is finished and the panacea 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.000
 able to drive it away is called gp bike 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.840
 14 a license title 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.460
 very important that it represents 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.619
 entry into the new generation for 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.930
 milestone and to which his boys are 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.520
 dedicated body and soul and the case of 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.200
 start the analysis from the plus element 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.420
 important in a game of this type 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.100
 the gameplay as I have said many times but 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.049
 I 'm rarely disappointed by this point 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.490
 of sight always managing to find a 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.200
 good balance between realism and 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.840
 accessibility in its guidance systems 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.450
 there have been some style drops but 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.829
 it is not the case of motorcycle gp 14 rather the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.659
 control of motion in fact is based 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.369
 always on a familiar physical model 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.710
 focused mainly on 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.840
 displacements of the pilot's body but now 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.579
 the responsibility of the vehicle is more rapid 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.770
 there is less inertia and it has come even more 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.079
 the dosage of train folds is fundamental 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.850
 and acceleration is still present one 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.289
 long list of aids designed for 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.850
 facilitate the task for pilots 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.250
 inexperienced and make it less frustrating 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.750
 the initial impact with the product but 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.640
 even with standard physics and i 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.259
 activated stability controls is not 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.630
 a walk to check properly 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.250
 the motorcycle exaggerated with brakes or 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.200
 avoid using go May properly 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.020
 on the track and you'll find yourself on the ground in 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.340
 let it not be said 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.440
 and don't think you can ignore 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.090
 beautifully the trajectories and beat 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.260
 however artificial intelligence le 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.270
 minor difficulties 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.350
 not even the easy races are given away 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.180
 for those who are beginners 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.160
 clearly the gameplay gives the best of 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.020
 self when you deactivate everything they are divided 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.760
 the brakes and you start having to take into account 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.540
 of every single element to stay in 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.130
 race 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.750
 being able to master the system in 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.150
 these conditions are satisfying 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.070
 huge and almost unnerving at times 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.600
 as a real race to facilitate a 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.910
 little things have also been introduced 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.460
 this time the inevitable re wind but is a 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.230
 you decide whether to abuse or ignore it 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.210
 to praise then the diversification of 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.040
 media with data close to reality that 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.870
 allow you to immediately see which bikes 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.580
 are more efficient and which are less e 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.590
 they lead the experience to change in a way 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.170
 significant when using bikes 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.000
 more profoundly outrageous a profound system 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.800
 and at times brutal that in short will do the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.050
 delight of hardcore fans but could 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.610
 discourage inexperienced users with 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.410
 all the help activated the difficulty 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.240
 minimum, however, career and 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.950
 normal tenders are also enjoyable 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.510
 for those who want to try the title more for 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.580
 the sporting passion for affinity 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.740
 videogame since we pulled in 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.510
 past dance motorbikes of various eras 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.610
 and the case of moving to the contents of 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.040
 milestone title the reggina mode is 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.720
 usual career a long series of 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.640
 races that will see you create a pilot 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.140
 starting from the bike 3 and growing by 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.310
 competing competition for 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.540
 to become the undisputed ruler 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.820
 of the motorcycle gp 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.709
 or at least one of the best is a mode 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.330
 very complete during which 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.220
 you will often change teams and face 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.840
 an infinite number of competitions accompanied by 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.270
 emails from your managers and from the news 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.820
 coming from the major categories yes 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.230
 could do more perhaps but it is undoubted 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.040
 that the Milanese team succeeded in 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.600
 do miracles 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.700
 considering the limited time of 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.709
 development career will see you engaged 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.360
 in the great of your bikes will put you 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.070
 goals set by the team and vi 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.720
 will allow to retouch in detail i 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.740
 settings of your two wheels with 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.480
 engineers 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.160
 in addition to this you will have the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.050
 inevitable try the fast races in time 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.270
 the normal grand prizes and a long series 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.709
 of challenges divided between real and imaginary 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.080
 these are the flower 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.030
 pride of the motogp 14 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.709
 these are brutal moments they seek 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.900
 to let the player revive overtaking 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.860
 spectacular of the past seasons or of 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.200
 rewrite historical moments 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.790
 unforgettable you will not exceed the first 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.630
 challenges like nothing happened 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.250
 the game 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.140
 ren difficulty now and it will take 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.210
 much sweat to get to complete 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.860
 finally, do not underestimate the 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.480
 number of pilots available 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.250
 There are motogp officers 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.170
 practically everyone with a few blocks 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.240
 downloadable in the lower categories 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.640
 the icing is represented by the pilots 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.740
 historians of sacred monsters like dwan and 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.270
 capirossi that carry the torch and the 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.920
 motorbikes of the time usable 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.780
 we would have liked to try the 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.920
 netcode of the game but at the moment not 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.560
 we were able to do tests 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.300
 in-depth it seems stable for now and in 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.220
 in case the network betrays me there is always a 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.630
 convenient split screen for two players a 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.130
 better not forget a new one 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.200
 mode designed for the competitive 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.270
 call split times welcome addition 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.830
 which divides the track into sectors leading 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.480
 the race to be decided by the pilot more 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.340
 technical and not necessarily from the most 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.440
 bad in the one on one 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.030
 the safety car in mode is less brilliant 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.370
 practice is a ride aboard a 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.290
 powerful bmw on the official circuits mass 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.060
 more like an extra fun than a challenge 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.830
 real is not much control and control 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.110
 of the car is rather strange 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.000
 since it seems almost on rails at times the 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.740
 steps forward don't stop there because 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.750
 never stone in the transition to generation 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.490
 current has decided to hand over to 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.320
 its graphic engine rebuilding it from 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.340
 zero the visual impact of the game is 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.600
 higher 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.910
 motorcycle models have been taken care of 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.860
 the textures more than worth the animations 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.080
 much less woody but at the same time 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.000
 various defects remain including 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.920
 rather bland tracks some bugs 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.780
 linked to polygonal interpolation e 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.500
 of framerate drops when playing in 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.630
 split screen 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.970
 we were also disappointed by the quality 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.980
 of the visitation with little derma patches 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.990
 natural and dubious distance trees 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.060
 quality and sand in practice little 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.220
 more than a commendable texture instead in 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.750
 some cases the lighting that even with 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.850
 not very defined shadows does some 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.830
 effect at night even in the ha 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.810
 immediately sensitive touch-ups and time 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.520
 it is less robotic since the pilots 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.320
 opponents don't just follow the 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.260
 trajectories but they attack with malice 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.240
 and commit 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.070
 last element that could be 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.530
 expanded is the personalization of the 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.030
 pilot still too limited one removed 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.010
 handful of portraits and changes to 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.900
 accessories are left very little indeed 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.660
 freedom to the player in the creation of 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.640
 an alter ego moto gp 14 represents a 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.380
 important step forward for milestone 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.210
 this is undoubtedly one of theirs 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.950
 most successful works a cluster of 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.630
 content held together by gameplay 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.340
 deep refined at duty is 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.380
 very difficult to master 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.270
 Perfection can still improve us 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.460
 many elements and technically the title 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.320
 it is far from superlative despite 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.360
 the renewal of the engine but the 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.680
 overall quality is really high 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.140
 and can only satisfy the 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.790
 enthusiasts recommended and hopefully both 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.270
 the beginning of a new era for the home 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.270
 nostrana
