00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.230
 and there are spectators alright 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.720
 Well I'm here on maine craft and it seems 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.119
 manila is not but it's not a village believe me 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.240
 I'm here on the mainland items because note 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.779
 in fiat has not gone out with minecraft yet 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.390
 1.3.1 'but it's okay there is a mod 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.260
 here called 71 if these mode is too 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.270
 Cool 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.300
 Look, for example, we 're here. 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.100
 in a normal minecraft place looks like a 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.649
 automatically generated word 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.110
 but who would say that on this mountain 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.160
 right here has a secret passage 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.750
 Cool, man, people can simply 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.300
 cross that block which is not any 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.760
 a block is not only this block is the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.129
 only secret passage and look at us 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.559
 there is one that is a room with nothing 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.840
 I almost think we could 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.000
 come back is or not because I think it has 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.559
 something you're seeing you can not 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.740
 to differentiate anything, but if we 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.040
 click here also has a secret button 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.159
 that I stayed at the cool door 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.710
 another room that with nothing and who would say 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:22.380
 here has a price and it was plate 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.790
 template is very cool is not cool a 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.470
 another room with nothing that was good this 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.170
 history here the other rooms had not 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.299
 torch will be the one that does something 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:38.009
 This is not a box full of things. 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.470
 It's ugly, the thing does not need many 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.290
 things but okay a chest 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.700
 cool, and he can even close it 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.369
 it's a door 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.180
 damn that door did not know this 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:58.829
 door here is a door even look is a 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:01.680
 door right at the door and cool, cool, huh? 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.729
 and you knew that here where I was 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.530
 Look, there's only glass here and I came back to the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.970
 beginning of the map if you knew you had come 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.410
 not right here 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.090
 and most likely you did not know 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.819
 that all this time had a passage 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.180
 Secret where I could see 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.409
 Okay, my God, it 's not Mr. 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.909
 this mode works several new items 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:27.019
 several new blocks related to the room 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.280
 secret and here is tava sic container but 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.849
 they are invisible 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.180
 Okay, maybe it just all went well and 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.920
 here for us to make these items is 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.870
 follows if we put a fee 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.620
 normal over a tony network people 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.280
 does 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.859
 the torch level laver that is that torch 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.780
 which I know to tighten also at a rate 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:51.219
 normal but she can push her 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.709
 emits a tony network signal if people 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:58.669
 put the land on the side and the cactus 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.579
 so here we make an item 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:03.319
 called cold fish cord and camouflages 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.849
 from this camouflage paste to 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.500
 people can use with various other items 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.689
 to do various things for example from 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.510
 put a glass of a 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.639
 camouflage we make this glass that 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.319
 it is visible only one side is 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.470
 seeing in this scenario we can see 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.120
 on the other side we can not see 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.549
 and it's another way for us to do it is 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.699
 putting several videos like this with several 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.769
 with three pages down here 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:29.930
 another one another added item is the 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.879
 wooden door or iron door 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:38.000
 also and even worse also serves the 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.340
 otherwise I think it is so and the door 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.530
 wood door the iron trapp and the 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.530
 people make a door a door camouflaged 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.329
 begins here fully camouflaged and this 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.560
 tripod on top of which is also 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.500
 fully camouflaged 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.120
 logical that this year over attacking 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.650
 Speak but on the one hand you can say that 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.609
 Is something wrong here with this 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.109
 block ne 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.219
 beauty here we also have a block 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.169
 invisible 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:05.989
 look this is an invisible block is 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.159
 seeing him not actually he is not a 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.409
 invisible block plus one block 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.090
 transparent not too transparent 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:14.269
 but a phantom bank that's the name 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.940
 Sure you like bloch and he's here. 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.139
 seeing he takes form of the item he is 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.269
 where we can put it but we can 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.320
 cross it as well as if it does not 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.750
 there we can do it with wool or 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.360
 with rotten meat 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.400
 another item added is the lever 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.280
 that we can do with wool or with 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.440
 rotten meat also and lever it 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.960
 works as if it were a lever 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.230
 normal but block-shaped starts here 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.700
 another item questioned is the stone network 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.040
 that we do the same as this one 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.250
 from here only using redstone and also 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.920
 people can use rotten meat he goes 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.990
 act like a network tony us 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.040
 can put it anywhere by 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.080
 example here is a bit of redstone 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.430
 invisible past nerds and here's a 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.460
 lever block 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.669
 if I turn lever puts to pay the fee 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.070
 legal return is not 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:13.100
 Give a little of our 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.100
 usability redstone series no jumps 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.290
 molds and here we also have the button 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.700
 that we can do with wool or with 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.350
 meat can also looks blackout in torch 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.220
 from the publisher this is a redstone movie 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.720
 also visible and more people also have 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.960
 pressure plate that we make of this 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.060
 way or with rotten meat too and I do not 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.410
 I have here to try but it's the same 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.250
 that's right 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.020
 and lastly we have one is putting 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.600
 so that an emg pearl 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.270
 including a pearl of the end that now 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.410
 So I think I used to think 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.260
 called pearl of inter 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:56.540
 ok and I what happens here is that the block 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.760
 I got bloody shell and he's here. 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.919
 when he received the tony network signal 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.520
 it will extend the block 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.669
 so the tone is exactly how I did it 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.280
 in that scheme there when I came 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:14.150
 that torch he opened two malls 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:17.990
 gate is that I took some blocks to 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:20.210
 we see and it changes slightly 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.000
 schematic of the story head is a little 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.830
 It's cool, man, if I want to. 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.460
 get a story torch here too 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.460
 I think getting caught 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.640
 if I want to eg put pass 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.500
 one wire up 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.479
 everyone knows that stone radio is 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.270
 hard the fuck did we do this 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.620
 We have to put a network bridge. 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.550
 stone 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.650
 because we can not put a 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.020
 headphone here put it up so 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:50.340
 on the walls or anything we can then 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.360
 do the following to us and put by 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.580
 example let's say we want to 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.759
 put a lever that I'm going to put 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.800
 this block pass a wire here and climb 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:01.680
 it does not give is because we do the 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.199
 people put this block here 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.969
 century cold cable century car network 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.770
 Tony, it's like he's in it. 

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:09.090
 Do you put it here and that's it? 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.409
 problem solved 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:15.690
 now if we put a block 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:18.650
 anyone over there who passes the final and 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.650
 ready 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.120
 and ready for some reason was not 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.570
 managing to put torch is already in it and 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.570
 now it's 

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:53.870
 and there you have it working well 

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.850
 more practical than making a stack of 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:08:00.320
 melt tony agrees and is special 

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.300
