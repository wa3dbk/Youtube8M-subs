hey<00:00:02.960> guys<00:00:03.290> Ron<00:00:03.710> from<00:00:04.040> study<00:00:04.340> TV<00:00:05.109> and<00:00:06.109> the<00:00:06.200> last

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.380 
hey guys Ron from study TV and the last

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.660 
hey guys Ron from study TV and the last
couple<00:00:06.620> years<00:00:06.769> I've<00:00:07.099> been<00:00:07.220> working<00:00:07.640> with

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
couple years I've been working with

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.980 
couple years I've been working with
students<00:00:08.210> one<00:00:08.389> of<00:00:08.420> the<00:00:08.510> things<00:00:08.750> that<00:00:08.870> I've

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
students one of the things that I've

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.949 
students one of the things that I've
discovered<00:00:09.139> is<00:00:09.860> that<00:00:09.980> number<00:00:10.730> of<00:00:10.879> students<00:00:11.480> to

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:11.959 
discovered is that number of students to

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.079 
discovered is that number of students to
study<00:00:12.200> from<00:00:12.559> their<00:00:12.709> textbook<00:00:13.009> and<00:00:13.849> so<00:00:13.879> the

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
study from their textbook and so the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:15.430 
study from their textbook and so the
point<00:00:14.330> of<00:00:14.480> this<00:00:14.629> short<00:00:14.870> video<00:00:15.080> is<00:00:15.289> to

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
point of this short video is to

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.560 
point of this short video is to
highlight<00:00:15.860> a<00:00:16.160> couple<00:00:16.190> of<00:00:16.550> key<00:00:16.760> reasons<00:00:17.090> why

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
highlight a couple of key reasons why

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.230 
highlight a couple of key reasons why
statement<00:00:18.500> textbook<00:00:19.070> is<00:00:19.430> extremely

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
statement textbook is extremely

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.179 
statement textbook is extremely
ineffective<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:21.109> officially<00:00:21.590> as<00:00:21.769> a<00:00:21.800> form<00:00:22.130> of

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
ineffective and officially as a form of

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.700 
ineffective and officially as a form of
study<00:00:22.660> the<00:00:23.660> video<00:00:23.900> will<00:00:24.050> also<00:00:24.170> hopefully

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
study the video will also hopefully

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.919 
study the video will also hopefully
persuade<00:00:25.279> and<00:00:25.460> convince<00:00:25.490> you<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:26.480> crane<00:00:26.750> to

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
persuade and convince you the crane to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.290 
persuade and convince you the crane to
stay<00:00:27.140> note<00:00:27.380> should<00:00:27.769> be<00:00:27.920> a<00:00:27.949> vital<00:00:28.460> part<00:00:28.490> of<00:00:29.000> your

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
stay note should be a vital part of your

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.170 
stay note should be a vital part of your
overall<00:00:29.509> study<00:00:30.109> strategy<00:00:30.710> to<00:00:31.640> another<00:00:31.820> first

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
overall study strategy to another first

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.270 
overall study strategy to another first
reason<00:00:32.660> why<00:00:33.200> staying<00:00:33.500> from<00:00:33.710> a<00:00:33.740> textbook<00:00:34.040> is

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
reason why staying from a textbook is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.520 
reason why staying from a textbook is
highly<00:00:34.850> ineffective<00:00:35.210> is<00:00:35.990> that<00:00:36.110> ultimately

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
highly ineffective is that ultimately

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.380 
highly ineffective is that ultimately
the<00:00:36.770> information<00:00:37.640> that's<00:00:37.820> in<00:00:37.970> a<00:00:38.090> textbook

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
the information that's in a textbook

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.680 
the information that's in a textbook
while<00:00:39.380> very<00:00:39.770> details<00:00:40.340> is<00:00:40.850> actually<00:00:41.270> organized

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
while very details is actually organized

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.450 
while very details is actually organized
in<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.930> way<00:00:41.960> that<00:00:42.200> is<00:00:42.290> not<00:00:42.500> conducive<00:00:42.830> to<00:00:43.070> memory

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
in a way that is not conducive to memory

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.460 
in a way that is not conducive to memory
retention<00:00:43.790> let<00:00:44.780> me<00:00:44.840> illustrate<00:00:44.930> with<00:00:45.380> an

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
retention let me illustrate with an

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.770 
retention let me illustrate with an
example<00:00:45.610> however<00:00:46.610> a<00:00:46.700> read<00:00:46.940> a<00:00:46.970> paragraph<00:00:47.180> and

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
example however a read a paragraph and

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.380 
example however a read a paragraph and
then<00:00:48.620> have<00:00:49.220> to<00:00:49.370> read<00:00:49.550> again<00:00:49.850> because<00:00:50.180> even

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
then have to read again because even

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.270 
then have to read again because even
absolutely<00:00:50.750> no<00:00:51.110> clue<00:00:51.410> what<00:00:51.710> you've<00:00:51.860> just<00:00:51.890> read

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
absolutely no clue what you've just read

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.420 
absolutely no clue what you've just read
I<00:00:52.930> know<00:00:53.930> this<00:00:54.260> happened<00:00:54.560> to<00:00:54.620> me<00:00:54.740> when<00:00:55.130> I<00:00:55.160> was<00:00:55.280> at

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
I know this happened to me when I was at

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.640 
I know this happened to me when I was at
uni<00:00:55.670> studying<00:00:56.030> law<00:00:56.290> frequently<00:00:57.290> I<00:00:57.410> read<00:00:57.620> a

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
uni studying law frequently I read a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.500 
uni studying law frequently I read a
paragraph<00:00:57.860> and<00:00:58.430> because<00:00:58.790> I<00:00:58.820> wasn't<00:00:58.970> focused

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
paragraph and because I wasn't focused

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.060 
paragraph and because I wasn't focused
because<00:00:59.720> I<00:00:59.840> wasn't<00:01:00.110> concentrating<00:01:00.290> and

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
because I wasn't concentrating and

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.130 
because I wasn't concentrating and
frankly<00:01:01.760> because<00:01:01.910> it<00:01:02.120> was<00:01:02.210> quite<00:01:02.450> complex<00:01:02.840> I

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
frankly because it was quite complex I

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.320 
frankly because it was quite complex I
need<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.280> read<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:04.580> again<00:01:04.670> because<00:01:05.030> I<00:01:05.299> couldn't

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
need to read it again because I couldn't

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.840 
need to read it again because I couldn't
remember<00:01:05.719> a<00:01:05.990> thing<00:01:06.079> the<00:01:06.950> reality<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.579> is<00:01:07.820> that

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
remember a thing the reality is is that

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.490 
remember a thing the reality is is that
textbooks<00:01:08.450> are<00:01:08.659> generally<00:01:08.990> structured<00:01:09.289> in

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
textbooks are generally structured in

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.950 
textbooks are generally structured in
large<00:01:09.799> chunks<00:01:10.070> of<00:01:10.640> information<00:01:10.759> so<00:01:11.719> the<00:01:11.810> key

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
large chunks of information so the key

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.719 
large chunks of information so the key
points<00:01:12.439> don't<00:01:12.560> actually<00:01:12.740> jump<00:01:13.189> out<00:01:13.310> at<00:01:13.490> you

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
points don't actually jump out at you

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.999 
points don't actually jump out at you
it's<00:01:14.119> much<00:01:14.270> harder<00:01:14.600> as<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.929> result<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.710> actually

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
it's much harder as a result to actually

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.370 
it's much harder as a result to actually
remember<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.700> learn<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:17.689> understand<00:01:18.140> the

that<00:01:51.289> your<00:01:51.409> school<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:52.159> using<00:01:52.579> they're<00:01:53.210> going

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
that your school is using they're going

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:54.550 
that your school is using they're going
to<00:01:53.420> have<00:01:53.509> what<00:01:53.689> some<00:01:53.869> other<00:01:53.929> information<00:01:54.229> that

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
to have what some other information that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.800 
to have what some other information that
you<00:01:54.740> simply<00:01:54.979> don't<00:01:55.399> need<00:01:55.639> to<00:01:55.850> know<00:01:56.030> for<00:01:56.630> your

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
you simply don't need to know for your

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.410 
you simply don't need to know for your
exams<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:58.340> problem<00:01:58.700> therefore<00:01:58.880> is<00:01:59.119> if<00:01:59.329> you

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
exams the problem therefore is if you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.959 
exams the problem therefore is if you
use<00:01:59.569> a<00:01:59.600> textbook<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.319> study<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:01.340> reality<00:02:01.789> is

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
use a textbook to study the reality is

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.940 
use a textbook to study the reality is
is<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.299> you<00:02:02.420> may<00:02:02.569> be<00:02:02.600> learning<00:02:03.170> information

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
is that you may be learning information

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.459 
is that you may be learning information
that's<00:02:04.249> not<00:02:04.520> required<00:02:05.030> for<00:02:05.149> your<00:02:05.479> exams<00:02:05.899> and

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
that's not required for your exams and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:07.870 
that's not required for your exams and
while<00:02:06.679> that<00:02:06.770> may<00:02:06.889> be<00:02:06.920> quite<00:02:07.280> for<00:02:07.399> your<00:02:07.520> general

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
while that may be quite for your general

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.999 
while that may be quite for your general
knowledge<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.780> reality<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.259> is<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:09.530> actually

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
knowledge the reality is is it actually

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.820 
knowledge the reality is is it actually
taking<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.670> longer<00:02:10.939> to<00:02:11.450> study<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.049> you're

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
taking you longer to study and you're

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.199 
taking you longer to study and you're
going<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.040> be<00:02:13.099> wasting<00:02:13.430> time<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.060> could

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
going to be wasting time that you could

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.390 
going to be wasting time that you could
be<00:02:14.360> using<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:15.349> study<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.829> learn<00:02:15.980> things<00:02:16.280> that

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
be using to study and learn things that

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.190 
be using to study and learn things that
are<00:02:16.519> relevant<00:02:16.670> for<00:02:16.909> your<00:02:17.090> syllabus<00:02:17.510> so

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
are relevant for your syllabus so

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.860 
are relevant for your syllabus so
textbooks<00:02:18.650> are<00:02:18.829> also<00:02:19.010> highly<00:02:19.610> effective

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
textbooks are also highly effective

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.330 
textbooks are also highly effective
because<00:02:20.870> they<00:02:21.260> don't<00:02:21.530> actually<00:02:21.590> narrow<00:02:22.129> down

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
because they don't actually narrow down

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.580 
because they don't actually narrow down
the<00:02:22.519> information<00:02:22.879> and<00:02:23.329> make<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.870> succinct<00:02:24.439> and

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
the information and make it succinct and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.819 
the information and make it succinct and
clear<00:02:24.650> for<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.519> learn<00:02:25.670> from<00:02:26.409> the<00:02:27.409> final

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
clear for you to learn from the final

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.759 
clear for you to learn from the final
reason<00:02:28.250> why<00:02:28.909> you<00:02:29.329> should<00:02:29.720> as<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.959> result<00:02:30.440> create

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
reason why you should as a result create

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.979 
reason why you should as a result create
notes<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.280> not<00:02:31.579> study<00:02:31.909> from<00:02:32.120> a<00:02:32.209> textbook

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
notes and not study from a textbook

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.630 
notes and not study from a textbook
is<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.440> simply<00:02:33.829> say<00:02:34.010> from<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.310> textbook

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
is it simply say from a textbook

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.399 
is it simply say from a textbook
actually<00:02:35.209> limits<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.629> amount<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.900> revision

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
actually limits the amount of revision

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.500 
actually limits the amount of revision
that<00:02:36.590> you're<00:02:36.709> doing<00:02:37.329> generally<00:02:38.329> if<00:02:38.390> you're

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
that you're doing generally if you're

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.869 
that you're doing generally if you're
starting<00:02:38.750> from<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.959> textbook<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.650> read<00:02:40.069> it<00:02:40.220> you

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
starting from a textbook you read it you

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.729 
starting from a textbook you read it you
might<00:02:41.060> read<00:02:41.299> it<00:02:41.420> again<00:02:41.689> you<00:02:42.200> might<00:02:42.319> read<00:02:42.620> it

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
might read it again you might read it

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.740 
might read it again you might read it
again<00:02:43.010> but<00:02:43.549> there's<00:02:43.730> limited<00:02:44.150> levels<00:02:44.540> of

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
again but there's limited levels of

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.649 
again but there's limited levels of
repetition<00:02:45.379> truly<00:02:46.190> because<00:02:46.609> reading<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.599> a

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
repetition truly because reading is a

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.599 
repetition truly because reading is a
fairly<00:02:47.930> passive<00:02:48.200> activity<00:02:48.889> you<00:02:49.310> don't<00:02:49.400> need

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
fairly passive activity you don't need

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.000 
fairly passive activity you don't need
to<00:02:49.760> use<00:02:50.120> your<00:02:50.690> brain<00:02:50.840> really<00:02:51.500> think<00:02:51.799> quite

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
to use your brain really think quite

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.289 
to use your brain really think quite
actively<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.489> that's<00:02:52.609> the<00:02:52.760> reason<00:02:53.090> why<00:02:53.239> you

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
actively and that's the reason why you

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.830 
actively and that's the reason why you
really<00:02:53.599> want<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:54.019> have<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.290> read<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.560> again

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
really want to have to read it again

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.059 
really want to have to read it again
on<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.959> other<00:02:57.049> side<00:02:57.170> of<00:02:57.440> things<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:57.799> if<00:02:57.920> your

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
on the other side of things so if your

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.830 
on the other side of things so if your
credit<00:02:58.370> study<00:02:58.639> notes<00:02:58.909> you've<00:02:59.150> got<00:02:59.299> a<00:02:59.329> reason

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
credit study notes you've got a reason

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.080 
credit study notes you've got a reason
you've<00:03:00.560> got<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.829> think<00:03:01.010> about<00:03:01.099> you've<00:03:01.819> got<00:03:01.849> to

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
you've got to think about you've got to

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.759 
you've got to think about you've got to
organize<00:03:02.599> it<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:02.930> then<00:03:03.170> you've<00:03:03.290> got<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.560> want

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
organize it and then you've got to want

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.349 
organize it and then you've got to want
it<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.159> you've<00:03:04.489> got<00:03:04.519> quite<00:03:04.879> a<00:03:04.940> levels<00:03:05.269> of

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
it and you've got quite a levels of

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.180 
it and you've got quite a levels of
repetition<00:03:05.900> which<00:03:06.019> is<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.200> key<00:03:06.440> principle<00:03:06.709> of

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
repetition which is a key principle of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.000 
repetition which is a key principle of
memory<00:03:07.760> retention<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.530> end<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.859> day

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
memory retention so the end of the day

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.970 
memory retention so the end of the day
you<00:03:10.400> should<00:03:10.480> create<00:03:11.480> study<00:03:12.109> notes<00:03:12.379> over<00:03:12.889> the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
you should create study notes over the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.500 
you should create study notes over the
last<00:03:13.129> six<00:03:13.459> years<00:03:13.549> that<00:03:13.879> I've<00:03:14.000> been<00:03:14.329> arrested

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
last six years that I've been arrested

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.599 
last six years that I've been arrested
with<00:03:14.780> over<00:03:14.989> 300<00:03:15.410> top<00:03:15.590> students<00:03:16.069> what<00:03:16.489> I've

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
with over 300 top students what I've

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.300 
with over 300 top students what I've
found<00:03:16.849> is<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.389> would<00:03:17.599> say<00:03:17.780> 98%<00:03:18.230> of<00:03:19.040> top

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
found is that I would say 98% of top

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.970 
found is that I would say 98% of top
students<00:03:19.730> use<00:03:20.060> 30<00:03:20.419> notes<00:03:20.660> as<00:03:20.840> aq<00:03:21.230> part<00:03:21.560> of

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
students use 30 notes as aq part of

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.920 
students use 30 notes as aq part of
their<00:03:22.129> overall<00:03:22.280> study<00:03:22.819> strategy<00:03:23.299> so<00:03:23.810> the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
their overall study strategy so the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.750 
their overall study strategy so the
reality<00:03:24.169> is<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.590> works<00:03:25.099> and<00:03:25.459> there's<00:03:25.609> some

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
reality is that works and there's some

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.390 
reality is that works and there's some
very<00:03:25.790> good<00:03:26.150> reasons<00:03:26.569> for<00:03:26.750> working<00:03:27.739> so<00:03:28.310> if

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
very good reasons for working so if

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.129 
very good reasons for working so if
you're<00:03:28.549> not<00:03:28.790> creating<00:03:29.030> study<00:03:29.449> notes<00:03:29.690> my

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
you're not creating study notes my
