00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
 hello to all survivors and 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.380
 welcome to a new video blog of me 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.450
 channel today I record it from the festival 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.220
 celsius in avilÃ©s because I'm surrounded 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.929
 of authors authors who have not only 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.280
 written novels they alone but that 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.200
 they have also taken advantage to write 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.269
 novels with other people so I've 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.920
 decided to bring them together in this video to 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.660
 ask them what are the tips that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.310
 I would give someone who wants to write 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.020
 a novel with four hands 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.029
 Well, something very important that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.000
 I learned I wrote four hands is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.869
 that it is indispensable that sometimes both 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.490
 authors 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.920
 just meet to talk about your 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.079
 likes to go out for a drink to 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.910
 me the most important thing of writing a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.649
 novel to four hands is that it is the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.899
 first moment you have very very clear 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.579
 the structure of the story that should be 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.899
 know the writing style of the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.820
 another person just as we know the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.469
 our to know both the virtues 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.360
 as the defects that there may be in 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.460
 both styles if all you do is 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.660
 put them together to write and write and 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.940
 talk about the history and the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.590
 characters at the end of the personal relationship 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.899
 can get to resent a point is 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.730
 important not to always think about work 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.680
 but also to stay once in a while 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.040
 to talk about tastes to see a movie 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.600
 or to do anything else 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.220
 you respect the opinion of the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.900
 another person and I the only advice that 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.180
 would give two people who want to serve 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.460
 together is that as very much the one 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.870
 in the other because in the end when 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.030
 we are writing together we are 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.910
 sharing our dreams we are 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.830
 sharing what excites us most and 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:25.670
 then it is very easy to come to the person 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.350
 If at first you despise an idea or 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.380
 a contribution you want to make 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.420
 listened to write agree 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.510
 what you want to write and above all 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.500
 do not be selfish in your decisions 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.420
 trusting the person like here we go 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.070
 to write the best advice that I can 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.320
 give people who want to write 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.070
 a four-handed book is that first 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.610
 make a very extensive meeting and 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.040
 they feel for coffee without any 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.140
 Hurry and speak exactly what you 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.180
 wants to get everything done so 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.310
 jointly because you are going to be a team not 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.800
 you are just one person with an idea 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.570
 you are two people doing everything to the 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.880
 once at the time of writing have it in 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.800
 account and thus get the reader 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.420
 when he is reading our novel he does not know 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.720
 give an account of who has written each part 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.510
 have patience and know that it will correct you 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.370
 and you will correct it but you have to take it 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.440
 with an incredible tranquility is the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.390
 best way to work and 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.780
 finish the job most of the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.720
 difficulty of a book 4 hands is 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.819
 Both the tone style and the themes are 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.780
 say that the more confident we are of 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.550
 that the person with whom we are 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.500
 typing is at the same address 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.220
 that we have more possibilities 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.220
 that the project goes well
