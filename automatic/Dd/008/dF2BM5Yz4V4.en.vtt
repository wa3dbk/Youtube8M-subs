00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:11.549
 today we are going to learn the preparation of a 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.320
 well-cooked and super tasty recipe is the 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.869
 Who will teach us the corn 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.210
 To make this delicious is Eliane and we 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.369
 Learned from whom this recipe I know 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.359
 that she has been coming from a family for a long time 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.820
 exact 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.789
 I have in memory the house of my grandmother 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.720
 with that wood stove we'll get 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.140
 and I always saw something invented and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.990
 this recipe was a ransom that my father 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.410
 could remember all the ingredients 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.570
 and passed then write down the ingredients 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.930
 You'll need three and a half cups. 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.320
 of wheat flour a cup and a half of 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.230
 cornmeal 100 grams of butter two 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.110
 biological yeast tablets 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.240
 cup of milk a teaspoon of 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:03.960
 sugar 1 teaspoon salt 2 eggs and 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:10.850
 a teaspoon of fennel let's 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.850
 mix the milk with the other ingredients 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:22.540
 put the yeast salt the sugar into 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.540
 butter and eggs 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.000
 beat everything in the blender 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.770
 the ideal point is when everything is 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:42.130
 mixed stay is so close 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.460
 step is the mixing of flour 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.720
 We already have the liquids there. 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.750
 ready 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.750
 So let's mix the flour. 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:04.660
 we will put the 12 grass in the palm of 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:06.130
 hand rubbed to highlight the 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.420
 flavor 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:14.260
 This is a secret, we make a hole here. 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:21.870
 in the middle where we are going to put the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.870
 wet ingredients and this is accurate 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.769
 mix everything with your hands 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.100
 add the flour gradually to give 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.100
 the tone 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.239
 This is a point that we are going to put 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.069
 to grow does not aim anymore does not analyze 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.939
 sticks more in the hands 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:54.049
 We'll get a deal on a canister. 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:56.420
 plastic bag is and let grow by 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.989
 About an hour or so has to cover 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.870
 can always be covered to prevent 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.379
 she forms a cone 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.400
 cover with plastic and let it rest 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:13.280
 already spent an hour looks just like the 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.700
 kills profile looks pretty and deserves 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.700
 enough 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.200
 cut the dough and place in the pan 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.900
 so we'll take it for 30 minutes 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.980
 more or less in a preheated oven to 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.980
 180 degrees 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.330
 Can you have coffee with him? 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.330
 wants very good
