00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.850
 let's make changes in Madrid 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.770
 the keys do not have too many calories 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.110
 not too much fat what they do have 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.849
 the cholesterol here we have the streets already 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.759
 chopped washed is simply with 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.439
 water and pieces of potato chorizo 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.170
 the piece of black pudding exercises 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.330
 of ham that has minced onions 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.360
 all the ingredients and it's very easy 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.300
 let's put everything raw especially 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.970
 the ingredients indicated by the recipe and 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.220
 we are going to cook them for 25 minutes in 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.160
 a good super fast pot is 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.530
 important after removing the fat 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.570
 As you are going to see the blood sausage we are going to 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.960
 click there we narrow the psoe 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.360
 the ham the onion and a little salt 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.010
 and of pepper we have also added the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.410
 marcilla pricked so that we are not 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.940
 Blow a little bit of paprika 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.390
 you like some chilli peppers we have also 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.610
 added 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.320
 sweet paprika if you like it too 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.840
 we can put a little paprika 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.720
 spicy so that the roses of the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.490
 tasty tripe come out tasty and the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.440
 let's know as I said in a 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.380
 good pot super fast they do not have 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.990
 nothing to do with an express pot of the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.520
 of all life the water simply that 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.229
 cover them because the calluses though 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.450
 They look like a solid food too 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.670
 they have quite a lot of water that the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.190
 they're going to release if then the calluses 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 they will be too smooth because there 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.899
 times that one is wrong and adds 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.490
 too much water you have to remove the calluses 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.399
 and the potato is to say all the elements 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 solid the pan and let the 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.039
 broth evaporate one uncovered to 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.950
 the maximum form you see there is a layer 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.330
 huge fat on the surface and this 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.580
 is how important this is fat 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.619
 saturated coming mostly from 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.670
 chorizo ​​and the blood sausage we are going to make 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.100
 a kind 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.090
 cheeks with the absorbent paper of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.009
 kitchen and we can stain the 45 papers 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.009
 because we are absorbing with this 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.690
 absorbent paper all the amount one 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.319
 not all but a large amount 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.330
 amount of fat and then when they do 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.160
 the next day be solid because 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.000
 curd perfectly and a block is made 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.940
 solid 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.769
 the fat will rise to the surface and 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.480
 You will also see how it can be removed 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.090
 perfectly then already with a 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.790
 spoon because it's solid fat wants 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.519
 say to this dish although it has 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.100
 We can remove a lot of calories 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.010
 saturated fat here we see that we are 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.290
 removing the calluses may have 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.720
 too much broth plus now the tripe 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.700
 they clean them so thoroughly that they 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.040
 they do not keep their feet either 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.410
 curd as before and then so that the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.540
 many people add flour and it's 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.940
 a crime to add to some good calluses 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.790
 a flour then what we're going to do 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.670
 is then evaporate the broth that has left 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.349
 too much water for us to have a 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:07.500
 a very gelatinous cays salsita 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.450
 and very thick because if they do not stay like 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.980
 waters and you can see it later in the photo 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:18.350
 final that there is the corresponding sauce and 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.350
 that sauce is thick 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.670
 the next day you see that they are already with 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.220
 coagulate two form a block have been 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.440
 caught the shape of the container and 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.209
 then for a teaspoon of coffee it 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.819
 it can be removing all that fat 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.819
 solidified that is completely
