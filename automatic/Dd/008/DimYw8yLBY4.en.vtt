00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.639
 is being informed about the presence of 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.410
 this unstable area there in the Pacific 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.139
 that also continues to contribute 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.270
 humidity towards the south towards the west 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.189
 and part of the center receives moisture that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.860
 is generated from this unstable zone has 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.619
 50 percent ability to become 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.600
 a tropical cyclone but little by little 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.189
 is retreating from the Mexican coast little to 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.170
 little is having less influence over 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.809
 us but for the next period if 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.790
 we will wait for important precipitations 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.559
 from nayarit to the state of oaxaca 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.570
 Strong to severe the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.280
 rainfall the southeast continues 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.839
 also receiving precipitation from 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.940
 humidity and important rainfall 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.860
 achieved in the south of veracruz in 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.989
 Tabasco forts in the state of Chiapas 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.390
 and we will also hope that the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.190
 Yucatan peninsula has the arrival of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.350
 humidity from the Caribbean sea with 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.309
 moderate rainfall observe you 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.680
 the cold front number 5 is already in the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.210
 Northwest of the Mexican Republic offers 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.880
 a little cloudiness rainfall 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.000
 light in baja california there in 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.439
 sound and its displacement observe you 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.450
 towards the east towards the gulf of 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.930
 mexico and dominate the mass 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.250
 in the north with a soft drink 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.530
 temperatures in the morning 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.520
 mainly in the morning and the wind 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.679
 intensifies 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.539
 between that great region of the north with 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.149
 gusts that can reach 50 60 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.649
 kilometers per hour for what is the 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.840
 great center of the country also with 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.090
 moderate to heavy rainfall and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.799
 we will continue with that situation of humidity 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.569
 that comes from the gulf of mexico and 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.990
 mainly from this unstable area 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:42.689
 there in the pacific temperatures in the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.069
 lor of the coast from 32 to 34 degrees I want 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.450
 tell him he will also refresh a 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.399
 little the environment on the part of this 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.220
 system but mainly by the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.990
 tomorrow before the middle part of the coast 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.789
 of the Pacific we will continue with a sky 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.890
 Partly cloudy most of the day 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.989
 increasing the cloudiness in the afternoon with 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.329
 precipitation from strong to intense in 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:02.369
 the entire western region south that 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.439
 is completely influenced yet by what 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.239
 which is the system low system 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.489
 pressure there in the Pacific 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.170
 temperatures from 32 to 34 degrees with 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.660
 rainfall that goes from strong to 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.090
 intense in the little Yucatan peninsula 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.530
 little by little it is recovering 33 to 35 the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.420
 maximum temperature the average sky 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.230
 cloudy rainfall much more 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.840
 isolated will be 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.769
 moderate and in the gulf of mexico 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.780
 moderate rainfall in the south of 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.810
 veracruz in what is the state of 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.030
 light tabasco there in Tamaulipas with 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.610
 temperatures ranging from 32 to 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.080
 the 35 degrees on the Gulf coast of 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.120
 mexico to the table from the north that little to 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.069
 little will be involved with this mass 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.470
 of cold air that generated the front number 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.299
 5 we will wait for light rainfall 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.370
 occasionally moderate really very 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.220
 very dispersed with temperatures that will go 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.930
 falling mainly in the morning and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.599
 the night version maximum average achievements 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.879
 will stay on the scale of hot 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.260
 for the middle center the middle country 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.970
 cloudy to cloudy precipitations of 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.099
 moderate to strong temperatures that go 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.170
 from warm to warm for the most part 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.670
 center but also the minimum 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.590
 they are still really cool too 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.120
 in the center of the country in the capital of 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.160
 the mexican republic this friday 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.260
 Saturday Sunday a partly cloudy sky

 fresh from 11 to 3 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.680
