strongest amount of flashlight you're
going<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.250> right<00:01:46.440> hit<00:01:47.440> that<00:01:47.770> widget<00:01:48.760> so<00:01:49.119> that

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
going to right hit that widget so that

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.990 
going to right hit that widget so that
we<00:01:49.659> just<00:01:49.840> installed<00:01:49.990> but<00:01:50.619> uh<00:01:51.000> interesting

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
we just installed but uh interesting

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.210 
we just installed but uh interesting
thing<00:01:52.210> happens<00:01:52.570> when<00:01:52.690> you<00:01:52.810> have<00:01:52.960> them<00:01:53.110> both<00:01:53.890> on

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
thing happens when you have them both on

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.810 
thing happens when you have them both on
its<00:01:54.760> kind<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.420> produces<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.580> medium<00:01:57.580> level

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
its kind of produces a medium level

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.590 
its kind of produces a medium level
right<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.470> for<00:01:59.680> example<00:02:00.360> okay<00:02:01.360> so<00:02:01.510> this<00:02:01.900> is<00:02:02.170> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
right so for example okay so this is a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.359 
right so for example okay so this is a
intensity<00:02:04.600> I<00:02:04.630> guess<00:02:05.260> we<00:02:05.409> call<00:02:05.650> one<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.159> then

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
intensity I guess we call one and then

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.350 
intensity I guess we call one and then
this<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:07.049> intensity<00:02:08.429> three<00:02:09.429> but<00:02:10.060> if<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.270> have

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
this is intensity three but if you have

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.150 
this is intensity three but if you have
both<00:02:10.599> on<00:02:10.869> it's<00:02:11.200> like<00:02:11.410> intensity<00:02:11.980> too

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
both on it's like intensity too

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.650 
both on it's like intensity too
okay<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.580> thought<00:02:13.760> that's<00:02:13.880> interesting

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
okay so I thought that's interesting

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.070 
okay so I thought that's interesting
maybe<00:02:15.350> there<00:02:15.830> are<00:02:16.100> some<00:02:16.370> uses<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.840> though<00:02:17.960> it

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
maybe there are some uses and though it

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.160 
maybe there are some uses and though it
might<00:02:18.260> be<00:02:18.290> very<00:02:18.530> small<00:02:18.920> but<00:02:19.640> uh<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:21.050> know

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
might be very small but uh just you know

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.520 
might be very small but uh just you know
just<00:02:21.590> fun<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.800> know<00:02:22.210> okay<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:23.240> let's<00:02:24.230> move<00:02:24.350> on

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
just fun to know okay so let's move on

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.290 
just fun to know okay so let's move on
to<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.770> second<00:02:25.100> one<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.340> second<00:02:25.760> one<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:25.910> want

and<00:02:54.680> hold<00:02:55.390> there<00:02:56.390> we<00:02:56.540> go<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.230> took<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.440> took

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
and hold there we go and it took a took

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.330 
and hold there we go and it took a took
a<00:02:58.580> snapshot<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.710> people<00:03:00.710> have<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:00.890> hard<00:03:01.190> time

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
a snapshot and people have a hard time

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.000 
a snapshot and people have a hard time
figuring<00:03:01.550> this<00:03:02.090> out<00:03:02.300> because<00:03:02.750> if<00:03:03.500> they<00:03:03.770> came

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
figuring this out because if they came

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.140 
figuring this out because if they came
from<00:03:04.280> Android<00:03:05.180> 2.3<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.500> had<00:03:06.710> to<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.340> think<00:03:07.670> hold

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
from Android 2.3 you had to I think hold

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.900 
from Android 2.3 you had to I think hold
the<00:03:08.300> power<00:03:08.540> button<00:03:08.630> for<00:03:09.140> like<00:03:09.980> half<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.490> second

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
the power button for like half a second

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.660 
the power button for like half a second
and<00:03:11.030> he<00:03:11.180> had<00:03:11.270> to<00:03:11.450> hold<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:12.040> home<00:03:13.040> button<00:03:13.070> and

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
and he had to hold the home button and

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.640 
and he had to hold the home button and
then<00:03:14.210> it<00:03:14.390> took<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.570> snapshot<00:03:14.930> if<00:03:15.290> he<00:03:15.380> did<00:03:15.560> it

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
then it took a snapshot if he did it

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.040 
then it took a snapshot if he did it
simultaneously<00:03:16.490> it<00:03:16.580> didn't<00:03:16.880> work<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:17.360> people

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
simultaneously it didn't work so people

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.610 
simultaneously it didn't work so people
got<00:03:18.440> used<00:03:18.740> to<00:03:18.830> that<00:03:19.420> you<00:03:20.420> know<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.870> way<00:03:21.470> of

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
got used to that you know that way of

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.470 
got used to that you know that way of
doing<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.400> then<00:03:22.550> when<00:03:22.760> they<00:03:22.850> upgraded<00:03:23.360> to

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
doing it and then when they upgraded to

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.470 
doing it and then when they upgraded to
Android<00:03:23.720> 4.0<00:03:24.500> they<00:03:25.310> could<00:03:25.580> they<00:03:25.880> couldn't<00:03:26.300> hit

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
Android 4.0 they could they couldn't hit

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.900 
Android 4.0 they could they couldn't hit
the<00:03:26.540> screen<00:03:27.140> capture<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.280> thought<00:03:28.550> I<00:03:28.580> just

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
the screen capture so I thought I just

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.670 
the screen capture so I thought I just
covered<00:03:29.240> that<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.450> other<00:03:29.750> way<00:03:30.050> I'm<00:03:30.470> sure

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
covered that the other way I'm sure

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.590 
covered that the other way I'm sure
you've<00:03:30.860> seen<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.220> in<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.400> commercials<00:03:31.970> it's

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
you've seen it in the commercials it's

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.300 
you've seen it in the commercials it's
this<00:03:33.230> swipe<00:03:33.530> right<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.540> can<00:03:35.540> swipe<00:03:36.130> we<00:03:37.130> can

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
this swipe right you can swipe we can

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.440 
this swipe right you can swipe we can
swipe<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.640> other<00:03:37.790> way<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.060> doesn't<00:03:38.360> really

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
swipe the other way it doesn't really

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.140 
swipe the other way it doesn't really
matter<00:03:39.010> then<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.310> could<00:03:40.459> actually<00:03:40.610> do<00:03:40.910> it<00:03:41.030> in

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
matter then you could actually do it in

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.979 
matter then you could actually do it in
landscape<00:03:41.360> mode<00:03:41.660> as<00:03:41.959> well<00:03:42.700> okay<00:03:43.989> probably

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
landscape mode as well okay probably

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.229 
landscape mode as well okay probably
best<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.380> use<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.650> finger<00:03:47.050> right<00:03:48.050> and<00:03:48.580> I<00:03:49.580> guess

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
best to use the finger right and I guess

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.260 
best to use the finger right and I guess
just<00:03:50.270> out<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:50.690> curiosity<00:03:51.550> you<00:03:52.550> could<00:03:52.730> do<00:03:53.150> it

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
just out of curiosity you could do it

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.500 
just out of curiosity you could do it
from<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.570> bottom<00:03:53.900> using<00:03:54.080> a<00:03:54.290> finger<00:03:55.090> okay<00:03:56.090> so

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
from the bottom using a finger okay so

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.760 
from the bottom using a finger okay so
it<00:03:56.630> all<00:03:56.750> seems<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.140> work<00:03:57.170> just<00:03:57.350> fine<00:03:57.590> and

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
it all seems to work just fine and

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.720 
it all seems to work just fine and
actually<00:03:58.190> uh<00:03:58.489> I<00:03:59.000> do<00:03:59.180> tend<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.780> use<00:03:59.959> that<00:04:00.200> us

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
actually uh I do tend to use that us

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.360 
actually uh I do tend to use that us
swipe<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.970> capture<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.450> lot<00:04:03.170> more<00:04:03.620> often<00:04:04.040> now

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
swipe to capture a lot more often now

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.150 
swipe to capture a lot more often now
and<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:05.209> think<00:04:05.270> it<00:04:05.570> is<00:04:05.660> because<00:04:05.989> I'll<00:04:06.230> sometimes

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
and I think it is because I'll sometimes

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.220 
and I think it is because I'll sometimes
you're<00:04:07.700> in<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:08.000> rush<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.510> capture<00:04:08.959> something

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
you're in a rush to capture something

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.160 
you're in a rush to capture something
and<00:04:09.709> you<00:04:10.550> know<00:04:10.610> that's<00:04:10.850> why<00:04:11.060> this<00:04:11.120> for<00:04:11.959> some

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
and you know that's why this for some

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.860 
and you know that's why this for some
reason<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.980> lot<00:04:13.640> easier<00:04:14.060> to<00:04:14.239> remember<00:04:14.660> so<00:04:14.840> I
