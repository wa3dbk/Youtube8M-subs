overdoing<00:05:14.880> it<00:05:15.030> I'm<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.450> big<00:05:15.720> fan<00:05:15.990> of<00:05:16.020> certain

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
overdoing it I'm a big fan of certain

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.710 
overdoing it I'm a big fan of certain
Tendulkar<00:05:17.040> as<00:05:17.190> many<00:05:17.820> of<00:05:18.000> you<00:05:18.240> who<00:05:18.540> were<00:05:18.690> here

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
Tendulkar as many of you who were here

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.900 
Tendulkar as many of you who were here
but<00:05:19.710> I<00:05:19.740> think<00:05:20.070> that<00:05:20.160> have<00:05:20.280> there's<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.640> flip

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
but I think that have there's a flip

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.940 
but I think that have there's a flip
side<00:05:20.940> to<00:05:21.419> it<00:05:21.450> also<00:05:21.780> I<00:05:21.990> mean<00:05:22.200> just<00:05:22.500> looking<00:05:22.830> at

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
side to it also I mean just looking at

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.570 
side to it also I mean just looking at
it<00:05:23.100> as<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.280> unifier<00:05:24.000> of<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.570> nation<00:05:24.960> for<00:05:25.919> them

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
it as a unifier of the nation for them

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.490 
it as a unifier of the nation for them
for<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.060> middle<00:05:27.270> class<00:05:27.300> it<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:27.990> because<00:05:28.380> they

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
for the middle class it is because they

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.380 
for the middle class it is because they
are<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:28.710> aspirational<00:05:29.400> class<00:05:29.700> at<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.060> moment

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
are the aspirational class at the moment

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.540 
are the aspirational class at the moment
with<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.690> post<00:05:30.900> liberalisation<00:05:31.350> India<00:05:31.980> but

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
with the post liberalisation India but

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.590 
with the post liberalisation India but
other<00:05:32.820> than<00:05:33.030> that

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
other than that

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.900 
other than that
I<00:05:33.630> think<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.200> is<00:05:34.380> more<00:05:34.680> like<00:05:35.010> you<00:05:35.550> know<00:05:35.580> lip

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
I think it is more like you know lip

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.960 
I think it is more like you know lip
taking<00:05:36.750> people<00:05:37.080> away<00:05:37.169> from<00:05:37.380> the<00:05:37.890> you<00:05:38.760> know<00:05:38.850> the

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
taking people away from the you know the

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.810 
taking people away from the you know the
misery<00:05:39.270> or<00:05:39.480> the<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:40.710> things<00:05:41.340> that<00:05:41.580> they<00:05:41.700> have

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
misery or the the things that they have

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.090 
misery or the the things that they have
to<00:05:41.850> feel<00:05:42.330> every<00:05:42.870> day<00:05:43.110> just<00:05:43.410> to<00:05:43.560> look<00:05:43.860> at

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
to feel every day just to look at

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.240 
to feel every day just to look at
cricket<00:05:44.580> as<00:05:44.730> a<00:05:44.790> nationalistic<00:05:45.540> thing<00:05:46.250> taking

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
cricket as a nationalistic thing taking

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.430 
cricket as a nationalistic thing taking
it<00:05:47.370> more<00:05:47.610> in<00:05:47.850> a<00:05:48.060> jingoistic<00:05:48.660> manner<00:05:49.050> we<00:05:49.230> think

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
it more in a jingoistic manner we think

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.890 
it more in a jingoistic manner we think
of<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.710> india-pakistan<00:05:50.130> match<00:05:50.550> when<00:05:51.510> such<00:05:51.750> in

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
of the india-pakistan match when such in

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.930 
of the india-pakistan match when such in
Tendulkar<00:05:52.410> plays<00:05:52.650> it<00:05:52.950> becomes<00:05:53.520> a<00:05:53.700> battle

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
Tendulkar plays it becomes a battle

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.880 
Tendulkar plays it becomes a battle
between<00:05:54.330> these<00:05:54.690> two<00:05:54.900> nations<00:05:55.080> not<00:05:55.440> a<00:05:55.500> game

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
between these two nations not a game

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.220 
between these two nations not a game
first<00:05:56.220> of<00:05:56.430> all<00:05:56.550> I<00:05:56.760> think<00:05:56.910> such<00:05:57.570> an<00:05:57.720> as<00:05:57.840> an<00:05:57.930> icon

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
first of all I think such an as an icon

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.540 
first of all I think such an as an icon
it's<00:05:58.380> not<00:05:58.470> just<00:05:58.740> for<00:05:58.919> the<00:05:58.980> middle<00:05:59.220> class<00:05:59.370> of

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
it's not just for the middle class of

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.790 
it's not just for the middle class of
the<00:05:59.610> rich<00:05:59.790> for<00:06:00.030> the<00:06:00.180> for<00:06:00.660> the<00:06:00.750> poorest<00:06:01.650> a

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
the rich for the for the poorest a

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.350 
the rich for the for the poorest a
person<00:06:02.190> in<00:06:02.310> India<00:06:02.669> that<00:06:02.820> he<00:06:02.910> would<00:06:03.030> still<00:06:03.240> have

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
person in India that he would still have

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.210 
person in India that he would still have
been<00:06:03.390> an<00:06:03.570> icon<00:06:03.900> for<00:06:04.080> them<00:06:04.200> and<00:06:04.410> if<00:06:04.740> he's<00:06:04.890> giving

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
been an icon for them and if he's giving

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.010 
been an icon for them and if he's giving
them<00:06:05.310> that<00:06:05.610> sense<00:06:06.060> of<00:06:06.210> aspiration<00:06:06.480> because

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
them that sense of aspiration because

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.540 
them that sense of aspiration because
let's<00:06:07.169> face<00:06:07.230> it<00:06:07.380> a<00:06:07.710> lot<00:06:07.950> of<00:06:08.130> the<00:06:08.250> people<00:06:08.370> who

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
let's face it a lot of the people who

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.980 
let's face it a lot of the people who
are<00:06:08.640> now<00:06:08.760> coming<00:06:09.000> in<00:06:09.180> and<00:06:09.240> playing<00:06:09.419> for<00:06:09.690> India

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
are coming from relatively modest

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.790 
are coming from relatively modest
backgrounds<00:06:12.390> absolutely<00:06:13.200> I<00:06:13.230> think<00:06:13.290> that's<00:06:13.680> a

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
backgrounds absolutely I think that's a

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.230 
backgrounds absolutely I think that's a
good<00:06:13.950> thing<00:06:14.010> which<00:06:14.370> is<00:06:14.490> happening<00:06:14.640> to<00:06:15.000> Indian

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
good thing which is happening to Indian

good thing which is happening to Indian
cricket<00:06:15.540> I<00:06:15.630> wouldn't<00:06:15.870> deny<00:06:15.990> that<00:06:16.260> what<00:06:16.410> I

meant was that for those who are seeing

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.380 
meant was that for those who are seeing
him<00:06:19.169> as<00:06:19.350> an<00:06:19.470> icon<00:06:19.919> those<00:06:20.610> who<00:06:20.789> can<00:06:20.940> aspire<00:06:21.330> to

to fly high and he I actually agree with

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.490 
to fly high and he I actually agree with
the<00:07:18.500> fact<00:07:18.710> that<00:07:18.800> because<00:07:19.250> how<00:07:19.790> he<00:07:20.180> has<00:07:20.450> gone<00:07:21.200> on

to<00:07:22.220> become<00:07:22.400> a<00:07:22.820> brand<00:07:23.120> not<00:07:23.450> just<00:07:23.480> a<00:07:23.960> cricketer

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:24.530 
to become a brand not just a cricketer
