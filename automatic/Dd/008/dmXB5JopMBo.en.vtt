00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579 
so these are the new scene lenses made

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.359 
so these are the new scene lenses made
by<00:00:25.820> samyang<00:00:26.539> in<00:00:26.810> South<00:00:27.380> Korea<00:00:27.710> they<00:00:28.039> available

at the moment and there will be three
more<00:00:36.680> lenses<00:00:37.220> available<00:00:37.760> in<00:00:38.089> time<00:00:38.659> these<00:00:39.230> are

more lenses available in time these are
PL<00:00:40.040> mounted<00:00:40.550> but<00:00:40.760> you<00:00:40.940> will<00:00:41.150> be<00:00:41.300> able<00:00:41.390> to

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
PL mounted but you will be able to

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.170 
PL mounted but you will be able to
change<00:00:41.780> them<00:00:42.110> into<00:00:42.440> other<00:00:43.010> mounds<00:00:43.579> and<00:00:43.940> for

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
change them into other mounds and for

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.460 
change them into other mounds and for

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
lenses this any altar is actually a t2

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.459 
lenses this any altar is actually a t2
it's<00:01:01.219> PL<00:01:01.640> only<00:01:02.179> but<00:01:02.660> it's<00:01:02.750> got<00:01:02.870> a<00:01:02.899> nice<00:01:03.079> smooth

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
it's PL only but it's got a nice smooth

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.200 
it's PL only but it's got a nice smooth
focus<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.610> iris<00:01:05.179> and<00:01:06.700> it's<00:01:07.700> a<00:01:07.789> quick<00:01:08.060> look

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
focus and iris and it's a quick look

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.600 
focus and iris and it's a quick look
down<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.570> iris<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.649> you'll<00:01:09.950> see<00:01:10.190> that<00:01:10.310> it's

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
down the iris and you'll see that it's

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.210 
down the iris and you'll see that it's
it's<00:01:11.210> smooth<00:01:12.170> but<00:01:12.500> it's<00:01:12.679> perhaps<00:01:12.979> a<00:01:13.130> little

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
it's smooth but it's perhaps a little

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.020 
it's smooth but it's perhaps a little
more<00:01:14.410> square<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:16.130> blades<00:01:16.399> a<00:01:16.580> little<00:01:16.789> bit<00:01:16.910> more

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
more square the blades a little bit more

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.690 
more square the blades a little bit more
obvious<00:01:17.390> than<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.890> other<00:01:19.190> two<00:01:19.340> lenses<00:01:19.580> which

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
obvious than the other two lenses which

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.490 
obvious than the other two lenses which
we'll<00:01:19.850> see<00:01:20.000> in<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.149> moment<00:01:20.330> for<00:01:20.929> size<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:21.350> can

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
we'll see in a moment for size you can

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.469 
we'll see in a moment for size you can
see<00:01:21.649> that<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.950> sony<00:01:22.369> 85<00:01:23.060> millimeter<00:01:23.360> is

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
see that the sony 85 millimeter is

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.150 
see that the sony 85 millimeter is
clearly<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.959> biggest<00:01:24.140> with<00:01:24.530> these<00:01:24.709> samyang

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
clearly the biggest with these samyang

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.839 
clearly the biggest with these samyang
the<00:01:25.310> second<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.420> zeiss<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.259> third<00:01:27.670> if<00:01:28.670> we

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:28.849 
the second and the zeiss the third if we

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:31.749 
the second and the zeiss the third if we
look<00:01:28.970> at<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.119> samyang<00:01:29.539> it's<00:01:29.899> got<00:01:30.759> aperture

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
look at the samyang it's got aperture

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.820 
look at the samyang it's got aperture
values<00:01:32.090> that<00:01:32.239> are<00:01:32.360> actually<00:01:32.830> constantly

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
values that are actually constantly

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.309 
values that are actually constantly
spaced<00:01:34.250> but<00:01:34.670> very<00:01:35.119> close<00:01:35.450> together<00:01:35.899> which

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
spaced but very close together which

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.919 
spaced but very close together which
could<00:01:36.739> make<00:01:36.860> it<00:01:37.039> a<00:01:37.069> little<00:01:37.250> hard<00:01:37.489> to<00:01:37.929> precisely

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
could make it a little hard to precisely

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.229 
could make it a little hard to precisely
close<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:40.009> down<00:01:40.160> just<00:01:40.459> a<00:01:40.610> little<00:01:40.640> bit<00:01:41.000> if

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:41.239 
close it down just a little bit if

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:43.419 
close it down just a little bit if
you're<00:01:41.479> actually<00:01:41.810> shooting<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:43.220> then<00:01:43.340> you've

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
you're actually shooting and then you've

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.449 
you're actually shooting and then you've
got<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.880> focus<00:01:44.420> ring<00:01:44.660> which<00:01:44.989> is<00:01:45.160> perhaps<00:01:46.160> a

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
got a focus ring which is perhaps a

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:47.499 
got a focus ring which is perhaps a
little<00:01:46.489> bit<00:01:46.700> more<00:01:46.940> than<00:01:47.090> hundred<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.390> eighty

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
little bit more than hundred and eighty

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.940 
little bit more than hundred and eighty
PASOK's<00:01:47.989> hundred<00:01:48.200> ninety<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.590> haven't

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
PASOK's hundred ninety I haven't

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.290 
PASOK's hundred ninety I haven't
measured<00:01:49.039> it<00:01:49.220> exactly<00:01:49.250> but<00:01:49.759> it's<00:01:50.090> slightly

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
measured it exactly but it's slightly

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.790 
measured it exactly but it's slightly
over<00:01:50.450> under<00:01:50.720> 90<00:01:50.929> degrees<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.319> rotation

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
over under 90 degrees of rotation

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.490 
over under 90 degrees of rotation
between<00:01:51.950> infinity<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:52.610> closest<00:01:53.300> focus<00:01:53.750> the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
between infinity and closest focus the

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.820 
between infinity and closest focus the
iris<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:54.890> nice<00:01:55.069> and<00:01:55.220> smooth<00:01:55.489> and<00:01:56.349> you<00:01:57.349> can<00:01:57.619> see

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
iris is nice and smooth and you can see

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.550 
iris is nice and smooth and you can see
it<00:01:57.920> there<00:01:58.129> perhaps<00:01:58.789> a<00:01:59.539> little<00:02:00.080> bit<00:02:00.200> of<00:02:00.289> square

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
it there perhaps a little bit of square

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.359 
it there perhaps a little bit of square
than<00:02:01.039> the<00:02:01.369> zeiss<00:02:02.060> I'm<00:02:02.360> not<00:02:02.780> percent<00:02:03.679> sure<00:02:03.979> but

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
than the zeiss I'm not percent sure but

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.430 
than the zeiss I'm not percent sure but
you<00:02:05.239> can<00:02:05.479> make<00:02:05.660> you<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.780> mind<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.259> when<00:02:06.379> you

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
you can make you a mind that when you

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.369 
you can make you a mind that when you
see<00:02:06.649> this<00:02:06.800> ice<00:02:06.950> in<00:02:07.129> a<00:02:07.220> second<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:08.259> what's<00:02:09.259> I

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
see this ice in a second and what's I

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.690 
see this ice in a second and what's I
guess<00:02:09.410> more<00:02:09.739> important<00:02:10.069> is<00:02:10.160> how<00:02:10.280> that<00:02:10.340> looks

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
guess more important is how that looks

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.780 
guess more important is how that looks
in<00:02:11.060> terms<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.599> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
in terms of the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.929 
in terms of the
the<00:02:13.360> bokeh<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:16.079> focus<00:02:17.079> lights<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.760> you

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
the bokeh and the focus lights that you

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.399 
the bokeh and the focus lights that you
might<00:02:19.090> get<00:02:19.269> a<00:02:19.299> new<00:02:19.420> image<00:02:19.689> and<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.079> can<00:02:20.110> again

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
might get a new image and you can again

see<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.650> on<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.980> test<00:02:21.159> footage<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.610> we

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
see that on the test footage that we

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.319 
see that on the test footage that we
have<00:02:21.870> on<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.290> site<00:02:23.500> if<00:02:24.069> you<00:02:24.459> look<00:02:24.819> at<00:02:25.120> the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
have on the site if you look at the

have on the site if you look at the
Zeiss<00:02:25.720> it's<00:02:25.989> a<00:02:26.110> smaller<00:02:26.439> lens<00:02:26.769> so<00:02:27.370> much<00:02:27.610> more

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
Zeiss it's a smaller lens so much more

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.390 
Zeiss it's a smaller lens so much more
compact<00:02:28.930> lens<00:02:29.200> actually<00:02:29.470> hence<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.220> name

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
compact lens actually hence the name

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.470 
compact lens actually hence the name

at these smaller ones the focusing is

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
you weigh the three lenses clearly the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.930 
you weigh the three lenses clearly the
the<00:02:55.870> King<00:02:56.379> when<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.739> comes<00:02:56.889> to<00:02:57.069> weight<00:02:57.250> is<00:02:57.609> the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
the King when it comes to weight is the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.479 
the King when it comes to weight is the
Sony<00:02:58.329> which<00:02:58.599> is<00:02:58.750> about<00:02:58.989> four<00:02:59.500> pounds<00:03:00.370> which<00:03:00.459> is

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
Sony which is about four pounds which is

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.199 
Sony which is about four pounds which is
over<00:03:00.849> four<00:03:01.060> pounds<00:03:02.670> then<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.790> have<00:03:03.940> the

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
over four pounds then you have the

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.930 
over four pounds then you have the
samyang<00:03:04.810> which<00:03:05.019> is<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.859> two<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.730> half

samyang which is is two and a half
pounds<00:03:07.569> perhaps<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.200> then<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.370> lightest<00:03:09.879> of

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
pounds perhaps and then the lightest of

pounds perhaps and then the lightest of
all<00:03:10.329> three<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:11.019> these<00:03:11.560> ice<00:03:11.889> which<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:13.090> going<00:03:13.659> to

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
all three is these ice which is going to

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.949 
all three is these ice which is going to
tip<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.989> scale<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.530> minute<00:03:14.799> just<00:03:15.220> about<00:03:15.959> two

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
tip the scale in a minute just about two

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:17.879 
tip the scale in a minute just about two
pounds

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
pounds

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.559 
pounds
they're<00:03:18.280> obviously<00:03:18.370> pl<00:03:18.879> dense<00:03:19.120> count<00:03:19.359> some<00:03:19.510> of

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
they're obviously pl dense count some of

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.819 
they're obviously pl dense count some of
these<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:19.870> might<00:03:20.019> be<00:03:20.199> slightly<00:03:20.470> different<00:03:20.650> in

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
these it might be slightly different in

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.409 
these it might be slightly different in
weight<00:03:21.040> but<00:03:21.340> you'll<00:03:21.519> get<00:03:21.669> the<00:03:21.849> general<00:03:22.269> idea

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
weight but you'll get the general idea

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.839 
weight but you'll get the general idea
of<00:03:22.900> where<00:03:23.470> they<00:03:23.590> they<00:03:23.919> are<00:03:24.310> next<00:03:24.609> to<00:03:24.699> each

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
of where they they are next to each

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.530 
of where they they are next to each
other<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.239> size-wise<00:03:26.169> clearly<00:03:26.919> the<00:03:27.220> sony<00:03:28.209> is

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
other and size-wise clearly the sony is

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.280 
other and size-wise clearly the sony is
the<00:03:29.230> biggest<00:03:29.590> but<00:03:30.160> quite<00:03:30.579> some<00:03:30.879> margin<00:03:31.290> the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
the biggest but quite some margin the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.250 
the biggest but quite some margin the
samyang<00:03:32.799> 24<00:03:33.430> we<00:03:34.299> don't<00:03:34.480> have<00:03:34.569> SAT<00:03:34.870> 24

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
samyang 24 we don't have SAT 24

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.170 
samyang 24 we don't have SAT 24
unfortunately<00:03:35.709> but<00:03:35.829> semi<00:03:36.129> 24<00:03:36.549> is<00:03:36.760> just<00:03:36.970> over

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
unfortunately but semi 24 is just over

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.020 
unfortunately but semi 24 is just over
two<00:03:37.359> pounds<00:03:37.389> as<00:03:37.900> well<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:41.769> CP<00:03:42.310> 2<00:03:42.519> just

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
two pounds as well and the the CP 2 just

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.879 
two pounds as well and the the CP 2 just
under<00:03:43.359> 2<00:03:43.510> pounds<00:03:43.720> so<00:03:43.959> not<00:03:44.530> such<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.769> big

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
under 2 pounds so not such a big

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.680 
under 2 pounds so not such a big
difference<00:03:45.040> there<00:03:45.400> but<00:03:45.669> a<00:03:45.910> slight<00:03:46.329> difference

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
difference there but a slight difference

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.349 
difference there but a slight difference
anyway<00:03:47.169> the<00:03:47.680> size<00:03:47.949> wise<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.669> samyang<00:03:49.120> is

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
anyway the size wise the samyang is

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.110 
anyway the size wise the samyang is
quite<00:03:50.079> a<00:03:50.109> lot<00:03:50.319> longer<00:03:50.590> now<00:03:51.489> let's<00:03:51.730> look<00:03:51.819> at<00:03:51.970> the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
quite a lot longer now let's look at the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.869 
quite a lot longer now let's look at the
samyang<00:03:52.720> 24<00:03:53.260> in<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.859> little<00:03:54.099> bit<00:03:54.220> more<00:03:54.430> detail

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
samyang 24 in a little bit more detail

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.520 
samyang 24 in a little bit more detail
you<00:03:55.540> have<00:03:55.569> a<00:03:56.609> again<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:57.849> Imus<00:03:58.269> which<00:03:58.629> is<00:03:58.900> quite

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
you have a again the Imus which is quite

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.470 
you have a again the Imus which is quite
closely<00:03:59.799> spaced<00:04:00.099> together<00:04:00.190> focus<00:04:01.030> rotation

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
closely spaced together focus rotation

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.330 
closely spaced together focus rotation
again<00:04:01.810> similar<00:04:02.290> just<00:04:02.530> over/under<00:04:03.069> nature

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
again similar just over/under nature

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.140 
again similar just over/under nature
degrees<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:05.250> those<00:04:06.250> are<00:04:06.519> obviously<00:04:06.940> focused

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
degrees and those are obviously focused

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.990 
degrees and those are obviously focused
gears<00:04:07.540> on<00:04:07.720> both<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.049> iris<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:09.190> focusing

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
gears on both the iris and the focusing

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.099 
gears on both the iris and the focusing
ring<00:04:10.530> then<00:04:11.530> if<00:04:11.889> you<00:04:12.040> look<00:04:12.280> at<00:04:12.609> the<00:04:12.909> Zeiss<00:04:13.479> it's

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
ring then if you look at the Zeiss it's

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.210 
ring then if you look at the Zeiss it's
against<00:04:14.919> not<00:04:15.669> equally<00:04:16.449> spaced<00:04:16.750> iris<00:04:17.220> values

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
against not equally spaced iris values

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.310 
against not equally spaced iris values
but<00:04:18.489> much<00:04:19.209> more<00:04:19.449> control<00:04:19.810> at<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.109> wider

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
but much more control at the wider

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.170 
but much more control at the wider
aperture<00:04:20.560> is<00:04:20.829> where<00:04:21.039> arguably<00:04:21.579> you<00:04:22.030> would

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
aperture is where arguably you would

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.520 
aperture is where arguably you would
need<00:04:22.360> them

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
need them

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.380 
need them
and<00:04:23.650> then<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.040> focusing<00:04:24.580> which<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:25.060> have<00:04:25.300> to

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
and then the focusing which I have to

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.170 
and then the focusing which I have to
say<00:04:25.570> is<00:04:25.780> quite<00:04:26.140> a<00:04:26.170> lot<00:04:26.500> tighter<00:04:27.100> on<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.760> 25

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
say is quite a lot tighter on the 25

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.060 
say is quite a lot tighter on the 25
millimeter<00:04:28.390> that<00:04:29.230> we've<00:04:29.410> got<00:04:29.590> here<00:04:29.770> then<00:04:29.950> the

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
millimeter that we've got here then the

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.980 
millimeter that we've got here then the
scene<00:04:30.340> lens<00:04:30.610> now<00:04:30.970> that<00:04:31.180> might<00:04:31.450> not<00:04:31.720> be<00:04:31.750> a<00:04:31.870> good

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
scene lens now that might not be a good

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.560 
scene lens now that might not be a good
thing<00:04:32.370> if<00:04:33.370> your<00:04:33.580> manual<00:04:33.880> focusing<00:04:34.270> but<00:04:34.420> it

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
thing if your manual focusing but it

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.790 
thing if your manual focusing but it
might<00:04:34.720> be<00:04:34.810> more<00:04:34.840> useful<00:04:35.020> if<00:04:35.470> you're<00:04:35.620> using

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
might be more useful if you're using

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.110 
might be more useful if you're using
motors<00:04:36.340> so<00:04:37.800> that's<00:04:38.800> possibly<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.370> matter<00:04:40.030> of

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
motors so that's possibly a matter of

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.000 
motors so that's possibly a matter of
choice<00:04:40.390> how<00:04:40.660> stiff<00:04:41.110> you<00:04:41.290> like<00:04:41.470> your<00:04:41.650> lens<00:04:41.860> to

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
choice how stiff you like your lens to

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.390 
choice how stiff you like your lens to
be<00:04:42.040> if<00:04:43.000> we<00:04:43.120> look<00:04:43.240> at<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.420> iris<00:04:43.840> blades<00:04:44.400> the

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
be if we look at the iris blades the

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.110 
be if we look at the iris blades the
scene<00:04:45.820> is<00:04:46.030> nice<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.110> smooth<00:04:47.730> and<00:04:48.730> like<00:04:48.910> but

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
scene is nice and smooth and like but

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.820 
scene is nice and smooth and like but
again<00:04:49.390> I<00:04:49.420> think<00:04:49.600> it's<00:04:49.900> ever<00:04:50.140> so<00:04:50.530> slightly

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
again I think it's ever so slightly

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.970 
again I think it's ever so slightly
Square<00:04:51.600> than<00:04:52.600> the<00:04:53.050> Zeiss<00:04:53.350> which<00:04:53.590> you're<00:04:53.770> about

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
Square than the Zeiss which you're about

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.780 
Square than the Zeiss which you're about
to<00:04:54.160> see<00:04:54.370> which<00:04:55.030> has<00:04:55.870> got<00:04:56.860> a<00:04:56.890> fairly<00:04:57.400> round

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
to see which has got a fairly round

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.240 
to see which has got a fairly round
aperture<00:04:58.750> but<00:04:59.320> you<00:04:59.590> know<00:04:59.740> what<00:05:00.040> really

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
aperture but you know what really

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.040 
aperture but you know what really
matters<00:05:00.460> is<00:05:00.760> what<00:05:00.790> this<00:05:01.030> looks<00:05:01.210> like<00:05:01.300> when<00:05:01.930> you

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
matters is what this looks like when you

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.830 
matters is what this looks like when you
actually<00:05:02.080> shoot<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:03.150> we<00:05:04.150> have<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.360> few<00:05:04.630> samples

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
actually shoot and we have a few samples

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.360 
actually shoot and we have a few samples
on<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.169> site<00:05:05.410> when<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:05.770> you<00:05:06.130> can<00:05:06.220> actually

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
on the site when you you can actually

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.090 
on the site when you you can actually
compare<00:05:06.760> for<00:05:06.940> yourself<00:05:07.300> between<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.169> DCP

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
compare for yourself between the DCP

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.790 
compare for yourself between the DCP
twos<00:05:09.280> and<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:10.210> scene<00:05:10.660> lenses<00:05:11.140> and<00:05:11.320> then

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
twos and the scene lenses and then

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.350 
twos and the scene lenses and then
finally<00:05:12.130> just<00:05:12.190> for<00:05:12.340> size<00:05:12.610> comparison<00:05:12.640> here's

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
finally just for size comparison here's

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
skip on the scene but you get the idea

lenses these are the ones we're looking

lenses these are the ones we're looking
out<00:05:28.930> here<00:05:29.050> a<00:05:29.110> pre-production<00:05:29.640> but<00:05:30.640> hopefully

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
out here a pre-production but hopefully

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.060 
out here a pre-production but hopefully
we'll<00:05:31.330> have<00:05:31.479> production<00:05:31.810> models<00:05:32.169> soon<00:05:32.440> for<00:05:33.040> a

we'll have production models soon for a

we'll have production models soon for a
