00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
I'm going to get this tool which is

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.760 
I'm going to get this tool which is
basically<00:02:01.620> a<00:02:01.980> stick<00:02:02.940> with<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.120> pin<00:02:03.330> on<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.480> end

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
basically a stick with a pin on the end

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.990 
basically a stick with a pin on the end
to<00:02:04.770> get<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.370> Middle's<00:02:05.910> of<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.150> letters<00:02:06.480> out

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.880 
to get the Middle's of the letters out
just<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.149> that

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.730 

so<00:02:18.430> they<00:02:18.520> have<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:18.880> that's<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.810> vinyl<00:02:20.380> cut<00:02:20.530> out

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
so they have it that's the vinyl cut out

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.949 
so they have it that's the vinyl cut out
now<00:02:21.700> going<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.030> go<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.360> application

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
now going to go to the application

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.460 
now going to go to the application
process<00:02:24.840> okay<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:25.900> I'm<00:02:26.080> going<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.260> be<00:02:26.350> using

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
process okay so I'm going to be using

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.040 
process okay so I'm going to be using
this<00:02:26.770> tape<00:02:27.100> which<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.610> valid<00:02:28.209> application

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
this tape which is valid application

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.640 
this tape which is valid application
tape<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:30.670> not<00:02:30.850> masking<00:02:31.270> tape<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.650> it's

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
tape it's not masking tape and it's

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.060 
tape it's not masking tape and it's
similar<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.130> but<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:34.060> very<00:02:34.270> low<00:02:34.600> stack<00:02:35.590> which

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
similar to but it's very low stack which

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.880 
similar to but it's very low stack which
means<00:02:36.280> it's<00:02:36.430> low<00:02:36.580> stickiness<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.770> can

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
means it's low stickiness so you can

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.040 
means it's low stickiness so you can
easily<00:02:38.980> peel<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.490> off<00:02:39.670> when<00:02:40.600> you've<00:02:40.720> put<00:02:40.959> the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
easily peel it off when you've put the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.330 
easily peel it off when you've put the
sticker<00:02:41.350> on<00:02:43.440> okay<00:02:44.440> so<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.709> next<00:02:44.739> step<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.190> to

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
sticker on okay so the next step is to

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.540 
sticker on okay so the next step is to
get<00:02:45.520> your<00:02:45.670> vinyl<00:02:46.239> here<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:47.459> what<00:02:48.459> you're

get your vinyl here and what you're
going<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.910> do<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.380> put<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.470> application<00:02:51.040> tape

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
going to do is put the application tape

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.360 
going to do is put the application tape
over<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.880> top<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.860> start<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.310> the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
over the top like this you start on the
