 Hello heroes, I am Irina, your Community Developer! 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Welcome to the advanced strategy tutorial! 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 After watching the video you can crush any enemy you encounter and clash of heroes will always end up in your favor! 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 In the multiplayer section you have the choice between different heroes, each with their own special skill: 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 To be honest, each of them is fairly strong and they all have their own benefits, but today we are explicitly looking at what strategy can be used for Varkas. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Here we go! 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 To recruit your army, you can choose from party-specific basic and more advanced troops. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 First, let's choose 1 Swordsman, 2 Archers, and 1 Angel. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 It is good to know that if you only choose 1 Champion orphan, you will see this appear on the battlefield more often. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 That is good for our strategy because we want to get a lot of Angels! 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 "Blessed Wing" immediately lets the Angels put all attack formations back on full power instead of gradually. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Our strategy is to activate as many Angels as possible at the same time. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 You can often activate two at the same time and that is exactly what we are going to do. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 In principle, Angels can heal all formations that want to attack. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 The artifact provides the opportunity for Angels to heal completely each turn. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Angels can weaken by enemy attacks although, since an Angel cannot heal himself, when activating two Angels at the same time they are able to heal each other at every turn. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 And now we always attack with maximum power! 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Now use Varkas' special skill to boost your attacks. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 And yahoo victory! 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 For the second strategy we use three Spear Carriers, 1 Knight, 1 Swordmaster and 1 Golden Spear as an artifact. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 The aim is to destroy the enemy defense and to attack as powerfully as possible. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 To be efficient, you must all organize small attacks over the entire battlefield (reinforce the effect by combining and combining attacks) 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 You notice that if your Spear Carrier's attack is stronger than the defense he has to go through, he will break through here without losing strength and will attack the enemy with maximum force. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 The second time you have to activate a Swordmaster. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 He will help you by breaking the enemy defense. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 This way your enemy will not be able to protect itself and you can attack it more efficiently. When your Swordmaster finally attacks, it becomes a deadly attack this way! 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 This tactic is very nice, by the way. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Choose one sort from each standard being and 1 Priestess. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 In this way we get many Priestesses on the battlefield and our strategy becomes more effective. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Take the "Staff of Elrath" artifact. Thus, during the attack of the Priestess the enemy is damaged instead of the Hero who heals. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 While your enemy tries to understand what's going on, he loses MUCH of his life. 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Interested? Yes, just what I mean! 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 In the beginning, activate as many Priestesses as possible: they will claim enemy lives during the attack. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 The more Priestesses you activate, the more you will hurt your enemy during the duration of the attack. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 The enemy has not even started his attack and is already losing life points, isn't that great? 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Now you are ready to apply your unique and winning strategy. There are so many choices! It is up to you! 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
