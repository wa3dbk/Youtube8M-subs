00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
to talk about that for a sec though so I

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.710 
to talk about that for a sec though so I
3bet<00:01:14.900> preflop<00:01:14.930> we<00:01:15.530> as<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:16.520> see<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.759> pots<00:01:16.939> 2009

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
3bet preflop we as you see the pots 2009

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.510 
3bet preflop we as you see the pots 2009
so<00:01:17.960> my<00:01:18.049> effective<00:01:18.439> stacks<00:01:19.600> 4045<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:22.400> I've

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
so my effective stacks 4045 and I've

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.520 
so my effective stacks 4045 and I've
three<00:01:22.700> bet<00:01:22.850> out<00:01:22.970> of<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.119> small<00:01:23.329> blind<00:01:23.540> he<00:01:24.409> has

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
three bet out of the small blind he has

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.139 
three bet out of the small blind he has
the<00:01:24.619> option<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:25.009> putting<00:01:25.159> in<00:01:25.400> over<00:01:25.790> a<00:01:25.850> third<00:01:26.060> of

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
the option of putting in over a third of

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.139 
the option of putting in over a third of
his<00:01:26.210> stack<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:26.869> I<00:01:27.170> mean<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:28.159> know<00:01:28.189> there's<00:01:29.060> an

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
his stack and I mean I know there's an

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.240 
his stack and I mean I know there's an
argument<00:01:29.479> for<00:01:29.619> disguising<00:01:30.619> your<00:01:30.710> hand<00:01:30.920> with

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
argument for disguising your hand with

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.550 
argument for disguising your hand with
the<00:01:31.280> slow<00:01:31.579> play<00:01:31.759> there<00:01:31.909> with<00:01:32.030> aces<00:01:32.329> but<00:01:32.720> I

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
the slow play there with aces but I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.990 
the slow play there with aces but I
think<00:01:34.159> when<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.430> have<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.610> chance<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:34.880> get

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
think when you have a chance to get

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.100 
think when you have a chance to get
enough<00:01:35.329> for<00:01:35.420> your<00:01:35.540> stack<00:01:35.720> when<00:01:35.899> you<00:01:35.990> could

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
enough for your stack when you could

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.840 
enough for your stack when you could
just<00:01:36.259> shove<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.740> pot<00:01:36.950> size<00:01:37.130> better<00:01:37.340> lesson<00:01:37.640> on

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
just shove a pot size better lesson on

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.280 
just shove a pot size better lesson on
the<00:01:37.939> flop<00:01:38.149> I<00:01:38.420> mean<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:38.780> just<00:01:38.810> have<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.140> take<00:01:39.229> it

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
the flop I mean you just have to take it

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.959 
the flop I mean you just have to take it
with<00:01:39.439> aces<00:01:39.799> like<00:01:40.659> in<00:01:41.659> pol<00:01:41.990> with<00:01:42.409> aces<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.820> only

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
with aces like in pol with aces the only

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.100 
with aces like in pol with aces the only
time<00:01:44.119> they<00:01:44.210> like<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:44.420> slow<00:01:44.600> play<00:01:44.780> is<00:01:44.899> when<00:01:45.020> I'm

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
time they like the slow play is when I'm

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.880 
time they like the slow play is when I'm
deep<00:01:46.090> well<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.420> mean<00:01:47.869> given<00:01:48.469> the<00:01:48.500> fact<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:48.770> I

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
deep well I mean given the fact that I

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.260 
deep well I mean given the fact that I
can<00:01:49.040> put<00:01:49.159> that<00:01:49.280> percentage<00:01:49.670> of<00:01:49.729> stacking<00:01:49.969> like

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
can put that percentage of stacking like

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.459 
can put that percentage of stacking like
there'll<00:01:50.450> be<00:01:50.479> times<00:01:50.689> where<00:01:50.869> all<00:01:51.020> flat<00:01:51.200> call<00:01:51.380> it

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
there'll be times where all flat call it

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:52.810

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
I'm gonna see Betty side flop doesn't

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.310 
I'm gonna see Betty side flop doesn't
mean<00:02:30.850> mislaid<00:02:31.240> stacking<00:02:31.720> off<00:02:31.840> flight<00:02:32.050> on<00:02:32.170> each

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
mean mislaid stacking off flight on each

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.570 
mean mislaid stacking off flight on each
side<00:02:32.440> flops<00:02:32.740> because<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.980> know<00:02:33.040> he's<00:02:33.250> not<00:02:33.400> huh

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
side flops because I know he's not huh

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.360 
side flops because I know he's not huh
so<00:02:34.050> it's<00:02:35.050> not<00:02:35.170> like<00:02:35.350> he's<00:02:35.500> gonna<00:02:35.590> flop<00:02:35.890> top<00:02:36.130> set

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
so it's not like he's gonna flop top set

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.510 
so it's not like he's gonna flop top set
and<00:02:36.580> I'm<00:02:36.670> gonna<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.390> I'm<00:02:37.840> gonna<00:02:37.900> like<00:02:38.200> flop

anyway so I don't know I just don't

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.380 
anyway so I don't know I just don't
understand<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.460> play<00:02:51.640> unless<00:02:51.880> he<00:02:52.030> thinks<00:02:52.270> I'm

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
understand the play unless he thinks I'm

mathematical breakdown that shows me why
I<00:03:14.080> callings<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.650> good<00:03:14.800> play<00:03:14.950> there<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.370> really

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
I callings a good play there I really

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.790 
I callings a good play there I really
don't<00:03:15.790> advocate<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.240> so<00:03:16.630> with<00:03:17.290> hundred<00:03:17.710> be

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
don't advocate it so with hundred be

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.080 
don't advocate it so with hundred be
blind<00:03:17.980> stacks<00:03:18.250> if<00:03:18.610> you<00:03:18.700> have<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.850> chance<00:03:18.970> to

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
blind stacks if you have the chance to

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.280 
blind stacks if you have the chance to
for<00:03:19.330> braces<00:03:19.780> do<00:03:20.110> it<00:03:20.290> this<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.650> my<00:03:20.920> advice<00:03:22.290> with

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
for braces do it this is my advice with

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.810 
for braces do it this is my advice with
200<00:03:23.590> big<00:03:23.680> blinds<00:03:23.830> tax<00:03:24.040> though<00:03:24.250> then<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.700> gets

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
200 big blinds tax though then it gets

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.950 
200 big blinds tax though then it gets
tough<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.270> can't<00:03:25.450> just<00:03:25.570> back<00:03:25.660> all<00:03:25.870> of

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
tough and you can't just back all of

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.010 
tough and you can't just back all of
your<00:03:26.110> flops<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:27.270> much<00:03:28.270> more<00:03:28.450> legitimate<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:28.930> be

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
your flops so much more legitimate to be

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.540 
your flops so much more legitimate to be
slow<00:03:29.290> playing<00:03:29.500> there<00:03:31.770> but<00:03:32.770> yeah<00:03:33.340> that's

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
slow playing there but yeah that's

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.910 
slow playing there but yeah that's
basically<00:03:33.850> my<00:03:34.000> feeling<00:03:34.300> on<00:03:34.390> um<00:03:34.990> calling

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
basically my feeling on um calling

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.170 
basically my feeling on um calling
versus<00:03:36.190> for<00:03:36.340> betting<00:03:36.520> he<00:03:36.640> stands<00:03:36.850> in<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.000> spot

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
versus for betting he stands in a spot

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.340 
versus for betting he stands in a spot
like<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:43.060> also<00:03:43.510> if<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:43.780> note<00:03:43.930> there<00:03:44.080> I'm

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
like that and also if you note there I'm

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.900 
like that and also if you note there I'm
probably<00:03:44.680> not<00:03:44.920> folding<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.280> hand<00:03:45.459> as<00:03:45.580> strong<00:03:45.790> as

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
probably not folding a hand as strong as

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.100 
probably not folding a hand as strong as
king<00:03:46.150> East<00:03:46.360> King<00:03:46.570> Jack<00:03:46.750> three<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:48.610> four<00:03:48.700> bet

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
king East King Jack three to a four bet

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.440 
king East King Jack three to a four bet
ruthless<00:03:50.110> if<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.220> knew<00:03:51.340> he<00:03:51.520> was<00:03:51.640> in<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.209> he

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
ruthless if I knew he was in it and he

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.420 
ruthless if I knew he was in it and he
was<00:03:52.570> only<00:03:52.959> for<00:03:53.170> betting<00:03:53.350> aces<00:03:53.680> there<00:03:53.920> then<00:03:54.310> I

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
was only for betting aces there then I

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.229 
was only for betting aces there then I
could<00:03:54.580> probably<00:03:54.730> fold<00:03:55.000> my<00:03:55.090> hand<00:03:55.560> but<00:03:56.560> as<00:03:56.950> is<00:03:57.910> he

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
could probably fold my hand but as is he

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.570 
could probably fold my hand but as is he
he<00:03:58.510> would<00:03:58.630> have<00:03:58.720> either<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:59.290> picked<00:03:59.950> up<00:04:00.040> twelve

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
he would have either I picked up twelve

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.740 
he would have either I picked up twelve
and<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:00.700> half<00:04:00.790> thick<00:04:00.940> blinds<00:04:01.180> dead<00:04:01.360> money<00:04:01.540> which

55.7% against his hand and that really

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.270 
55.7% against his hand and that really
just<00:05:04.030> shows<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.330> power<00:05:04.509> of<00:05:04.630> Jaws<00:05:05.380> and<00:05:05.410> PLO<00:05:05.949> I

mean playing playing big draws fast is

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.749 
mean playing playing big draws fast is
very<00:05:26.470> standard<00:05:26.830> in<00:05:26.949> PLO<00:05:27.250> and<00:05:27.370> this<00:05:27.490> is<00:05:27.610> watch

their equity is just so huge in many
spots<00:05:29.940> but<00:05:30.940> not<00:05:31.870> for<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.050> ramble<00:05:32.380> I'm<00:05:32.470> sure

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
spots but not for the ramble I'm sure

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.870 
spots but not for the ramble I'm sure
most<00:05:33.009> of<00:05:33.130> you<00:05:33.220> think<00:05:33.340> that's<00:05:33.550> pretty<00:05:33.729> standard

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
most of you think that's pretty standard

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.360 
most of you think that's pretty standard
already
