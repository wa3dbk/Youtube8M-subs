00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
repaired because of the damage that the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.900 
repaired because of the damage that the

you'll be fine as far as amino acids I'm

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.539 
you'll be fine as far as amino acids I'm

gonna agree with Martin Burke and over

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.979 
gonna agree with Martin Burke and over
at<00:03:47.640> lean<00:03:47.850> gains<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.329> say<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.810> certainly

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
at lean gains and say that it certainly

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.600 
at lean gains and say that it certainly
can't<00:03:49.410> hurt<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.650> take<00:03:49.980> an<00:03:50.250> amino<00:03:50.519> acid

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
can't hurt to take an amino acid

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.340 
can't hurt to take an amino acid
supplement<00:03:51.420> although<00:03:51.630> in<00:03:51.750> general<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:52.140> think

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
supplement although in general I think

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.600 
supplement although in general I think
they're<00:03:52.440> waste<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.860> money<00:03:52.950> because<00:03:53.160> you<00:03:53.430> don't

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
they're waste of money because you don't

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.220 
they're waste of money because you don't
really<00:03:53.730> need<00:03:53.970> them<00:03:54.120> if<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.720> get<00:03:54.930> enough

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
really need them if you get enough

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.840 
really need them if you get enough
protein<00:03:55.440> in<00:03:56.070> your<00:03:56.130> diet<00:03:56.280> when<00:03:56.640> you're<00:03:56.670> not

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
protein in your diet when you're not

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.120 
protein in your diet when you're not
fasting<00:03:57.360> then<00:03:57.540> you're<00:03:58.500> just<00:03:58.620> really<00:03:58.890> paying

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
fasting then you're just really paying

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.830 
fasting then you're just really paying
way<00:03:59.310> too<00:03:59.340> much<00:03:59.700> for<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.060> amino<00:04:00.299> acids<00:04:00.720> you

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
way too much for the amino acids you

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.080 
way too much for the amino acids you
could<00:04:00.959> get<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.350> lot<00:04:01.739> more<00:04:01.799> for<00:04:02.250> less<00:04:02.430> money<00:04:02.640> and

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
could get a lot more for less money and

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.890 
could get a lot more for less money and
stuff<00:04:03.690> like<00:04:04.220> chicken<00:04:05.220> turkey<00:04:05.760> beef<00:04:06.360> whole

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
stuff like chicken turkey beef whole

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.449 
stuff like chicken turkey beef whole
eggs<00:04:07.370> milk<00:04:08.370> etc<00:04:08.989> but<00:04:09.989> in<00:04:10.079> general<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.739> don't

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
eggs milk etc but in general I don't

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.979 
eggs milk etc but in general I don't
really<00:04:11.579> see<00:04:11.850> it<00:04:12.060> being<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.420> negative<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.870> take

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
really see it being a negative to take

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.199 
really see it being a negative to take
amino<00:04:13.350> acids<00:04:13.799> right<00:04:14.400> before<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.850> break<00:04:15.060> it

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
amino acids right before you break it

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.490 
amino acids right before you break it
fast<00:04:15.420> like<00:04:15.720> for<00:04:15.870> example<00:04:15.959> if<00:04:16.289> you're<00:04:16.380> gonna

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
fast like for example if you're gonna

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.370 
fast like for example if you're gonna
work<00:04:16.709> out<00:04:16.919> at<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.459> end<00:04:17.669> of<00:04:17.789> your<00:04:17.880> fast<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.539> don't

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
work out at the end of your fast I don't

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.080 
work out at the end of your fast I don't
see<00:04:19.500> any<00:04:19.620> reason<00:04:19.979> to<00:04:20.400> not<00:04:20.549> take<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.940> amino

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
see any reason to not take the amino

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.640 
see any reason to not take the amino
acids<00:04:21.630> right<00:04:21.780> before<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.140> workout<00:04:22.500> because

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
acids right before the workout because

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.719 
acids right before the workout because
you're<00:04:22.950> gonna<00:04:23.070> break<00:04:23.310> it

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
you're gonna break it

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.840 
you're gonna break it
right<00:04:23.940> after<00:04:24.180> workout<00:04:24.510> anyway<00:04:24.960> right

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
right after workout anyway right

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.550 
right after workout anyway right
what<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.060> aminos<00:04:26.450> do<00:04:26.690> is<00:04:26.960> they<00:04:27.080> let<00:04:27.260> your<00:04:27.410> body

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
what the aminos do is they let your body

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.230 
what the aminos do is they let your body
know<00:04:27.830> that<00:04:28.160> it's<00:04:28.280> time<00:04:28.580> to<00:04:28.610> start<00:04:28.940> recovering

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
know that it's time to start recovering

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.510 
know that it's time to start recovering
so<00:04:29.720> it<00:04:29.810> kind<00:04:30.290> of<00:04:30.320> just<00:04:30.380> preps<00:04:30.980> your<00:04:31.160> body<00:04:31.340> to

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
so it kind of just preps your body to

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.400 
so it kind of just preps your body to
get<00:04:31.640> ready<00:04:31.850> to<00:04:32.570> rebuild<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:33.080> muscle<00:04:33.380> that

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
get ready to rebuild the muscle that

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.920 
get ready to rebuild the muscle that
you're<00:04:33.650> damaging<00:04:34.040> during<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.400> workout<00:04:34.760> so<00:04:35.540> no

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
you're damaging during the workout so no

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.360 
you're damaging during the workout so no
problem<00:04:36.290> with<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.500> amino<00:04:36.620> acids<00:04:37.100> really

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
problem with the amino acids really

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.500 
problem with the amino acids really
although<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.760> wouldn't<00:04:38.210> take<00:04:38.330> them

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
although I wouldn't take them

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.180 
although I wouldn't take them
willy-nilly<00:04:38.720> during<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:39.470> fast<00:04:39.710> because<00:04:40.100> I

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
willy-nilly during the fast because I

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.160 
willy-nilly during the fast because I
just<00:04:40.370> don't<00:04:40.580> see<00:04:40.760> a<00:04:40.790> point<00:04:40.970> in<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.330> similar<00:04:42.110> to

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
just don't see a point in it similar to

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.680 
just don't see a point in it similar to
fat<00:04:42.620> in<00:04:43.190> carbs<00:04:43.700> and<00:04:44.000> basically<00:04:44.420> anything

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
fat in carbs and basically anything

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.840 
fat in carbs and basically anything
other<00:04:45.080> than<00:04:45.260> plain<00:04:45.500> water<00:04:45.770> or<00:04:45.950> low<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.460> zero

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
other than plain water or low to zero

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.350 
other than plain water or low to zero
calorie<00:04:47.300> drinks<00:04:48.200> like<00:04:48.770> black<00:04:49.040> coffee<00:04:49.360> plain

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
calorie drinks like black coffee plain

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.470 
calorie drinks like black coffee plain

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
tea low to zero calorie energy drinks or

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.750 
tea low to zero calorie energy drinks or
flavored<00:04:54.170> water<00:04:54.350> I<00:04:54.710> just<00:04:55.340> don't<00:04:55.490> see<00:04:55.640> the

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
flavored water I just don't see the

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.920 
flavored water I just don't see the
point<00:04:55.910> in<00:04:56.030> taking<00:04:56.210> it<00:04:56.480> and<00:04:56.630> it<00:04:56.690> kind<00:04:56.870> of

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
point in taking it and it kind of

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.690 
point in taking it and it kind of
defeats<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.320> purpose<00:04:57.410> of<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:57.860> fast<00:04:58.100> which<00:04:58.670> is

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
defeats the purpose of the fast which is

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.270 
defeats the purpose of the fast which is
to<00:04:58.970> rely<00:04:59.210> on<00:04:59.240> your<00:04:59.630> body<00:04:59.900> fat<00:05:00.230> for<00:05:00.470> energy<00:05:00.560> if

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
to rely on your body fat for energy if

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.530 
to rely on your body fat for energy if
that<00:05:01.460> doesn't<00:05:01.730> answer<00:05:01.850> your<00:05:02.030> question<00:05:02.360> so

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
that doesn't answer your question so
