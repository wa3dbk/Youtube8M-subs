00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
excited about this game guys I think a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.310 
excited about this game guys I think a
lot<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.520> people<00:02:20.700> were<00:02:21.030> hating<00:02:21.270> on<00:02:21.540> hardline<00:02:22.080> a

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
lot of people were hating on hardline a

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.530 
lot of people were hating on hardline a
few<00:02:22.650> months<00:02:22.830> ago<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:24.060> guess<00:02:24.330> it's

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
few months ago and I guess it's

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.180 
few months ago and I guess it's
justifiable<00:02:25.170> they<00:02:25.560> were<00:02:25.620> planning<00:02:25.920> on

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
justifiable they were planning on

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.160 
justifiable they were planning on
releasing<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:26.880> game<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.300> October<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:28.080> last

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
releasing this game in October of last

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.980 
releasing this game in October of last
year<00:02:28.740> I<00:02:28.770> think<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.340> then<00:02:29.760> Visceral<00:02:30.450> Games<00:02:30.480> and

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
year I think and then Visceral Games and

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.080 
year I think and then Visceral Games and
EA<00:02:31.110> decided<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.830> push<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.190> back<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.940> was

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
EA decided to push it back and that was

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.150 
EA decided to push it back and that was
a<00:02:33.120> good<00:02:33.330> move<00:02:33.600> because<00:02:33.870> battlefield<00:02:34.590> 4<00:02:34.920> was

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
a good move because battlefield 4 was

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.460 
a good move because battlefield 4 was
still<00:02:35.460> in<00:02:35.670> rotation<00:02:36.330> for<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.630> lot<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.930> gamers<00:02:37.320> I

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
still in rotation for a lot of gamers I

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.530 
still in rotation for a lot of gamers I
don't<00:02:37.980> even<00:02:38.100> think<00:02:38.220> all<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.760> maps<00:02:39.060> were<00:02:39.360> out

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
don't even think all the maps were out

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.390 
don't even think all the maps were out
yet<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.530> were<00:02:40.650> ready<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.980> release

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
yet and you were ready to release

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.670 
yet and you were ready to release
another<00:02:41.610> game<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.750> think<00:02:42.870> pushing<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.530> back

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
another game so I think pushing it back

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.440 
another game so I think pushing it back
really<00:02:44.100> really<00:02:44.550> helped<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:44.940> hype<00:02:45.180> for<00:02:45.420> this

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
really really helped the hype for this

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.570 
really really helped the hype for this
game<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.960> think<00:02:46.200> pushing<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.650> back<00:02:46.800> help<00:02:47.400> the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
game I think pushing it back help the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.420 
game I think pushing it back help the
developers<00:02:48.240> are<00:02:48.480> iron<00:02:49.200> out<00:02:49.560> some<00:02:49.590> things<00:02:49.860> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
developers are iron out some things and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.190 
developers are iron out some things and
I<00:02:50.790> think<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.120> beta<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.570> going<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.780> be<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> lot<00:02:52.170> of

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
I think the beta is going to be a lot of

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.640 
I think the beta is going to be a lot of
fun<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.860> do<00:02:53.190> not<00:02:53.610> anticipate<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.870> problems<00:02:55.380> out

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
fun I do not anticipate the problems out

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.310 
fun I do not anticipate the problems out
launched<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.580> battlefield<00:02:56.910> 4<00:02:57.390> half<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:57.900> I

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
launched that battlefield 4 half and I

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.230 
launched that battlefield 4 half and I
think<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.770> it<00:02:58.950> does<00:02:59.160> launch<00:02:59.520> with<00:02:59.790> problems

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
think if it does launch with problems

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.750 
think if it does launch with problems
the<00:03:00.780> same<00:03:01.050> problems<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.620> battlefield<00:03:02.070> 4<00:03:02.520> had

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
the same problems that battlefield 4 had

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.730 
the same problems that battlefield 4 had
I<00:03:03.000> think<00:03:03.300> it's<00:03:03.630> going<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.840> pretty<00:03:04.050> much<00:03:04.260> ruin

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
I think it's going to pretty much ruin

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.250 
I think it's going to pretty much ruin
the<00:03:04.860> Battlefield<00:03:05.370> franchise<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.600> I'm<00:03:06.900> not<00:03:07.200> too

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
the Battlefield franchise so I'm not too

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.470 
the Battlefield franchise so I'm not too
worried<00:03:07.740> about<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:07.980> i<00:03:08.190> really<00:03:08.490> think<00:03:08.730> these

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
worried about it i really think these

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.000 
worried about it i really think these
betas<00:03:09.960> are<00:03:10.110> really<00:03:10.410> going<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.590> iron<00:03:10.770> out<00:03:10.980> any

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
betas are really going to iron out any

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.010 
betas are really going to iron out any
issues<00:03:11.460> that<00:03:11.910> they're<00:03:12.000> going<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.240> have<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.780> i

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
issues that they're going to have and i

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.450 
issues that they're going to have and i
think<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.350> game<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.650> going<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.040> be<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.160> lot<00:03:14.430> of
