00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.260
 beside 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.200
 it's a girl who dreams of playing in one of her ports her sales in volume of 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.809

 alsatian if jean-paul roux 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.770
 a few weeks ago and he makes wooden toys I think it's 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.820
 a great idea to come back to the wooden toys because she is a child 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.020
 we will keep it for a long time alas maybe even keep it big and the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.790
 pass on to his children why daddy yes that still a little bit more 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.110
 charm that plastic what 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.600
 here and especially there is a story behind emissaries of jean-pol she 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.940
 is very touching I met in her workshop batellier been looted she 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.940
 gave an infirmary 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.710
 the senate and people can easily months for Santa first to 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.249
 house 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.440
 if the dictators and finally the ministers 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.760
 he was incarcerated since May but a little bit of poetry the young people present have 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.869
 slowly progressed from one adventure to another sales prices 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.530
 a phone call 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.940
 the association 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.090
 there is the respondent that is to say the children really play 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.210
 and parents eagerness sole on other members 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.460
 the object is a reason to be made I had a Parisian childhood so 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.120
 the same guy the most on the street 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.010
 BenoÃ®t the apartment 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.570
 and I wait for holidaymakers year in Brittany in the family 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.490
 react in a camp like in a farm there was nothing but 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.650
 prisons the animals 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.810
 the source and the symbols a lot like the one who does what and then it's a 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.640
 monument the gambling it's a little bit in the bottom of myself are 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.510
 the same 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.670
 Poweo 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.570
 will their children receive 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.460
 the hundreds of toys 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.850
 like a christmas to forget a single and quality that really suits me 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.519
 so that's a bit of a bit the way today the sun 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.729
 claude dubois but not anything either 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:19.779
 it's because it's wood that it's necessarily for once through 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.609
 our poor regions 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.319
 something authentic grosbois household tight fist there was 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.419
 the music is still there 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.099
 for the children who come here for him 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.709
 15 relief they have a representation 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.110
 of the object that are in the hands high level and the person who created it 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.009
 how parquet Sunday 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.889
 he's gone and how is he created and why 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.889
 so here we lead the raw material quoted lime trees 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.799
 it is a sculpture wood the drawing is fine enough 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.339
 and pretty tight 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:51.970
 so we can easily the world 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.209
 work it so I made a model no longer a little horse that 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.699
 this model is made of plywood 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.389
 Then I cut with a saw arrukban 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.209
 lighter 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.209
 yes there was a Christmas market in Strasbourg 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.619
 more interesting now when we're not even going there anymore 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.009
 since we have the impression that it is 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.149
 for the moment it would need to renew a little bit 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:26.160
 but I'm not a nostalgic 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.190
 the choice made in the past but I think we need to build 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.039
 in europe how things today 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:35.089
 I'm not nostalgic that this time Valerie Police 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.479
 but we still have to make sense the show is a very important figure 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:47.689
 we forgive him not yet know the real star of the TV not had the 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:48.489
 same success 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.720
 he will take the time to realize today he will also be present at 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.759
 Christmas market of his contract the week 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.610
 other trump charm of the day j 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.180
 back in this industry where we are all right he is proud of the piece 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.410

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.130
 beautiful rocking horse for 1 350 euros so it's not on the market 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.400
 top of the range strasbourg that can be found on the other hand 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.109
 order him pieces will then be awake will be maximum selestat 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.430
 it is his wife who will hold the stands from December 3 to 23 to find her 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.520
 but in the lower part, poorly balanced with many other craftsmen 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.460
 in selestat but that's my favorite this week have never 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.539
 go back to the top 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.580
