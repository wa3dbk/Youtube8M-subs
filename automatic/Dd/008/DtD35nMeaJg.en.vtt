from<00:01:49.740> look<00:01:50.070> at<00:01:50.159> where<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.460> starts<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.360> look<00:01:51.540> at

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
from look at where it starts and look at

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.740 
from look at where it starts and look at
where<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.930> ends<00:01:52.759> his<00:01:53.759> front<00:01:54.000> foot<00:01:54.180> that's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
where it ends his front foot that's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.620 
where it ends his front foot that's
about<00:01:55.170> maybe<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.560> three<00:01:56.070> inch<00:01:56.430> stride<00:01:57.240> right

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
about maybe a three inch stride right

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.780 
about maybe a three inch stride right
it's<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.079> too<00:01:58.259> big<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.740> lot<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.250> power<00:01:59.490> hitters

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
it's not too big a lot of power hitters

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.580 
it's not too big a lot of power hitters
will<00:01:59.939> get<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> bigger<00:02:00.360> story<00:02:00.840> they're<00:02:01.200> trying

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
will get a bigger story they're trying

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.230 
will get a bigger story they're trying
to<00:02:01.710> develop<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.399> momentum<00:02:02.880> they're<00:02:03.060> trying

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
to develop that momentum they're trying

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.330 
to develop that momentum they're trying
to<00:02:03.270> create<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.630> momentum<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.799> torque<00:02:05.189> in

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
to create that momentum that torque in

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.510 
to create that momentum that torque in
that<00:02:05.490> bad<00:02:05.640> speed<00:02:06.170> joey<00:02:07.170> votto<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:08.220> not

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that bad speed joey votto here is not

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.490 
that bad speed joey votto here is not
trying<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.780> know<00:02:09.869> he<00:02:10.050> has<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> very

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
trying to do that you know he has a very

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.309 
trying to do that you know he has a very
simple<00:02:11.039> stride<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> very<00:02:12.030> simple<00:02:12.300> leg<00:02:12.480> kick

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
simple stride is a very simple leg kick

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.679 
simple stride is a very simple leg kick
he<00:02:13.379> takes<00:02:13.590> his<00:02:13.799> 3<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.219> 4-inch<00:02:14.609> strike<00:02:14.999> and<00:02:15.359> then

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
he takes his 3 to 4-inch strike and then

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.330 
he takes his 3 to 4-inch strike and then
he<00:02:15.780> starts<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.170> rotational<00:02:16.739> aspect<00:02:16.859> of<00:02:17.219> his

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
he starts a rotational aspect of his

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.940 
he starts a rotational aspect of his
swing<00:02:17.609> and<00:02:18.109> what's<00:02:19.109> really<00:02:19.409> great<00:02:19.560> about<00:02:19.620> it

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
swing and what's really great about it

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.649 
swing and what's really great about it
is<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.189> how<00:02:20.400> he<00:02:20.430> strides<00:02:20.819> hits<00:02:21.150> lands<00:02:21.599> very

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
is that how he strides hits lands very

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.989 
is that how he strides hits lands very
very<00:02:22.109> soft<00:02:22.379> and<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:23.310> see<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.519> lot<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.879> these

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:23.999 
very soft and you see a lot of these

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.599 
very soft and you see a lot of these
kids<00:02:24.299> who<00:02:24.659> who<00:02:25.379> strive<00:02:25.709> really<00:02:26.099> hard<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.549> that

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
kids who who strive really hard and that

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.309 
kids who who strive really hard and that
moves<00:02:26.819> her<00:02:27.030> head<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.900> they<00:02:27.989> wonder<00:02:28.200> why

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
moves her head and they wonder why

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.390 
moves her head and they wonder why
they're<00:02:28.650> not<00:02:28.680> picking<00:02:28.980> up<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.219> pitch

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
they're not picking up the pitch

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.610 
they're not picking up the pitch
effectively<00:02:30.030> enough<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:31.019> keep<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.469> in<00:02:31.530> mind

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
effectively enough so keep that in mind

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.410 
effectively enough so keep that in mind
guys<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.010> lot<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.549> a<00:02:32.700> great<00:02:32.969> way<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.120> kind<00:02:33.389> of

guys a lot of a great way to kind of

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.390 
guys a lot of a great way to kind of
look<00:02:33.540> at<00:02:33.689> this<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.079> you<00:02:34.260> want<00:02:34.469> to<00:02:34.620> land<00:02:34.980> on<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
look at this is you want to land on the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.119 
look at this is you want to land on the
ball<00:02:35.609> of<00:02:35.639> your<00:02:35.909> foot<00:02:36.150> look<00:02:37.079> how<00:02:37.230> he<00:02:37.290> lands<00:02:37.889> just

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
ball of your foot look how he lands just

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.000 
ball of your foot look how he lands just
right<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.639> the<00:02:38.790> ball<00:02:39.000> boom<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:40.379> his<00:02:40.560> foot<00:02:40.829> and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
right on the ball boom on his foot and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.039 
right on the ball boom on his foot and
then<00:02:41.519> that's<00:02:41.969> that<00:02:42.120> hill<00:02:42.419> in<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.659> front<00:02:42.870> foot

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
then that's that hill in the front foot

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.899 
then that's that hill in the front foot
comes<00:02:43.230> down<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.739> back<00:02:43.919> heel<00:02:44.159> comes<00:02:44.430> up<00:02:44.639> right

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
comes down the back heel comes up right

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.170 
comes down the back heel comes up right
that<00:02:45.840> starts<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.439> rotational<00:02:47.189> aspect<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.819> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
that starts the rotational aspect of the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.770 
that starts the rotational aspect of the
swing

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
swing

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.069 
swing
and<00:02:50.030> lastly<00:02:51.030> that's<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.510> pretty<00:02:51.719> short<00:02:51.900> video

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
and lastly that's a pretty short video

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.929 
and lastly that's a pretty short video
on<00:02:52.859> what<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.099> did<00:02:53.189> guys<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.579> want<00:02:53.699> you<00:02:53.760> guys<00:02:53.909> to

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
on what you did guys I want you guys to

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.020 
on what you did guys I want you guys to
looked<00:02:54.299> at<00:02:54.480> where<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.799> bat<00:02:56.010> head<00:02:56.219> is<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.639> going

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
looked at where the bat head is is going

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.599 
looked at where the bat head is is going
when<00:02:57.449> you<00:02:57.540> start<00:02:57.750> your<00:02:57.900> swing<00:02:58.099> said<00:02:59.099> this<00:02:59.219> over

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
when you start your swing said this over

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:00.979 
when you start your swing said this over
and<00:02:59.760> over<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.060> over<00:03:00.239> again<00:03:00.419> then<00:03:00.689> one<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
and over and over again then one of the

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.080 
and over and over again then one of the
biggest<00:03:01.169> misconceptions<00:03:01.980> about<00:03:02.129> getting

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
biggest misconceptions about getting

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.610 
biggest misconceptions about getting
backspin<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.659> ball<00:03:03.719> is<00:03:04.049> taking<00:03:04.530> your

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
backspin on the ball is taking your

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.089 
backspin on the ball is taking your
hands<00:03:05.069> taking<00:03:05.969> them<00:03:06.180> where<00:03:06.359> they<00:03:06.510> are<00:03:06.540> and

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
hands taking them where they are and

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.610 
hands taking them where they are and
making<00:03:08.099> them<00:03:08.189> go<00:03:08.310> straight<00:03:08.669> to<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.849> baseball

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
making them go straight to the baseball

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.839 
making them go straight to the baseball
one<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.769> biggest<00:03:11.010> fallacies<00:03:11.159> guys<00:03:11.609> what

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
one of the biggest fallacies guys what

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.009 
one of the biggest fallacies guys what
you<00:03:11.939> really<00:03:12.120> want<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.389> do<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:12.659> want<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.870> get
