 now we are going to prepare our sauce 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.720
 of tomato 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.980

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.239
 we're going to boil it all together until 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.269
 the tomatoes are soft and we will pass 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.309

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.010

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.079
 that preparing the meat first will be 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.300
 season the meat with salt and then 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.900
 we must put it in the spit 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.470

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.050

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.510
 let's put our corn tortillas 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.270
 smell on the spit and we'll leave them for a 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.299
 good time until they are well browned 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.240
 once they are toasted we are going 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.270
 to add the grated cheese quesadilla you 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.009

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.469
