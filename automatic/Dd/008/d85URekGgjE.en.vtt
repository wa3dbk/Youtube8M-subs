the<00:02:28.290> next<00:02:28.500> principle<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.860> want<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.100> talk<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.310> you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
the next principle I want to talk to you

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.840 
the next principle I want to talk to you
about<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.880> always<00:02:30.870> strive<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:32.160> listen<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
about is always strive to listen to the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.020 
about is always strive to listen to the
music<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.980> could<00:02:34.980> be<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.100> jazz<00:02:35.370> dancer<00:02:35.819> with

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
music you could be a jazz dancer with

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.390 
music you could be a jazz dancer with
incredible<00:02:36.750> moves<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.319> amazing<00:02:37.920> movements

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
incredible moves and amazing movements

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.920 
incredible moves and amazing movements
but<00:02:38.819> if<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.090> don't<00:02:39.270> do<00:02:39.360> them<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.630> music

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
but if you don't do them to the music

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.070 
but if you don't do them to the music
then<00:02:40.319> they're<00:02:40.440> just<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.800> stuff<00:02:41.870> it's<00:02:42.870> not

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
then they're just that stuff it's not

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
then they're just that stuff it's not
dancing

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
dancing

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.400 
dancing
I<00:02:44.130> mean<00:02:45.030> imagine<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.420> jazz<00:02:45.630> musician<00:02:45.990> who<00:02:46.230> goes

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
I mean imagine a jazz musician who goes

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.350 
I mean imagine a jazz musician who goes
out<00:02:46.590> there<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:46.800> stage<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.340> plays<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.880> really

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
out there on stage and plays a really

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.380 
out there on stage and plays a really
wicked<00:02:48.540> solo<00:02:49.110> or<00:02:49.410> incredible<00:02:50.220> licks<00:02:50.490> but<00:02:51.209> is

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
wicked solo or incredible licks but is

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.810 
wicked solo or incredible licks but is
really<00:02:52.350> inappropriate<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.310> mood<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.700> the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
really inappropriate for the mood of the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.330 
really inappropriate for the mood of the
song<00:02:54.060> or<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:55.170> out<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.500> tune<00:02:55.800> with<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.100> rest<00:02:56.250> of

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
song or is out of tune with the rest of

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.309 
song or is out of tune with the rest of
musicians<00:02:56.790> then<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.510> get<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.690> sense<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.140> what

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
musicians then you get a sense of what

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.840 
musicians then you get a sense of what
it's<00:02:58.440> like<00:02:58.530> when<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.860> jazz<00:02:59.100> dancer<00:02:59.520> just<00:02:59.550> goes

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
it's like when a jazz dancer just goes

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.560 
it's like when a jazz dancer just goes
out<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.180> does<00:03:00.390> possibly<00:03:01.350> amazing<00:03:01.860> stuff<00:03:02.610> not

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
out and does possibly amazing stuff not

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.759 
out and does possibly amazing stuff not
to<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.930> music<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:05.370> listen<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.850> music<00:03:05.940> and

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
to the music so listen to the music and

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.229 
to the music so listen to the music and
sooner<00:03:07.769> or<00:03:07.800> later<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.400> will<00:03:08.640> probably<00:03:08.910> start

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
sooner or later it will probably start

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:16.960 
sooner or later it will probably start
telling<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:09.720> exactly<00:03:09.900> what<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.530> do

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.000 

the<00:03:17.540> final<00:03:17.990> principle<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.500> want<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.740> talk<00:03:18.860> to

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
the final principle I want to talk to

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.180 
the final principle I want to talk to
you<00:03:19.070> about<00:03:19.160> today<00:03:19.550> is<00:03:19.790> this<00:03:20.650> incredible<00:03:21.650> jazz

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
you about today is this incredible jazz

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.950 
you about today is this incredible jazz
dancers<00:03:22.790> tend<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.150> have<00:03:23.300> two<00:03:23.570> things<00:03:23.780> in

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
dancers tend to have two things in

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.240 
dancers tend to have two things in
common<00:03:24.190> first<00:03:25.190> off<00:03:25.490> great<00:03:26.360> technique<00:03:27.250> second

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
common first off great technique second

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.170 
common first off great technique second
off<00:03:28.660> lots<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:29.840> personality<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.820> think<00:03:32.090> this

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
off lots of personality and I think this

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.790 
off lots of personality and I think this
is<00:03:32.300> a<00:03:32.330> great<00:03:32.570> goal<00:03:32.780> for<00:03:32.990> you<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.230> have<00:03:33.410> as<00:03:33.620> you

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
solo jazz dancer Matt what this means is

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.670 
solo jazz dancer Matt what this means is
that<00:03:43.640> first<00:03:44.120> off<00:03:44.360> I<00:03:44.630> recommend<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.470> work

really hard on mastering the basic

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.930 
really hard on mastering the basic

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.190 
dancing in general
second<00:03:52.130> of<00:03:52.220> all<00:03:52.340> once<00:03:52.880> you<00:03:53.150> start<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.720> master

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
second of all once you start to master

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.400 
second of all once you start to master
them<00:03:54.380> start<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.340> play<00:03:55.520> around<00:03:55.790> be<00:03:56.750> creative

them start to play around be creative
let<00:03:57.680> yourself<00:03:57.980> go<00:03:58.190> try<00:03:59.180> doing<00:03:59.690> things<00:04:00.050> and<00:04:00.440> see

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
let yourself go try doing things and see

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800 
let yourself go try doing things and see
what<00:04:00.830> happens<00:04:01.400> without<00:04:01.820> worrying<00:04:02.300> about<00:04:02.540> the
