00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
spas-12 and watch this when he goes to

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.459 
spas-12 and watch this when he goes to
pick<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> drop<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.350> when

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
pick it up this is like a drop so when

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.200 
pick it up this is like a drop so when
he<00:00:43.530> pits<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:44.160> check<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.969> out<00:00:45.030> he<00:00:45.180> just

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
he pits this up check it out he just

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.119

running running around the map here
you've<00:01:33.479> seen<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.840> before<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.590> little

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
you've seen this before this little

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.800 
you've seen this before this little
section<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:36.240> I'm<00:01:36.420> they're<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.750> to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
section here but I'm they're going to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.719 
section here but I'm they're going to
show<00:01:36.960> some<00:01:37.290> more<00:01:37.530> gameplay<00:01:37.770> right<00:01:38.220> about<00:01:38.460> now

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
show some more gameplay right about now

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.910 
show some more gameplay right about now
here's<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> box<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.079> see<00:01:40.110> there's<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.650> few

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
here's the box you can see there's a few

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.649 
here's the box you can see there's a few
new<00:01:41.040> weapons<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.610> there<00:01:41.820> I'll<00:01:42.150> give<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.479> guys

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
new weapons in there I'll give you guys

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.950 
new weapons in there I'll give you guys
a<00:01:42.689> slow-mo<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.619> right<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:44.570> see<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.780> got

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
a slow-mo of that right now see we got

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.710 
a slow-mo of that right now see we got
the<00:01:46.110> law<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.560> org<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.369> wave<00:01:47.790> gun<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.420> quantum

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the law the org the wave gun the quantum

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.330 
the law the org the wave gun the quantum
entanglement<00:01:49.290> device<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:49.950> seems<00:01:50.189> like

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
entanglement device and that seems like

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.590 
entanglement device and that seems like
all<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.670> see<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.060> moment<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.509> new

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
all we can see at the moment for new

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.999 
all we can see at the moment for new
weapons<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.110> I'm<00:01:52.200> sure<00:01:52.380> there's<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.619> few<00:01:52.860> more

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
weapons but I'm sure there's a few more

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.800 
weapons but I'm sure there's a few more
in<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:53.340> that's<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> show<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.630> can

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
in there that's going to show you can

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.940 
in there that's going to show you can
get<00:01:54.930> them<00:01:55.079> straight<00:01:55.290> out<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> box<00:01:55.680> when

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
get them straight out of the box when

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.499 
get them straight out of the box when
you<00:01:56.040> get<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> wave<00:01:56.700> gun<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.329> be<00:01:57.420> in

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
you get the wave gun it's going to be in

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.389 
you get the wave gun it's going to be in
two<00:01:57.689> parts<00:01:58.110> as<00:01:58.259> you'll<00:01:58.710> see<00:01:58.860> further<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.280> you

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
two parts as you'll see further on you

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.670 
two parts as you'll see further on you
can<00:01:59.549> separate<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.090> into<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.960> big<00:02:01.170> gun<00:02:01.409> or

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
can separate it into one big gun or

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.679 
can separate it into one big gun or
separate<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.310> into<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.700> two<00:02:02.939> guns<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.509> when

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
separate it into the two guns like when

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.480 
separate it into the two guns like when
you<00:02:03.780> get<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.290> may<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.979> pack<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> punch

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
you get it you may have to pack a punch

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.670 
you get it you may have to pack a punch
at<00:02:05.670> first<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.090> we<00:02:06.210> don't<00:02:06.450> know<00:02:06.600> yet<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
at first but we don't know yet here the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.169 
at first but we don't know yet here the
guy<00:02:07.799> picks<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> quantum<00:02:08.729> entanglement

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
guy picks up the quantum entanglement

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.540 
guy picks up the quantum entanglement
device<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.830> see<00:02:11.009> that's<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> launch

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
device and you can see that's the launch

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.160 
device and you can see that's the launch
of<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:12.030> step<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.690> fly<00:02:12.930> up<00:02:13.140> to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
of this a step on that you fly up to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.730 
of this a step on that you fly up to
where<00:02:13.470> that

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
where that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.710 
where that
you<00:02:13.800> just<00:02:14.190> went<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.790> guy<00:02:15.000> there<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.660> you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
you just went and that guy there so you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.420 
you just went and that guy there so you
fly<00:02:15.990> across<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.410> map<00:02:16.650> as<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.160> see<00:02:17.400> right

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
fly across the map as you can see right

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.330 
fly across the map as you can see right
now<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.780> huge<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.590> entire<00:02:19.950> map<00:02:20.160> it's

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
now and it's huge this entire map it's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.670 
now and it's huge this entire map it's
insane<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.630> going<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.260> good<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
insane it's going to be so good and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.410 
insane it's going to be so good and
you'll<00:02:23.220> see<00:02:23.430> me<00:02:23.550> out<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.850> few<00:02:24.060> more<00:02:24.150> stuff<00:02:24.390> as

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
you'll see me out as a few more stuff as

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.060 
you'll see me out as a few more stuff as
long<00:02:24.630> as<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.020> floating<00:02:25.350> away<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.740> shoot

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
long as I like floating away you shoot

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.860 
long as I like floating away you shoot
them<00:02:26.280> all<00:02:26.430> looks<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.180> he's<00:02:27.300> got<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.540> quantum

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
them all looks like he's got the quantum

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.480 
them all looks like he's got the quantum
