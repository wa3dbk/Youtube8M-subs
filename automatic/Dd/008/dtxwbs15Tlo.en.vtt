things around the instrument so I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.110

in<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.300> way<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> other<00:00:37.140> side<00:00:37.410> it's

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
in a way but on the other side it's

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.139 
in a way but on the other side it's
definitely<00:00:38.280> something<00:00:38.670> when<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.910> want<00:00:39.030> to
