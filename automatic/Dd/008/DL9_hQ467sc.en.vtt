We all experience stress. I think we
all experience low mood. We may have some

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.620
anxiety. But when those things, however you
choose to express or feel it, start impacting

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.029
your life, that’s where there may be a problem.
NewAccess is designed for anyone 18 years

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.160
and over.
People who are really at the lower level

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.749
of experiencing depression and anxiety.
It isn’t about having, you know, big

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:29.179
mental health issues.
It’s rather unique to existing 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.900
services because we’re working
in partnership with them.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.120
They’re the ones that are identifying
the problem. They’re the ones that are setting

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.980
the goals. We’re just providing them with
some skills, and also some understanding,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.060
I guess of how they can move forward and manage
it themselves.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.900
I had a gentleman come into the service
who was experiencing work stress. And over

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.120
the six weeks, we were able to problem solve,
and identify a plan of attack.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.330
Now if he didn’t access the service,
in a few months it could have got a lot worse.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:01.180
So the reason this program is so good,
is it gives people the opportunity to

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.180
stand back in a safe, comfortable environment,
and reflect on what’s going on for them.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.039
It creates an opening, a recognition
which is almost, can be like a lightbulb moment

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.979
for them. And actually, progress is amazingly
quick.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.119
It’s that moment of clarification where
they go... OK.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.780
So we can see the benefits in a measured
way each week. We can see it on paper, but we

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.591
can also see it physically. We get that visual improvement, which is so satisfying.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.649
What’s important is that this program
is easily accessible. It’s a confidential

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.579
service, OK, and it’s free.
NewAccess, in terms of describing it,

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.829
it’s like, a personal trainer for the mind.
Now if you were to go to a personal trainer.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.679
That personal trainer does not do the exercise
for you. But they are there by your side.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.839
Giving you that knowledge and skills, and
pushing you along that journey.
