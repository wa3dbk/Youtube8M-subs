00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
XP it is a pretty outstanding operating

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:15.260 
XP it is a pretty outstanding operating
system<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.880> far<00:01:11.450> for<00:01:12.450> instance<00:01:13.970> if<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.119> look

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
system so far for instance if you look

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.980

at<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.390> resource<00:01:15.840> monitor<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:18.420> memory<00:01:18.840> in

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
at the resource monitor the memory in

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.929 
at the resource monitor the memory in
use<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.470> pretty<00:01:19.799> much<00:01:20.040> equal<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.119> what<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.939> XP

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
use is pretty much equal to what then XP

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.630 
use is pretty much equal to what then XP
is<00:01:24.060> taken<00:01:24.360> up<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.540> my<00:01:24.659> computer<00:01:24.920> with<00:01:25.920> RF<00:01:26.400> I've

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
is taken up on my computer with RF I've

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.780 
is taken up on my computer with RF I've
see<00:01:26.850> I've<00:01:27.000> got<00:01:27.030> more<00:01:27.360> ram<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:29.400> ratio<00:01:29.579> is

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
see I've got more ram but the ratio is

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.749 
see I've got more ram but the ratio is
still<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> same<00:01:31.280> in<00:01:32.280> use<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.759> 395<00:01:34.579> piss<00:01:35.579> off

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
still the same in use is 395 piss off

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.649 
still the same in use is 395 piss off
fly<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:37.560> oh<00:01:37.909> how<00:01:38.909> much<00:01:39.030> we've<00:01:39.210> got<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> minor

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
fly it oh how much we've got a minor

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.580

it<00:03:01.950> might<00:03:02.280> no<00:03:03.269> that's<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:04.260> done<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:07.850> say<00:03:08.850> it's<00:03:09.000> a

bit like there but then again remember
on<00:03:11.310> recording<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.830> is<00:03:13.950> very<00:03:14.160> poor

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.430 

reasons<00:03:51.450> why<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.660> shouldn't<00:03:51.989> go<00:03:52.079> for<00:03:52.380> this

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
support for programs um this is only due

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.539 
support for programs um this is only due
