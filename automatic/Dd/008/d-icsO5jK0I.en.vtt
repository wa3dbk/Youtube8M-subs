in<00:00:07.020> Photoshop<00:00:07.589> pretty<00:00:07.980> simple<00:00:08.309> task<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.910> do

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
in Photoshop pretty simple task to do

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.089 
in Photoshop pretty simple task to do
but<00:00:09.269> sometimes<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.840> gets<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.170> little<00:00:10.320> crazy<00:00:10.860> if

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
but sometimes it gets a little crazy if

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.740 
but sometimes it gets a little crazy if
you<00:00:11.130> don't<00:00:11.250> understand<00:00:12.120> what's<00:00:12.330> going<00:00:12.420> on

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
you don't understand what's going on

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.259 
you don't understand what's going on
first<00:00:13.530> thing<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.769> needs<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.549> it

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
first thing that needs to do is it

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.090 
first thing that needs to do is it
wouldn't<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.960> have<00:00:16.109> an<00:00:16.230> image<00:00:16.350> up<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:16.859> we

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
wouldn't you have an image up here we

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.670 
wouldn't you have an image up here we
need<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.279> take<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.820> image<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.390> go<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.289> image

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
need to take the image and go to image

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.120 
need to take the image and go to image
size<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.600> select<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:22.320> size<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.800> want<00:00:22.949> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
size and select what size we want to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.340 
size and select what size we want to
make<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.519> standard<00:00:24.449> thumbnail<00:00:24.810> size<00:00:25.050> would

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
make it standard thumbnail size would

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.550 
make it standard thumbnail size would
roughly<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.920> about<00:00:26.300> 150<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.330> 200<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:27.990> width<00:00:28.289> so

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
roughly be about 150 to 200 in width so

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.560 
roughly be about 150 to 200 in width so
I'm<00:00:28.859> going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.039> go<00:00:29.160> ahead<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.580> change<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.119> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
I'm going to go ahead and change this to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.870 
I'm going to go ahead and change this to
200<00:00:31.140> now<00:00:31.560> you'll<00:00:31.740> notice<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.309> change<00:00:32.640> this

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
200 now you'll notice as I change this

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.080 
200 now you'll notice as I change this
because<00:00:33.239> i<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.960> chain<00:00:34.680> link<00:00:35.090> located

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
because i have this chain link located

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.299 
because i have this chain link located
to<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.050> right<00:00:37.140> hand<00:00:37.469> side<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.160> also

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
to the right hand side of that it also

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.700 
to the right hand side of that it also
changes<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> height<00:00:39.210> at<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.450> same<00:00:39.719> time<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
changes the height at the same time the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.990 
changes the height at the same time the
reason<00:00:41.010> why<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.190> does<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.820> its

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
reason why it does that is its

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.090 
reason why it does that is its
constraining<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.840> proportions<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
constraining the proportions of the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.029 
constraining the proportions of the
image<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.390> width<00:00:45.690> when<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.320> changes<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
image so the width when that changes the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.889 
image so the width when that changes the
height<00:00:47.219> changes<00:00:47.640> as<00:00:47.850> well<00:00:48.620> when<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.890> want<00:00:50.640> to

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
height changes as well when we want to

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.630 
height changes as well when we want to
make<00:00:51.899> some<00:00:52.559> corrections<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.489> only

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
make some corrections to it and only

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.639 
make some corrections to it and only
want<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> change<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.480> width<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.500> we

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
want to change the width of it then we

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.680 
want to change the width of it then we
would<00:00:56.030> disconnect<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.239> constrain

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
would disconnect the constrain

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.779 
would disconnect the constrain
proportions<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.620> i'll<00:00:58.890> show<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.160> how<00:00:59.370> that

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
proportions and i'll show you how that

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.160 
proportions and i'll show you how that
whole<00:00:59.969> thing<00:01:00.180> works<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.660> i'm<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.050> go

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
whole thing works so i'm going to go

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
whole thing works so i'm going to go
ahead<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.710> show<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.460> size<00:01:02.699> difference

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
ahead and show you the size difference

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.060 
ahead and show you the size difference
here<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.870> then<00:01:04.110> i'm<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> hit<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> ctrl

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
here and then i'm going to hit the ctrl

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.410 
here and then i'm going to hit the ctrl
z<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.549> take<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.850> back<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> its<00:01:06.330> original

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
z and take that back to its original

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.250 
z and take that back to its original
size<00:01:07.700> once<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:08.939> go<00:01:09.090> back<00:01:09.270> into<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> image<00:01:09.900> size

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
size once we go back into the image size

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.410 
size once we go back into the image size
if<00:01:10.619> i<00:01:10.740> take<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.130> constraint<00:01:11.640> proportions<00:01:12.240> out

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
if i take the constraint proportions out

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.210 
if i take the constraint proportions out
you'll<00:01:12.750> notice<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.140> chain<00:01:13.409> link<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.770> removed

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
you'll notice the chain link is removed

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.760 
you'll notice the chain link is removed
and<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.760> i<00:01:14.880> change<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.210> back<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.780> 200<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and if i change that back to 200 the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.859 
and if i change that back to 200 the
height<00:01:16.979> does<00:01:17.220> not<00:01:17.369> change<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:17.970> i<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.600> ahead<00:01:18.659> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
height does not change if i go ahead and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.010 
height does not change if i go ahead and
okay<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.009> selection<00:01:20.909> you'll<00:01:21.600> notice<00:01:21.990> that

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
okay this selection you'll notice that

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.609 
okay this selection you'll notice that
it<00:01:22.619> really<00:01:23.100> along<00:01:23.460> gates<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.030> image<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> what

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
it really along gates the image so what

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.859 
it really along gates the image so what
i'm<00:01:25.740> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.420> made<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> mistake

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
i'm going to do is if I made a mistake

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.560 
i'm going to do is if I made a mistake
on<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.439> go<00:01:28.950> ahead<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.430> hit<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.909> control<00:01:30.329> Z

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
on that go ahead and hit the control Z

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.440 
on that go ahead and hit the control Z
and<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.560> takes<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.159> last<00:01:32.579> move<00:01:32.909> out<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
and that takes that last move out of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.819 
and that takes that last move out of
there<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.490> go<00:01:35.490> back<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.909> image<00:01:36.090> size<00:01:36.829> select

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
there and go back to image size select

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.460 
there and go back to image size select
the<00:01:37.979> constraint<00:01:38.460> proportions<00:01:39.200> put<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.290> back

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the constraint proportions put it back

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.609 
the constraint proportions put it back
to<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> size<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.430> need<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.229> we<00:01:43.229> are<00:01:43.380> done

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
to the size that we need and we are done

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.889 
to the size that we need and we are done
with<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.610> next<00:01:44.970> item<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.600> needs<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
with that the next item that needs to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.350 
with that the next item that needs to
happen<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:47.250> need<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.640> select<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.509> save

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
happen is you need to select the save
