the<00:00:12.210> singles<00:00:12.660> developing<00:00:13.500> consistency<00:00:14.309> we

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
the singles developing consistency we

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.330 
the singles developing consistency we
can<00:00:15.000> move<00:00:15.210> from<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.960> outside<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.680> rim<00:00:16.890> to

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
can move from the outside of the rim to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.060 
can move from the outside of the rim to
the<00:00:17.460> inside<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.090> base<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.800> we're<00:00:19.800> using

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the inside on the base and we're using

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.220 
the inside on the base and we're using
our<00:00:20.279> metronome<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.090> we<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.869> do<00:00:22.020> both

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
our metronome and we can do both

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.950 
our metronome and we can do both
double-time<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.279> single<00:00:24.090> time<00:00:24.300> what<00:00:24.810> do<00:00:24.900> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
double-time and single time what do I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.170 
double-time and single time what do I
mean<00:00:25.170> by<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.529> well<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.400> set<00:00:26.730> our<00:00:26.849> metronome

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
mean by that well is set our metronome

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.510 
mean by that well is set our metronome
up<00:00:27.920> right<00:00:32.840> two<00:00:33.840> strokes<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.860> each<00:00:34.950> hand<00:00:35.219> like

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
up right two strokes for each hand like

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.130 
up right two strokes for each hand like
we've<00:00:35.700> done<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.000> previous<00:00:36.050> podcasts<00:00:42.140> notice

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

we've done in previous podcasts notice
I'm<00:00:43.260> doing<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> double<00:00:43.980> time<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:51.329> as

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
I'm doing it double time there and as

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.200 
I'm doing it double time there and as
much<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.350> try<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.489> you're<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:54.000> to

much as you can try if you're going to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.200 
much as you can try if you're going to
do<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.539> eight<00:00:54.960> times<00:00:55.520> slow<00:00:56.520> eight<00:00:56.820> times

do it eight times slow eight times
double<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.199> fast<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:59.129> try<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.640> consistent

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
double or fast then try to be consistent

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.060 
double or fast then try to be consistent
because<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.570> want<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.780> practice<00:01:01.079> consistency

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
because you want to practice consistency

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:12.789 
because you want to practice consistency
as<00:01:02.250> well<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.570> stay<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:10.130> right<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
as well and we can stay here right and

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.350 
as well and we can stay here right and
we<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:13.950> stay<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> outside<00:01:14.340> or<00:01:14.970> then<00:01:15.240> we

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
we can stay on the outside or then we

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.770 
we can stay on the outside or then we
can<00:01:15.540> also<00:01:15.810> go<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.590> inside<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.600> drum

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
can also go on the inside of the drum

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:43.560 
can also go on the inside of the drum
doing<00:01:19.470> more<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.130> bass<00:01:20.580> bass<00:01:20.970> notes

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.649 

notice<00:01:44.570> it's<00:01:45.070> right<00:01:46.070> here<00:01:47.000> because<00:01:47.360> when<00:01:47.539> it's

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
notice it's right here because when it's

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.169 
notice it's right here because when it's
faster<00:01:51.070> you<00:01:52.070> want<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.399> be<00:01:52.520> natural<00:01:52.729> you<00:01:53.119> don't

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
faster you want to be natural you don't

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.590 
faster you want to be natural you don't
want<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.509> drop<00:01:53.720> what<00:01:54.439> you<00:01:54.560> want<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:56.360> want

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
want to drop what you want to you want

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.929 
want to drop what you want to you want
them<00:01:56.929> as<00:01:57.200> much<00:01:57.560> wrist<00:01:57.950> action<00:01:58.429> it's<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.640> wrist

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
them as much wrist action it's the wrist

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.809 
them as much wrist action it's the wrist
in<00:01:59.179> there<00:01:59.740> you<00:02:00.740> for<00:02:00.950> your<00:02:01.069> folk<00:02:01.340> from<00:02:01.520> there

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
but the way you develop that is just

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.719 
but the way you develop that is just
working<00:02:07.069> on<00:02:07.399> here<00:02:08.330> now<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:09.110> great<00:02:09.679> exercise<00:02:10.369> as

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
working on here now a great exercise as

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.039 
working on here now a great exercise as
well<00:02:11.180> for<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.049> doubles<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:13.040> develop<00:02:13.610> this

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
well for the doubles to develop this

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.440 
well for the doubles to develop this
turn<00:02:15.049> a<00:02:15.080> metronome<00:02:15.470> off<00:02:15.769> here<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:17.420> just

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
turn a metronome off here is to just

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.590 
turn a metronome off here is to just
have<00:02:17.930> your<00:02:18.080> hand<00:02:18.380> flat<00:02:19.040> on<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.549> drum<00:02:19.850> okay

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600

have your hand flat on the drum okay
we're<00:02:20.989> going<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.170> develop<00:02:21.410> this<00:02:21.680> wrist<00:02:22.069> and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
we're going to develop this wrist and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.550 
we're going to develop this wrist and
this<00:02:22.850> this<00:02:23.239> power<00:02:23.569> right<00:02:23.870> here<00:02:24.110> being<00:02:24.319> able<00:02:24.470> to

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
this this power right here being able to

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.120 
this this power right here being able to
be<00:02:24.680> relaxed<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.310> control<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:27.140> we<00:02:27.890> could<00:02:28.010> just

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
be relaxed and control and we could just

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.190 
be relaxed and control and we could just
do<00:02:28.310> singles<00:02:28.760> right<00:02:28.970> here<00:02:29.209> or<00:02:29.480> we<00:02:29.930> can<00:02:30.049> actually

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200

so<00:02:40.989> we<00:02:41.989> want<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.230> develop<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.680> right<00:02:43.310> in

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
so we want to develop that right in

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.770 
so we want to develop that right in
there<00:02:43.579> okay<00:02:47.769> now<00:02:48.769> another<00:02:49.430> thing<00:02:49.730> for<00:02:50.660> the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.050 

if<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:24.240> have<00:03:24.540> three<00:03:24.900> drums<00:03:25.790> then<00:03:26.790> one

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
if you have three drums then one

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.340 
if you have three drums then one
exercise<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.780> we<00:03:27.900> can<00:03:28.050> do<00:03:28.200> is<00:03:28.410> we<00:03:29.040> go<00:03:29.160> ahead

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.220 

and<00:03:34.700> remember<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:36.090> want<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.390> stick<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.900> our

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
and remember you want to stick to our

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.820 
and remember you want to stick to our
timing<00:03:37.800> hair<00:03:39.260> set<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.290> time<00:03:40.680> that's

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
timing hair set a time that's

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.510 
timing hair set a time that's
comfortable<00:03:41.400> for<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:43.070> and<00:03:44.070> that<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.370> can

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
comfortable for you and that you can

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:55.340 
comfortable for you and that you can
grow<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.910> right<00:03:50.420> for<00:03:53.270> not<00:03:54.270> okay<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:55.020> we're

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
grow it right for not okay so we're

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:11.290 
grow it right for not okay so we're
going<00:03:55.500> out<00:03:55.800> to<00:03:55.950> in<00:04:06.680> not<00:04:07.680> not<00:04:08.280> not<00:04:08.880> not<00:04:09.240> not<00:04:10.170> not

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
going out to in not not not not not not

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.660 
going out to in not not not not not not
in<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.360> same<00:04:13.140> way<00:04:13.410> as<00:04:13.650> if<00:04:13.920> you<00:04:14.100> have<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.250> drum<00:04:14.520> in

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
in the same way as if you have a drum in

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.300 
in the same way as if you have a drum in
front<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:15.000> you<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:16.019> can<00:04:16.230> develop<00:04:16.530> this<00:04:16.890> this

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
front of you you can develop this this

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.060 
front of you you can develop this this
right<00:04:17.609> hand<00:04:17.910> in<00:04:18.510> front<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.200> or<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.829> left

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
right hand in front of you or the left

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.300 
right hand in front of you or the left
hand<00:04:20.400> out<00:04:20.700> in<00:04:21.090> front<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.390> you<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.860> then<00:04:26.220> you

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
hand out in front of you and then you

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.909 
hand out in front of you and then you
can<00:04:26.490> switch<00:04:26.669> up<00:04:26.820> moving<00:04:27.390> around<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.780> drum<00:04:30.919> and

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
can switch up moving around the drum and

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.370 
can switch up moving around the drum and
that's<00:04:32.880> one<00:04:33.120> way<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.360> develop<00:04:33.540> our<00:04:33.960> doubles

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
that's one way to develop our doubles

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.760 
that's one way to develop our doubles
another<00:04:35.160> way<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:35.669> to<00:04:36.540> develop<00:04:37.200> a<00:04:37.290> strength<00:04:37.650> of

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
another way is to develop a strength of

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.190 
another way is to develop a strength of
the<00:04:37.890> doubles<00:04:38.340> inside<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.300> center<00:04:39.660> drum<00:04:39.930> and

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
the doubles inside the center drum and

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.580 
the doubles inside the center drum and
then<00:04:40.890> reduce<00:04:41.190> singles<00:04:41.760> on<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.210> other<00:04:42.360> drum<00:04:42.720> so

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
then reduce singles on the other drum so

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.020 
then reduce singles on the other drum so
what<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.740> mean<00:04:44.010> by<00:04:44.070> that<00:04:44.250> is<00:04:44.790> basically<00:04:48.350> doubles

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
what I mean by that is basically doubles

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:58.550 
what I mean by that is basically doubles
single<00:04:55.850> now<00:04:56.850> notice<00:04:57.270> I'm<00:04:57.419> going<00:04:57.630> hand<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.290> hand

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
single now notice I'm going hand to hand

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.960 
single now notice I'm going hand to hand
between<00:04:59.400> out<00:05:00.000> in<00:05:02.000> now<00:05:03.000> double<00:05:04.160> double<00:05:05.160> single

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
between out in now double double single

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:14.939 
between out in now double double single
double<00:05:07.130> single<00:05:08.690> okay

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.499 

the<00:05:15.949> other<00:05:16.190> way<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.460> we<00:05:16.639> can<00:05:16.879> do<00:05:17.060> this<00:05:17.240> and

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
the other way that we can do this and

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.390 
the other way that we can do this and
let<00:05:17.780> me<00:05:17.900> backtrack<00:05:18.110> here<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:19.069> other<00:05:19.220> way

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
let me backtrack here the other way

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.149 
let me backtrack here the other way
notice<00:05:19.879> that<00:05:20.000> when<00:05:20.300> I'm<00:05:20.419> doing<00:05:20.539> it

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159 
notice that when I'm doing it

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:34.689 
notice that when I'm doing it
single<00:05:22.159> double<00:05:22.750> okay<00:05:24.159> double<00:05:25.159> single<00:05:33.699> the

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
single double okay double single the

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.580 
single double okay double single the
other<00:05:34.729> way<00:05:35.030> that<00:05:35.060> we<00:05:35.300> can<00:05:35.479> do<00:05:35.629> this<00:05:35.780> is<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.530> we

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
other way that we can do this is that we

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.080 
other way that we can do this is that we
can<00:05:36.919> actually<00:05:37.159> go<00:05:38.139> outside<00:05:39.139> outside<00:05:39.819> back<00:05:40.819> to

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
can actually go outside outside back to

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.180 
can actually go outside outside back to
the<00:05:41.240> inside<00:05:41.750> whereas<00:05:42.409> before<00:05:42.770> I<00:05:42.800> was<00:05:42.979> just

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
the inside whereas before I was just

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.149 
the inside whereas before I was just
going<00:05:43.430> straight<00:05:43.580> from<00:05:44.060> in<00:05:44.330> here<00:05:44.930> out<00:05:48.099> now<00:05:49.099> we

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
going straight from in here out now we

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.219 
going straight from in here out now we
can<00:05:49.490> do<00:05:49.639> it<00:05:49.669> instead<00:05:50.330> of<00:05:50.389> always<00:05:50.630> coming<00:05:50.780> back

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
can do it instead of always coming back

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.020 
can do it instead of always coming back
to<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:51.500> middle<00:05:51.740> drum<00:05:51.979> we<00:05:52.430> can<00:05:52.610> go<00:05:52.729> to<00:05:52.789> the

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
to the middle drum we can go to the

00:05:53.030 --> 00:06:05.620 
to the middle drum we can go to the
outer<00:05:53.180> drums<00:06:02.650> so<00:06:03.650> instead<00:06:04.130> we're<00:06:04.490> focusing<00:06:05.449> on

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
outer drums so instead we're focusing on

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.540 
outer drums so instead we're focusing on
this<00:06:05.900> and<00:06:08.860> remember<00:06:09.860> then<00:06:10.039> we<00:06:10.130> can<00:06:10.250> go<00:06:10.310> back<00:06:10.520> to

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
this and remember then we can go back to

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:39.570 
this and remember then we can go back to
the<00:06:10.729> single<00:06:19.300> slowing<00:06:20.300> it<00:06:20.389> down

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.409 

double<00:06:40.580> double

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 
double double

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:52.809 
double double
single<00:06:42.259> single<00:06:43.039> double<00:06:43.389> double<00:06:51.550> okay<00:06:52.550> and

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
single single double double okay and

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.330 
single single double double okay and
these<00:06:53.690> are<00:06:53.870> a<00:06:53.900> few<00:06:54.169> of<00:06:54.259> the<00:06:54.349> exercises<00:06:54.620> to

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
these are a few of the exercises to

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.990 
these are a few of the exercises to
develop<00:06:55.969> these<00:06:56.389> doubles<00:06:57.219> and<00:06:58.219> it's<00:06:58.729> a<00:06:58.789> great

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
develop these doubles and it's a great

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.779 
develop these doubles and it's a great
exercise<00:06:59.240> because<00:06:59.659> you<00:07:00.229> now<00:07:00.440> can<00:07:00.800> have<00:07:01.310> more

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:01.789 
exercise because you now can have more

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:04.899 
exercise because you now can have more
language<00:07:02.120> for<00:07:03.050> your<00:07:03.319> solo<00:07:03.770> or<00:07:04.159> to<00:07:04.340> add<00:07:04.490> to<00:07:04.759> your

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:04.909 
language for your solo or to add to your

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:06.490 
language for your solo or to add to your
playing<00:07:05.240> even<00:07:05.690> if<00:07:05.779> you're<00:07:05.900> playing<00:07:06.110> in<00:07:06.259> a<00:07:06.319> band

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
playing even if you're playing in a band

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:26.090 
playing even if you're playing in a band
say<00:07:07.430> you<00:07:07.490> have<00:07:07.909> a<00:07:07.940> pattern<00:07:08.330> on<00:07:08.569> top<00:07:08.840> of<00:07:08.990> that

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.100 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.790 

so<00:07:27.100> now<00:07:27.310> we're<00:07:27.490> adding<00:07:27.640> extra<00:07:28.510> language<00:07:28.900> to

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 
so now we're adding extra language to

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.010 
so now we're adding extra language to
what<00:07:30.040> we've<00:07:30.220> already<00:07:30.370> been<00:07:30.580> doing<00:07:30.820> on<00:07:31.060> top<00:07:31.330> you

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020 
what we've already been doing on top you

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:40.280 
what we've already been doing on top you
got<00:07:32.170> a<00:07:32.200> bandage<00:07:32.650> plan<00:07:32.890> to<00:07:33.160> talk<00:07:33.700> to<00:07:34.120> top<00:07:36.720> ducted

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:40.290 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.020 

you<00:07:41.290> are<00:07:41.470> you<00:07:41.620> have<00:07:41.770> extra<00:07:42.220> stuff<00:07:42.490> to<00:07:42.670> add<00:07:42.820> in
