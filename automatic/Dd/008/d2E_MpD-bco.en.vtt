now I'm done with my first name and to

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.540 
now I'm done with my first name and to
get<00:00:43.329> to<00:00:43.660> where<00:00:44.079> I<00:00:44.110> want<00:00:44.379> to<00:00:44.440> start<00:00:44.680> my<00:00:44.860> last

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
get to where I want to start my last

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.760 
get to where I want to start my last
name<00:00:45.820> instead<00:00:46.570> of<00:00:46.629> stopping<00:00:47.079> clipping

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
name instead of stopping clipping

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.439 
name instead of stopping clipping
threads<00:00:48.160> pulling<00:00:48.670> my<00:00:48.790> bobbin<00:00:49.090> throw<00:00:49.269> it<00:00:49.329> up

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
threads pulling my bobbin throw it up

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.090 
threads pulling my bobbin throw it up
and<00:00:49.629> doing<00:00:49.870> all<00:00:49.989> that<00:00:50.170> stuff<00:00:50.410> again

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
and doing all that stuff again

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.310 
and doing all that stuff again
I<00:00:51.129> can<00:00:51.550> just<00:00:51.730> secure<00:00:51.879> those<00:00:52.420> threads<00:00:52.840> a<00:00:53.079> little

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
I can just secure those threads a little

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.430 
I can just secure those threads a little
bit<00:00:53.469> right<00:00:53.680> there<00:00:54.100> and<00:00:54.370> then<00:00:55.059> raise<00:00:55.840> my<00:00:56.079> needle

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
bit right there and then raise my needle

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.040 
bit right there and then raise my needle
up<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:56.800> jump<00:00:57.519> to<00:00:57.879> where<00:00:58.059> I<00:00:58.120> want<00:00:58.480> to<00:00:58.570> start<00:00:58.870> the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
up and jump to where I want to start the

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.920 
up and jump to where I want to start the
W<00:00:59.409> in<00:00:59.530> my<00:00:59.649> last<00:00:59.920> name<00:01:00.250> and<00:01:00.579> then<00:01:01.390> I'll<00:01:01.629> just

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
W in my last name and then I'll just

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.979 
W in my last name and then I'll just
secure<00:01:02.379> those<00:01:02.620> threads<00:01:03.010> there<00:01:03.610> and<00:01:03.989> continue

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
secure those threads there and continue

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.830 
secure those threads there and continue
going

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
going

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.020 
going
and<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.979> course<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.399> to<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.759> again

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and of course I have to do that again

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.109 
and of course I have to do that again
here<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.450> start<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> rest<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.229> my<00:01:10.350> name<00:01:11.119> jump

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
here to start the rest of my name jump

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.670 
here to start the rest of my name jump
down<00:01:12.329> here<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.430> start<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> rest<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.539> I<00:01:16.439> can

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
down here and start the rest and I can

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.730 
down here and start the rest and I can
just<00:01:17.579> clip<00:01:18.030> those<00:01:18.329> threads<00:01:18.750> later<00:01:19.229> when<00:01:19.590> I'm

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
just clip those threads later when I'm

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.649 
just clip those threads later when I'm
all<00:01:19.920> done<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.820> way<00:01:20.970> you've<00:01:21.149> saved<00:01:21.360> time

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
all done and that way you've saved time

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.760 
all done and that way you've saved time
and<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.899> save<00:01:22.140> thread

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and you save thread

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.609 
and you save thread
it's<00:01:23.700> called<00:01:23.909> jumping

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
it's called jumping

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.510 
it's called jumping
and<00:01:26.039> now<00:01:26.700> here's<00:01:27.469> where<00:01:28.469> am<00:01:28.649> I<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.920> need<00:01:29.250> across

and now here's where am I I need across

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.580 
and now here's where am I I need across
my<00:01:29.759> tea<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.359> instead<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.689> jumping<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.409> that

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
my tea and instead of jumping to do that

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.690 
my tea and instead of jumping to do that
I'm<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.219> right<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
I'm just going to do it right here and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
already let's see if I can remember how

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
already let's see if I can remember how
to<00:01:39.509> spell<00:01:39.659> my<00:01:39.929> name

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.290 

and<00:01:47.740> there<00:01:48.010> we<00:01:48.160> go<00:01:50.400> so<00:01:51.400> that<00:01:51.430> is<00:01:51.640> one<00:01:52.030> way<00:01:52.060> so

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
and there we go so that is one way so

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.150 
and there we go so that is one way so
see<00:01:52.690> then<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:52.930> can<00:01:53.080> go<00:01:53.230> right<00:01:53.410> back<00:01:53.440> here<00:01:54.040> and

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
see then I can go right back here and

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.700 
see then I can go right back here and
just<00:01:54.550> click<00:01:54.850> these<00:01:55.090> threads<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:55.870> pull<00:01:56.500> them

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
just click these threads and pull them

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.790 
just click these threads and pull them
off<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.280> they're<00:01:58.270> gone<00:01:58.510> and<00:01:58.900> it's<00:01:59.470> just

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
off and they're gone and it's just

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.950 
off and they're gone and it's just
really<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.580> faster<00:02:01.270> way<00:02:01.480> to<00:02:03.360> start<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.630> stop<00:02:04.810> a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
really a faster way to start and stop a

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.890 
really a faster way to start and stop a
line<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.530> stitching<00:02:05.980> and<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.790> way<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.660> get

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
line of stitching and that way you get

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.770 
line of stitching and that way you get
much<00:02:08.680> more<00:02:09.450> time

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
much more time

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.230 
much more time
stitching<00:02:11.380> okay<00:02:12.250> let's<00:02:12.490> go<00:02:12.640> from<00:02:12.820> there<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:14.110> to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
stitching okay let's go from there in to

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.120 
stitching okay let's go from there in to

circles<00:02:20.560> but<00:02:21.310> it's<00:02:21.370> another<00:02:21.820> nice<00:02:22.180> background

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
circles but it's another nice background

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.060 
circles but it's another nice background
filler<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:24.460> you're<00:02:24.970> you're<00:02:25.570> coming<00:02:26.530> back<00:02:26.860> on

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
filler and you're you're coming back on

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.800 
filler and you're you're coming back on
the<00:02:27.190> same<00:02:27.460> line<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.730> stitching<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.390> little<00:02:28.630> bit

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
the same line of stitching a little bit

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.530 
the same line of stitching a little bit
so<00:02:29.200> kind<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.220> makes<00:02:30.400> some<00:02:30.580> people<00:02:30.700> nervous<00:02:30.910> to

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
so kind of makes some people nervous to

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.160 
so kind of makes some people nervous to
do<00:02:31.660> things<00:02:31.900> like<00:02:32.020> this<00:02:32.380> but<00:02:33.010> it's<00:02:33.190> okay<00:02:34.170> you

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
do things like this but it's okay you

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.990 
do things like this but it's okay you
can<00:02:35.320> make<00:02:35.470> them<00:02:35.620> big<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.490> can<00:02:36.640> make<00:02:36.670> them

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
can make them big you can make them

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.690 
can make them big you can make them
small<00:02:37.420> they<00:02:38.290> don't<00:02:38.320> all<00:02:38.770> have<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:39.070> be<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.520> same

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
small they don't all have to be the same

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.900 
small they don't all have to be the same
size<00:02:40.120> as<00:02:40.630> we<00:02:41.470> know<00:02:41.590> nature<00:02:42.070> never<00:02:42.370> makes<00:02:42.730> them

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
size as we know nature never makes them

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.980 
size as we know nature never makes them
the<00:02:43.030> same<00:02:43.270> size<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:43.960> it's<00:02:44.140> okay<00:02:44.440> for<00:02:44.500> us<00:02:44.680> to

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
the same size so it's okay for us to

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.070 
the same size so it's okay for us to
make<00:02:47.530> big<00:02:47.770> ones<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.160> small<00:02:48.190> ones<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.900> is

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
make big ones and small ones and that is

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.260 
make big ones and small ones and that is
a<00:02:50.110> really<00:02:50.560> nice<00:02:50.770> background<00:02:51.130> filler<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:52.000> takes

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
a really nice background filler it takes

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.790 
a really nice background filler it takes
a<00:02:52.450> little<00:02:52.600> more<00:02:52.810> time<00:02:53.140> than<00:02:53.500> things<00:02:53.710> like

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
a little more time than things like

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.610 
a little more time than things like
stippling<00:02:54.550> but<00:02:55.450> it's<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.720> really<00:02:56.080> nice<00:02:56.290> change

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
stippling but it's a really nice change

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.100 
stippling but it's a really nice change
of<00:02:56.800> pace<00:02:56.860> from<00:02:57.400> some<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.050> normal<00:02:59.050> things

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
of pace from some of the normal things

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.720 
of pace from some of the normal things
that

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.870 

that<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.390> normally<00:03:04.540> do

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
that I normally do

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.950 
that I normally do
let<00:03:07.300> me<00:03:07.420> fill<00:03:07.690> in<00:03:07.870> this<00:03:08.080> one<00:03:08.440> little<00:03:08.770> spot<00:03:08.860> here

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
let me fill in this one little spot here

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.960 
let me fill in this one little spot here
okay<00:03:10.960> so<00:03:11.020> there's<00:03:11.410> some<00:03:11.590> cobblestones<00:03:12.220> and

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
okay so there's some cobblestones and

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.890 
okay so there's some cobblestones and
take<00:03:13.180> some<00:03:13.360> more<00:03:13.480> pins<00:03:13.750> out<00:03:13.960> here<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.720> let's

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
take some more pins out here and let's

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.160 
take some more pins out here and let's
make<00:03:16.990> some<00:03:17.260> snowflakes<00:03:18.990> snowflakes<00:03:19.990> are

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
make some snowflakes snowflakes are

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.440 
make some snowflakes snowflakes are
always<00:03:20.440> kind<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.710> fun<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.820> this<00:03:22.060> is<00:03:22.270> where

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
always kind of fun and this is where

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.180 
always kind of fun and this is where
you're<00:03:22.600> definitely<00:03:22.840> backing<00:03:23.560> up<00:03:23.680> on<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.860> same

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
you're definitely backing up on the same

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.320 
you're definitely backing up on the same
line<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.700> stitching<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.470> you're<00:03:26.590> just<00:03:26.860> making

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
line of stitching and you're just making

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.460 
line of stitching and you're just making
lines<00:03:28.330> that<00:03:28.720> cross<00:03:28.990> each<00:03:29.200> other

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.340 

of<00:03:32.800> course<00:03:33.070> when<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.340> do<00:03:33.490> them<00:03:33.580> with<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.730> same

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
of course when you do them with the same

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.820 
of course when you do them with the same
color<00:03:35.350> thread<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.610> can<00:03:36.820> really<00:03:37.180> see

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.600 

how<00:03:40.310> pretty<00:03:40.700> they<00:03:40.880> could<00:03:41.060> be<00:03:41.210> in<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.450> background

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
how pretty they could be in a background

00:03:43.610 --> 00:04:00.480 
how pretty they could be in a background
you<00:03:44.210> can<00:03:44.390> make<00:03:44.540> them<00:03:44.720> big<00:03:44.960> and<00:03:45.320> small

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.110 

or<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.880> one<00:04:01.090> in<00:04:01.120> right<00:04:01.450> here

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.410 

and<00:04:05.989> that's<00:04:06.230> snowflakes<00:04:06.830> very<00:04:07.250> simple<00:04:07.730> can<00:04:08.269> be

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
and that's snowflakes very simple can be

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.170 
and that's snowflakes very simple can be
done<00:04:08.599> really<00:04:08.989> close<00:04:09.200> together<00:04:09.379> big<00:04:10.010> small<00:04:10.459> the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
done really close together big small the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.800 
done really close together big small the
whole<00:04:11.360> nine<00:04:11.660> yards<00:04:12.910> another<00:04:13.910> thing<00:04:14.300> in<00:04:14.599> nature

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
whole nine yards another thing in nature

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.120 
whole nine yards another thing in nature
that's<00:04:15.290> never<00:04:15.530> alike<00:04:15.950> is<00:04:16.359> flowers<00:04:17.919> this<00:04:18.919> is

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
that's never alike is flowers this is

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.879 
that's never alike is flowers this is
how<00:04:19.280> I<00:04:19.310> make<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.299> make<00:04:20.470> flowers<00:04:21.470> that<00:04:21.620> look<00:04:21.739> kind

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
how I make I make flowers that look kind

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.310 
how I make I make flowers that look kind
of<00:04:21.979> like<00:04:22.100> daisies<00:04:22.699> I<00:04:22.970> make<00:04:23.360> one<00:04:23.600> petal<00:04:24.110> and

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
of like daisies I make one petal and

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.140 
of like daisies I make one petal and
then<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:24.560> make<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.949> center<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:25.699> then<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:25.910> have<00:04:26.120> a

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
then I make the center so then I have a

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.909 
then I make the center so then I have a
place<00:04:26.479> to<00:04:26.510> aim<00:04:26.840> for<00:04:26.870> with<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.500> rest<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.800> my

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
place to aim for with the rest of my

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.760 
place to aim for with the rest of my
petals<00:04:28.449> you<00:04:29.449> can<00:04:29.600> make<00:04:29.750> your<00:04:29.900> petals<00:04:30.290> short

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
petals you can make your petals short

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.360 
petals you can make your petals short
and<00:04:31.130> squatty<00:04:31.460> or<00:04:31.910> big<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.240> long<00:04:33.160> however<00:04:34.160> you

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
and squatty or big and long however you

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.879 
and squatty or big and long however you
want<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.699> make<00:04:34.880> them<00:04:35.320> just<00:04:36.320> fill<00:04:36.590> in<00:04:36.770> around

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
want to make them just fill in around

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.149 
want to make them just fill in around
that<00:04:37.250> Center

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:40.159 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.579 

there's<00:04:40.669> my<00:04:40.909> last<00:04:41.149> one<00:04:41.449> and<00:04:41.689> then<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.259> make<00:04:42.439> the

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:42.589 
there's my last one and then to make the

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:44.979 
there's my last one and then to make the
next<00:04:42.860> one<00:04:43.039> I'd<00:04:43.459> go<00:04:43.699> around<00:04:43.819> the<00:04:44.330> center<00:04:44.779> right

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:44.989 
next one I'd go around the center right

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:46.719 
next one I'd go around the center right
on<00:04:45.139> that<00:04:45.289> same<00:04:45.469> line<00:04:45.589> of<00:04:45.739> stitching<00:04:46.039> and<00:04:46.520> come

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
on that same line of stitching and come

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.329 
on that same line of stitching and come

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
so then you can do a leaf and then

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.010 
so then you can do a leaf and then
another<00:05:47.230> flower<00:05:47.700> and<00:05:48.700> just<00:05:49.060> continue<00:05:49.690> on
