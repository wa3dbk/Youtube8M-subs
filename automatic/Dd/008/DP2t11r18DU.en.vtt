about three in the morning not in the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.210 
about three in the morning not in the
evening<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.500> now<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:46.799> about<00:01:46.950> three<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.159> the

evening and now it's about three in the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.560 
evening and now it's about three in the
morning<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.700> morning<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:48.390> me<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.810> took<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
morning so morning for me I took it and

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.539 
morning so morning for me I took it and
and<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.409> I'm<00:01:52.500> still<00:01:52.740> being<00:01:52.890> pretty<00:01:53.009> good<00:01:53.189> good

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and so I'm still being pretty good good

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.999 
and so I'm still being pretty good good
I<00:01:53.820> guess<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.149> should<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.390> worn<00:01:54.600> off<00:01:54.659> by<00:01:54.869> now<00:01:55.009> 9

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
I guess it should have worn off by now 9

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.080 
I guess it should have worn off by now 9
10<00:01:56.549> 11<00:01:56.820> 12

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
10 11 12

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.569 
10 11 12
yeah<00:01:59.049> so<00:01:59.649> it<00:01:59.770> should<00:01:59.920> be<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.070> last<00:02:00.189> hours<00:02:00.549> of

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
yeah so it should be the last hours of

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.609 
yeah so it should be the last hours of
it<00:02:00.880> they're<00:02:01.869> still<00:02:02.049> feeling<00:02:02.289> pretty<00:02:02.380> good

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
it they're still feeling pretty good

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.859 
it they're still feeling pretty good
there<00:02:02.950> easing<00:02:03.399> not<00:02:03.579> as<00:02:03.729> much<00:02:03.909> as<00:02:04.240> they<00:02:04.630> were

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
there easing not as much as they were

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.590 
there easing not as much as they were
before<00:02:05.670> I'm<00:02:06.670> just<00:02:06.969> making<00:02:07.210> sure<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.359> keep

where<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.180> just<00:02:25.870> like<00:02:25.930> little<00:02:26.200> red<00:02:26.470> rings

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
where this is just like little red rings

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.839 
where this is just like little red rings
around<00:02:27.489> where<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.000> whole<00:02:28.629> thing<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.849> it's

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
around where the whole thing is and it's

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.710 
around where the whole thing is and it's
doing<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:31.299> both<00:02:31.420> sides<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:33.720> I'm

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
doing that on both sides and I'm

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.600 
doing that on both sides and I'm
thinking<00:02:35.349> this<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.769> from<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:36.010> piercing<00:02:36.459> and

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
thinking this just from the piercing and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.009 
thinking this just from the piercing and
the<00:02:36.700> irritated<00:02:37.150> skin<00:02:37.390> which<00:02:37.720> would<00:02:37.870> make

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
the irritated skin which would make

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.750 
the irritated skin which would make
sense<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:41.349> also<00:02:41.590> i<00:02:42.190> think<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:42.459> is<00:02:42.519> part

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
sense and it also i think this is part

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.800 
sense and it also i think this is part
of<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:42.910> swelling<00:02:43.390> but<00:02:44.200> it's<00:02:44.410> been<00:02:45.569> like<00:02:46.569> how

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
of the swelling but it's been like how

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.539 
of the swelling but it's been like how
you're<00:02:47.110> like<00:02:47.560> how<00:02:47.680> your<00:02:47.829> cheeks<00:02:48.099> are<00:02:48.280> really

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549

you're like how your cheeks are really
like<00:02:48.879> soft<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.510> whatnot<00:02:49.810> but<00:02:50.470> if<00:02:50.829> i<00:02:51.040> get<00:02:51.220> like

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.410 
like soft and whatnot but if i get like
really<00:02:51.549> close<00:02:51.819> probably<00:02:52.510> about<00:02:52.599> acura<00:02:53.260> sh

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
really close probably about acura sh

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.420 
really close probably about acura sh
about<00:02:55.420> here<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.170> not<00:02:56.349> like<00:02:56.470> directly<00:02:56.920> on<00:02:57.220> it

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
about here so not like directly on it

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.550 
about here so not like directly on it
but<00:02:57.760> close<00:02:59.280> its<00:03:00.280> kind<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.629> skins<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.380> lot

but close its kind of the skins a lot
more<00:03:02.769> hard<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.730> tough<00:03:04.650> i<00:03:06.660> think<00:03:07.660> that's<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.139> lot

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
more hard and tough i think that's a lot

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.170 
more hard and tough i think that's a lot
from<00:03:08.650> just<00:03:08.829> like<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.190> skin<00:03:09.519> trying<00:03:10.120> to

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
from just like the skin trying to

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.360 
from just like the skin trying to
protect<00:03:10.510> itself<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.500> all<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.959> as<00:03:14.769> as

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
protect itself and all that and as as

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.339 
protect itself and all that and as as
weeks<00:03:15.730> have<00:03:15.880> been<00:03:15.910> going<00:03:16.239> on<00:03:16.389> it's<00:03:16.720> been

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
weeks have been going on it's been

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.129 
weeks have been going on it's been
getting<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.709> smaller<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.280> small<00:03:18.549> area<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.450> of

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
getting a smaller in small area and of

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.750 
getting a smaller in small area and of
course<00:03:20.170> it's<00:03:20.500> not<00:03:20.680> just<00:03:20.980> that's<00:03:21.340> not<00:03:21.519> going<00:03:21.670> to

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
course it's not just that's not going to

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.339 
course it's not just that's not going to
completely<00:03:22.090> disappear<00:03:22.450> just<00:03:22.660> because<00:03:22.930> i<00:03:23.139> have

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
completely disappear just because i have

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.720 
completely disappear just because i have
a<00:03:23.380> metal<00:03:23.650> bar<00:03:23.829> going<00:03:24.099> through<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.459> which<00:03:24.609> is

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
a metal bar going through it which is

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.979 
a metal bar going through it which is
going<00:03:24.819> to<00:03:24.880> make<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.180> little<00:03:25.269> bit<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:25.959> know

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
going to make it a little bit you know

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.099 
going to make it a little bit you know
tough<00:03:27.180> it's<00:03:28.180> actually<00:03:28.299> since<00:03:28.690> if<00:03:28.930> it's

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
tough it's actually since if it's

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.599 
tough it's actually since if it's
creating<00:03:29.560> new<00:03:29.709> skin<00:03:30.099> right<00:03:30.340> here<00:03:30.790> then<00:03:32.609> then

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
creating new skin right here then then

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.460 
creating new skin right here then then
that<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.419> skins<00:03:34.750> obviously<00:03:35.169> going<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.319> be

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
that that skins obviously going to be

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.009 
that that skins obviously going to be
harder<00:03:35.769> than<00:03:35.799> stuff<00:03:36.489> that<00:03:37.180> does<00:03:37.389> have<00:03:37.720> like<00:03:37.989> a

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
harder than stuff that does have like a

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.819 
harder than stuff that does have like a
another<00:03:38.829> layer<00:03:39.160> going<00:03:39.579> through<00:03:40.680> just<00:03:41.680> like

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
another layer going through just like
