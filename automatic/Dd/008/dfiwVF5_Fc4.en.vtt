you know you can't stick this in your
printer<00:00:35.700> not<00:00:36.210> unless<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.510> want<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.719> remove<00:00:36.960> a

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
printer not unless you want to remove a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.709 
printer not unless you want to remove a
page<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.670> need<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.969> print<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.239> backwards

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
page so you need to print it backwards

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.590 
page so you need to print it backwards
and<00:00:40.100> I<00:00:41.100> tried<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.579> technique<00:00:41.910> earlier<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
and I tried this technique earlier and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.639 
and I tried this technique earlier and
it<00:00:42.690> worked<00:00:42.840> fine<00:00:43.110> when<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:43.469> practicing

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
it worked fine when I was practicing

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.619 
it worked fine when I was practicing
then<00:00:44.190> when<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.370> had<00:00:44.610> my<00:00:44.760> actual<00:00:45.120> journal<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.510> was

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
then when I had my actual journal I was

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.510 
then when I had my actual journal I was
working<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.260> completely<00:00:46.680> botched<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.280> um

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
working on I completely botched it um

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.010 
working on I completely botched it um
and<00:00:49.129> it<00:00:50.129> was<00:00:50.219> smudging<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.820> smearing<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and it was smudging and smearing and it

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
and it was smudging and smearing and it
was<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> nightmare<00:00:52.440> um<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> thought<00:00:54.059> I'd

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
was just a nightmare um so I thought I'd

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.580 
was just a nightmare um so I thought I'd
show<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.570> show<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.050> better<00:00:55.170> way<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
show you the show you a better way and

even see where it was going and I was
smearing<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.630> because<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.049> moving<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.500> me

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
smearing it because it was moving on me

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.450 
smearing it because it was moving on me
and<00:01:13.890> also<00:01:14.880> um<00:01:15.229> it<00:01:16.229> kind<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.680> starts<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> dry

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and also um it kind of starts to dry

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.219 
and also um it kind of starts to dry
after<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> while<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.479> plastic<00:01:18.900> sheet

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
after a while so with a plastic sheet

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.289 
after a while so with a plastic sheet
you've<00:01:19.439> got<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> much<00:01:19.950> longer<00:01:20.640> time<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.150> can

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you've got a much longer time you can

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.450 
you've got a much longer time you can
work<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.600> work<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.350> ink<00:01:22.590> or<00:01:22.830> leave<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.189> before

page if you want to use something you've

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.719 
page if you want to use something you've
printed<00:01:57.990> off<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.710> computer<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.490> they're

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
printed off the computer so they're

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.249 
printed off the computer so they're
quick<00:02:00.030> tip<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.570> when<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.869> print<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.170> you

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
quick tip so when you do print it you

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.469 
quick tip so when you do print it you
need<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.530> reverse<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.000> way<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.329> that

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
need to reverse it so the way to do that

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
need to reverse it so the way to do that
is<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.560> know<00:02:04.649> set<00:02:04.890> up<00:02:04.920> here<00:02:05.219> whatever<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
to print reverse instead of just

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.610 
to print reverse instead of just
clicking<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.480> little<00:02:12.599> print<00:02:12.930> icon

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
you kind of have to tell the computer to

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:36.770 
you kind of have to tell the computer to
do<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.910> it's<00:02:36.060> not<00:02:36.120> going<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.360> do<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.629> its

do that it's not going to do it on its
own<00:02:36.840> um<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.340> my<00:02:38.519> ink<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.180> um<00:02:39.569> is<00:02:40.640> still<00:02:41.640> left

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
own um so my ink is is um is still left

I could give it a little spritz of ink
and<00:02:48.140> actually<00:02:49.140> let<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> color<00:02:49.799> become<00:02:50.280> darker

shaper<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.660> can<00:03:21.900> fill<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.100> it's<00:03:23.250> not<00:03:23.370> so

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
shaper and I can fill in so it's not so

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.620 
shaper and I can fill in so it's not so
pixelated<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.450> smack<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:24.900> uh<00:03:26.450> what<00:03:27.450> should<00:03:27.480> I

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
pixelated so smack so uh what should I

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.900 
pixelated so smack so uh what should I
call<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.840> dotty<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.350> guess<00:03:28.650> but<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.549> know<00:03:29.819> it's

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
call it dotty I guess but you know it's

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.250 
call it dotty I guess but you know it's
just<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.090> kind<00:03:30.329> of<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.480> fun<00:03:30.660> technique<00:03:30.870> you're

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
just that kind of a fun technique you're

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.180 
just that kind of a fun technique you're
probably<00:03:31.470> not<00:03:31.650> going<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.829> get<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.040> most

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
probably not going to get the most

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.729 
probably not going to get the most
perfect<00:03:32.639> of<00:03:32.790> results<00:03:33.299> but<00:03:33.480> it's<00:03:34.230> um<00:03:34.530> it's

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
perfect of results but it's um it's

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.039 
perfect of results but it's um it's
artsy<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.340> fun<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:35.819> just<00:03:35.910> what<00:03:36.329> you<00:03:36.480> need<00:03:36.660> in

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
artsy and fun and just what you need in

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.839 
artsy and fun and just what you need in

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
your art journal so I messed up the

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.879 
your art journal so I messed up the
technique<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.389> my<00:03:39.540> big<00:03:39.870> long<00:03:40.049> mixed-media<00:03:40.560> fun

seconds<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.549> video<00:03:47.669> and<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.150> was<00:03:48.209> doing<00:03:48.389> the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
seconds of the video and I was doing the

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.909 
seconds of the video and I was doing the
this<00:03:48.900> technique<00:03:49.680> blast<00:03:49.919> and<00:03:50.280> um<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:52.590> it
