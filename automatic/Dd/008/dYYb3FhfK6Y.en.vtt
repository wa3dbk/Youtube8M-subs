00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.479
 What was the virus to do? 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.320

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.580
 T-shirt 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.619
 I do not believe we're going to bring a 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.720
 video of five minutes on 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.390
 empty plastics exactly the galley 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.400
 Looks may sound like bullshit but the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.500
 creator of this thing that was mine. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.299
 Felipe friend, take a hug for him. 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.659
 the creator then pay a little bit of the 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.729
 profit in the videos for him the creator of this 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.159
 He always came here and had a 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.619
 instead of being different from other 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.479
 he arrived and reached 200 r and 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.070
 everything you are doing there that you know 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.380
 often plenty of boat here then 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.659
 it is also normal to be quite can empty 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.009
 then he said I just tapping vial should 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.880
 or not then do the following all me 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.320
 Follow 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.140
 we will give all the support to the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.020
 electronic catalog and in season 3 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.299
 he brought three bbbs for each plane and 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.369
 he filled more than two dozen some 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.270
 thing then that money had a 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.560
 business 25 cas profit will tell me 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.390
 25 cases may not seem like much for 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.530
 who has home and one for the bank kaká 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.960
 who's in need of money to 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.420
 poor 25 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.220
 kaka is a big amount and that's it 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.810
 also another tip I say if you 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.210
 is someone who has some Cassa there 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.910
 friend costs nothing that I tell people 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.500
 that I learned to beg and in the little that 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.970
 I saw you do not endorse some 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.370
 I could already hook up a 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.500
 little more than three fighters was almost 4 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.120
 So that's why already 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.920
 paid on the weapon I just bought 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.320
 and a few more things 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.660
 this here comes with a pretty basic tip 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.430
 people that may seem like bullshit but 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.460
 I'm doing this every day, always on 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.950
 start it has and it is common you find thousand 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.590
 23 thousand trips it often one 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.940
 start the injury itself person who 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.380
 is hunting he always plays in the same 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.570
 place by custom 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.910
 then the tip line is a hint of the 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.980
 songs that we have brought from the channel 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.960

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.000
 we want to thank the staff of the 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.740
 portal tibia not long ago people 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.750
 came in contact and they 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.420

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.190
