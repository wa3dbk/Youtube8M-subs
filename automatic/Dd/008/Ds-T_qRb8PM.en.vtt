00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
other day I realized that these are

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.450 
other day I realized that these are
Ninja<00:05:18.600> Turtle<00:05:18.960> colors<00:05:19.350> and<00:05:19.680> that<00:05:19.950> was<00:05:20.100> that

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
Ninja Turtle colors and that was that

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.240 
Ninja Turtle colors and that was that
was<00:05:20.580> not<00:05:20.790> intentional<00:05:21.210> at<00:05:21.750> all<00:05:21.920> so<00:05:22.920> the<00:05:23.070> only

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
was not intentional at all so the only

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.960 
was not intentional at all so the only
challenge<00:05:23.580> I<00:05:23.850> had<00:05:24.090> make<00:05:24.840> enos<00:05:25.200> was<00:05:25.850> whether<00:05:26.850> or

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
challenge I had make enos was whether or

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.090 
challenge I had make enos was whether or
not<00:05:27.150> this<00:05:27.630> will<00:05:27.840> be<00:05:27.990> able<00:05:28.140> to<00:05:28.380> fit<00:05:28.650> him<00:05:28.830> because

not this will be able to fit him because

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.560 
not this will be able to fit him because
I<00:05:29.220> don't<00:05:29.400> know<00:05:29.490> his<00:05:29.640> wrist<00:05:29.910> measurement

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.230 
I don't know his wrist measurement

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.420 
I think this measured out to be eight
and<00:05:33.300> a<00:05:33.480> half<00:05:33.510> inches<00:05:33.960> it's<00:05:34.440> big<00:05:34.740> on<00:05:34.890> me<00:05:35.100> so
