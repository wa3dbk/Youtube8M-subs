00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.620
 you get the walking point felix as 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:09.200
 their is a packet 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:12.560
 a package only one can recognize and 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.850
 package has just a few pages and here 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:23.180
 a number for each passes and here 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:24.200
 something like every package 612 and in 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.910
 think again 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.160
 Welcome to a new unboxing 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.210
 the channel akw crumbs 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.760
 I have a package out today 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.040
 japan in hand and yes I have that 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.020
 ordered what we already see a title 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.899
 but I hope that it is in there because 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.640
 It is from the shop from Japan 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.980
 who speaks a Japanese and over 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.140
 a certain communication page called 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.690
 Rakuten one can just about Japanese 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.010
 order shops and that was on offer 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.829
 I thought that worried times 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.680
 and hope that the right one in there 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.170
 and here you can see the compelling that it 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.420
 someone wrote what she did 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.579
 definitely can not expect and does 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.109
 Just let me know 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:09.679
 said do not guarantee that that 

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:11.709
 is that I hope we look something 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:16.789
 let's do that too 

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:21.709
 The whole thing got away believably 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:23.240
 look where all the stuff comes from 

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:25.779
 because I have to go up here now 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.779
 cut through 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:42.590
 so fine media shop so here must 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.580
 I read through quickly 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.740
 actually should have started there sent 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.800
 It should be and what it is the song too 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.690
 and now we come to what it is 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.149
 should be and what is share but is 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.909
 namely the model of premium package 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.759
 in the first edition I think that was 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.020
 It was the first issue that came out for 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.899
 the pc that is actually very much 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.720
 limited very limited on ebay costs 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.620
 The 200 Euro I have it 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.390
 get a little cheaper and that is 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.620
 premium package from forward bonn that is 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.160
 I have to be a bit more spectacular 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.959
 say as the place of before before 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.610
 Here you can see the bonuses unfortunately apply 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.350
 Boni no longer because the short expired 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.970
 are therefore also so cheap japan 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.069
 but is in europe and germany 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.340
 it's just as expensive as it gets 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:37.590
 because you want the beautiful in the figure 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.000
 shelf and then we get 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.860
 sometimes the figure is actually that 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.790
 what it's about and that's the little one 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.079
 fine figure 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.079
 that's the blue one 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.049
 that's the blue name of monster 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.859
 by t-online as a figure called demetri 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:21.640
 I believe her and that's what 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:26.319
 it goes in the package and yes and then 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.989
 still comes the air and that 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.159
 package but that looks just similar 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.159
 like that of an example 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.349
 and that is the formula one package 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.139
 as well as the disc packaging as from four 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.870
 won and now I can too 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:49.120
 still on 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.919
 Here is the instructions 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.950
 is again a great guide from 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.139
 monster from t-online we all read 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.480
 can 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:02.579
 not really that's cool 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:07.030
 Laying here I look quickly to the 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:10.439
 So the codes are among others the 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.439
 kos that unfortunately already expired 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.560
 So I really have for the sport day 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:22.060
 got I must say costs 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:25.539
 It's actually a whole four euros or me 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.909
 5 euro with shipping continued tms shipping 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.380
 from japan speaks the cheapest and here 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:30.430
 It looks good, they need it too 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.580
 Not necessarily I have already got it 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.810
 installed but unboxing what 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.030

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.280
 japan what I'm in the chair actually 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.870
 that it still exists because it is in 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.830
 Germany actually pretty expensive 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:48.639
 will be on ebay or in ca 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.240
