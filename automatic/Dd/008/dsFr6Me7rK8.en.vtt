00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 it happened kursk well official 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.230
 the version is such that there will start a torpedo 65 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.940
 76 to she exploded and because of this 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.920
 I would detonate the ammunition 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.840
 I will tell right away I do not know what is there 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.760
 happened but i'm sure that's what 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.080
 it is written that they presented it to us 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.930
 still hardly can according 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.670
 reality torpedo 576 k I with 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.849
 these torpedo retreated 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.329
 33 afton petri combat services one under 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.370
 ice on the north pole one in the atlantic to 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.620
 the shores of the united states one 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.719
 Mediterranean Sea 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.660
 they were submarine ammunition 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.920
 boats 671 different project this 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.690
 torpedoes and where one of the elements of fuel 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.449
 are hydrogen peroxide peroxide 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.750
 hydrogen it is not stable it all the time 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.579
 decomposes and therefore they stand on such 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.260
 they are by the way very simple 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.350
 primitive priborychiki there roughly speaking 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.579
 such liquid containers and bubbles 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.110
 running decomposes hydrogen peroxide 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.150
 bubbles run and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.310
 sailor he must be approaching time from 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.320
 time afraid and take a minute there before 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.770
 10 bubbles normally there attributed there 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.390
 up to 30 is already bad if there are more than 50 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.950
 bubbles minute I conditionally of course 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.280
 called need to have an emergency 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.840
 Bleed produce so here it is 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.360
 hydrogen peroxide it is aggressive 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.390
 of course very but nonetheless she is not 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.290
 explodes in principle it can create 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.030
 voluminous fire but explosions of explosion are not 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.100
 maybe it is firstly secondly there 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.500
 as far as i know as far as i remember i already 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.259
 I have not reread this one for a long time 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.770
 hit in all things open print by 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.930
 on course there they mean they said that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.840
 through some microcracks 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.730
 it's hydrogen peroxide inside the torpedo 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.290
 flowed somewhere I think it is not 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.010
 unreal here i have my own version 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.030
 it was connected in general it was of course 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.410
 most likely it seems to me 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.610
 collision with an american submarine 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.200
 the boat than the collision was this kind 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.330
 a piece pop up on a communication session when 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.210
 surfing on a session on naturally 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.450
 trim on feed the Americans the other way around 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.440
 dives and american boat which 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.680
 there was less kursk 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.960
 but she hit him just with a keel edge 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:26.560
 stiffness when immersed and she hit 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.250
 his nose i don't know how to pieces exactly a 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.290
 Here on 7 in 1 in this project there just 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.850
 situated 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.930
 Group commander air bottles 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.380
 high pressure air 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.820
 this is a reserve group there are cylinders 400 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.130
 atmospheres pressure and if by them strongly 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.370
 will hit just this first explosion which 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.140
 its power was also recorded 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.850
 equivalent to about 100 kilograms there 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.500
 TNT 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.780
 here this explosion occurred 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.670
 depressurization of the body went water water 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.850
 matches trim submarine 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.980
 acquired on us the rudders will work 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.340
 trim didn't work out possible 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.930
 jammed more and screw and 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.640
 this weather the boat began to sink 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.760
 primer and there as far as i know in 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.430
 Barents Sea they are quite tough and 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.900
 here imagine 14 thousand tons 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.330
 displacement here is this giant 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.450
 giant submarine she's like 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.489
 roller coaster like an express it stuck in the bottom 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.350
 and as a result of this detonation occurred 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.330
 ammunition but this is what's in my head 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.180
 Come understand 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:38.500
 It was not necessarily so, but the whole 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.140
 this story with the fact that it exploded 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.290
 torpedo 576 k thick so -called 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.220
 torpedoes 65 centimeters in diameter she 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.989
 It seems unlikely thanks 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.960
 but maybe someday we will find out 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.400
 the truth continue to answer questions 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.020
 simplify bar hotel before also 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.960
 unlikely not imagine the fact 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.650
 that the Americans shot at her and stuff 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.660
 other other 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.970
 sometimes ours is very naive 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.000
 viewers give overly trusting here 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.740
 walked on the network picture where to take 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.420
 body 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.320
 Kursk when he was raised suddenly put 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.450
 and there you can see such semicircles 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.750
 inward indented holes this 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.489
 instead of entering torpedoes 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.440
 On guys if here entered torpedo she 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.440
 there inside blew all the opposite should 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.060
 turned out to be outside understand that is 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.930
 but you need to approach with a certain share 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.760
 criticism 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.760
 because we read networks
