so I go to 8c I get on the phone with

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.270 
so I go to 8c I get on the phone with
someone<00:01:55.079> from<00:01:55.229> them<00:01:55.409> they<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.710> me<00:01:55.890> send<00:01:56.159> out

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
someone from them they have me send out

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.490 
someone from them they have me send out
this<00:01:56.460> whole<00:01:56.820> list<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.299> reports<00:01:57.780> which<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.259> did

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
this whole list of reports which I did

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.819 
this whole list of reports which I did
and<00:01:59.540> things<00:02:00.540> still<00:02:00.780> freezing<00:02:01.200> thing<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.619> still

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
and things still freezing thing is still

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.670 
and things still freezing thing is still
freezing<00:02:02.100> thing<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.579> still<00:02:02.759> freezing<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.350> I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
freezing thing is still freezing so I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.910 
freezing thing is still freezing so I
had<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.640> do<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.880> anyway<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.420> am<00:02:07.200> reinstalling

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
had to do this anyway I am reinstalling

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.490 
had to do this anyway I am reinstalling
Windows<00:02:08.099> 7<00:02:08.810> hopefully<00:02:09.810> maybe<00:02:10.050> had<00:02:10.319> something

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
Windows 7 hopefully maybe had something

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.530 
Windows 7 hopefully maybe had something
to<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.860> uninstalled<00:02:11.670> my

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
to do that uninstalled my

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.869 
to do that uninstalled my
in<00:02:12.959> video<00:02:13.200> drivers<00:02:13.769> and<00:02:14.099> how<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.250> install<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.640> TI

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
in video drivers and how to install a TI

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.720 
in video drivers and how to install a TI
drivers<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.629> doubt<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.890> really<00:02:17.459> don't<00:02:17.580> think

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
drivers I doubt it I really don't think

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.600 
drivers I doubt it I really don't think
so<00:02:18.230> from<00:02:19.230> what<00:02:19.409> I'm<00:02:19.500> seeing<00:02:19.530> when<00:02:20.400> I've<00:02:20.489> been

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
so from what I'm seeing when I've been

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.000 
so from what I'm seeing when I've been
reading<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:20.909> forms<00:02:21.299> at<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.569> 7<00:02:21.959> thing<00:02:22.200> car

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
reading it forms at the 7 thing car

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.030 
reading it forms at the 7 thing car
doesn't<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.430> 7<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.810> no<00:02:25.200> there's<00:02:25.530> some<00:02:25.739> you

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
doesn't like 7 it's no there's some you

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.949 
doesn't like 7 it's no there's some you
