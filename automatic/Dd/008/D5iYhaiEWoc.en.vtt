00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.789
 this tutorial video will teach you to apply the thermal paste on the processor 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:17.639
 this folder will be between the heat sink of the college and a processor 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.409
 and serves to increase the adhesion between them 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.409
 so the processor is cooled more efficiently 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.539
 it is recommended that you change your pass whenever you remove the CPU cooler to 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.249
 ensure adhesion 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.670
 it is also necessary to change it according to the manufacturer's instructions 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.030
 each folder has its own useful life 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.500
 before beginning pay attention to some safety tips 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.830
 be careful when handling the thermal grease 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.320
 never put in mouth contact 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.320
 Also avoid leaving it close to children or animals. 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.750
 besides the thermal paste you will need hawks the one 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.050
 ex-boss of plastic swabs the year maciel and toilet paper 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.670
 removing the processor also requires careful 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 loss 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.940
 a and then take the carefully by the edges 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.570
 you must first remove the thermal paste that is in the processor or in the 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.620
 severed 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.970
 them to carefully scrape the surface of the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.370
 use a wet cotton swab with a bad one because the deco itself to remove what 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.370
 subtract 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.350
 then 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.409
 wipe the cotton cloth moistened with alcohol 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 yea 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.370
 when applying the new folder 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.530
 pay attention to quantity 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.620
 you do not need to spend too much 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.770
 excess paste impaired closure rather than helping a 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.010
 gout should be sufficient 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.320
 spread with the spatula so that the layer made is 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.640
 with a sheet of paper 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.619
 it is not necessary to cover the entire upper part of the processor 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.619
 the most important local center 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:20.529
 who decides processor always paying attention to the correct fittings 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:30.209
 be sure to connect the basic component fan to the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.529
 cooling 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.139
 this was another video tutorial of the bajaki 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:34.950
