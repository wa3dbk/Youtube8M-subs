other<00:01:30.840> things<00:01:32.060> requirements<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.270> was

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
other things requirements and it was

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.719 
other things requirements and it was
good<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.570> go<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> pop<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.350> my<00:01:34.409> Igla<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.610> was

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
good to go so I pop on my Igla and I was

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.770 
good to go so I pop on my Igla and I was
looking<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.119> targets<00:01:36.450> that's<00:01:36.570> basically

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
looking for targets that's basically

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.270

what I did I just jumped in a map and I
looked<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.579> targets<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> go<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> see

looked for targets in there I go I see
one<00:01:39.990> yay

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
one yay

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.980 
one yay
IG<00:01:41.100> la<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.460> cool<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> fire<00:01:42.720> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
IG la is cool because it's the fire and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530 
IG la is cool because it's the fire and
hold<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.130> maintain<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> lock<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.299> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
hold so if you maintain a lock on it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.030 
hold so if you maintain a lock on it
you'll<00:01:45.899> get<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.770> actually

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you'll get it and you can actually

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.060 
you'll get it and you can actually
bypass<00:01:47.250> stuff<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:49.170> flares<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:49.890> comes

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
bypass stuff to the flares so here comes

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.310 
bypass stuff to the flares so here comes
this<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.369> right<00:01:50.520> here<00:01:50.729> boom<00:01:51.140> here<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
this one right here boom here it is

this one right here boom here it is
vehicle<00:01:53.009> hit<00:01:53.159> give<00:01:53.460> weight<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.149> then<00:01:54.329> boom

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
vehicle hit give weight and then boom

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.969 
vehicle hit give weight and then boom
and<00:01:54.720> crash<00:01:54.750> boom<00:01:55.320> alright<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.680> there<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:55.829> go

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
and crash boom alright so there we go

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.980 
and crash boom alright so there we go
keeps<00:01:56.250> inward<00:01:56.520> boom<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.909> there<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.689> make<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
keeps inward boom and there it is make a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.649 
keeps inward boom and there it is make a
dent<00:01:58.290> got<00:01:58.710> make<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> dent<00:01:59.430> alright<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.509> also

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
that so I completed the assignment and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.589 
that so I completed the assignment and
then<00:02:08.099> once<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.610> completed<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> assignment<00:02:09.390> I

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
then once I completed the assignment I

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.390 
then once I completed the assignment I
picked<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.200> mp7<00:02:10.500> there<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.129> is

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
picked up the mp7 there it is

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.830 
picked up the mp7 there it is
alright<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.629> that's<00:02:13.050> basic

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
alright so that's basic

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.750 
alright so that's basic
all<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.170> have<00:02:14.349> to<00:02:14.379> do<00:02:14.739> it's<00:02:15.129> really<00:02:15.489> simple

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
all you have to do it's really simple

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.970 
all you have to do it's really simple
it's<00:02:16.120> really<00:02:16.180> simple<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:16.840> yeah<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.019> suggest<00:02:17.860> I

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
it's really simple so yeah I suggest I

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.320 
it's really simple so yeah I suggest I
mean<00:02:18.099> this<00:02:18.190> thing<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.580> fire-and-forget<00:02:19.000> but

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
mean this thing is a fire-and-forget but

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.940 
mean this thing is a fire-and-forget but
it's<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.510> short-range<00:02:19.900> one<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.319> Igla<00:02:20.739> has<00:02:20.920> a

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
it's a short-range one the Igla has a

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.979 
it's a short-range one the Igla has a
pretty<00:02:21.190> good<00:02:21.340> range<00:02:21.459> on<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.849> so<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.269> suggest

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
pretty good range on it so I suggest

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.300 
pretty good range on it so I suggest
using<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.379> one<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:23.769> especially<00:02:24.010> on

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
using that one and just especially on

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.160 
using that one and just especially on
helicopters<00:02:24.879> is<00:02:25.060> easy<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.569> hold<00:02:25.810> because<00:02:25.989> they

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
helicopters is easy to hold because they

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.160 
helicopters is easy to hold because they
mostly<00:02:26.500> hover<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.459> pick<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.670> map<00:02:27.940> that's<00:02:28.120> got<00:02:28.390> a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
mostly hover so pick a map that's got a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.320 
mostly hover so pick a map that's got a
lot<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.190> know<00:02:30.310> it's<00:02:30.489> got<00:02:30.640> air<00:02:30.760> vehicles<00:02:31.180> in

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
lot of you know it's got air vehicles in

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.089 
lot of you know it's got air vehicles in
a<00:02:31.420> wide-open<00:02:31.870> map<00:02:32.200> like<00:02:32.379> this<00:02:32.590> like<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:32.920> is

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
a wide-open map like this like this is

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.530 
a wide-open map like this like this is
dragon<00:02:33.430> pass<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.819> is<00:02:33.970> chen<00:02:34.150> rising

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
dragon pass this is chen rising

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.570 
dragon pass this is chen rising
obviously<00:02:34.959> so<00:02:35.830> picking<00:02:36.069> off<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.250> map<00:02:36.400> like

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
obviously so picking off the map like

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.100 
obviously so picking off the map like
that<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.879> just<00:02:36.910> hang<00:02:37.120> out<00:02:37.299> whatever<00:02:37.780> who

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
that and just hang out whatever who

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.680 
that and just hang out whatever who
cares<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.560> know<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:40.060> as<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.330> can<00:02:40.450> see<00:02:40.510> them

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
cares you know so as you can see them

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.530 
cares you know so as you can see them
using<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:40.989> mp7<00:02:41.290> here<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.069> I<00:02:42.730> got<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:42.940> kill<00:02:43.209> just
