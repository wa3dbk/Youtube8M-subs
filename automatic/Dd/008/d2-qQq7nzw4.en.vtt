comm d50 500 we just did the unboxing
and<00:00:05.670> initial<00:00:06.210> impressions<00:00:06.720> on<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:07.020> which<00:00:07.560> was

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
and initial impressions on it which was

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.259 
and initial impressions on it which was
quite<00:00:07.799> favorable<00:00:08.309> I'm<00:00:08.519> excited<00:00:09.150> especially

quite favorable I'm excited especially

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.650 
quite favorable I'm excited especially
about<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.900> touchscreen<00:00:10.280> but<00:00:11.280> um<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:12.389> made<00:00:12.570> me

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
about the touchscreen but um it made me

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.030 
about the touchscreen but um it made me
realize<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.110> wasn't<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.679> couldn't<00:00:13.920> remember

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
realize I wasn't I couldn't remember

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.730 
realize I wasn't I couldn't remember
exactly<00:00:14.240> what<00:00:15.240> all<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.480> differences<00:00:16.320> were<00:00:16.560> on

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
exactly what all the differences were on

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.769 
exactly what all the differences were on
the<00:00:16.830> d50<00:00:17.250> 5<00:00:17.460> from<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.789> d50<00:00:18.180> 3<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:18.539> I'm<00:00:18.630> just

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
the d50 5 from the d50 3 so I'm just

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.970 
the d50 5 from the d50 3 so I'm just
going<00:00:18.930> over<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> spec<00:00:19.410> sheet<00:00:19.590> here<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> got

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
going over the spec sheet here and I got

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.880 
going over the spec sheet here and I got
9<00:00:20.510> fairly<00:00:21.510> significant<00:00:22.140> ones<00:00:22.320> ones<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.800> at

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
9 fairly significant ones ones that at

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.170 
9 fairly significant ones ones that at
least<00:00:23.039> popped<00:00:23.310> out<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.640> me<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.880> could<00:00:24.029> see

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
least popped out to me that I could see

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.970 
least popped out to me that I could see
are<00:00:24.269> different<00:00:24.420> we've<00:00:25.170> got<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> ISO

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
are different we've got the ISO

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.359 
are different we've got the ISO
sensitivity<00:00:26.220> expanded<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.390> native<00:00:28.369> 25600

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
sensitivity expanded to native 25600

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.370 
sensitivity expanded to native 25600
used<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> boost<00:00:30.150> was<00:00:30.420> high<00:00:30.570> one<00:00:30.869> so

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
used to be in a boost was high one so

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.560 
used to be in a boost was high one so
whether<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.710> ends<00:00:32.550> up<00:00:32.610> being<00:00:32.850> better<00:00:33.270> higher

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
whether that ends up being better higher

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.150 
whether that ends up being better higher
so<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.260> remains<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.680> seen<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:34.950> we'll

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
so that remains to be seen but we'll

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.400 
so that remains to be seen but we'll
check<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.430> out<00:00:35.760> touch<00:00:36.690> screen<00:00:36.989> controls

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
check that out touch screen controls

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.709 
check that out touch screen controls
that's<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> huge<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> 5500<00:00:39.450> why<00:00:39.570> I'm

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
that's the huge one in the 5500 why I'm

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.200 
that's the huge one in the 5500 why I'm
really<00:00:39.989> excited<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.430> how<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.730> works

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
really excited to see how this works

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.510 
really excited to see how this works
and<00:00:43.020> then<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> touch<00:00:43.620> screen<00:00:43.860> functions<00:00:44.399> that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and then the touch screen functions that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.430 
and then the touch screen functions that
are<00:00:44.670> available<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.450> all<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
are available with that all the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.900 
are available with that all the
different<00:00:46.530> things<00:00:46.739> menu<00:00:47.309> navigation

AF<00:00:50.760> point-and-shoot<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.660> that's<00:00:51.840> should<00:00:52.379> be

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
AF point-and-shoot so that's should be

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.720 
AF point-and-shoot so that's should be
where<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.770> touch<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> screen<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.670> it

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
where you touch on the screen and it

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.250 
where you touch on the screen and it
fires<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.180> shot<00:00:54.420> from<00:00:54.600> where<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.870> focused

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
fires the shot from where you focused

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.900 
fires the shot from where you focused
and<00:00:55.379> shouldn't<00:00:55.559> fire<00:00:55.800> which<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.250> really<00:00:56.730> cool

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
and shouldn't fire which is really cool

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.360 
and shouldn't fire which is really cool
I've<00:00:57.149> used<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> Panasonic's<00:00:58.370> let's

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
I've used it on the Panasonic's let's

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.709 
I've used it on the Panasonic's let's
see<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.699> else<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.000> got<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.570> that's

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
see what else we got here so that's

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.180 
see what else we got here so that's
three<00:01:01.020> things<00:01:01.289> while<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> touch<00:01:01.890> screens

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
three things while the touch screens

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.280 
three things while the touch screens
kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.489> tube<00:01:02.640> or<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.780> we'll<00:01:03.930> count<00:01:04.170> that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
kind of tube or one but we'll count that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.190 
kind of tube or one but we'll count that
as<00:01:04.530> 2<00:01:04.830> then<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.060> tucked<00:01:06.299> touch<00:01:06.600> function

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
as 2 then the tucked touch function

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.170 
as 2 then the tucked touch function

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
you could turn on the auto bracketing

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.710 
you could turn on the auto bracketing
aperture<00:01:14.760> all<00:01:14.909> these<00:01:15.090> things<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:15.540> done

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
aperture all these things can be done

from the touch screen on the back which

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.490 
from the touch screen on the back which
is<00:01:17.280> really<00:01:17.850> cool<00:01:18.119> especially<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> body<00:01:18.960> we

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
is really cool especially on a body we

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.160 
is really cool especially on a body we
don't<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> dual<00:01:20.600> command<00:01:21.600> dials<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.990> call

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
don't have the dual command dials I call

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.210 
don't have the dual command dials I call
them<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.619> don't<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.070> for

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
them but you know you don't have one for

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.859 
them but you know you don't have one for
shutter<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.000> aperture<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.750> do

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
shutter and one for aperture like you do

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.030 
shutter and one for aperture like you do

it has that 53 did not so I'll be

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.760 
it has that 53 did not so I'll be
interesting<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.530> more<00:01:43.710> of

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
interesting to see what that is more of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.340 
interesting to see what that is more of
a<00:01:43.829> video<00:01:44.130> feature<00:01:44.399> obviously<00:01:44.700> but

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
a video feature obviously but

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.319 
a video feature obviously but
interesting<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> see<00:01:46.649> how<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.979> works<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.850> what

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
interesting to see how it works and what

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.760 
interesting to see how it works and what
it<00:01:48.390> gives<00:01:48.600> us

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it gives us

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.429 
it gives us

that is I'm gonna have to look into that
but<00:01:59.729> sounds<00:02:00.149> interesting<00:02:00.390> I'm<00:02:00.750> always

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
on the LCD screen so we'll check that

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.850 
on the LCD screen so we'll check that
out<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.310> let<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.579> know<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:06.659> battery<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
14a but the 5300 was rated for 600

14a but the 5300 was rated for 600
shots<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.129> is<00:02:14.190> rated<00:02:14.610> for<00:02:14.760> 820<00:02:16.159> you<00:02:17.159> know

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
shots this is rated for 820 you know

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.580 
shots this is rated for 820 you know
they're<00:02:17.970> they're<00:02:18.330> usually<00:02:18.540> if<00:02:18.900> they've

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
they're they're usually if they've

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.680 
they're they're usually if they've
tweaked<00:02:20.129> it<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.340> be<00:02:20.700> lower<00:02:20.940> power<00:02:21.239> consumption

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
tweaked it to be lower power consumption

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.839 
tweaked it to be lower power consumption
it<00:02:22.230> usually<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.739> true<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.159> usually<00:02:23.190> works<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
it usually is true it usually works I

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.850 
it usually is true it usually works I
you<00:02:24.420> know<00:02:24.540> it's<00:02:24.780> not<00:02:24.930> may<00:02:25.080> not<00:02:25.110> we<00:02:25.379> may<00:02:25.500> not<00:02:25.680> get

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
you know it's not may not we may not get

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.180 
you know it's not may not we may not get
the<00:02:25.980> full<00:02:27.379> 820<00:02:28.379> but<00:02:28.560> then<00:02:28.680> we<00:02:28.769> may<00:02:28.890> not<00:02:29.040> have

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
the full 820 but then we may not have

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.800 
the full 820 but then we may not have
also<00:02:29.340> got<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.640> full<00:02:29.819> 600<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.480> guess<00:02:30.659> what

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
also got the full 600 so I guess what

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.569 
also got the full 600 so I guess what
I'm<00:02:30.870> saying<00:02:31.110> there<00:02:31.319> is<00:02:31.409> the<00:02:31.799> percentage<00:02:32.340> that

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
I'm saying there is the percentage that

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.520 
I'm saying there is the percentage that
they're<00:02:32.730> saying<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.239> better<00:02:33.510> between<00:02:33.780> 600<00:02:34.500> and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
they're saying is better between 600 and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.470 
they're saying is better between 600 and
820<00:02:35.069> we<00:02:35.190> should<00:02:35.370> kind<00:02:35.579> of<00:02:35.640> see<00:02:35.849> that<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.239> our

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
820 we should kind of see that in our

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.250 
820 we should kind of see that in our
operations<00:02:37.140> regardless<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:37.980> what<00:02:38.129> we<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:39.260> and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
operations regardless of what we get and

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.490 
operations regardless of what we get and
wait<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.860> down<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.340> 420<00:02:42.030> from<00:02:42.420> 480<00:02:43.049> so<00:02:43.349> that's

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
wait it's down to 420 from 480 so that's

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.430 
wait it's down to 420 from 480 so that's
a<00:02:43.590> fairly<00:02:43.920> significant<00:02:44.700> reduction<00:02:45.440> fourteen

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
a fairly significant reduction fourteen

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.770 
a fairly significant reduction fourteen
point<00:02:46.920> eight<00:02:47.099> ounces<00:02:47.609> versus<00:02:48.120> sixteen<00:02:48.599> point

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
point eight ounces versus sixteen point

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.539 
point eight ounces versus sixteen point
nine<00:02:48.840> three<00:02:48.959> but<00:02:49.620> when<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:49.769> look<00:02:49.920> at<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.099> 420

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
nine three but when you look at is 420

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.050 
nine three but when you look at is 420
grams<00:02:50.700> versus<00:02:51.450> 480<00:02:51.810> grams<00:02:52.280> ones<00:02:53.280> over<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> pound

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
grams versus 480 grams ones over a pound

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.759 
grams versus 480 grams ones over a pound
and<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.299> others<00:02:54.450> under<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.810> pound<00:02:55.079> uh<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.680> know

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
and the others under a pound uh you know

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.250 
and the others under a pound uh you know
sixty<00:02:56.190> grams<00:02:56.400> there<00:02:56.760> it's<00:02:57.420> it's<00:02:57.690> enough<00:02:57.959> when

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
sixty grams there it's it's enough when

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.660 
sixty grams there it's it's enough when
you're<00:02:58.379> talking<00:02:58.620> small<00:02:58.920> light<00:02:59.129> bodies<00:02:59.489> like

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
you're talking small light bodies like

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.300 
you're talking small light bodies like
this<00:02:59.849> so<00:03:00.390> those<00:03:00.480> are<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.659> nine<00:03:00.959> things<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:02.280> I

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
this so those are the nine things that I

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.880 
this so those are the nine things that I
see<00:03:02.640> as<00:03:02.760> different<00:03:03.450> between<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.079> D<00:03:04.200> 55<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.799> D

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
see as different between the D 55 and D

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.770 
see as different between the D 55 and D
5300<00:03:05.640> I've<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.790> missed<00:03:06.030> something<00:03:06.239> guys<00:03:06.480> let<00:03:06.750> me

interested to see about the image
quality<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.349> touchscreen<00:03:22.769> for<00:03:22.919> me<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.130> a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
quality so the touchscreen for me is a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.009 
quality so the touchscreen for me is a
biggie<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:23.669> those<00:03:23.790> are<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:23.970> nine<00:03:24.419> things<00:03:24.780> in

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
biggie but those are the nine things in

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.870 
biggie but those are the nine things in
total<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.530> kind<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.220> pulled<00:03:26.430> out<00:03:26.579> of<00:03:26.609> here

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
total that I kind of pulled out of here

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.879 
total that I kind of pulled out of here
and<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.540> know<00:03:27.660> two<00:03:28.290> or<00:03:28.319> three<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.680> them<00:03:28.799> I

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
and you know two or three of them I

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.619 
and you know two or three of them I
guess<00:03:29.040> were<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.459> do<00:03:29.609> with<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.849> touchscreen<00:03:30.389> so

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
guess were to do with the touchscreen so

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.390 
guess were to do with the touchscreen so
might<00:03:31.049> be<00:03:31.200> six<00:03:31.410> or<00:03:31.530> seven<00:03:31.859> if<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.040> look<00:03:32.190> at<00:03:32.280> it

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
might be six or seven if you look at it

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.699 
might be six or seven if you look at it
that<00:03:32.519> way<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:33.120> any<00:03:33.329> case<00:03:33.599> as<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:34.290> said<00:03:34.319> if<00:03:34.590> I've

that way in any case as I said if I've

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.740 
that way in any case as I said if I've
missed<00:03:34.859> something<00:03:35.129> leave<00:03:35.579> it<00:03:35.730> below<00:03:35.879> if<00:03:36.660> you
