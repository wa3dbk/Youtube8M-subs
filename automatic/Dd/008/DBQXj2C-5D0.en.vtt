00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
candle holder is secure onto the plate

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.319 
candle holder is secure onto the plate
you<00:03:41.650> can<00:03:41.830> apply<00:03:42.099> your<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> second<00:03:42.670> layer<00:03:42.819> by

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
you can apply your a second layer by

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.890 
you can apply your a second layer by
adding<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.610> super<00:03:45.610> glue<00:03:45.819> to<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.090> top<00:03:46.390> here

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
adding the super glue to the top here

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.780 
adding the super glue to the top here
you<00:03:47.079> don't<00:03:47.769> want<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.040> add<00:03:48.129> it<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.549> bottom

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
to Center on to the candle holder so

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.270 
to Center on to the candle holder so
just<00:03:55.180> apply<00:03:55.480> another<00:03:55.780> layer<00:03:55.870> of<00:03:56.079> superglue<00:03:56.950> to

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
just apply another layer of superglue to

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.110 
just apply another layer of superglue to
the<00:03:57.640> top<00:03:58.859> now<00:03:59.859> the<00:03:59.920> glue<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:00.489> dry<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:00.760> should
