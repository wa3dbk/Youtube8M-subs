00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.950 
them the next thing you want to do after
the<00:00:20.730> batteries<00:00:21.090> out<00:00:21.270> we're<00:00:21.510> starting<00:00:21.869> to

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the batteries out we're starting to

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.200 
the batteries out we're starting to
immobilize<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.830> vehicle<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.760> want<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> go<00:00:24.090> up

immobilize the vehicle you want to go up

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.859 
immobilize the vehicle you want to go up
under<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.779> there's<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.740> plastic<00:00:26.400> shroud<00:00:27.300> here

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
under here there's a plastic shroud here

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.560 
under here there's a plastic shroud here
and<00:00:28.289> basically<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.250> pan<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:30.029> protects

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
and basically it's a pan that protects

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.840 
and basically it's a pan that protects
as<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.929> drive<00:00:31.309> underneath<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.460> engine

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
as you drive underneath the engine

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.040 
as you drive underneath the engine
you're<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.180> want<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> take<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.780> pan

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
you're going to want to take that pan

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.740 
you're going to want to take that pan
off<00:00:34.320> okay<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.370> two<00:00:35.940> bolts<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.450> front

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
off okay this one two bolts in the front

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840 
off okay this one two bolts in the front
and<00:00:36.960> there's<00:00:37.440> wampum<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> side<00:00:38.550> on

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
and there's wampum this on the side on

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.950 
and there's wampum this on the side on
the<00:00:39.000> other<00:00:39.120> side<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:39.660> there's<00:00:39.840> like

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the other side and then there's like

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.290 
the other side and then there's like
four<00:00:40.260> around<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> back<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.160> then<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:42.059> clips

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
four around the back and then it clips

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.610 
four around the back and then it clips
on<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> front<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.020> want<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> take<00:00:43.440> this

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
on to the front you want to take this

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.229 
on to the front you want to take this
pan<00:00:43.920> off<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.059> your<00:00:45.149> next

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
pan off that's going to be your next

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.549 
pan off that's going to be your next
step<00:00:50.719> is<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.989> want<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.170> drain<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
step is going to want to drain the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.200 
step is going to want to drain the
coolant<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.670> how<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.820> drain<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
coolant now this is how you drain the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.389 
coolant now this is how you drain the
coolant<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.750> 240<00:00:55.320> look<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> lower

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
coolant in a 240 look for the lower

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.770 
coolant in a 240 look for the lower
radiator<00:00:56.699> hose<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
radiator hose it's going to be on the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.510 
radiator hose it's going to be on the
right<00:00:57.989> side<00:00:58.020> passenger<00:00:58.890> side<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.430> the
