00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
to clog up your network an iPhone 5 we

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.930 
to clog up your network an iPhone 5 we
created<00:00:55.769> a<00:00:55.830> new<00:00:55.949> much<00:00:56.160> smaller<00:00:56.489> lightning

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
created a new much smaller lightning

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.820 
created a new much smaller lightning
connector<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:57.930> digital<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.650> know

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
connector it's all digital so you know

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.530 
connector it's all digital so you know
it<00:00:59.100> replaced<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.550> ancient<00:00:59.940> technology<00:01:00.450> in

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
it replaced that ancient technology in

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.000 
it replaced that ancient technology in
the<00:01:00.629> previous<00:01:00.960> connector<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.559> it's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the previous connector and it's

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.770 
the previous connector and it's
reversible<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.090> use<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.390> either<00:01:03.480> way

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
reversible so you can use it either way

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.170 
reversible so you can use it either way
try<00:01:04.410> doing<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.800> the<00:01:05.009> old<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:06.000> think

this<00:01:06.360> more<00:01:06.570> than<00:01:06.690> makes<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.229> fact

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259
