00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.970
 hi to all the guys I'm huxley 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.200
 I'm uploading a different video 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.690
 in fact today you see mine 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.700
 pc configuration with the aid of 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.860
 some images that will correspond to the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.949
 components that will fetch you 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.449
 i will show the complete pc and the neckline and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.609
 of the image I will describe you to the various 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.630
 objects but don't waste time let's start 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.070
 immediately 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.990
 let's start with the museum and the motherboard 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.949
 that is those that allow the pc to 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.410
 operate the set one msi z 87 c 45 of 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.540
 innings where the appointment number 87 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.780
 in fact these chipset know of last 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.420
 generation the motherboard is equipped with 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.950
 four USB 3.0 ports and two ports 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.800
 usb 2.0 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.750
 then we have the killer ethernet socket that 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.210
 I find it very interesting 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.039
 in fact it will divide internet traffic 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.230
 to allow us to play in the medium 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.210
 without lag the rest of the attacks is there 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.850
 instead in all the ship lines then 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.590
 I will not dwell too much to write the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.370
 card is only compatible with sockets 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.199
 of last generation that is the 1150 said 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.150
 in fact I decided to buy a 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.490
 latest generation i5 processor 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.040
 that is ii 5 4670 k the rams are instead 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.759
 of vengeance races becomes 3 high 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.670
 1,600 megawatt led profile 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.189
 I took two banks of 4gb then 8 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.340
 total gigabytes as a video card 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.320
 I decided to mount a gtx 770 of the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.189
 asus with two gigabytes of memory 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.110
 dedicated 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.180
 this video card will allow me to 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.119
 play next-generation games 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.890
 without problems and with excellent results 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.810
 with the encores that instead decided to 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.100
 take a western digital caviar blue 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.399
 from a terabyte 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.490
 obviously it was 3 with 7.200 rpm that 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.649
 they are nothing but beautiful per minute 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.560
 to miss anything I also thought of 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.740
 buy a fantastic ssd from samsung 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.950
 from 120 giga bytes to be exact I have 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.390
 got the samsung 840 and vaud in which 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.390
 i will go mount windows operating system 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.390
 8.1 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.190
 to feed all this it will take a 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.940
 nice bit of barrel reached whose I am 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.810
 went to choose a cx 750m of the call 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.970
 series with 80 plus bronze certification 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.799
 this goes feeder is semi bull hare 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.140
 which is why we could assemble the suns 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.640
 cases strictly necessary for a 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.830
 best cable management 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.959
 all these components will find 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.140
 refuge inside a fantastic 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.299
 keys called k 380 in the cooler 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.329
 a great master who is to tell him 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.840
 noticed in a USB 3.0 port and a port 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:48.420
 USB 2.0 and a fan with red LED 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.220
 positioned on the front for a 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.410
 best cooling system the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.099
 houses will give us the opportunity to mount 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.310
 three more fans for this piece 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.709
 that for the price this is the support 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.440
 by far every expectation 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.440
 in fact they can be inside 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.230
 installed both ssd thanks to the appropriate 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.099
 the usual provided there is idisk 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.049
 we will also find more filters for the 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.239
 dust so as to improve the passage 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.160
 by a bale p I do n't know power supplies and for 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.810
 all other components of the 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.239
 description of the components ends here 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.670
 the total price of 980 euros without 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.910
 shipments so all in all a great deal 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.910
 good deal
