what I'm starting to feel now and I'm

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.190 
what I'm starting to feel now and I'm
wondering<00:03:11.250> if<00:03:11.460> it's<00:03:11.670> because<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.570> know<00:03:12.690> right

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200

now I'm in total solitude by myself and

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.860 
now I'm in total solitude by myself and
I<00:03:15.750> get<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.590> actually<00:03:17.130> spend<00:03:17.460> time<00:03:17.820> with<00:03:18.180> myself

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
I get to actually spend time with myself

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.930

to<00:03:19.320> reflect<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.250> meditate<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:21.060> pray<00:03:22.940> before

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
I've never had that so I guess I mean I

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.060 
I've never had that so I guess I mean I
can't<00:03:28.560> say<00:03:28.860> what<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.790> or<00:03:30.090> what<00:03:30.600> it's<00:03:30.780> not
