 these are the exhausts yes the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.330
 exhausts at the back this is a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.479
 option you're not going to take 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.680
 what it's super ugly in fried 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.689

 wonder what it was for he 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.240
 had put some steel did not pass it 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.650
 required a permit 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.850
 that was the problem, though 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.960
 when driving in a cabriolet you need a 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.840
 particular accessory Thursday cabrioles 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.079
 and rolls royce nation thanks here 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.799
 here we blame my previous 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.020
 try rolls royce to look like a game 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:06.159
 do not say the name so today I have 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.619
 makes efforts but these ladies before 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.149
 from a small thing everything is great 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.410
 slow in a rolls royce so if she 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.269
 and convertible there is because it takes 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.519
 35 seconds it's great of a cc megane 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.540
 it's much faster 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.500
 there is also a trick is super long it's 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.640
 to find the function of the buttons 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.590
 how to open the chest when the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.530
 car is running aurelie past a 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.510
 half an hour we found 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.430
 and what are we discovering 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.250
 capacity of 315 liters 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.450
 the megan cc 417 so if you want some 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.819
 body have to buy a megan we have 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.209
 without you we are here to walk it's 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.209
 the moment to go 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.740
 everyone looks surprised but a 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.630
 owner does rolls royce to this be 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.620
 the back so that allows me to 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.630
 discover the touch thanks it of this leather 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.840
 bulls in high alps 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.250
 meadows where barbed eyelashes and tony yes 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.420
 not to damage the leather of the animals 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.130
 however, you still have to admit 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.690
 one thing is that in a rolls royce 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.170
 we are not in a class s of home 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.290
 mercedes 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.790
 y to leather of leather of leather 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.320
 it's getting driving and watching the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.820
 landscape then by cons what does not 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.860
 the mercedes class s for still in all 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.660
 this is the convertible version 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.550
 so my self will stop you 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.940
 as soon as you can there it's me who 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.940
 take the place 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.060
 under his hood there we have a v12 6.3 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.180
 because that you know it does not change 460 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.890
 horses 720 newton meters of cut 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.030
 when one accelerates his walk 1 must not 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.349
 look for the gear knob here no 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.959
 because he's here it's decided at all 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.920
 such rolls royce speaks a lot about the 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.739
 nautical inspiration 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.569
 well we are going to talk about boating but 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.239
 to talk about the behavior yes it's 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.469
 quite stormy and it rocks too I 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.969
 say if I had any advice to give to 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.250
 chantal perrichon once finally a 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:00.439
 time in my life we must establish 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.599
 the obligation to roll rolls royce 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:05.950
 cut phantom drophead 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:10.400
 it's an incentive to roll slowly 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.959
 happily no noise the landscape the 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.590
 sun bought a phantom it takes 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.590
 buy a convertible 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.310
 then at the end of this sea trip 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.100
 this car is not even a 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.210
 it's a rolls royce it's 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.889
 a car that makes you ride 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.910
 gently and that's very rare except 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.120
 the old ones that breaks you 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.639
 ears 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.620
 but there it is not you choice then if I 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.050
 convinced you know that despite everything 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.000
 it has a price this little machine rolls royce 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.800
 phantom cut drophead will cost you the 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.690
 trifle of four hundred and forty thousand 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.650
 euros pretty much because everything depends 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.130
 options that you will put in 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.650
 good listen I would not know you too 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.669
 advise to buy it you think 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.830
 how much does she do on a day 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.830
 like spa or normal mode toshiba
