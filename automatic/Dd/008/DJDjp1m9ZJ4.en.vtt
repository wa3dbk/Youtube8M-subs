00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.910
 good afternoon this is totally alexander i 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.420
 I want to make such a small video 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.090
 blog recently my nissan x-trail passed 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.980
 revocable gearbox campaign by 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.720
 variator that is, there is changing 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.820
 software 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.790
 Enough optimization troubleshooting 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.200
 my work improved after that 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.010
 dynamics in my subjective opinion and 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.230
 minus objective for 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.490
 increased consumption and now I want 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.340
 make a small flow measurement 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.820
 I am now behind the city for small projects 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.750
 juice in the city and out of town and check 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.490
 mixed cycle 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.800
 how much the expense increased again 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.399
 firmware 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.329
 current consumption of 14 liters usually he was 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.340
 eleven and a half 12 all that expense 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.289
 by the city 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.500
 his beautiful 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:09.700
 movement i will say how married 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:13.090
 rubber achieve minimum consumption i 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.820
 turned on the house mode so front 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.220
 drive and just is able to 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.870
 rest 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.930
 then opportunities will include 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.600
 cruise control of course our roads is 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.260
 almost unreal with us constantly 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.080
 enemies 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.270
 descent and ascent and drove green points with 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.670
 speed limit of 60 kilometers per 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.670
 hour and in some even under 40 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.600
 I chose air conditioning principle work 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.600
 ok it is not required 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.080
 11 light cant turn it off because it 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.510
 prohibited by the rules save save 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.660
 to the fullest 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.380
 we did not see 38 kilometers per hour on there 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.400
 inside 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.710
 one and a half thousand turns 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.650
 view shows kids 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.060
 peter 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.060
 and a half liters average 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.860
 speed curve 90 on the tachometer 1800 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.710
 1900 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.300
 instant consumption is also 56 liters 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.450
 the average fell to 8 and 9 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.160
 now you are marikom tips like 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.080
 can save 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.030
 there is 400 grams 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.310
 what advice when you drive a compilation 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.310
 hmali easier and therefore need to compress 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.980
 stronger so he has to lift up 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:41.570
 mix it rolled over there main 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.800
 consumption always goes burbul on analysis of 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.890
 hull ride 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.590
 the car flies in itself save 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.630
 just 1 grander 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.910
 three hundred kilometers per hour 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.520
 but so he and 33 thousand the most optimal 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:01.260
 for trails for thousands of turnover and 100 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.510
 Kilometers us 03 consumption roughly will 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.950
 8 liters per 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.950
 here we are at our destination 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.349
 average consumption was 8.8 liters 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.150
 ideal flow rate less than 8 liters 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.330
 failed to get the track was 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.120
 loaded a lot of settlements very 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.180
 strong side wind on the dynamics 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.670
 x-trail and you know what 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.030
 such a small test
