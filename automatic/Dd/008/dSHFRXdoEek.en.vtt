three lines on a screen and then the

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.000 
three lines on a screen and then the
oldest<00:02:10.659> of<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.869> lines<00:02:11.080> will<00:02:11.290> disappear<00:02:11.830> when

assuming that this is really poisonous

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.690 
assuming that this is really poisonous
water<00:02:37.720> because<00:02:38.319> if<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.620> wasn't<00:02:38.860> if<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.430> drop<00:02:39.670> of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
water because if it wasn't if a drop of

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.280 
water because if it wasn't if a drop of

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
water could kill that bird there is

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.500 
water could kill that bird there is
something<00:02:41.830> seriously<00:02:42.220> wrong<00:02:42.640> with<00:02:42.879> it<00:02:43.209> the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
something seriously wrong with it the
