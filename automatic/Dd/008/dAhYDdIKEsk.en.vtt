00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.470 
scrub so it's just like literally it's
like<00:06:01.460> sugar<00:06:01.960> with<00:06:02.960> um<00:06:04.060> they<00:06:05.060> put<00:06:05.270> all<00:06:05.390> this

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
like sugar with um they put all this

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.910 
like sugar with um they put all this
natural<00:06:05.750> stuff<00:06:06.200> it's<00:06:06.500> just<00:06:06.710> like<00:06:06.860> oil

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
natural stuff it's just like oil

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.650 
natural stuff it's just like oil
and<00:06:09.750> weird<00:06:10.750> things<00:06:11.230> but<00:06:11.500> basically<00:06:11.680> I<00:06:12.660> really

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
and weird things but basically I really

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.180 
and weird things but basically I really
recommend<00:06:14.020> it<00:06:14.110> not<00:06:14.230> just<00:06:14.350> because<00:06:14.650> like<00:06:14.770> you

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
recommend it not just because like you

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.730 
recommend it not just because like you
look<00:06:15.550> at<00:06:15.670> often<00:06:15.940> it<00:06:16.030> tastes<00:06:16.210> good<00:06:16.420> but<00:06:16.740> I

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
look at often it tastes good but I

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.220 
look at often it tastes good but I
noticed<00:06:18.310> that<00:06:18.610> you<00:06:19.060> know<00:06:19.150> how<00:06:19.270> sometimes<00:06:19.510> your

noticed that you know how sometimes your

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.710 
noticed that you know how sometimes your
lipstick<00:06:20.770> will<00:06:20.860> get<00:06:21.040> really<00:06:21.490> um<00:06:21.760> cracked<00:06:22.570> like

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720
