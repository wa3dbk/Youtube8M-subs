00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello to all the boys this new one 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.360
 channel fifa italgen ming a new channel 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.670
 dedicated above all to fifa 13 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.980
 as we present today there will be one 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.539
 short game where we summarized 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:22.680
 cutting into normal pieces 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.789
 in online seasons against normal 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.710
 normal opponent is more than anything else 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.759
 I didn't want to dwell on the game but 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.170
 I would like to focus on our ideals of 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.489
 canales what we will do and what we will design 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.719
 first of all this is our first 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.110
 video and we wanted to start making videos i 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.460
 particular scares between fifa 13 and in 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.760
 particular matches and also explaining 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.640
 tutorials like better beings 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.100
 and also tutorials on how to get more 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:06.030
 credits and through us fifa 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.180
 we could also have your videos of 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.090
 more beautiful goals and not only us not only 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.320
 you but also us once in a while 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.580
 month we will make the video of the most beautiful goals 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.580
 mounted via a mounting 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.740
 we want to do all this by doing 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.729
 a video a week and started with 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.880
 to introduce you that I already had 13 myself 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.440
 taken a week earlier as here 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.110
 season ticket if you took season ticket 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.200
 the game fifa 13 you took but one 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.729
 week before 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.289
 now it is no longer possible in 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.119
 how far you can take the full game 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:58.470
 but it was very useful as you 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.479
 you can get an idea of ​​the market at the beginning 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.520
 and how much the players a 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:09.410
 bit see how like fifa 13 and also 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:13.940
 we also made enough credits e 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.459
 now the game has come out before that 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.370
 the game prices came out of the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.640
 players were very low and now yes 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.019
 are lowered so I recommend a 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.400
 lots of people to start doing 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:32.220
 buy smart shopping as 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.200
 don't go right away to spend money for 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.600
 players that are worth much but rather 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.450
 starting with a square from not 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.239
 spend more than 34 thousand credits on a 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.859
 player 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.990
 these prices I think after 23 days 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.330
 from the exit of 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.930
 starting from this day they will begin 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.840
 immediately to increase so I recommend 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.849
 to take advantage of it 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.569
 I already took advantage of it in fact I have 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.390
 got lots of players at prices 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.910
 torn up like handanovic and robinho e 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.790
 all players as you are 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:19.280
 seeing now not everyone though now for 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:23.569
 most is nothing I wanted too 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:27.040
 dwell on the matches because 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.530
 this rule the matches but starting from 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.829
 starting in a while we will be showing 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:39.500
 especially tutorials like how 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:41.660
 start the inter for avi and make goals and the 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.099
 settings that we use during 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:49.099
 here is after this corner kick 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:52.099
 I take a goal from my head what I do 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.860
 rarely happens as I on the 20th 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.870
 matches I did I never did the 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.069
 head goals 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.290
 I must say that compared to FIFA 12 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.110
 especially in the last team is much more 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.100
 difficult to make goals from the head as 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.709
 both the players marked the 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.260
 text accuracy fail not 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.079
 they always manage to put it into force but 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.790
 which also changes a lot 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.160
 even the shots 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.800
 you put a glimpse of the beginning are i 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.380
 our more or less usual it iris last 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.300
 times have become bombs 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.210
 as they have increased proof of 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.310
 however, the power is very much the same 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.780
 time did the goalkeepers also 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.690
 quite strong compared to the demo of 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.580
 fifa 13 which has here is a search 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:46.400
 beautiful nocerino goal 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:49.370
 beautiful action and also of left and 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.840
 I must say that compared to the demo that was 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:56.960
 on the kickoff as gameplay is not 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.950
 changed a lot but there are only shots though 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.720
 for the rest they have here look at the 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.240
 sorry for me 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:10.550
 stop this lob and find it 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:12.590
 perfect and I wanted to say that compared to the 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.540
 demo of fifa 13 as you already had 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.080
 approved or most 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:21.140
 only the shots and the strength of the players change 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:26.030
 goalkeepers but for all the rest it's the same 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:28.640
 but however compared to fifa 12 it changes calm 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.160
 of as many as the actions and the 1 a 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.160
 2 are are much faster and 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.500
 above all the most essential thing is the 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.920
 touch control which would be the control 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.130
 than before it has become much more 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.740
 difficult compared to 12 as in 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.740
 based on player strength 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.440
 that is, the higher your credit rating, the easier it is 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.930
 controlling the ball is obvious if a 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.570
 bronze player you give me a ride 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.020
 very strong and obvious that the city was 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.960
 in short, this is it 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.440
 I wanted to thank you for watching e 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.810
