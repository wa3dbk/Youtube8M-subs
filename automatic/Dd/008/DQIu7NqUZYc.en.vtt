and everyone you know so that was a big

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.080 
and everyone you know so that was a big
part<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:04.129> developing<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.220> spiritual<00:01:05.640> practice

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
part of developing a spiritual practice

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.320 
part of developing a spiritual practice
in<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.409> world<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.460> surprised<00:01:08.880> me<00:01:09.060> later

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
in that world and it surprised me later

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.390 
in that world and it surprised me later
when<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> done<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.500> yoga<00:01:10.890> two<00:01:11.159> things

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
when I done to yoga two things

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
when I done to yoga two things
surprising<00:01:12.000> one<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.479> there<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.320> no

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
surprising one is that there is no

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.590 
surprising one is that there is no
simple<00:01:13.950> vehicle<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.670> people<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.240> learn<00:01:15.420> about

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
simple vehicle for people to learn about

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
simple vehicle for people to learn about
the<00:01:15.900> yoga<00:01:16.140> sutras<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:16.740> had<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> kind<00:01:17.040> of

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the yoga sutras it they had to kind of

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.700 
the yoga sutras it they had to kind of
plow<00:01:17.310> through<00:01:17.700> an<00:01:18.210> academic<00:01:19.110> tone<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.590> they

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
plow through an academic tone if they

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.140 
plow through an academic tone if they
want<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> learn<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.520> very<00:01:20.700> few<00:01:20.820> people<00:01:21.060> were

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
want to learn so very few people were

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.719 
want to learn so very few people were
doing<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:22.590> everyone<00:01:23.159> else<00:01:23.280> didn't

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
doing that and then everyone else didn't

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.920 
doing that and then everyone else didn't
know<00:01:23.820> what<00:01:23.939> yoga<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.330> was<00:01:24.600> they<00:01:24.869> would

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
know what yoga really was they would

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.679 
know what yoga really was they would
take<00:01:25.080> classes<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.180> gyms<00:01:27.180> or<00:01:27.360> something<00:01:27.630> like

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
take classes and gyms or something like

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.510 
take classes and gyms or something like
that<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.930> they<00:01:28.259> would<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.950> yoga<00:01:29.490> but

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that and they would they like yoga but

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.249 
that and they would they like yoga but
they<00:01:29.729> didn't<00:01:29.880> really<00:01:29.970> know<00:01:30.180> what<00:01:30.479> yoga<00:01:31.079> was

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
they didn't really know what yoga was

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.440 
they didn't really know what yoga was
and<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> felt<00:01:31.979> there<00:01:32.159> needed<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.400> be<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.820> way<00:01:33.420> for

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
and I felt there needed to be a way for

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
and I felt there needed to be a way for
people<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.380> felt<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.070> people<00:01:35.189> understood

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
people I felt that if people understood

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.160 
people I felt that if people understood
what<00:01:35.790> yoga<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.420> could<00:01:36.600> make<00:01:36.810> good

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
what yoga was they could make good

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.420 
what yoga was they could make good
choices<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.740> themselves<00:01:37.829> about<00:01:38.220> how<00:01:38.369> to
