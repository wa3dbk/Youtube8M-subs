day<00:00:07.919> so<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:09.210> idea<00:00:09.420> kind<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.050> came<00:00:10.320> from

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
day so this idea kind of came from

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.459 
day so this idea kind of came from
playing<00:00:11.639> frog<00:00:11.940> marks<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.660> evolving<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.290> deck

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
playing frog marks and evolving the deck

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.000 
playing frog marks and evolving the deck
so<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.450> very<00:00:15.929> early<00:00:16.350> version<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.859> it

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
so this is the very early version of it

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.790 
so this is the very early version of it
so<00:00:17.160> I'm<00:00:17.220> hoping<00:00:17.430> for<00:00:17.670> some<00:00:17.880> feedback<00:00:18.270> and

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
so I'm hoping for some feedback and

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.990 
so I'm hoping for some feedback and
let's<00:00:19.800> get<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:20.160> into<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.699> profile<00:00:21.830> to

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
let's get right into the profile to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.960 
let's get right into the profile to
Horace<00:00:24.000> level<00:00:24.300> 4<00:00:25.460> because<00:00:26.460> he's<00:00:26.939> not

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
Horace level 4 because he's not

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.240 
Horace level 4 because he's not
necessary<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:27.869> he<00:00:27.990> still<00:00:28.230> decent<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.859> there

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
necessary but he still decent and there

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.370 
necessary but he still decent and there
are<00:00:29.369> ways<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.789> deck<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.210> make<00:00:30.390> him<00:00:30.599> winning

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
are ways in the deck to make him winning

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.530 
are ways in the deck to make him winning
battles<00:00:33.200> 3<00:00:34.200> horas<00:00:34.860> level<00:00:35.309> 6<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:36.149> he's<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
battles 3 horas level 6 because he's the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.080 
battles 3 horas level 6 because he's the
most<00:00:36.899> critical<00:00:37.110> part<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.680> getting<00:00:38.370> out<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
most critical part of getting out the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.369 
most critical part of getting out the
boss<00:00:39.300> monster<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:41.180> then<00:00:42.180> obviously<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.930> level

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
boss monster and then obviously to level

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.190
