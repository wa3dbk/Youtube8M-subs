00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello everyone in this video we do 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.319
 see a delicious and very tasty recipe 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.179
 Very nice are the pizzas from nel 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.150
 area and zucchini probably many of 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.920
 you will already know how to make an ideal recipe 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.580
 in collaboration also this with 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.820
 fruit and vegetable then and dedicate it minimal 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:24.630
 also come again they are really cute 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.630
 in summer they make you very very often it is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.099
 a beautiful fantastic trick 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.460
 just to eat the zucchini 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.590
 aubergines to the living in this way below 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.719
 I'm really sure about the pizza shape 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.820
 that the expansion will go away all of them 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.770
 tv I immediately see the proceedings 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 which is very simple 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.020
 then we go to slice sliced ​​not 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.020
 too much on tv our eggplant 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.789
 we continue also with zucchini e 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.949
 these we keep slightly more 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.899
 thin 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.219
 now we hope the surface with a little 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.570
 of oil 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.820
 these your children will make them 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.189
 just outside for giorgio to be 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.650
 very good are also cute from 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:14.430
 see also to serve and add 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:18.229
 also a quick sprinkling of salt and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.229
 we can bake at 180 degrees 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.400
 add to ours without 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.890
 tomato a little bit of oil one 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.020
 sprinkled with salt but I do n't put a lot of it 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.590
 because anyway and I had put it on 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.340
 the opening and we add a nice priva 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.200
 of oregano 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.659
 you can also put fresh basil 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.520
 it's very good 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.100
 all that remains is to add the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.780
 our sauce on the vegetables they have 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.210
 baked in the oven 30 minutes we cut 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.930
 our mozzarella slices 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.610
 if you wish you can also put 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.410
 a mozzarella any or even a 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.770
 it seems obvious to me these rice cheeses 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.710
 so they remain completely vegan 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:10.070
 our pizzetti five minutes of cricket 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:12.800
 and they will be ready after the grill 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.860
 this is the result as you see the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.990
 rice mozzarella melted characters 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.930
 always own real cheese 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.220
 and it is also very good and always amazes 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.360
 because initially I didn't think it was 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.940
 so good 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.370
 instead I have to say it makes everything very much 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.410
 nice and looks just like cheese 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.880
 I very much hope that the recipes of it 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.160
 liked it and as always 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.560

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.780

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.410
