00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hi everyone guys are welcome ara 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.790
 in this new video today I will make you 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.690
 see another of my custom 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.370
 this time it's just a repeat 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.710
 we have killer croc from the animated series 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.619
 this killer koch comes naturally 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.609
 by a killer croc however he was in condition 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.430
 really pitiful had signs everywhere 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.099
 head was of a very different color from 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.890
 that of the body this is given by 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.340
 time from atmospheric factors we are 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.920
 so from the weather and also 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.530
 he had marks on his pants, signs everywhere 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.399
 anyway that I did naturally I have 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.489
 made a complete repeat of both the body 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.350
 that of the pants and also I added 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.680
 some details that were not present 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.469
 in the original film kenner anyway for 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.559
 the body chose this gray enough 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.719
 clear as it is that of killer is animated 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.140
 left shiny just to give 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.730
 the effect of the skin we say reptilian 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.369
 so you can call that of killer 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.740
 croc I gave the shiny painting also i 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.990
 trousers 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 I could have done it paco but I like it 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.010
 also polished 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.759
 oh well your feet are always shiny i 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.189
 added details were the pupils 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.340
 in the eyes that are in the animated series 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.799
 present however in the killer croc film 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.320
 no one knows why they didn't put the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.930
 pupils and instead I obviously have them 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.159
 put that I was there I added a few 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.680
 particular 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.810
 I also have oddly teeth 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.790
 leave the original color every now and then 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.590
 I make these jokes they want to leave 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.960
 something of the original color anyway 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.420
 they weren't too spoiled so yes 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.829
 they could thus leave the part I have 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.479
 done colorful let's say and the language that 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.630
 unfortunately in the business the investigating judge 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.610
 original was gray this was a 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.090
 big enough mistake ie to leave 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.270
 a gray tongue is a bit of a mess 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.750
 with that he sees the repainted of this 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.590
 let's say red rose and then the killer 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.479
 croc 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.970
 it's a little more similar to the one in the series 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.000
 animated all the crocodile e 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.400
 to the accessory he had from the beginning 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.140
 however it was left as it was 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.170
 it was quite in good condition 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.150
 certainly much better than his master 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.160
 well guys even for today the video 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.840

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.620
