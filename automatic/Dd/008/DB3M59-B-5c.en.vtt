the description I will be showing you
how<00:00:39.159> to<00:00:39.309> program<00:00:39.489> this<00:00:39.850> and<00:00:40.089> it<00:00:40.809> is<00:00:41.170> quite

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
how to program this and it is quite

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.149 
how to program this and it is quite
simple<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.110> person<00:00:44.440> that<00:00:44.530> knows<00:00:44.710> how<00:00:44.920> to<00:00:44.949> do

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
simple for a person that knows how to do

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.270 
simple for a person that knows how to do
it<00:00:45.220> but<00:00:45.879> for<00:00:46.839> a<00:00:46.870> beginner<00:00:47.050> it<00:00:47.469> is<00:00:47.649> very<00:00:48.070> very

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
it but for a beginner it is very very

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.140 
it but for a beginner it is very very

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
confusing the manual that you get arm is

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.990 
confusing the manual that you get arm is
very<00:00:52.629> stupid<00:00:53.229> because<00:00:53.830> it<00:00:54.100> doesn't<00:00:54.670> tell<00:00:54.820> you

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
very stupid because it doesn't tell you

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.990 
very stupid because it doesn't tell you
specific<00:00:55.600> things<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.379> do<00:00:56.670> when<00:00:57.670> you<00:00:57.850> are

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
specific things to do when you are

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.369 
specific things to do when you are

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
programming this I will show you in

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.410 
programming this I will show you in
steps<00:01:03.040> I<00:01:03.280> have<00:01:03.579> already<00:01:03.820> done<00:01:04.119> um<00:01:05.490> what<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:07.030> have

has a 2 mil 1.5 2.5 and there it is very
useful<00:01:18.250> because<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:19.000> can<00:01:19.210> detach<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:20.140> they

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
useful because you can detach and they

are very easy to replace and it is quite
cheap<00:01:23.650> because<00:01:24.520> they<00:01:24.700> are<00:01:24.880> but<00:01:25.690> they<00:01:25.840> are<00:01:25.870> high

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
cheap because they are but they are high

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.590 
cheap because they are but they are high
high<00:01:27.400> quality<00:01:27.430> steel<00:01:28.060> stuff<00:01:28.360> they<00:01:28.450> don't

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
high quality steel stuff they don't

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.570

make<00:02:53.050> sure<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.500> put<00:02:53.740> it<00:02:53.860> in<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.280> right<00:02:54.490> way

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
make sure you put it in the right way

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.160 
make sure you put it in the right way
and<00:02:54.970> also<00:02:55.930> make<00:02:56.530> sure<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:57.160> do<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.490> in<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
and also make sure that you do it in the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.810 
and also make sure that you do it in the
channel<00:02:59.500> 2<00:03:00.450> second<00:03:01.450> one<00:03:02.340> underneath<00:03:03.340> the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
channel 2 second one underneath the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.090 
channel 2 second one underneath the
channel<00:03:04.180> 3<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.700> will<00:03:06.880> show<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.270> now<00:03:08.100> what

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
channel 3 so I will show you now what

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.760 
channel 3 so I will show you now what
you<00:03:09.190> do<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:10.000> have<00:03:10.630> that<00:03:10.840> make<00:03:11.320> sure<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.650> is

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
you do is you have that make sure it is

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.900 
you do is you have that make sure it is
plugged<00:03:11.920> into<00:03:12.220> your<00:03:12.340> battery

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
plugged into your battery

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.800 
plugged into your battery
it<00:03:13.120> says<00:03:13.620> plug<00:03:14.620> into<00:03:14.800> your<00:03:15.100> battery<00:03:15.580> after

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
it says plug into your battery after

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.620 
it says plug into your battery after
turning<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.900> on<00:03:16.930> but<00:03:17.200> don't<00:03:17.770> do<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.480> turn<00:03:19.480> it

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
turning it on but don't do that turn it

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.530 
turning it on but don't do that turn it
on<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.709> unplugged<00:03:21.070> make<00:03:22.060> sure<00:03:22.300> you're

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
on it is unplugged make sure you're

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.380 
on it is unplugged make sure you're
holding<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.080> throttle<00:03:23.260> in<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.910> then<00:03:24.910> plug<00:03:25.240> it

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
holding the throttle in and then plug it

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.850 
holding the throttle in and then plug it
into<00:03:25.600> your<00:03:25.930> channel<00:03:26.290> 2<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:28.209> will<00:03:28.830> flash<00:03:29.830> green

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
into your channel 2 it will flash green

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.770 
into your channel 2 it will flash green
and<00:03:30.930> then<00:03:31.930> when<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.010> wants<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.459> to<00:03:33.670> show<00:03:34.570> the

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
and then when it wants you to show the

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.770 
and then when it wants you to show the
brake<00:03:35.019> you<00:03:35.500> put<00:03:35.830> all<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.790> break<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.269> or<00:03:37.570> the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
brake you put all the break in or the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.710 
brake you put all the break in or the
way<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.170> will<00:03:38.769> beep<00:03:39.010> twice<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.690> then<00:03:40.690> you

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
way and will beep twice and then you

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.090 
way and will beep twice and then you
release<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.470> throttle<00:03:41.680> into<00:03:42.489> neutral<00:03:44.100> making

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
release the throttle into neutral making

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.960 
release the throttle into neutral making
it<00:03:45.220> beep<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.700> then<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:47.019> is<00:03:47.320> programmed<00:03:47.970> so

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
it beep and then it is programmed so

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.640 
it beep and then it is programmed so
that<00:03:49.000> is<00:03:49.390> totally<00:03:51.780> programmed<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:52.989> ready<00:03:53.050> to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
that is totally programmed and ready to

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.320 
that is totally programmed and ready to
go<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:55.360> what<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.660> will<00:03:55.750> find<00:03:55.989> also<00:03:56.410> that

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
go so what you will find also that

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.699 
go so what you will find also that
you'll<00:03:58.330> run<00:03:58.540> into<00:03:58.660> trouble<00:03:59.110> is<00:03:59.260> on<00:03:59.560> your

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
you'll run into trouble is on your

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.350 
you'll run into trouble is on your
server<00:04:00.930> um<00:04:01.930> in<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.650> slash<00:04:02.940> this<00:04:03.940> thing<00:04:04.239> is

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
server um in the slash this thing is

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.920 
server um in the slash this thing is
made<00:04:04.660> so<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.410> it<00:04:05.620> runs<00:04:06.130> backwards<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:07.540> servo

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
made so that it runs backwards the servo

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.310 
made so that it runs backwards the servo
technically<00:04:08.500> should<00:04:08.920> be<00:04:09.010> on<00:04:09.160> this<00:04:09.340> side<00:04:10.320> but

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
technically should be on this side but

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.009 
technically should be on this side but
it<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.950> put<00:04:12.160> over<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:12.459> side<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:13.060> you'll<00:04:13.810> run

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
it is put over this side so you'll run

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.740 
it is put over this side so you'll run
into<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.230> problem<00:04:14.410> on<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:14.950> bottom<00:04:15.190> here<00:04:15.750> what

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
into a problem on the bottom here what

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.870 
into a problem on the bottom here what
I've<00:04:16.870> done<00:04:17.140> instead<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.989> stock<00:04:20.609> which<00:04:21.609> is

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
I've done instead of the stock which is

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.390 
I've done instead of the stock which is
the<00:04:22.479> actual<00:04:23.520> rotation<00:04:24.520> is<00:04:25.060> on<00:04:25.390> this<00:04:25.600> side<00:04:26.400> but

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
the actual rotation is on this side but

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.550 
the actual rotation is on this side but
I<00:04:27.580> have<00:04:27.760> turned<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.090> around<00:04:28.240> so<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.900> reverses

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
I have turned it around so it reverses

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.230 
I have turned it around so it reverses
the<00:04:30.400> thing<00:04:30.640> because<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.660> actual<00:04:33.240> Traxxas

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
the thing because the actual Traxxas

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.870 
the thing because the actual Traxxas
stock<00:04:34.630> receiver<00:04:35.440> does<00:04:35.890> not<00:04:36.070> have<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.280> reversal

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
stock receiver does not have a reversal

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.150 
stock receiver does not have a reversal
switch<00:04:37.090> so<00:04:37.870> if<00:04:38.020> you<00:04:38.200> will<00:04:38.350> need<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:38.770> get<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:38.919> new

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
switch so if you will need to get a new

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.279 
switch so if you will need to get a new
receiver<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:39.970> transmitter<00:04:42.330> to

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
receiver and transmitter to

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.659 
receiver and transmitter to
um<00:04:45.419> that<00:04:46.419> well<00:04:46.839> that<00:04:46.869> has<00:04:47.439> a<00:04:47.860> reversal<00:04:48.460> switch

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
um that well that has a reversal switch

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.629 
um that well that has a reversal switch
and<00:04:49.289> that's<00:04:50.289> some<00:04:50.439> good<00:04:50.649> tips<00:04:50.830> from<00:04:51.069> Brandon
