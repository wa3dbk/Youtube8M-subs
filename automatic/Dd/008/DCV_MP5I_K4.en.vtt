00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
I'm feeling good I think it's gonna get

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.530 
I'm feeling good I think it's gonna get
our<00:02:17.470> own<00:02:17.530> feeling<00:02:17.890> great<00:02:18.250> on<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.670> team<00:02:18.880> but<00:02:19.510> I

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
our own feeling great on the team but I

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.880 
our own feeling great on the team but I
think<00:02:19.930> more<00:02:20.080> than<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.230> we're<00:02:20.440> really<00:02:20.590> deep

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
think more than that we're really deep

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.830 
think more than that we're really deep
and<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:21.520> even<00:02:22.030> if<00:02:22.120> we<00:02:22.240> had<00:02:22.390> played<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.630> lot<00:02:22.810> of

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
and so even if we had played a lot of

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.880 
and so even if we had played a lot of
minutes

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
minutes

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.690 
minutes
people<00:02:24.850> like<00:02:24.970> kick<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.300> Christina<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:25.870> IKEA

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
people like kick a Christina and IKEA

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.940 
people like kick a Christina and IKEA
chris<00:02:27.700> Christie<00:02:28.690> players<00:02:29.560> coming<00:02:29.800> off<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
chris Christie players coming off the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.830 
chris Christie players coming off the
bench<00:02:30.070> who<00:02:30.790> get<00:02:30.970> just<00:02:31.180> as<00:02:31.270> many<00:02:31.390> when<00:02:31.600> this<00:02:31.720> is

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
bench who get just as many when this is

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.200 
bench who get just as many when this is
s<00:02:31.960> or<00:02:32.080> could<00:02:32.320> possibly<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:33.100> mean<00:02:33.310> at<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.850> point

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
s or could possibly I mean at that point

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.160 
s or could possibly I mean at that point
it<00:02:34.270> doesn't<00:02:34.450> really<00:02:34.540> matter<00:02:34.690> because<00:02:35.020> we're

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
it doesn't really matter because we're

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.160 
it doesn't really matter because we're
also<00:02:35.290> exchangeable<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:37.140> interchangeable

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
also exchangeable that interchangeable

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.700 
also exchangeable that interchangeable
that<00:02:39.100> I<00:02:39.730> think<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.690> gives<00:02:40.930> us<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.140> little<00:02:41.410> edge

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
that I think that gives us a little edge

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.170 
that I think that gives us a little edge
and<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.010> yeah<00:02:42.310> it's<00:02:42.460> great<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.820> we<00:02:42.910> all<00:02:43.030> got

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
and that yeah it's great that we all got

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.660 
and that yeah it's great that we all got
to<00:02:43.360> rest<00:02:43.570> but<00:02:43.840> even<00:02:44.200> if<00:02:44.440> we<00:02:44.620> didn't<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.160> mean<00:02:45.550> we

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
to rest but even if we didn't I mean we

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.670 
to rest but even if we didn't I mean we
still<00:02:45.850> have<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.270> know<00:02:46.410> starters<00:02:47.410> on<00:02:47.590> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
still have you know starters on the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.100 
still have you know starters on the
bench<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.160> thought<00:02:48.520> they<00:02:48.700> were<00:02:48.760> very<00:02:49.110> physical

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
bench I thought they were very physical

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.960 
bench I thought they were very physical
I<00:02:50.350> thought<00:02:50.740> that<00:02:51.010> they<00:02:51.160> got<00:02:51.370> their<00:02:51.520> hands<00:02:51.730> on<00:02:51.910> a

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
I thought that they got their hands on a

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.830 
I thought that they got their hands on a
lot<00:02:52.210> of<00:02:52.360> balls<00:02:53.430> 5050<00:02:54.430> balls<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:55.030> we're<00:02:55.570> quick

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
with their hands when northwestern would

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.720
