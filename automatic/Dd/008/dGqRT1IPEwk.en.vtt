00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.950 
talked about the adjustability of these
boots<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.070> thanks<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.820> this

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
boots and that is thanks to this

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
boots and that is thanks to this
technology<00:01:18.960> system<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.770> basically<00:01:20.460> what<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
technology system and basically what it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.260 
technology system and basically what it
is<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.689> got<00:01:21.960> some<00:01:22.580> invisible<00:01:23.580> or

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
is is it's got some invisible or

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.200 
is is it's got some invisible or
actually<00:01:24.570> hidden<00:01:24.890> wire<00:01:25.890> that's<00:01:26.460> inside<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
actually hidden wire that's inside the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.870 
actually hidden wire that's inside the
back<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.409> basically<00:01:28.880> flip

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
back here and you can basically flip

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.870 
back here and you can basically flip
this<00:01:30.119> up<00:01:30.390> here<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.049> give<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.590> few<00:01:31.880> twists

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
this up here and give it a few twists

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.789 
this up here and give it a few twists
and<00:01:33.060> that's<00:01:33.630> actually<00:01:33.900> going<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.110> tighten<00:01:34.710> up

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
and that's actually going to tighten up

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.340 
and that's actually going to tighten up
the<00:01:35.070> calf<00:01:35.670> area<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.329> very<00:01:36.479> adjustable<00:01:36.900> if

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
