00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.920
 in fact alessandro if this is the fifth va region or these part i believe 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.200
 that this is a draw with a completely different flavor so many occasions to 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.159
 goal what has changed compared to previous games 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.949
 and we have not reactivated was what I said unfortunately there is a stop 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.490
 taken off course we were no longer there we were a little bit too long 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.820
 instead of tonight we returned to the juventus caaf act 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.429
 great games for the whole season so we've been back for a month and a half 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.609
 ago when we played compact concentrates 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.030
 because we knew what we had to do if I were with one another 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.220
 but the branch distances the most important thing because lately instead 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.499
 we were too long we couldn't play as we were used to 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.329
 there were two or three scoring chances before the Milan 2 or 3 advantage 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.710
 bailouts are wrong 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.250
 the flamini therefore a mayonnaise during dangerous 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.410
 forward then came the goal also particular of the Milan not only error 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.949
 believe the grumbles disengagement then 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.620
 rosburgo the other d 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.830
 Diablo felt particularly fortunate I was afraid 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.930
 at that moment it will be what it will be 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.520
 aurano sure that it did not bother me tremendously because we created 3 4 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.930
 balls 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.370
 good for scoring 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.490
 then them 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.060
 so half a half had managed to take the lead but I had confidence 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.980
 why 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.510
 when we play like this we don't have the balls and we create the first goal then the goal 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.430
 we always do it 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.720
 mark iaquinta and it seemed that it could be 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.710
 big brother i was wondering if it was 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.570
 of course if this season 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.780
 good country evening 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.180
 -4 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.550
 or detached the ace of the omen in the sense that it is she who makes him play 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.650
 evidently but 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.190
 himself so steady this physical strength in the legs 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.070
 then I never gave numbers and black notch no no to say what it is like me 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.290
 I consider the team I did not give but the numbers 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.800
 vincenzo unfortunately in the two years we have been here we have always had small ones 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.590
 things that 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.630
 in the moment its best% an injury 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.400
 something 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.350
 that brought him to stand still 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.290
 so when he is fine disruptive because he gives you thorough is a 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.240
 generous or is one who sacrifices himself for the team for which he played every 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.390
 whenever I saw him better than the others and so they all played 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.829
 others 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.679
 read is the last thing about her and she has received so much criticism 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.599
 what is his fault that he was too close too well 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.839
 inter pro score probably still not going for the Scudetto 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.589
 to do points 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:27.759
 or later we will see 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.580
 does not feel a little too delicate and against 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.989
 insist on this key 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.399
 I must see who criticizes me 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:39.739
 the teeth trainer used to being criticized 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.139
 ele must accept 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.239
 alessandro also because ranieri said he understands soccer will have 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.790
 I have certainly considered some work my job 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.340
 and we have you caviar ring bobs who understand football until you try 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.260
 quintessentially we hope that I don't remember how cold it is - save on 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.930
 sphere remains were eye was a holiday rankings compliments my site 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.799
 personally, how much I am more appreciated than a Milan player but who 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.350
 you have succeeded compared to the Rossoneri 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.980
 to do what you planned before the game in a while 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.669
 speech of the attackers 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:14.659
 and I wanted to know if the choice of amauri and iaquinta pellegatta under the conditions 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:19.430
 physical or otherwise has a football tactical plan and therefore the desire to have 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:23.819
 forced to sing high songs physically since then you lawn with what you are 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.789
 managed to listen to this juggling injury then in this one this May 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:31.260
 moment what I look at above all is the physical condition of who is 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.109
 better than another because 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.649
 you all know it very well 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:40.399
 bigger then condition the coach of those who run more so 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:45.260
 if there is a good assortment because as I said before vincenzo and player 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.859
 that gives you depth and amauri 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.859
 carpisa 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.469
 moreover they are tall they are generous not that 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:57.739
 del piero and trezeguet are not 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.529
 that's what I've always done with 4 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:01.829
 source just try to field 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.829
 who is better 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.849
 captain and amauri have made a round of round 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.980
 wonderful then there was amauri that 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.369
 has fallen a little bit 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:15.369
 I saw captain 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:17.889
 download shoot 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.019
 away fifth because it didn't rain injuries 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.430
 I always expect 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.430
 important diamond 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.200
 abroad so much talk has been so much mystification 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.020
 company constitution of many photo fans station 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.399
 but also and above all with rotating blades the players also spoke 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.669
 they were a little aware of the I don't believe it but in this speech then tonight 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.340
 they see you will wait for them to come in. A quarter of an hour will come in 20 minutes and they will behave 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.690
 as 18-year-old girls I believe this is at its greatest 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.490
 satisfaction this evening our true 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.870
 it's true because the two of us who always say girl can talk 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.230
 only in the field 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.320
 and then there will be a few words that 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.050
 that there is in a peroxen dressing room because it was a little too much 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.039
 giants from there there was only the desire of everyone 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.460
 and to get out of a game we were deservedly losing and 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.770
 we wanted to react 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.550
 so these things have always been there will be but nothing d 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.870
 this thing happened in place at the soel saturday 'a lot more liberated 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.580
 to played with different to skip that was that she wanted soaked I don't love 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.880
 I came to him that he had problems with pubalgia so 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.440
 and then enter 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.960
 in Italian football it is never easy for him to have this problem 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.589
 that 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:44.539
 during the season the doctors have solved it and now it's the button 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:45.599
 we wanted 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.460
 larus, I wanted to ask you, I wanted to ask you to update on 

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:51.360
 dos doctor hit me a little 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.669
 pothwar refinement the cable with which he handled the situation in the last ones 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:56.689
 last times 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.159
 humanly I only care about that 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.090
 above all that but the mind is like having come out keeping yourself that way 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:05.619
 quiet peaceful 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:08.619
 without letting go of your nervousness 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.199
 because I know I'm on the side of reason why when you know you have 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.360
 done some work is doing well 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.719
 what criticisms are there and they all stand up 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.589
 by whom they are brought as they are brought 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:27.119
 and then there are the real ones and the ones that everyone would consider 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:30.129
 because they can make you improve so I'm always 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:31.850
 open all the criticisms 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.810
 because criticism for me is the spice of life and allows you to improve yourself 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.600
 but there is now a glimpse to operate the situation 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:46.020
 Uniti.it if I have to push hard to do. after we will see the situation 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.029
 the situation has not deteriorated 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:51.189
 it is normal under control and we have to make points this is the most thing 

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.999
 important 

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:53.449
 we want to fight 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.240
 to get seconds this evening we have given no proof of it 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.629
 it went well but 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:01.629
 we must continue like this because it is only luck 

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:05.629
 tv and you don't come if you don't deserve it 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:08.710
 so we resumed the game just because the team was 

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:09.899
 determined 

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:13.580
 to make a big result here in san siro against a milan he is sending 

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:15.569
 a thousand and we were 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:19.639
 It has been a month and a half that we could not do what we know how to do this 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.960
 evening we did we are very happy with the performance 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.619
 I'm very happy of course 

00:07:24.619 --> 00:07:27.969
 last thing the purchase of diego is also a purchase of ranieri 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.149
 but everyone always said those we have 

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:31.990
 got are 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.639
 not always agreed with the company 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:35.430
 perfect 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.190
 thanks thanks good evening will be scazzi
