Fulham<00:01:57.270> from<00:01:57.630> from<00:01:58.079> what<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.350> see<00:01:58.409> there

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
Fulham from from what we can see there

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.940 
Fulham from from what we can see there
on<00:01:58.829> fifa<00:01:59.520> 14<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.299> one<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.930> he<00:02:01.649> should

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
on fifa 14 that one is but he should

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.069 
on fifa 14 that one is but he should
have<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.310> round<00:02:02.790> about<00:02:02.909> 60-something<00:02:03.659> shooting

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
have a round about 60-something shooting

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.490 
have a round about 60-something shooting
which<00:02:04.170> isn't<00:02:04.469> too<00:02:04.590> bad<00:02:04.770> i<00:02:04.829> know

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
which isn't too bad i know

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.230 
which isn't too bad i know
that<00:02:05.710> cat<00:02:05.980> probably<00:02:06.580> more<00:02:06.790> than<00:02:06.850> that<00:02:07.150> because

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
that cat probably more than that because

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.880 
that cat probably more than that because
he's<00:02:07.450> had<00:02:07.630> some<00:02:07.810> quality<00:02:08.229> strikes<00:02:08.500> over<00:02:08.710> the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
he's had some quality strikes over the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.469 
he's had some quality strikes over the
years<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:09.759> shouldn't<00:02:10.090> be<00:02:10.179> one<00:02:10.300> of<00:02:10.390> the

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
years and that shouldn't be one of the

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.880 
years and that shouldn't be one of the
things<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.780> disintegrates<00:02:11.530> as<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.770> get

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
have solutely loved that badge by the

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.390 
have solutely loved that badge by the
way<00:03:27.670> it's<00:03:28.390> just<00:03:28.450> cool<00:03:28.840> badge<00:03:29.170> but<00:03:29.769> yeah<00:03:30.370> I

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
way it's just cool badge but yeah I

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.650 
way it's just cool badge but yeah I
don't<00:03:30.519> think<00:03:30.640> I'll<00:03:30.820> get<00:03:30.910> downgraded<00:03:31.120> too<00:03:31.480> much

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
don't think I'll get downgraded too much

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.479 
don't think I'll get downgraded too much
because<00:03:31.780> he's<00:03:31.989> about<00:03:32.200> 20<00:03:32.650> 9<00:03:32.799> 30ish<00:03:33.220> now<00:03:33.459> I

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
because he's about 20 9 30ish now I

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.130 
because he's about 20 9 30ish now I
think<00:03:33.610> so<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.180> probably<00:03:34.570> stay<00:03:34.720> around<00:03:34.930> about

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
think so I probably stay around about

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.720 
think so I probably stay around about
the<00:03:35.200> same<00:03:35.290> level<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:36.010> we've<00:03:36.130> got<00:03:36.220> chemawa<00:03:36.549> as

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
the same level and we've got chemawa as

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.569 
the same level and we've got chemawa as
well<00:03:36.910> who<00:03:37.120> was<00:03:37.480> a<00:03:37.750> fantastic<00:03:38.260> player<00:03:38.680> español

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
well who was a fantastic player español

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:40.949 
well who was a fantastic player español
really<00:03:39.820> actually<00:03:39.970> like<00:03:40.209> him<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.570> used<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.810> look

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
really actually like him I used to look

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.050 
really actually like him I used to look
linking<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.739> young<00:03:42.160> Latino<00:03:42.519> in<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.820> middle

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
linking it to young Latino in the middle

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.479 
linking it to young Latino in the middle
but<00:03:43.600> he<00:03:43.840> probably<00:03:44.140> gonna<00:03:44.440> be<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.650> high-end<00:03:45.220> gold

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489

as the end of the video these are

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.620 
as the end of the video these are
probably<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.280> six<00:03:51.670> most<00:03:51.880> famous<00:03:52.329> there<00:03:52.510> I
