00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.850 
and you might want to do that twice a
week<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.700> they're<00:01:59.880> indoors<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.170> don't<00:02:01.649> do

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
week if they're indoors here I don't do

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.469 
week if they're indoors here I don't do
mine<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.549> live<00:02:02.850> seven<00:02:03.119> blocks<00:02:03.299> from

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
mine because I live seven blocks from

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.510 
mine because I live seven blocks from
the<00:02:03.659> ocean<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.500> gets<00:02:04.680> some<00:02:04.890> moisture<00:02:05.310> from

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the ocean so it gets some moisture from

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.050 
the ocean so it gets some moisture from
the<00:02:05.670> air<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.840> don't<00:02:06.899> fertilize<00:02:07.380> mine

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
the air and I don't fertilize mine

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.339 
the air and I don't fertilize mine
because<00:02:09.060> again<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.539> are<00:02:09.569> outdoor<00:02:10.080> so

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
because again they are outdoor so

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.029 
because again they are outdoor so
they're<00:02:10.500> getting

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
they're getting

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.369 
they're getting
what<00:02:11.220> they<00:02:11.340> need<00:02:11.549> from<00:02:11.760> there<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.170> would

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
what they need from there but you would

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.089 
what they need from there but you would
use<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:14.099> liquid<00:02:14.879> fertilizer<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.739> high<00:02:17.069> in

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
use a liquid fertilizer that is high in

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.149 
use a liquid fertilizer that is high in
nitrogen<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.120> high<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.540> potassium<00:02:18.769> that's<00:02:19.769> N

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
nitrogen and high in potassium that's N

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.270 
nitrogen and high in potassium that's N
and<00:02:21.120> K<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.989> first<00:02:22.230> number<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.799> second

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
and K the first number and the second

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.610 
and K the first number and the second
number<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.540> also<00:02:24.810> want<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.319> make<00:02:25.470> sure

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
number and you also want to make sure

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.809 
number and you also want to make sure
that<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:25.920> has<00:02:26.099> no<00:02:26.659> minerals<00:02:27.659> in<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.440> like<00:02:28.650> a

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
that it has no minerals in it like a

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.750 
that it has no minerals in it like a
iron<00:02:29.819> or<00:02:30.480> boron<00:02:31.019> or<00:02:31.590> copper<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.489> they<00:02:32.549> don't

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
iron or boron or copper that they don't

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.460 
iron or boron or copper that they don't
like<00:02:32.879> that<00:02:32.909> and<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.780> would<00:02:33.930> dilute<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.440> down

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
like that and you would dilute it down

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.410 
like that and you would dilute it down
to<00:02:34.829> about<00:02:34.920> quarter<00:02:35.370> strength<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.269> would

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
to about quarter strength and you would

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.399 
to about quarter strength and you would
spray<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.959> on<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.739> foliage<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:39.019> other<00:02:40.019> than

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
spray that on the foliage and other than

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.759 
spray that on the foliage and other than
that<00:02:40.590> they<00:02:40.859> are<00:02:41.040> as<00:02:41.189> easy<00:02:41.459> as<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.359> be

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
that they are as easy as can be

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.530 
that they are as easy as can be
this<00:02:43.769> is<00:02:43.980> now<00:02:44.159> with<00:02:44.430> joyous<00:02:44.730> garden<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.390> I've
