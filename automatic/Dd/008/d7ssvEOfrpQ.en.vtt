you're eating you know more and more
fruit<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.480> then<00:03:46.660> you<00:03:47.170> get<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.500> point<00:03:47.620> where

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
fruit so then you get to the point where

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.590 
fruit so then you get to the point where
you<00:03:47.920> can<00:03:48.040> sit<00:03:48.280> down<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.790> eat<00:03:49.120> ten<00:03:49.450> bananas

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.470 
you can sit down and eat ten bananas
without<00:03:50.020> having<00:03:50.710> to<00:03:50.950> blend<00:03:51.250> them<00:03:51.490> obviously

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
without having to blend them obviously

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.210 
without having to blend them obviously
you<00:03:52.720> can<00:03:52.870> still<00:03:53.050> blend<00:03:53.290> them<00:03:53.410> but<00:03:53.590> it's<00:03:53.980> kind

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
you can still blend them but it's kind

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.950 
you can still blend them but it's kind
