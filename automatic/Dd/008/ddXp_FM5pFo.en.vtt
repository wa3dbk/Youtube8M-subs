00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello girls today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.480
 get these rhythms inspired from the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.400
 Pauline blond I'm completely 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.160
 obsessed with this style of hair and 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.680
 I love Chinese hair and here they 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.160
 I'm going to teach how to have this style of 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.890
 hair and I hope you like them 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.250
 or that the clamp I'm going to use is from the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.960
 brand browning female if you look and what 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.590
 first thing we're going to do is obvious 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.820
 learn it and attend the temperature to 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.250
 the one you want I'm not going to put in 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.590
 374 degrees the second step is 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.470
 Completely optional but I will use 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.199
 This thermal protector of the soft brand 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.280
 to protect my hair from the clip because 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:54.649
 I'm going to put 300 74 degrees to my hair and not 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.059
 I want to hurt him so I'm going to 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.059
 put on all my hair 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.199
 and with a brush I will untangle my 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.280
 hair to distribute the protector in 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.280
 all my hair 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.429
 Now I'm going to divide my hair into two 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.429
 parts 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.820
 and since the clamp is heated I'm going to 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.790
 grab a section of my hair and I'll 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.100
 to put around the clamp as well as 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.540
 I am teaching them 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.540
 I'll wait a few seconds 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.510
 and then I'm going to tell him to give the clip 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.420
 and look, I'm glad the first resort 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.110
 and so I'm going to repeat this process in all 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.110
 my hair 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.950
 ah 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.950
 ah 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.790
 ah 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:43.209
 and the last step is to throw me fried this 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.950
 is the Disney brand in the green color 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.950
 and in number 4 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.140
 and I'm going to put it on all my hair to 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.349
 that my fruits do not fall during the 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.349
 day 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.950
 and here is the result of the curls 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.739
 inspired by blond paulina I hope that 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.109
