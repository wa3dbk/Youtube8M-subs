few weeks beach one of them in very
rough<00:00:40.829> shape<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.399> suspect<00:00:41.969> there<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> large

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
rough shape I suspect there was a large

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.319 
rough shape I suspect there was a large
population<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.739> rodents<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.430> year<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.090> so

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
population of rodents this year and so

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.580 
population of rodents this year and so
with<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.170> rodent<00:00:46.850> food<00:00:47.850> source<00:00:48.180> then<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
with the rodent food source then the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.369 
with the rodent food source then the
Owls<00:00:49.829> respond<00:00:50.610> by<00:00:50.879> producing<00:00:51.480> more<00:00:51.629> babies<00:00:52.050> so

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
Owls respond by producing more babies so

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.689 
Owls respond by producing more babies so
when<00:00:52.649> they've<00:00:52.829> got<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.129> abundance<00:00:53.610> of

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
when they've got this abundance of

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.979 
when they've got this abundance of
offspring<00:00:54.210> when<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.320> time<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:55.649> them<00:00:55.920> to

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
offspring when it's time for them to

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.060 
offspring when it's time for them to
establish<00:00:57.989> their<00:00:58.170> own<00:00:58.199> territories<00:00:58.890> they

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
establish their own territories they

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.279 
establish their own territories they
have<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> go<00:00:59.489> further<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.270> Snow<00:01:00.539> White's<00:01:00.930> do
