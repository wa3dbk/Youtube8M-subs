00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
to replace this belt the first thing

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.870 
to replace this belt the first thing
you'll<00:00:27.869> want<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.680> remove<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> deck

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
you'll want to do is remove the deck

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.970 
you'll want to do is remove the deck
which<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.240> very<00:00:30.599> easily<00:00:30.869> by<00:00:31.230> pulling<00:00:31.679> four

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
which is very easily by pulling four

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.760 
which is very easily by pulling four
pins<00:00:33.110> but<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.290> most<00:00:34.530> difficult<00:00:34.950> part<00:00:35.640> is

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
pins but the most difficult part is

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.380 
pins but the most difficult part is
getting<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:39.770> where<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> belt<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.250> located<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
getting to where the belt is located the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.020 
getting to where the belt is located the
first<00:00:42.690> thing<00:00:42.989> you'll<00:00:43.200> want<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.829> which<00:00:44.789> I

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
first thing you'll want to do which I

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.479 
first thing you'll want to do which I
didn't<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.260> first<00:00:46.289> time<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.890> replaced<00:00:47.280> is

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
didn't do the first time I replaced is

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.400 
didn't do the first time I replaced is
come<00:00:47.730> over<00:00:47.760> here<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.270> remove<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.960> guard

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
come over here and remove this guard

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.580 
come over here and remove this guard
from<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> sides<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.149> then<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.230> see

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
from the sides and then if you can see

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.369 
from the sides and then if you can see
that<00:00:53.370> allows<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.180> you're<00:00:54.750> looking<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that allows you you're looking at the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.260 
that allows you you're looking at the
fan<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:56.489> top<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:58.160> where<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> drive<00:00:59.550> pull

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
fan on top of the where the drive pull

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.119 
fan on top of the where the drive pull
belt<00:01:00.510> goes<00:01:00.859> so<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.629> part<00:01:04.409> one<00:01:04.650> here

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
belt goes so this is just part one here

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.370 
belt goes so this is just part one here
and<00:01:05.309> I'll<00:01:06.299> continue<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.010> moment

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.520 

I<00:01:12.090> don't<00:01:13.090> know<00:01:13.270> if<00:01:13.390> you<00:01:13.509> can<00:01:13.659> see<00:01:13.899> but<00:01:14.110> this<00:01:14.320> is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
I don't know if you can see but this is

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.370 
I don't know if you can see but this is
from<00:01:14.799> under<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.880> lawn<00:01:16.090> mower<00:01:16.659> deck<00:01:16.960> and<00:01:17.229> that

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
from under the lawn mower deck and that

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.300 
from under the lawn mower deck and that
is<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.799> fan<00:01:18.100> on<00:01:18.430> top<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.539> the<00:01:19.840> where<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.950> drive

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
is the fan on top of the where the drive

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.319 
is the fan on top of the where the drive
belt<00:01:21.610> will<00:01:21.789> go<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:22.390> then<00:01:23.140> this<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:24.789> idler

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
belt will go and then this is the idler

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.179 
belt will go and then this is the idler
pulley<00:01:25.360> there<00:01:25.929> and<00:01:26.289> then<00:01:27.130> you<00:01:27.340> have<00:01:27.640> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
pulley there and then you have the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.819

this<00:04:06.470> bracket<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.820> bottom<00:04:08.180> part<00:04:08.480> right<00:04:08.780> here

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
this bracket the bottom part right here

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.600 
this bracket the bottom part right here
which<00:04:09.230> was<00:04:09.440> very<00:04:09.710> simple<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.190> do

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
which was very simple to do

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.120 
which was very simple to do
I've<00:04:11.480> carried<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.110> belt<00:04:12.350> around<00:04:12.770> the<00:04:12.890> top

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
I've carried the belt around the top

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.440 
I've carried the belt around the top
pulley<00:04:13.990> then<00:04:14.990> I<00:04:15.080> started<00:04:15.500> feeding<00:04:15.740> the<00:04:16.040> belt

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
pulley then I started feeding the belt

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.599 
pulley then I started feeding the belt
through<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.540> slot<00:04:18.049> where<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.560> fan<00:04:18.859> blades

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
through the slot where the fan blades

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.350 
through the slot where the fan blades
are<00:04:19.940> on<00:04:20.420> the<00:04:21.170> other<00:04:21.290> side<00:04:21.820> we'll<00:04:22.820> take<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.090> look

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
are on the other side we'll take a look

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.520 
are on the other side we'll take a look
at<00:04:23.450> that<00:04:23.660> right<00:04:23.960> now

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.290 

so<00:04:28.710> here<00:04:29.010> you<00:04:29.160> can<00:04:29.340> see<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.760> belt<00:04:30.000> coming

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
so here you can see the belt coming

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.000 
so here you can see the belt coming
through<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:31.220> I<00:04:32.220> will<00:04:32.430> just<00:04:32.730> feed<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:34.770> belt

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
through and I will just feed the belt

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.000 
through and I will just feed the belt
through<00:04:35.900> over<00:04:36.900> these<00:04:37.110> fan<00:04:37.350> blades<00:04:37.680> they're

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
through over these fan blades they're

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
through over these fan blades they're
plastic<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:39.540> they're<00:04:39.810> very<00:04:40.140> easy<00:04:40.970> now<00:04:41.970> the

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
plastic so they're very easy now the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.760 
plastic so they're very easy now the
belt<00:04:42.510> is<00:04:42.750> on<00:04:43.400> from<00:04:44.400> this<00:04:44.580> side<00:04:44.910> on<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:46.500> pulley

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
belt is on from this side on that pulley

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.100 
belt is on from this side on that pulley
so<00:04:47.280> my<00:04:47.660> final<00:04:48.660> step<00:04:49.290> now<00:04:49.620> is<00:04:49.920> to<00:04:50.340> go<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:51.110> put

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
so my final step now is to go and put

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.440 
so my final step now is to go and put
the<00:04:52.260> belt<00:04:52.440> around<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.920> idler<00:04:53.130> pulley<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.850> put

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
the belt around the idler pulley and put

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.140 
the belt around the idler pulley and put
the<00:04:54.570> bracket<00:04:54.930> back<00:04:55.050> on<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:55.620> it's<00:04:56.010> done<00:04:56.370> it's

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
the bracket back on and it's done it's

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.440 
the bracket back on and it's done it's
not<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.810> hard<00:04:58.080> job<00:04:58.670> if<00:04:59.670> you<00:05:00.000> know<00:05:00.120> what<00:05:00.300> you're

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
not a hard job if you know what you're

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.110 
not a hard job if you know what you're
doing

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.450 

okay<00:05:05.120> now<00:05:05.360> for<00:05:05.599> a<00:05:05.629> very<00:05:05.870> important<00:05:06.440> trick<00:05:06.710> I'm

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
okay now for a very important trick I'm

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.379 
okay now for a very important trick I'm
going<00:05:07.849> to<00:05:08.000> show<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.240> how<00:05:08.659> to<00:05:09.190> connect<00:05:10.389> you'll

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
going to show you how to connect you'll

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.050 
going to show you how to connect you'll
see<00:05:11.629> that<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:12.020> belt<00:05:12.830> is<00:05:13.069> now<00:05:13.310> on<00:05:13.580> the<00:05:13.699> idler

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
see that the belt is now on the idler

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.170 
see that the belt is now on the idler
pulley<00:05:14.590> we're<00:05:15.590> going<00:05:15.889> to<00:05:16.039> connect<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.669> spring

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
pulley we're going to connect the spring

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.290 
pulley we're going to connect the spring
tension<00:05:17.930> spring<00:05:18.319> on<00:05:19.099> the<00:05:19.460> hook<00:05:19.669> right<00:05:19.940> here

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
tension spring on the hook right here

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.020 
tension spring on the hook right here
and<00:05:20.590> this<00:05:21.590> tension<00:05:21.860> spring<00:05:22.310> has<00:05:22.580> to<00:05:22.729> go<00:05:22.849> back

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
and this tension spring has to go back

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.939 
and this tension spring has to go back
to<00:05:23.210> that<00:05:23.360> bolt<00:05:23.659> right<00:05:23.900> there<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.560> can<00:05:24.740> see

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
to that bolt right there and you can see

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.700 
to that bolt right there and you can see
that's<00:05:25.159> a<00:05:25.370> good<00:05:25.610> six<00:05:26.479> inches<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:27.199> you<00:05:27.349> can<00:05:27.379> see

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
that's a good six inches and you can see

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.909 
that's a good six inches and you can see
that<00:05:27.889> is<00:05:28.039> a<00:05:28.069> very<00:05:28.460> strong<00:05:28.940> spring<00:05:29.650> so<00:05:30.650> what<00:05:30.889> I

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
that is a very strong spring so what I

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.360 
that is a very strong spring so what I
am<00:05:31.250> going<00:05:31.490> to<00:05:31.610> do<00:05:32.289> to<00:05:33.289> make<00:05:33.470> this<00:05:33.650> easy<00:05:34.009> I'm

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
am going to do to make this easy I'm

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:43.390 
am going to do to make this easy I'm
going<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.759> create<00:05:34.970> leverage<00:05:36.789> by<00:05:42.069> attaching<00:05:43.069> a
