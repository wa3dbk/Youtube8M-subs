metal we hear about the environmental
problems<00:00:28.019> every<00:00:28.320> day<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.310> often<00:00:29.429> don't

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
problems every day but we often don't

and the reality is we have all the
solutions<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:33.989> need<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.260> move<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.770> turn

we<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.510> voracious<00:00:57.930> appetite<00:00:58.649> for

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
we have this voracious appetite for

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.310 
we have this voracious appetite for
single-use<00:00:59.250> throwaway<00:01:00.000> plastics<00:01:00.570> there's

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
single-use throwaway plastics there's

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.319 
single-use throwaway plastics there's
now<00:01:01.530> coming<00:01:01.949> back<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.309> these<00:01:02.399> massive<00:01:02.940> human

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
now coming back with these massive human

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.410 
now coming back with these massive human
fingerprints<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.260> over<00:01:04.320> our<00:01:04.769> planet<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.420> so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
fingerprints all over our planet and so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 
fingerprints all over our planet and so
what<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.689> hope<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.900> do<00:01:07.140> by<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.500> voyage<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.950> try

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
what we hope to do by this voyage is try

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.370 
what we hope to do by this voyage is try
and<00:01:08.369> say<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:09.060> need<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.240> rethink<00:01:09.570> how<00:01:10.350> we

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and say we need to rethink how we

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.190 
and say we need to rethink how we
interact<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> web<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.939> life<00:01:11.970> how<00:01:12.900> weary

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
interact with the web of life how weary

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.230 
interact with the web of life how weary
interact<00:01:13.650> with<00:01:13.830> nature<00:01:13.979> I'll<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:14.970> stopped

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
interact with nature I'll be stopped

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.670 
interact with nature I'll be stopped
putting<00:01:15.420> these<00:01:15.600> human<00:01:15.960> fingerprints<00:01:16.560> this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
putting these human fingerprints this

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.940 
putting these human fingerprints this
pollution<00:01:17.100> into<00:01:17.430> our<00:01:17.670> oceans<00:01:18.600> into<00:01:19.470> landfill

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
pollution into our oceans into landfill

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.670 
pollution into our oceans into landfill
entire<00:01:20.490> atmosphere<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> hope<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.530> what

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
entire atmosphere and so I hope you what

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.140 
entire atmosphere and so I hope you what
this<00:01:22.799> does<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.220> brings<00:01:23.549> people<00:01:23.909> together

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
this does is it brings people together

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.719 
this does is it brings people together
to<00:01:24.420> ask<00:01:24.689> questions<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.439> curious<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.159> take

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
to ask questions to be curious to take

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.700 
to ask questions to be curious to take
their<00:01:26.880> own<00:01:27.030> adventures<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.290> part<00:01:28.590> of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
their own adventures to be part of

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.109 
their own adventures to be part of
something<00:01:28.920> special<00:01:29.130> where<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:29.939> say

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
something special where we can all say

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.149 
something special where we can all say
we<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.689> solve<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.110> together<00:01:31.320> there's<00:01:31.979> no

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
we can solve this together there's no

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.219 
we can solve this together there's no
reason<00:01:32.520> why<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.700> can't<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.450> there<00:01:34.140> were

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
reason why we can't do this there were

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
reason why we can't do this there were
many<00:01:34.439> times<00:01:34.740> during<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> project<00:01:35.310> where

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
many times during the project where

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.149 
many times during the project where
Matthew<00:01:36.720> would<00:01:36.930> stand<00:01:37.229> there<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.590> Oates<00:01:37.860> down

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
Matthew would stand there and Oates down

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.530 
Matthew would stand there and Oates down
with<00:01:38.340> him<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.670> would<00:01:38.820> look<00:01:38.970> around<00:01:39.329> each

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
with him and we would look around each

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.569 
with him and we would look around each
other<00:01:39.780> along<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.619> everybody<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.430> would

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
other along with everybody and we would

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.130 
other along with everybody and we would
hit<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> brick<00:01:42.000> wall<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.780> easy<00:01:42.930> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
hit a brick wall and it's so easy to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.380 
hit a brick wall and it's so easy to
take<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> path<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.890> least<00:01:43.950> resistance<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.850> say

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
take the path of least resistance I say

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.569 
take the path of least resistance I say
well<00:01:45.570> we'll<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.750> cut<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> corner<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.369> that's

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
well we'll just cut a corner and that's

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.910 
well we'll just cut a corner and that's
why<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:47.970> taken<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.450> long<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:49.049> really<00:01:49.619> put

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
why it's taken this long to really put

this<00:01:50.040> vessel<00:01:50.399> together<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:51.540> decided

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
this vessel together because we decided

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.450 
this vessel together because we decided
not<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.290> take<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.500> part<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:52.950> resistance

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
not to take the part of this resistance
