going to walk around to this side of the
bike<00:01:30.659> right<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.460> drop<00:01:32.460> down<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
bike right here drop down here to the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.230 
bike right here drop down here to the
exhaust<00:01:33.890> there's<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.070> little<00:01:35.310> 250<00:01:35.759> motors<00:01:36.030> for

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
exhaust there's a little 250 motors for

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.690 
exhaust there's a little 250 motors for
them<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.750> set<00:01:36.930> right<00:01:37.110> here<00:01:40.430> when<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.549> get

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
them on this set right here when I get

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.140 
them on this set right here when I get
up<00:01:41.850> here

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
up here

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.500 
up here
look<00:01:43.659> at<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.900> wheels<00:01:44.110> on<00:01:44.770> this<00:01:44.979> bike<00:01:45.450> try<00:01:46.450> to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
look at the wheels on this bike try to

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.490 
look at the wheels on this bike try to
get<00:01:46.799> close<00:01:47.799> here<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:49.180> try<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:49.840> get<00:01:50.020> close<00:01:50.260> here

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
get close here but try to get close here

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.010 
get close here but try to get close here
so<00:01:50.650> everybody<00:01:50.979> would<00:01:51.130> see<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:52.600> there's

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
so everybody would see but there's

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.540 
so everybody would see but there's
absolutely<00:01:54.180> no<00:01:57.869> tire<00:01:58.869> spin<00:01:59.710> marks<00:02:00.159> on<00:02:00.369> this

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
absolutely no tire spin marks on this

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.490 
absolutely no tire spin marks on this
wheel<00:02:00.820> that<00:02:01.600> wheels<00:02:01.840> probably<00:02:02.229> one<00:02:02.350> of<00:02:02.380> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
wheel that wheels probably one of the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.020 
wheel that wheels probably one of the
cleanest<00:02:02.860> front<00:02:03.100> wheels<00:02:03.310> I've<00:02:03.520> ever<00:02:03.759> seen

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
cleanest front wheels I've ever seen

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.810 
cleanest front wheels I've ever seen
come<00:02:04.869> on<00:02:04.960> by<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.710> back<00:02:05.890> wheel<00:02:06.159> looks<00:02:06.399> like<00:02:06.610> it

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
come on by the back wheel looks like it

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.290 
come on by the back wheel looks like it
might<00:02:07.000> possibly<00:02:07.869> have<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.640> spoon<00:02:09.640> put<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.179> at

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
might possibly have a spoon put on it at

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.260 
might possibly have a spoon put on it at
one<00:02:10.450> time<00:02:10.479> or<00:02:10.720> another<00:02:11.459> maybe<00:02:12.459> this<00:02:13.000> may<00:02:13.209> be

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
one time or another maybe this may be

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.600 
one time or another maybe this may be
the<00:02:13.540> second<00:02:14.440> tire<00:02:14.620> actually<00:02:15.190> came<00:02:15.370> on<00:02:15.519> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
the second tire actually came on the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.130 
the second tire actually came on the
bike<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:18.550> parent<00:02:18.970> look<00:02:19.090> at<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.269> miles<00:02:19.600> on<00:02:19.989> the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
bike the parent look at the miles on the
