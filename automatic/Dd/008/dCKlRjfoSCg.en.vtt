00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.059
 the barkworm known as the mistletoe in the carob tree 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.359
 attack with the virulent and forests of the Sierra Gorda de Querétaro 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:20.890
 essentially in the highlands as is the case in Landa de Matamoros an area 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.000
 where mounts hills and canyons and capricious forms extend people 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.879
 the 350 and three thousand 100 meters above sea level just in this 

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.559
 request the zone the state of querétaro that is considered as the 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.600
 eastern center of the country according to authorities and experts the attack and 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.480
 registered five years ago 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.060
 and it has to do with palpitations in the rainy and thundering regime 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.020
 precisely to climate change 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.570
 the phenomenon seriously threatens the whole area protected by the government 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.540
 Mexican that declared it in the year 1997 a biosphere reserve and for 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.350
 organization of the united nations for education science and 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.030
 unesco culture that proclaimed in 2001 a reserve of the world biosphere 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.149
 Many villagers say that forests are weak 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.920
 and that's why the worm is stronger 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.340
 this is because the rains came down and now everything is drier 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.830
 the trees are dying say many 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.140
 the trees are growing 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.360
 the society in general sees with concern this serious problem 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.180
 for wild that his whole life has been in this place for wild that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.650
 consider that here he will die 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.650
 and here to leave much of its heritage 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.940
 he says he did not destroy trees he would be expelled doctor 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.450
 I am filling them again with an opportunity for the forest 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.950
 do one day what it was in the past 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.630
 the use explains how the late weaves of this place of the bad roll landa of 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.580
 Matamoros is fighting to save his life 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.690
 of many 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.240
 many trees but for many 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.420
 it would seem otherwise
