00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello here is my review geely emgrand 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.440
 for the group emgrand russia and start with 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.620
 what I redid redid the lattice 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.179
 radiator installed in the mesh and cut 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:19.470
 sidebands redid the saber painted 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.880
 black made headlights this give birth 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.420
 or booze in black 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.400
 set angel eyes and set 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.580
 dipped xenon in the high beam 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.160
 initially there was also a movie but then from 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.370
 give it up because it is impossible 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.610
 blink in the car in front 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.629
 Dimensions installed LED front 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.329
 fog lights 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:48.090
 also installed xenon daytime running 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:52.199
 LEDs installed labor replaced 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:57.570
 the frame number made cilia on the headlights 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:00.020
 so on disks repainted me wheels 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.280
 it seems to look prettier 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.740
 repainted calipers in red 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.000
 further installed chrome on the door under 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.920
 business class looks much 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.780
 representatives well the car immediately 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.670
 went up for me 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.690
 back hut, respectively, where 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.670
 repainted also repainted support 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:29.830
 further toned rear lights 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.009
 I like it but I can give advice not 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.880
 do it yourself better consult salon 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:41.170
 you will be made much cheaper and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.380
 better quality is what they say dimensions 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.979
 have everything shine all right 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:55.060
 I have no problems with this further 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.990
 who did not glue the grant on 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.740
 the back of the blue looks like it seems to me 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.500
 it is better 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.590
 the same colored disk painted 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:11.290
 caliper made lining installed 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.300
 front, respectively, further probably 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.010
 noticed 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.550
 mounted fin fin is not a model 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.799
 actually acting antenna 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:28.060
 I installed when doing Shumkov in the cabin 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:31.420
 did as stretched the cable under the upholstery 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.079
 the roofs through this small stand 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.310
 removed as 10 cap we have 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:42.090
 open it then we have a bolt 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.700
 unscrew and pull over there 3 or 4 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:53.739
 latches they are easily removed spent 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:55.450
 rack on the floor and started in a torpedo started in 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.540
 torpedo but also connected respectively to 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.890
 tape recorder further what else is done here 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.320
 set the dvr mirror 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.100
 rear view 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:13.890
 here probably not seen how she removes but 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:17.350
 Generally this is a video recorder cable 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:21.220
 Feeder spent behind the upholstery small stands 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:25.030
 and through the torpedo once turned it on this 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.330
 outlets directly inside the torpedo 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.910
 further set 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:37.270
 backlight 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:42.260
 feet here in front and respectively behind 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:44.990
 then the second is very beautiful 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.910
 button is my jet washer 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.520
 headlights well here are the nozzles that we saw well 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.850
 and proper 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.870
 probably all the cabin and still stuck 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.770
 behind 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:04.820
 column did not touch the shelf left as it is 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:09.500
 was in its original form did not want it 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:13.450
 alter well let's go further in the trunk 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:17.770
 what was remade trunk 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.720
 I installed in the trunk 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.220
 led strip is now day 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.000
 respectively seen bad standing 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:31.660
 a little gleaming here but also in sight 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.300
 columns so they had to cut a little bit 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:40.130
 body because regular speakers are 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.260
 just say so dwarfs in their place 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:48.290
 stick something bigger just 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:55.130
 unreal photo shows bag our bag 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:58.580
 by the way it came out very cool on 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:02.050
 the car has become much quieter in the front 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.050
 my doors are set 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:09.710
 with no door installed 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.669
 logos and front right 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.669
 accordingly also 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:22.169
 so here's the hood 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:25.069
 under the hood we basically have nothing 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.069
 reworked 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:35.830
 repainted single engine cover 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.000
 the headlight washer penetrated the puppy was the first 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:53.500
 secured 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:57.310
 Now it's over with us here 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.470
 fuse though new for 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:04.090
 LED lights bottoms and are brought 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.380
 all the way to the headlight jet 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:16.130
 LED backlight bottom probably 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:19.700
 now we will not see but the light is brighter 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:29.150
 Accordingly, you highlight the bottom a lot 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:32.080
 modes and here are 8 colors and an additional 4 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.080
 glow mode 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:39.669
 completely did 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:44.740
 soundproofing anticorrosive itself did the bottom 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:48.590
 made anti-gravity still further 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:52.690
 makes it easy in the cabin 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.690
 for that you give a lot of money 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.500
 here 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:11.350
 Well, in general, the car arranges the engine 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.670
 pretty frisky run well checked 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.880
 maximum speed 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:19.750
 I drove around the ring 208 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:28.510
 accelerated in principle think kilometers 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:30.810
 5-6 still could but unfortunately did not give the car 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.810
 beautiful
