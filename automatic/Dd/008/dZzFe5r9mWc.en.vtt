00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880

may have noticed that there have been

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.529 
may have noticed that there have been
random<00:06:07.260> letters<00:06:07.919> and<00:06:08.220> numbers<00:06:08.400> popping<00:06:08.970> up<00:06:09.330> on

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
random letters and numbers popping up on

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:12.710 
random letters and numbers popping up on
screen<00:06:10.530> if<00:06:11.010> you<00:06:11.430> go<00:06:11.669> back<00:06:11.820> to<00:06:12.000> the<00:06:12.120> video<00:06:12.270> and

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
screen if you go back to the video and

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.100 
screen if you go back to the video and
you<00:06:12.840> write<00:06:13.199> those<00:06:13.710> letters<00:06:13.860> and<00:06:14.310> numbers<00:06:14.460> down

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
you write those letters and numbers down

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.930 
you write those letters and numbers down
that<00:06:16.110> is<00:06:16.470> your<00:06:16.770> beta<00:06:17.010> code<00:06:17.340> be<00:06:17.520> sure<00:06:17.699> that<00:06:17.849> you

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
that is your beta code be sure that you

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.180 
that is your beta code be sure that you
keep<00:06:18.090> the<00:06:18.270> colors<00:06:18.599> together<00:06:18.810> so<00:06:19.349> all<00:06:19.620> the

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
keep the colors together so all the

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.120 
keep the colors together so all the
purple<00:06:20.639> letters<00:06:21.449> and<00:06:21.630> numbers<00:06:21.750> that<00:06:22.349> is<00:06:22.680> one

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
purple letters and numbers that is one

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.730 
purple letters and numbers that is one
beta<00:06:23.490> code<00:06:23.820> all<00:06:24.060> the<00:06:24.330> red<00:06:24.570> ones<00:06:24.840> if<00:06:25.050> you<00:06:25.440> get

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
beta code all the red ones if you get

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.070 
beta code all the red ones if you get
all<00:06:25.860> the<00:06:26.039> red<00:06:26.220> ones<00:06:26.460> and<00:06:26.639> put<00:06:27.150> it<00:06:27.240> in<00:06:27.419> that's

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
all the red ones and put it in that's

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.779 
all the red ones and put it in that's
one<00:06:28.440> code<00:06:28.740> so<00:06:28.979> you've<00:06:29.160> got<00:06:29.190> to<00:06:29.430> figure<00:06:29.520> out

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
one code so you've got to figure out

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.939 
one code so you've got to figure out
which<00:06:30.120> one<00:06:30.389> you<00:06:30.539> want<00:06:30.690> to<00:06:30.780> go<00:06:30.900> for<00:06:31.169> write<00:06:31.800> them

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
which one you want to go for write them

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.010 
which one you want to go for write them
down<00:06:31.979> and<00:06:32.520> then<00:06:32.669> go<00:06:32.880> back<00:06:33.090> and<00:06:33.150> enter<00:06:33.690> the<00:06:33.720> beta

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
down and then go back and enter the beta

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.170 
down and then go back and enter the beta
code<00:06:34.320> and<00:06:34.590> the<00:06:34.949> first<00:06:35.159> ones<00:06:35.400> to<00:06:35.490> do<00:06:35.640> that<00:06:35.880> is

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
code and the first ones to do that is

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.980 
code and the first ones to do that is
going<00:06:36.870> to<00:06:37.380> win<00:06:37.950> the<00:06:38.640> beta<00:06:38.880> codes<00:06:39.240> so<00:06:39.659> it's<00:06:39.840> all

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
going to win the beta codes so it's all

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.700 
going to win the beta codes so it's all
right

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
right

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.830 
right
there<00:06:40.830> you<00:06:40.980> have<00:06:41.160> all<00:06:41.430> the<00:06:41.610> information<00:06:41.880> you

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
there you have all the information you

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.220 
there you have all the information you
need<00:06:42.870> now<00:06:43.290> I<00:06:43.320> did<00:06:43.620> tell<00:06:43.920> you<00:06:44.450> that<00:06:45.450> you<00:06:45.930> you

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
need now I did tell you that you you

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.690 
need now I did tell you that you you
needed<00:06:46.440> to<00:06:46.530> watch<00:06:46.770> the<00:06:46.950> whole<00:06:47.100> video<00:06:47.250> so

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.700 
needed to watch the whole video so

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.850 
needed to watch the whole video so
already<00:06:48.540> probably<00:06:48.930> a<00:06:49.170> lot<00:06:49.440> of<00:06:49.560> people<00:06:49.770> are

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
already probably a lot of people are

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.550 
already probably a lot of people are
already<00:06:50.070> going<00:06:50.430> back<00:06:50.760> through<00:06:51.150> and<00:06:51.560> watching

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
already going back through and watching

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.530 
already going back through and watching
the<00:06:53.040> video<00:06:53.310> to<00:06:53.400> write<00:06:53.730> down<00:06:53.760> the<00:06:54.090> letters<00:06:54.360> and

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:54.540 
the video to write down the letters and

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.890 
the video to write down the letters and
numbers<00:06:54.630> that's<00:06:55.110> that's<00:06:55.410> great<00:06:55.530> no<00:06:55.920> but

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
numbers that's that's great no but

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.180 
numbers that's that's great no but
they're<00:06:57.900> going<00:06:58.080> to<00:06:58.260> enter<00:06:58.470> their<00:06:58.590> codes<00:06:58.920> and

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
they're going to enter their codes and

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.400 
they're going to enter their codes and
it's<00:06:59.310> going<00:06:59.520> to<00:06:59.610> be<00:06:59.700> wrong<00:06:59.940> because<00:07:00.210> the<00:07:01.140> codes

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
it's going to be wrong because the codes

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.400 
it's going to be wrong because the codes
are<00:07:01.620> actually<00:07:02.130> completely<00:07:02.610> backwards<00:07:03.300> so<00:07:03.870> the

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.410 
are actually completely backwards so the

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.370 
are actually completely backwards so the
last<00:07:04.710> number<00:07:05.220> or<00:07:05.610> letter<00:07:05.640> that<00:07:06.570> you<00:07:06.780> see<00:07:07.110> is

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 
last number or letter that you see is

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.010 
last number or letter that you see is
actually<00:07:07.950> the<00:07:08.430> first<00:07:08.730> number<00:07:09.120> or<00:07:09.480> letter<00:07:09.510> in

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020

up winning one of the codes and write
down<00:07:44.310> the<00:07:44.550> codes<00:07:44.850> so<00:07:45.240> we<00:07:45.420> all<00:07:45.570> know<00:07:45.600> that<00:07:45.840> that

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.410 
down the codes so we all know that that

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.620 
down the codes so we all know that that
is<00:07:46.680> used<00:07:47.190> up<00:07:47.430> so<00:07:47.460> people<00:07:47.760> aren't<00:07:48.090> searching
