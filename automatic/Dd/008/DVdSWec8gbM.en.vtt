00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello to you again clarke of 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.319
 bikes next mods review if i 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.429
 could add new types of stoves it on 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.950
 really awesome 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.290
 let's see what kind of appearance and songs 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.289
 will help only 6 or 5 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.710
 for a start we will need for all 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.779
 species 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.630
 six stone ovens i.e. one by one 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:28.460
 you can at least one to one of the first 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:32.360
 time there will be an iron stove so 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.079
 But on the iron it turned out 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.079
 unevenly 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:50.950
 iron stove key 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:52.570
 I throw exactly went for the cotton oven and 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.080
 like this 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.809
 golden stoves and then you will be 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.129
 diamond furnace 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:05.600
 diamond stove you are so smart 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.220
 brighten you started all the ovens and then 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:14.660
 we will look at their effectiveness 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:18.970
 Further, we have the official stove and reception 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.970
 black guys serif urns and cattle and 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.880
 this dish is a carved hellish stove like this 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.090
 here time the scene is not so much like she is like 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.320
 times with stone 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:39.649
 Well, 1 stove us just no where to estimate 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.630
 we will not put a jacket on age 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.659
 Sid 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:49.649
 almano is not germination sooner because 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.789
 Now they are increasing, but here they are not very well. 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.859
 Well, let's see how they work 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:03.230
 something we lack we miss 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:09.280
 coal strange let's remove myasko 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:14.170
 a little on collect and take yourself coal 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:18.380
 immediately make a word 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.500
 Well, well, this oven turns out well, look 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.320
 on amber in this stove fits 2 so 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:31.730
 coal that's how these below and 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:34.130
 2 cups meat but but as if pressed 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.490
 only one meat ie one coal 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.070
 in two 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.060
 that is, as if mom is not a warehouse so that 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.530
 you did not have to resort to caves there 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.750
 put the coal in and running back maybe 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.700
 shove more and leave the whole 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.850
 this extra slot so all 2 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.570
 Stack on month you here go further 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.770
 next we have a golden drink and here at all 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:01.640
 everything is gorgeous 400 round 400k meat and 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:05.420
 for some reason, 5 cells for heating steel 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.720
 not warming up but for the result that we have 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.550
 It turns out I do not know why further with 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.160
 diamond here in general of course all when 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.850
 the mass is simply super 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.370
 more strange I do not understand why well 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.380
 here we have 7 cells of this wall 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.200
 that is, seven Sakas coal we can put 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.560
 and 7 starkov meat let's name the dispute we have 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.110
 what is the Caucasus 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.489
 Well, one grandee of course 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.459
 as you can see the speed is also changing 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:43.140
 the speed is more acceptable to all of the iron 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:44.459
 Stream gold 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.250
 well, gold is a little slower 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:51.930
 look at this question fires one coal 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:57.239
 spent and 10 already there yet you are watching 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:00.470
 how much coal do we have up to 1 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:06.620
 much well what is it that turned us 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:10.170
 the stove is smart and here we have obsidian 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.720
 obsidian stove we have here on what 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.590
 different no over part of course one 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:21.710
 but pretty good meaning she can 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:25.639
 two products at once but slightly 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.639
 like a fireplace and stove 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.669
 wpa2 product is far that will be faster 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.979
 this one or this diamond will of course 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.660
 faster even if she overcooks one 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.710
 the place will be to us but only slightly 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.350
 faster like this and as you can see it works and 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.449
 the last oven is our hellish stove 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.300
 it does not require coal 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:52.150
 does not require at all their resources are not 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:57.080
 requires except one but I set fire to and 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:59.300
 it will work but one just 5 I donâ€™t know 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.789
 just global just awful what 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.000
 big minus 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:08.260
 she overcooks one meat but I will inform 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.639
 one ore any any something any 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:16.460
 two minutes 120 seconds just 120 seconds 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:19.130
 ride here for 20 seconds but there are pluses 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.610
 if you go to hell you can do 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:26.270
 yourself a hundred such bichik there as 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.009
 a lot of this stone is not sorry for him and then 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.379
 you will be 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.530
 unlimited some kind of limitless 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:36.370
 sing or don't know what can there 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.530
 build craft industrial to love 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.050
 pipes can I not remember it too well, when 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.479
 I can start a pipe to put a match 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.349
 the share was resources ie consider it 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:50.659
 just an endless generator or something 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:53.449
 generator yes i am clear will he be a robot 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:55.520
 I crafted it okay 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:59.270
 today it's a great mod 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.370
 came the fire and stopped working that well, 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.319
