 double click or execute as 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.320
 administrator as you want 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.239
 window that is the window of the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.680
 next aquileana installation no 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.900

 des palomea in this option here 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.400
 ileana nets 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.190
 they leave everything as it is here ileana 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.990
 next choose a location where 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.869
 they want to install they are thanked as 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.240
 I was already in the next one and they have 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.450
 install 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.340
 will start the installation maybe lasted a 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.340
 couple of minutes but not many 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.719
 I went back to tell you that this program does not 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.649
 it only comes when more programs 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:38.280
 which is called mp3 download air and the video 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.280
 ch 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.549
 this program is totally free no 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.970
 you need to register or nothing is in 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.970
 Spanish 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.410
 now this little window will be opened 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:21.990
 they tell him that they must select their language 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.940
 I'm going to select the Spanish Ileana 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.940
 ok and accept 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.250
 well as made and installed 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.250
 they give him to finish 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.330
 as you can see here are the two programs 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.200
 I told him that he came with the program 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.410
 mp3 download air and the video do the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.250
 first program the mp3 downloaders serves 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.050
 to download music for free 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.040
 It is much better than the air it 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.620
 I recommend that you use it and the video search 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.770
 'ciro' to download videos from youtube 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.070
 totally free obvious 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.950
