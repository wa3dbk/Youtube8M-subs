00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
going spend a lot of time on us this

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.680 
going spend a lot of time on us this
week<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.230> things<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.829> did<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:50.449> excel<00:00:51.449> in

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
week but things that we did not excel in

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.660 
week but things that we did not excel in
are<00:00:51.899> definitely<00:00:52.860> correctable<00:00:53.340> those<00:00:53.550> are

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
are definitely correctable those are

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.880 
are definitely correctable those are
things<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.420> control<00:00:54.840> over<00:00:54.890> making

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
things that we have control over making

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.520 
things that we have control over making
free<00:00:56.039> throws<00:00:56.070> making<00:00:56.640> layups<00:00:57.050> not<00:00:58.050> committing

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
free throws making layups not committing

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
free throws making layups not committing
so<00:00:58.680> many<00:00:58.859> fouls<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.489> think<00:00:59.969> those<00:01:00.120> are<00:01:00.149> areas

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
so many fouls I think those are areas

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.939 
so many fouls I think those are areas
where<00:01:00.780> we've<00:01:00.989> got<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.350> more<00:01:01.500> disciplined

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
where we've got to be more disciplined

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.500 
where we've got to be more disciplined
and<00:01:02.190> more<00:01:02.430> committed<00:01:02.730> when<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.120> look<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and more committed when we look at the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.230 
and more committed when we look at the
overall<00:01:03.799> game<00:01:04.799> plan<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.729> taking<00:01:06.000> care<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
overall game plan and taking care of the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
overall game plan and taking care of the
basketball<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.900> mean<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.950> had<00:01:08.100> over<00:01:08.189> 20

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
basketball I mean we we had over 20

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280 
basketball I mean we we had over 20
turnovers<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.119> game<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.049> know<00:01:10.140> those

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
turnovers in that game so you know those

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.210 
turnovers in that game so you know those
are<00:01:10.409> little<00:01:10.500> things<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.950> we've<00:01:11.070> been

to<00:01:16.650> defend<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.610> rebound<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.390> that's<00:01:18.570> what

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
to defend and rebound but that's what

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.999
