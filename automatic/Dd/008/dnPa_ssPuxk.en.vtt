00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.829
 is hello and welcome here 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.480
 tobi from teck impact welcome 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.920
 this new video 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.960
 I've had it on twitter before 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.550
 announced that it is here to the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.180
 he will give classics here again 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.399
 is revived 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.739
 and that's the same in a double sense 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.680
 because once we become here windows 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.019
 nt look what a yes already 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.870
 one piece is old and the other I will 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.559
 revive the retro review videos 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.330
 and we will continue in the windows 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.009
 go back to history 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.320
 windows 1.0 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.580
 but here goes only once primarily about 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.700
 windows nt windows m is the successor 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.210
 from windows 98 and the last one 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.740
 operating system of this new xl how to man 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.560
 so pretty should say 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.050
 followers give before binding sam 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.880
 was already released windows 2000 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.500
 what belongs to the windows nt row i am 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.110
 the you here just in time so the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.170
 windows ancestry history of 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.110
 windows pedigree and actually should 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.220
 it however no windows give 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.970
 the development of. was delayed 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.429
 windows 2000 for home users and who 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.970
 paid attention in the last retro 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.390
 videos made eight years ago 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.489
 were 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.860
 who will surely know that 

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:58.929
 this successor windows xp was then 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.119
 so windows xp was almost the same for 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.940
 home user designed nt 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.220
 operating system as it says but was 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.679
 not finished the work delayed 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.860
 itself and so looked microsoft in 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.920
 zugzwang and brought out here windows 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.150
 the whole thing was on 14 september 2000 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.530
 published and supported until 2006 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.720
 as the one or the other already 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.690
 had this system in 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.430
 the relatively bad reputation and also 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.330
 some mistakes are here in the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.610
 programming had crept in 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.180
 assuming a hold was tight intel 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:43.060
 pentium processor with 150 megahertz yes 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.760
 mega 32 megabyte ram 320 megabyte 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.590
 memory space and a cd rom drive 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.140
 as well as a floppy disk drive 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.269
 These were the requirements for windows 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.170
 98 to operate oh god to windows m 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.690
 to evict 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.300
 that was something for those times 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.739
 the memory space is already on again 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.519
 entrance so step forward not 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.379
 absolutely so well arrived 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.519
 what 's new features we have 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.930
 they want it a little bit like that 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.360
 Look first principle would be natural 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.629
 the look and feel is in principle 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.950
 relatively similar to windows 98 you 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.480
 Incidentally, you can follow the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.549
 video synonymous directly right now 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.500
 look there you will notice that 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:27.459
 windows 98 looks very similar 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.980
 ms windows Juno easily refresh 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.569
 were with a new wallpaper 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.790
 which actually only a monochrome 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.150
 background picture was not really 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.190
 so step forward now 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.920
 However, it is generally very small 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.840
 tick nicely, however, it became 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.250
 Often it criticizes that just not so 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.079
 contains many new features 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.810
 what do we have on features we have the 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.940
 internet explorer 5.5 years ago 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.359
 another feature that is here now 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.069
 unfortunately already the internet explorer 6 and 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:01.959
 if we look at this here 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:04.930
 day - impact punkt.de let's go 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.639
 by the way, he hears this little one 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.440
 click still when calling the end 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:12.420
 times as soon as they come 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.609
 memories up again 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.979
 yes, this is the effect of this page 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.510
 Of course, you are far from seeing any more 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.519
 on the current state of technology 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.300
 even if that already here 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:29.220
 version 6.0 is new were also the 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.680
 rest when we look here 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.900
 standby we can select in German 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.200
 what then the high state in which the 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.599
 system is still kept active 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.220
 also switched off the pc in principle 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:46.900
 we also have this car 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.240
 update as I almost do not say yet 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.710
 but such a pseudo automatic 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.750
 update function the windows update via 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.520
 windows update was not new, however 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.440
 that automatically install in the 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.920
 background he just sees it here 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.340
 update server gives itself more 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.080
 that's why we have to click here 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.430
 however, that you have the updates 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.440
 automatically install in the background 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.460
 that was new and could be left here 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.730
 of course it is aimed 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.470
 Home users the least possible with 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.210
 have to do their pc they wanted to 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.620
 deal with it as little as possible 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.000
 wanted to 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.730
 I'm that the plaintiffs on the bag 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.860
 then there were the 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.910
 system recovery , let's look 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.160
 times to the whole 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.750
 this is what we have here under program 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:35.510
 Accessories the system tools and system 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.040
 restore systems will be the production 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.090
 one or the other certainly know that 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.790
 there are still today 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.800
 that is the pc is at certain 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:48.680
 points automatically into the net caught the 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.450
 means you are smaller and quieter photo 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.920
 the last end of the system was like that 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:56.990
 at the time and that will be when 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.360
 you would like that restored 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.250
 Of course this is not a full backup 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.680
 but that only considers certain 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.900
 System files just for the operation 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.450
 are important and if necessary and 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.190
 haid could be broken because of one 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.930
 Another reason you would do it here 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.000
 Do not do that as something 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.130
 more works and you see now 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.630
 already at the length of the videos this 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.640
 not really many new features 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.010
 it was just that 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.090
 a bit yes we have to go fast 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.460
 bring out another operating system 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.160
 because we do not have windows xp right now 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.080
 create the right time 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.210
 The model of many pc magazine too 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.710
 denounced at the time that is not 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.780
 really many innovations brought her 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.290
 windows m 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:41.660
 and as I said since 2006 is the support 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.550
 to the end and I just hope that 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.100
 none of you still in any one 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.410
 Variation used here as I am here 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.840
 just to look at it again 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.300
 how it was at the time when you were still 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.160
 you have questions about the system or me 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.990
 something on this should try and 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.940
 Let's not start with gta 5 now 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:02.330
 then it might be like in the comments 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.370
 Write or like to tech 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.940
 impact page under the point question 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.950
 put 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.570
 I thank you for watching and 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.530
 As always, we take each other in the next 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.530
 video to 1
