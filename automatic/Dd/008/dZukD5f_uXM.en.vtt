00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
downloads tab and what that does is

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.330 
downloads tab and what that does is
you're<00:05:20.409> going<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.590> have<00:05:20.710> to<00:05:20.830> install<00:05:21.130> it<00:05:21.190> right

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340
