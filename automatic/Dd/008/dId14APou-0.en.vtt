to learn the enemy's patterns the enemy
starts<00:01:35.609> one<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.060> about<00:01:36.299> five<00:01:36.719> animations<00:01:37.560> from

starts one of about five animations from
the<00:01:38.069> starting<00:01:38.429> animation<00:01:38.999> you<00:01:39.179> need<00:01:39.389> to

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
the starting animation you need to

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.389 
the starting animation you need to
figure<00:01:39.779> out<00:01:40.049> what<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.649> response<00:01:41.100> should<00:01:41.340> be

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
figure out what the response should be

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.879 
figure out what the response should be
there<00:01:42.149> typically<00:01:42.569> about<00:01:43.020> two<00:01:43.289> preferable

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:43.889 
there typically about two preferable

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:46.190 
there typically about two preferable
responses<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.939> give<00:01:45.149> often<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> is

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
responses you can give often it is

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840

every<00:03:59.480> game<00:03:59.720> needs<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.230> push<00:04:00.440> innovation<00:04:00.680> to

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
every game needs to push innovation to

every game needs to push innovation to
the<00:04:01.340> edge<00:04:01.489> at<00:04:01.849> every<00:04:02.209> second<00:04:02.660> of<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.989> day

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
the edge at every second of the day

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.500

understand<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.079> this<00:04:21.260> review<00:04:21.680> is<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:21.859> little

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
understand that this review is a little

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.950 
understand that this review is a little
off<00:04:22.400> base<00:04:22.669> with<00:04:23.030> how<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.300> review<00:04:23.900> should

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
off base with how a review should

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.620 
off base with how a review should
theoretically<00:04:24.380> be<00:04:24.949> typically<00:04:25.729> done<00:04:25.969> but<00:04:26.599> I

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
theoretically be typically done but I

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.480 
theoretically be typically done but I
believe<00:04:26.990> it's<00:04:27.229> important<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.800> point<00:04:28.010> out<00:04:28.130> to

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
believe it's important to point out to

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.339 
believe it's important to point out to
the<00:04:28.610> world<00:04:28.789> what<00:04:29.030> this<00:04:29.300> game<00:04:29.570> specifically

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
the world what this game specifically

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:31.450 
the world what this game specifically
isn't
