00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
one of these different blocks does so in

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.040 
one of these different blocks does so in
the<00:00:20.189> back<00:00:20.400> over<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.180> know<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.660> textures

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the back over here I know that textures

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.210 
the back over here I know that textures
aren't<00:00:22.230> great<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:22.560> hopefully<00:00:22.980> they'll<00:00:23.100> be

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
aren't great but hopefully they'll be

improved in the new update we have the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.519 
improved in the new update we have the
tunnel<00:00:26.250> boring<00:00:26.460> machine<00:00:26.880> ejector<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.779> this

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
tunnel boring machine ejector and this

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.189 
tunnel boring machine ejector and this
block<00:00:28.800> will<00:00:29.039> actually<00:00:29.640> eject<00:00:30.150> anything<00:00:31.080> that

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
block will actually eject anything that

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.470 
block will actually eject anything that
comes<00:00:31.289> out<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.769> back<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.489> machine<00:00:33.450> I

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
comes out of the back of the machine I

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.760 
comes out of the back of the machine I
don't<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:33.809> think<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.200> useful<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.710> a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
don't really think it's that useful of a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.959 
don't really think it's that useful of a
block<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.040> doesn't<00:00:35.430> really<00:00:35.550> need<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.790> worry

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
block you doesn't really need to worry

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.880 
block you doesn't really need to worry
about<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.320> want<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.559> get<00:00:37.710> more

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
actually have the tunnel boring machine

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.729 
actually have the tunnel boring machine
filler<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.960> block<00:00:49.260> will<00:00:49.289> actually

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
you're you have the machine going this

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.790 
you're you have the machine going this
way<00:00:54.149> which<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.539> north<00:00:54.809> will<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> car

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
way which is north will have a car

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.229 
way which is north will have a car
machine<00:00:56.039> gun<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.399> way<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.789> mod<00:00:56.969> review

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
machine gun this way for this mod review

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.779 
machine gun this way for this mod review
the<00:00:57.690> actual<00:00:58.199> filler<00:00:58.500> will<00:00:59.010> place<00:00:59.280> really<00:00:59.640> any

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the actual filler will place really any

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.939 
the actual filler will place really any
block<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.210> want<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.570> behind<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.559> actual

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
block you want to behind the actual

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.009 
block you want to behind the actual
machine<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.969> could<00:01:03.180> put<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> diamond

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
machine so I could put in like a diamond

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 
machine so I could put in like a diamond
right<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.280> would<00:01:05.400> place<00:01:05.580> diamond

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
right there and it would place diamond

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.910 
right there and it would place diamond
blocks<00:01:06.119> behind<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.750> machine<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.560> that's<00:01:07.740> that

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
blocks behind the machine so that's that

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.350 
blocks behind the machine so that's that
we<00:01:08.100> also<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.729> cool<00:01:08.970> little<00:01:09.000> la

Machine<00:01:11.310> platform<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.810> where

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
Machine platform and this is just where

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.270 
Machine platform and this is just where
you<00:01:12.990> stand<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.500> will<00:01:13.650> actually<00:01:13.830> move

you stand on this will actually move
with<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> machine<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.390> which<00:01:15.600> i<00:01:15.750> think

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
with the machine with that which i think

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.490 
with the machine with that which i think
is<00:01:16.049> pretty<00:01:16.259> cool<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:17.479> yeah<00:01:18.479> right<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.080> you

is pretty cool and yeah right here you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.050 
is pretty cool and yeah right here you
can<00:01:19.619> tell<00:01:19.770> there's<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> lot<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.220> little<00:01:20.610> Dinis

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
can tell there's a lot of little Dinis

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.399 
can tell there's a lot of little Dinis
and<00:01:21.270> lights<00:01:21.509> going<00:01:21.750> off<00:01:21.900> right<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and lights going off right here this is

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.350 
and lights going off right here this is
the<00:01:22.590> actual<00:01:22.770> engine<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.490> make<00:01:23.909> sure<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.150> put

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
the actual engine and make sure you put

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.460 
the actual engine and make sure you put
a<00:01:24.390> coal<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> engine<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.320> does

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a coal in the engine because it does

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.190 
a coal in the engine because it does
need<00:01:25.619> cool<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> actually<00:01:26.189> run<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.080> just<00:01:28.080> make

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
need cool to actually run and just make

you can see that we can go this way or

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.180 
you can see that we can go this way or
the<00:02:55.350> other<00:02:55.380> way<00:02:55.620> we're<00:02:55.860> going<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.040> go<00:02:56.100> with

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
the other way we're going to go with

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.380 
the other way we're going to go with
other<00:02:56.370> way<00:02:56.520> but<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:56.880> see<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.030> actually

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
other way but you can see that actually

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.970 
other way but you can see that actually
stopped<00:02:57.750> right<00:02:58.020> here<00:02:58.050> because<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.530> can't<00:02:58.739> plow

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
stopped right here because it can't plow

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.320 
stopped right here because it can't plow
through<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.280> because<00:02:59.520> there's<00:02:59.700> no<00:02:59.820> drillers

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
through that because there's no drillers

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.780 
through that because there's no drillers
there<00:03:00.570> obviously<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.980> we<00:03:02.040> want<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.310> head<00:03:02.430> south

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
there obviously so we want to head south

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.250 
there obviously so we want to head south
I<00:03:02.940> don't<00:03:03.060> know<00:03:03.150> why<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.330> says<00:03:03.600> North<00:03:03.870> now<00:03:04.050> okay

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
I don't know why it says North now okay

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.410 
I don't know why it says North now okay
so<00:03:04.350> we're<00:03:04.440> going<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.620> head<00:03:04.709> south<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.420> our

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
so we're going to head south and our

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.760 
so we're going to head south and our
little<00:03:06.690> drills<00:03:06.989> kind<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.260> have<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> little

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
little drills kind of have a little

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.560 
little drills kind of have a little
texture<00:03:08.160> change<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.640> front<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.480> will

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
texture change in the front and it will

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.729 
texture change in the front and it will
now<00:03:09.690> drill<00:03:09.989> through<00:03:10.170> anything<00:03:10.380> that's<00:03:10.650> in

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
now drill through anything that's in

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.350 
now drill through anything that's in
front<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.160> that's<00:03:11.550> kind<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.790> why<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:11.940> set<00:03:12.239> up

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
front of it that's kind of why I set up

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.820 
front of it that's kind of why I set up
all<00:03:12.480> these<00:03:12.600> blocks<00:03:12.959> over<00:03:13.170> here<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:13.650> we<00:03:13.739> can

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
all these blocks over here so we can

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.010 
all these blocks over here so we can
kind<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.040> test<00:03:14.250> out<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.580> see<00:03:14.760> what<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.630> looks

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
kind of test out and see what it looks

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.060 
kind of test out and see what it looks
like<00:03:16.200> I'm<00:03:16.350> kind<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.590> running<00:03:16.709> out<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:16.920> breath

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
like I'm kind of running out of breath

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.680 
like I'm kind of running out of breath
here<00:03:17.160> but<00:03:17.519> uh<00:03:17.549> all<00:03:17.880> right<00:03:17.940> let's<00:03:18.299> go<00:03:18.450> ahead<00:03:18.570> and

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
here but uh all right let's go ahead and

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.720 
here but uh all right let's go ahead and
see<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.890> can<00:03:20.010> see<00:03:20.100> it's<00:03:20.220> doing<00:03:20.430> kind<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.640> a

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
see and you can see it's doing kind of a

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.890 
see and you can see it's doing kind of a
cool<00:03:20.910> little<00:03:21.060> job<00:03:21.360> plowing<00:03:21.690> through<00:03:21.810> this

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
cool little job plowing through this

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.690 
cool little job plowing through this
tree<00:03:22.260> which<00:03:22.410> i<00:03:22.530> think<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.769> pretty<00:03:23.040> awesome<00:03:23.280> and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
tree which i think is pretty awesome and

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.759 
tree which i think is pretty awesome and
let's<00:03:24.450> go<00:03:24.510> ahead<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:25.110> see<00:03:25.260> how<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.560> does

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
let's go ahead and just see how it does

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.170 
let's go ahead and just see how it does
handling<00:03:26.340> through<00:03:26.549> all<00:03:26.730> these<00:03:26.940> different

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
handling through all these different

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.259 
handling through all these different
blocks<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:29.160> like<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:29.640> said<00:03:29.700> guys<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.030> can

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
blocks so like I said guys you can

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.699 
blocks so like I said guys you can
actually<00:03:30.660> stand<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.110> platform<00:03:31.260> and

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
actually stand on the platform and

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.259 
actually stand on the platform and
you'll<00:03:31.830> actually<00:03:32.010> move<00:03:32.459> with<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.060> tunnel

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
you'll actually move with the tunnel

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.970 
you'll actually move with the tunnel
boring<00:03:33.480> machine<00:03:33.810> itself<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.739> don't<00:03:34.890> have

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
boring machine itself so you don't have

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.310 
boring machine itself so you don't have
to<00:03:35.100> worry<00:03:35.250> about<00:03:35.340> like<00:03:35.459> coming<00:03:35.820> kind<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
to worry about like coming kind of the

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.900 
to worry about like coming kind of the
Machine<00:03:37.769> leaving<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.250> behind<00:03:38.370> because<00:03:38.760> that

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
Machine leaving you behind because that

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.580 
Machine leaving you behind because that
would<00:03:39.030> not<00:03:39.180> be<00:03:39.209> good<00:03:39.330> but<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:40.200> can<00:03:40.320> see<00:03:40.410> here

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
would not be good but you can see here

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.930 
would not be good but you can see here
