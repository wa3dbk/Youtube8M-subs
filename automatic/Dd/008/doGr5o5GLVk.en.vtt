 for this good installation is for that 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.500
 telephone installation we need the 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:28.900
 rosette the adapter 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:31.410
 the 4 wire cable the clamps and the 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.410
 puncher 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.060
 next I will show you how 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.430
 able to strip the cable to connect the 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.730
 balances telephone number 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.640
 first thomas one end of the cable with 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:57.830
 the tweezers only apply a bit of 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:01.809
 pressure and release the four tracks here and 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.809
 assemble it to the connector 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:10.460
 we are going to assemble the 4 cable 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.460
 telephone annex 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.880
 since we are giving the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.440
 we do the same at the other end 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.620
 and so the two ends are struck 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.890
 no longer 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.200
 and we will connect the end of the cable 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.869
 to the adapter 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.190
 then the adapter sung the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.800
 recipe 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.080
 it stays this way 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.690
 and then the next end of the cable 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.690
 is connected to a disaster 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.530
