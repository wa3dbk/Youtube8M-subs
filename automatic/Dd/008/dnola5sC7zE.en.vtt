00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.900
 hello youtube friends how are the day 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.480
 today we are going to prepare some delicious 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.939
 by docs is a very simple recipe 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.360
 delicious for children and good we're going to 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.360
 see how 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:39.080
 we will use wooden sticks 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.110
 table flour sifted eggs pepper 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:46.320
 yellow corn flour oil sugar 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.780
 without yeast and a pinch of salt in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.649
 chicha 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.390
 let's take the sausages and 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.739
 we introduce the banderilla stick 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.190
 without them going out for 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.190
 achieve them 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.710
 in high bowl let's start 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.070
 mix the dry ingredients the flour 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.390
 salt corn flour baking powder 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.390
 yellow and sugar 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:30.480
 we mix everything very well and add a 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.480
 little bit of pepper and we keep mixing 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.009
 Now let's integrate the ingredients 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.329
 We are going to stir a little 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.329
 eggs before putting them 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.770
 we also add milk 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.740
 If the mixture is very dry they can 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.740
 add a little more milk 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.470
 you have to keep this 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.680
 consistency 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.160
 preferably in a tall glass as it is 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.320
 let's place our mass 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.530
 we will use it to submerge the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.370
 sausage completely and be able to cover it 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.370
 well of our mass 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.219
 On the other hand, we are going to put the oil 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.109
 to warm 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:38.150
 I used a tall pot like the one 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.700
 can see in the background not to spend 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.920
 a lot of oil is the one that makes me 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.170
 perfect to fry with docs or 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.569
 banderillas 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.040
 when you put it in the oil do not go 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.980
 to drop to the bottom because they are going to 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.530
 stick it up for a little while 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.650
 forms a crust and then later they can 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.650
 go down 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.910
 until the color is golden brown 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.920
 be time to remove it I'm going to 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.030
 put on an absorbent paper for 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.400
 remove excess fat 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.730
 look how pretty they are now let's go 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.909
 prove it 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.720
 friends here is our story 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.069
 banderilla as I want to say 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.250
 completed 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.959
 I made a mixture of coffee with mayonnaise a 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.959
 little mustard but do not mix 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.359
 How are you
