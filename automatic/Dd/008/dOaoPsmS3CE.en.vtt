00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:03.879
 but I also look at myself a little bit today 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.499
 it slipped 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:20.339
 for this we need a map for the land register and a siren explanation from one 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.970
 report of the videos you should watch explanation about the deputy prime minister 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.140
 this case can be in second place 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.289
 I'm going to arrange 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.320
 when along it starts with a 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.080
 vriezenveen is therefore also an honor 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.490
 in itself this is one work 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.590
 6 she's still something 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.330
 away from an earlier loss the us so nice at home so this is the basis and 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.150
 it will remain per complex for a while 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.910
 also has 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.910
 this way I have shown you how to do that before 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.650
 because that's how the first time is ahead 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.100
 hereby a spokesperson 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.910
 which can 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.290
 g the opening takes place from 4 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.290
 4 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.400
 we still have a long one 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.610
 one of those many 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.090
 according to moody's standing is very small 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.630
 it looks like that one is not because this was no less in collaboration 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 in itself there is nothing there 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.170
 everyone and 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.930
 and then go deeper 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.280
 that I return to ing 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.280
 two children apart 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.550
 anyway 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.550
 in minor 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.510
 that is i think the start of it is swum on 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.380
 I want to get started seven days 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.980
 it goes like this 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.980
 take the lead 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.180

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.740

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.330
 two hours for each case in May enschede 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.379
 I am doing this for a while with this plan 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.299
 That's why 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.299
 is blue 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.489
 after a year 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.769
 general 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.849
 9 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.349
 in 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.609
