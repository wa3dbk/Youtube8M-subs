00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
anyone else's reviews on this system yet

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.910 
anyone else's reviews on this system yet
I<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.840> remember<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.410> before<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> system

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
I do remember that before the system

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.220 
I do remember that before the system
dropped<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> massive<00:00:33.570> divide<00:00:33.899> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
dropped there was a massive divide I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.350 
dropped there was a massive divide I
mean<00:00:34.500> obviously<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.280> cool<00:00:35.460> package<00:00:35.910> but

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
mean obviously it's a cool package but

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.709 
mean obviously it's a cool package but
the<00:00:36.480> biggest<00:00:36.719> question<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:38.309> worth<00:00:38.340> it

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
the biggest question is is it worth it

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.900 
the biggest question is is it worth it

they feel good to use and I'm just a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.330 
they feel good to use and I'm just a
massive<00:01:56.430> fan<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.610> them<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> controllers

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
massive fan of them so the controllers

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
massive fan of them so the controllers
were<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.700> important<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.270> me<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.869> then

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
were really important to me but then

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.260 
were really important to me but then
again<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.189> actual<00:02:02.520> handheld<00:02:03.119> I

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
again so is the actual handheld I

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.359 
again so is the actual handheld I
mentioned<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.200> interface<00:02:04.619> feels<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
mentioned that the interface feels a

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.310 
mentioned that the interface feels a
little<00:02:05.490> bit<00:02:05.729> cheap<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:06.960> just

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
little bit cheap but it's really just

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.109 
little bit cheap but it's really just
there<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.710> select<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.640> game

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
there to select a game

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.089 
there to select a game
there's<00:02:09.599> no<00:02:09.720> capability<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.619> web<00:02:10.770> browsing

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
there's no capability for web browsing

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.820 
there's no capability for web browsing
or<00:02:11.430> even

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
or even

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.760 
or even
manager<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:13.170> hardware<00:02:14.170> on<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.350> other<00:02:14.500> hand

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
manager the hardware on the other hand

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.860 
manager the hardware on the other hand
feels<00:02:15.220> solid<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:16.000> even<00:02:16.420> though<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.570> feels<00:02:16.720> a

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
feels solid and even though it feels a

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.690 
feels solid and even though it feels a
bit<00:02:16.900> like<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.260> Neo<00:02:17.440> Geo<00:02:17.680> CD<00:02:17.950> controllers

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
bit like the Neo Geo CD controllers

bit like the Neo Geo CD controllers
these<00:02:19.270> buttons<00:02:19.690> are<00:02:19.810> still<00:02:19.990> smaller<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.800> they

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
these buttons are still smaller and they

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.470 
these buttons are still smaller and they
really<00:02:21.250> take<00:02:21.400> some<00:02:21.580> getting<00:02:21.820> used<00:02:21.850> to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
really take some getting used to

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
cutting-edge but I always felt this is

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.600

where you can experience some real raw I

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.390 
where you can experience some real raw I
think<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.060> game<00:03:37.330> this<00:03:38.260> is<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.440> game<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:39.220> came

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
think a game this is a game that came

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.060 
think a game this is a game that came
out<00:03:39.580> way<00:03:39.790> before<00:03:40.120> Metal<00:03:40.420> Slug<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:41.350> that's

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
out way before Metal Slug and that's

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.630 
out way before Metal Slug and that's
obvious

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
obvious
