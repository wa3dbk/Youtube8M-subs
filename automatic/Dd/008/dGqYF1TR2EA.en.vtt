we make smart intelligent wiring systems
for<00:00:08.240> vehicles<00:00:08.360> so<00:00:09.349> our<00:00:09.559> customers<00:00:10.160> build

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
for vehicles so our customers build

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.600 
for vehicles so our customers build
everything<00:00:10.610> from<00:00:10.849> trucks<00:00:11.299> 2<00:00:11.599> buses<00:00:11.629> to<00:00:12.289> RVs<00:00:12.679> we

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
everything from trucks 2 buses to RVs we

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.029 
everything from trucks 2 buses to RVs we
give<00:00:13.789> them<00:00:13.969> a<00:00:14.120> better<00:00:14.419> way<00:00:14.719> to<00:00:15.259> wire<00:00:15.530> all<00:00:15.860> the

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
give them a better way to wire all the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.500 
give them a better way to wire all the
electrical<00:00:16.430> functions<00:00:16.850> in<00:00:17.030> those<00:00:17.240> vehicles

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
electrical functions in those vehicles

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.089 
electrical functions in those vehicles
so<00:00:18.020> we<00:00:18.110> used<00:00:18.260> to<00:00:18.320> be<00:00:18.380> part<00:00:18.590> of<00:00:18.679> much<00:00:18.830> larger
