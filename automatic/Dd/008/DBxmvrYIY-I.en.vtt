on in this lick we're going to start

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.160 
on in this lick we're going to start
down<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.170> by<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.220> nut<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.790> we're<00:01:00.240> bending<00:01:00.960> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
down here by the nut and we're bending a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.800 
down here by the nut and we're bending a
lot<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> strings<00:01:01.770> back<00:01:02.040> here<00:01:02.220> behind<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.580> nut

lot of strings back here behind the nut

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.240 
lot of strings back here behind the nut
and<00:01:03.810> if<00:01:04.050> you<00:01:04.260> play<00:01:06.230> any<00:01:07.230> kind<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.920> guitar

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and if you play any kind of guitar

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.510 
and if you play any kind of guitar
without<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.700> recessed<00:01:09.350> neck<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:11.160> going<00:01:11.370> to<00:01:11.430> be

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
without a recessed neck it's going to be

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.360 
without a recessed neck it's going to be
a<00:01:11.550> little<00:01:11.820> hard<00:01:12.380> it<00:01:13.380> may<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.710> be<00:01:13.860> possible<00:01:14.040> at

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
a little hard it may not be possible at

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.330 
a little hard it may not be possible at
all<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.560> this<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.740> definitely<00:01:16.920> something

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
all so this is definitely something

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.890 
all so this is definitely something
that's<00:01:17.490> kind<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.760> made<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.180> guitars<00:01:18.540> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that's kind of made for guitars that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.410 
that's kind of made for guitars that
have<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.800> recess<00:01:20.310> neck<00:01:20.610> because<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.270> have

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
have that recess neck because you have

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.940 
have that recess neck because you have
to<00:01:21.510> have<00:01:21.630> enough<00:01:21.840> room<00:01:22.050> to<00:01:22.110> pull<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.650> string

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
to have enough room to pull the string

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.910 
to have enough room to pull the string

it<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.540> really<00:02:37.599> cool<00:02:37.989> sound

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.110 

those<00:02:42.010> two<00:02:42.340> strings<00:02:42.670> releasing<00:02:43.600> together

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
those two strings releasing together

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.580 
those two strings releasing together
after<00:02:46.120> we<00:02:46.240> do<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.630> band<00:02:47.020> we're<00:02:47.440> going<00:02:47.470> to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
after we do that band we're going to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.560 
after we do that band we're going to
drop<00:02:47.890> back<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.160> half<00:02:48.490> step<00:02:48.790> I'm<00:02:49.060> going<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.390> keep

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
drop back a half step I'm going to keep

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.630 
drop back a half step I'm going to keep
this<00:02:49.720> third<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.350> I'm<00:02:51.040> going<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.190> bend<00:02:51.460> this

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
this third and I'm going to bend this

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.530 
this third and I'm going to bend this
third<00:02:51.880> up<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:52.420> down<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.570> half<00:02:52.900> step<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.730> it's

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
third up and down a half step and it's

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.120 
third up and down a half step and it's
never<00:02:55.720> going<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.930> be<00:02:56.080> exactly<00:02:56.260> perfect<00:02:57.040> but

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
never going to be exactly perfect but

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.590 
never going to be exactly perfect but
you<00:02:57.220> could<00:02:57.370> try<00:02:57.490> to<00:02:57.550> get<00:02:57.700> as<00:02:57.790> close<00:02:57.970> as<00:02:58.030> as<00:02:58.420> you

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
you could try to get as close as as you

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.570 
you could try to get as close as as you
can

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.730 

so<00:03:05.540> there's<00:03:05.870> going<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.050> be<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.200> little<00:03:06.410> bit<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.680> a

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
so there's going to be a little bit of a

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.170 
so there's going to be a little bit of a
compromise<00:03:07.220> there<00:03:07.490> all<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.760> time<00:03:07.790> but<00:03:08.090> you

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
compromise there all the time but you

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.460 
compromise there all the time but you
can<00:03:08.300> get<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.540> pretty<00:03:08.570> darn<00:03:08.900> close

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
can get it pretty darn close

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.140 
can get it pretty darn close
especially<00:03:10.130> if<00:03:10.220> things<00:03:10.400> are<00:03:10.520> going<00:03:10.730> by<00:03:10.850> pretty

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
especially if things are going by pretty

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.400 
especially if things are going by pretty
quick<00:03:11.420> you're<00:03:11.600> never<00:03:11.780> going<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:11.960> know<00:03:12.110> if<00:03:12.290> as

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
quick you're never going to know if as

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.660 
quick you're never going to know if as
if<00:03:12.530> it's<00:03:12.680> like<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.980> little<00:03:13.280> bit<00:03:13.430> out<00:03:13.490> of<00:03:13.610> tune<00:03:15.670> so

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
if it's like a little bit out of tune so

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.490 
if it's like a little bit out of tune so
I'm<00:03:16.790> dropping<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.270> down<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.340> B<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:19.580> D

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
I'm dropping that down to the B and D

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.130 
I'm dropping that down to the B and D
again

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.500 

and<00:03:24.230> then<00:03:24.860> I'm<00:03:24.980> going<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.250> approach<00:03:25.790> my<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
and then I'm going to approach my a and

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.170 
and then I'm going to approach my a and
c-sharp<00:03:26.870> from<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.140> half-step<00:03:27.530> underneath

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.869 

in<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.230> low<00:03:31.409> a<00:03:31.439> I'm<00:03:32.010> going<00:03:32.189> to<00:03:32.250> let<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.459> ring

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
in the low a I'm going to let that ring

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.750 
in the low a I'm going to let that ring
and<00:03:33.180> then<00:03:33.689> I'm<00:03:33.810> going<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.959> do<00:03:34.189> these<00:03:35.189> contrary

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
and then I'm going to do these contrary

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.929 
and then I'm going to do these contrary
motion<00:03:36.079> bends<00:03:37.079> or<00:03:37.319> up<00:03:37.980> contrary<00:03:38.519> motion<00:03:38.640> band

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 
motion bends or up contrary motion band

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.690 
motion bends or up contrary motion band
and<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.569> is<00:03:39.720> another<00:03:40.099> type<00:03:41.099> of<00:03:41.129> band<00:03:41.459> that

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
and this is another type of band that

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.240 
and this is another type of band that

contrary<00:03:52.829> motion<00:03:53.069> bands<00:03:53.989> so<00:03:54.989> we're<00:03:55.109> going<00:03:55.200> to

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
contrary motion bands so we're going to

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.170 
contrary motion bands so we're going to
do<00:03:55.379> is<00:03:55.500> take<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.680> first<00:03:56.069> finger<00:03:56.609> and<00:03:56.879> this<00:03:57.030> is

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
do is take that first finger and this is

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.089 
do is take that first finger and this is
kind<00:03:57.359> of<00:03:57.450> tricky<00:03:57.750> but<00:03:57.900> we're<00:03:58.049> going<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.200> push

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
kind of tricky but we're going to push

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.399 
kind of tricky but we're going to push
it<00:03:59.280> up<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.640> we're<00:03:59.790> going<00:03:59.879> to<00:03:59.939> collect<00:04:00.409> the

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
it up and we're going to collect the

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.349 
it up and we're going to collect the
g-string<00:04:02.099> underneath<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:02.909> so<00:04:03.000> now<00:04:03.120> we<00:04:03.150> have

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
g-string underneath it so now we have

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.420 
g-string underneath it so now we have
the<00:04:03.450> b<00:04:03.659> and<00:04:03.870> g<00:04:03.900> string<00:04:04.379> all<00:04:04.590> underneath<00:04:04.980> one

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
the b and g string all underneath one

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.410 
the b and g string all underneath one
finger<00:04:05.909> okay<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.409> so<00:04:08.400> what<00:04:08.579> this<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.909> doing<00:04:09.120> is

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
finger okay and so what this is doing is

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.360 
finger okay and so what this is doing is
this<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.720> bending<00:04:10.319> up<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.620> second<00:04:11.010> string<00:04:11.190> so

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
this is bending up that second string so

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.010 
this is bending up that second string so
I<00:04:11.400> get<00:04:11.700> an<00:04:11.879> F<00:04:12.090> natural

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
I get an F natural

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.400 
I get an F natural
and<00:04:14.320> I<00:04:14.890> have<00:04:15.070> a<00:04:15.100> C<00:04:15.430> natural<00:04:16.050> so<00:04:17.050> I<00:04:17.110> end<00:04:17.260> up<00:04:17.350> with

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
and I have a C natural so I end up with

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.250 
and I have a C natural so I end up with
that<00:04:17.680> sounding<00:04:18.310> interval<00:04:18.760> and<00:04:19.140> that's<00:04:20.140> going

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
that sounding interval and that's going

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.170 
that sounding interval and that's going
to<00:04:20.350> be<00:04:20.440> my<00:04:20.590> starting<00:04:21.010> interval<00:04:21.430> once<00:04:21.910> I<00:04:22.030> have

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
to be my starting interval once I have

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.040 
to be my starting interval once I have
that<00:04:22.210> interval

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
that interval

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.249 
that interval
I'm<00:04:24.560> going<00:04:24.919> to<00:04:24.979> pull<00:04:25.250> this<00:04:25.430> down<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:26.240> my<00:04:26.840> F<00:04:27.050> is

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
I'm going to pull this down and my F is

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.070 
I'm going to pull this down and my F is
going<00:04:27.409> to<00:04:27.530> release<00:04:27.800> down<00:04:28.159> into<00:04:28.430> an<00:04:28.550> e<00:04:28.909> but<00:04:29.690> my<00:04:29.840> C

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
going to release down into an e but my C

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.219 
going to release down into an e but my C
is<00:04:30.110> going<00:04:30.349> to<00:04:30.430> bend<00:04:31.430> up<00:04:31.729> into<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.060> c-sharp<00:04:32.599> so

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
is going to bend up into a c-sharp so

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:34.360 
is going to bend up into a c-sharp so
you<00:04:33.289> get<00:04:33.409> AB<00:04:33.530> and<00:04:33.710> that's<00:04:33.860> going<00:04:34.009> in<00:04:34.190> two

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
you get AB and that's going in two

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.670 
you get AB and that's going in two
different<00:04:34.520> directions<00:04:34.729> and<00:04:35.479> that's<00:04:36.349> why<00:04:36.560> it's

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
different directions and that's why it's

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.879 
different directions and that's why it's
called<00:04:36.770> a<00:04:36.919> contrary<00:04:37.250> motion<00:04:37.520> Ben
