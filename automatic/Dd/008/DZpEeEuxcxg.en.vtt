and Richard me Richard been working hard
we<00:02:54.690> know<00:02:54.870> we've<00:02:55.470> been<00:02:55.620> on<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.800> bench<00:02:55.950> together

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
we know we've been on the bench together

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.340 
we know we've been on the bench together
reports<00:02:57.060> all<00:02:57.180> kind<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.450> different<00:02:57.510> contrast

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
reports all kind of different contrast

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.990 
reports all kind of different contrast
we<00:02:58.590> are<00:02:58.770> we<00:02:59.010> doing<00:02:59.250> very<00:02:59.459> much<00:02:59.520> different<00:02:59.970> I

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
we are we doing very much different I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.790 
we are we doing very much different I
mean<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.630> at<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.930> same<00:03:01.140> time<00:03:01.350> we're<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> lot<00:03:01.709> of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
mean but at the same time we're a lot of

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.530 
mean but at the same time we're a lot of
the<00:03:01.890> same<00:03:02.070> because<00:03:02.520> Richard<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> little<00:03:03.390> bit

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
the same because Richard is a little bit

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.910 
the same because Richard is a little bit
other<00:03:03.900> thing<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.050> separates<00:03:04.709> me<00:03:04.860> from

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
other thing that separates me from

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.530 
other thing that separates me from
Richard<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.610> weight<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:06.060> know<00:03:06.150> Richards

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
Richard is the weight you know Richards

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.120 
Richard is the weight you know Richards
a<00:03:06.600> little<00:03:06.810> bit<00:03:06.930> smaller<00:03:07.230> than<00:03:07.319> me<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:07.950> Richard

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
a little bit smaller than me but Richard

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.130 
a little bit smaller than me but Richard
runs<00:03:08.430> hard<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.850> mean<00:03:09.000> he's<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.330> downhill<00:03:09.690> runner

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
runs hard I mean he's a downhill runner

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.350 
runs hard I mean he's a downhill runner
I<00:03:10.620> think<00:03:11.250> early<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:11.550> his<00:03:11.640> career<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:12.150> know<00:03:12.239> he

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
I think early in his career you know he

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.490 
I think early in his career you know he
was<00:03:12.480> just<00:03:12.570> trying<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.840> make<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.110> much<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.290> each

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
was just trying to make so much of each

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.870 
was just trying to make so much of each
opportunity<00:03:13.739> got<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.430> that's<00:03:14.489> what<00:03:14.670> kind<00:03:14.850> of

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
opportunity got and that's what kind of

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.640 
opportunity got and that's what kind of
got<00:03:15.000> him<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.209> trouble<00:03:15.239> but<00:03:15.750> knowing<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.530> he's

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
got him in trouble but knowing that he's

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.900 
got him in trouble but knowing that he's
gonna<00:03:16.769> come<00:03:16.890> in<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.160> see<00:03:17.220> significant<00:03:17.730> amount

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
gonna come in and see significant amount

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.310 
gonna come in and see significant amount
of<00:03:17.970> carries<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.330> think<00:03:18.510> he's<00:03:18.630> settled<00:03:19.019> down<00:03:19.050> as

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
of carries I think he's settled down as

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.080 
of carries I think he's settled down as
a<00:03:19.350> runner<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.650> lot<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.100> he's<00:03:20.700> gonna<00:03:20.790> be<00:03:20.910> able<00:03:20.970> to

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
a runner a lot and he's gonna be able to

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.009 
a runner a lot and he's gonna be able to
just<00:03:21.150> go<00:03:21.300> out<00:03:21.390> there<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.570> just<00:03:21.660> be<00:03:21.870> himself

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
just go out there and just be himself

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.780 
just go out there and just be himself
let<00:03:22.410> his<00:03:22.500> athletic<00:03:22.860> ability<00:03:23.220> take<00:03:23.370> over<00:03:23.580> and

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
let his athletic ability take over and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.430 
let his athletic ability take over and
you're<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.000> power<00:03:24.239> guy<00:03:24.540> but<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.050> run<00:03:25.230> to

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
you're the power guy but you can run to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.770 
you're the power guy but you can run to
also<00:03:25.950> yeah<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.250> mean<00:03:26.670> they're<00:03:27.239> gonna<00:03:27.330> depend<00:03:27.630> on

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
also yeah I mean they're gonna depend on

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.210 
also yeah I mean they're gonna depend on
me<00:03:27.870> between<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.260> tackles<00:03:28.470> but<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.830> same<00:03:29.010> time

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
me between the tackles but the same time

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.530 
me between the tackles but the same time
I<00:03:29.280> can<00:03:29.489> run<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.700> options<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:30.239> run<00:03:30.450> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
I can run the options I can run the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.259 
I can run the options I can run the
speeds<00:03:30.840> but<00:03:31.110> chances<00:03:32.100> are<00:03:32.190> breaking<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.239> know

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
speeds but chances are breaking you know

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.699 
speeds but chances are breaking you know
a<00:03:33.390> speedrun<00:03:33.900> or<00:03:34.019> something<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.410> outside

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
a speedrun or something to the outside

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:35.780 
a speedrun or something to the outside
you<00:03:34.800> have<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:34.920> better<00:03:35.070> chance<00:03:35.130> with<00:03:35.459> Russell

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
you have a better chance with Russell

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.610 
you have a better chance with Russell

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
and he's rolling in there just like we

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.610 
and he's rolling in there just like we
always<00:04:51.420> have<00:04:51.630> one<00:04:51.750> two<00:04:51.930> three<00:04:52.170> four<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.410> then

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
always have one two three four and then

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.130 
always have one two three four and then
we<00:04:52.770> rolled<00:04:52.980> it<00:04:53.040> right<00:04:53.100> back<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.550> top<00:04:53.760> so

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
we rolled it right back to the top so

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.510 
we rolled it right back to the top so
we're<00:04:55.140> just<00:04:55.320> in<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.650> out<00:04:55.710> all<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:56.160> running

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
we're just in and out all the running

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.160 
we're just in and out all the running
backs<00:04:56.670> are<00:04:56.790> in<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:57.000> out<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:57.330> that<00:04:57.990> would<00:04:58.140> be

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
backs are in and out but that would be

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.930 
backs are in and out but that would be
the<00:04:58.380> biggest<00:04:58.860> difference<00:04:59.280> between<00:04:59.310> Michael

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
the biggest difference between Michael

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.240 
the biggest difference between Michael
Floyd<00:05:00.230> Richard<00:05:01.230> Murphy<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:01.680> know<00:05:02.040> I<00:05:02.070> mean

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
Floyd Richard Murphy and I know I mean

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.100 
Floyd Richard Murphy and I know I mean
it's<00:05:02.460> just<00:05:02.550> that<00:05:03.090> that's<00:05:03.240> what<00:05:03.510> different<00:05:03.900> so

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
it's just that that's what different so

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.960 
it's just that that's what different so
puts<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.800> difference<00:05:05.070> between<00:05:05.310> those<00:05:05.460> three<00:05:05.820> of

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
puts a difference between those three of

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.670 
puts a difference between those three of
us<00:05:06.090> you<00:05:06.540> feel<00:05:06.720> pretty<00:05:06.930> confident<00:05:07.320> that<00:05:07.470> all<00:05:07.560> of

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
us you feel pretty confident that all of

y'all can can be successful in find

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.510 
y'all can can be successful in find
success<00:05:09.960> without<00:05:10.110> 20<00:05:10.500> carries<00:05:10.950> a<00:05:10.980> game<00:05:11.220> that

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
success without 20 carries a game that

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.250 
success without 20 carries a game that
sort<00:05:11.790> of<00:05:11.850> power<00:05:12.090> yardage<00:05:12.600> definitely

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
sort of power yardage definitely

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.380 
sort of power yardage definitely
definitely<00:05:13.470> I<00:05:13.710> mean<00:05:14.030> it's<00:05:15.030> just<00:05:15.090> really

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
definitely I mean it's just really

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.090 
definitely I mean it's just really
because<00:05:15.870> then<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.200> reason<00:05:16.410> I<00:05:16.440> say<00:05:16.470> that<00:05:16.620> we're

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
because then the reason I say that we're

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.810 
because then the reason I say that we're
hungry<00:05:17.250> you<00:05:17.700> know<00:05:17.820> and<00:05:18.090> I<00:05:18.570> think<00:05:19.050> as<00:05:19.290> a<00:05:19.320> whole

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
hungry you know and I think as a whole

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.980 
hungry you know and I think as a whole
that's<00:05:20.820> how<00:05:20.940> this<00:05:21.060> running<00:05:21.360> back<00:05:21.480> screw<00:05:21.720> this

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
that's how this running back screw this

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.900 
that's how this running back screw this
group<00:05:22.290> is<00:05:22.470> we're<00:05:22.950> really<00:05:23.130> not<00:05:23.280> about<00:05:23.460> the
