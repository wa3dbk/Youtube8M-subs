structure of water and what affects it
now<00:01:13.880> water<00:01:14.149> is<00:01:14.329> the<00:01:14.630> most<00:01:14.750> receptive<00:01:15.350> of<00:01:15.679> the

four<00:01:16.340> elements<00:01:17.079> mr.<00:01:18.079> Emoto<00:01:18.350> thought<00:01:18.770> perhaps

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
four elements mr. Emoto thought perhaps

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.389 
four elements mr. Emoto thought perhaps
it<00:01:19.640> would<00:01:19.789> respond<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.799> non-physical<00:01:21.799> events

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
it would respond to non-physical events

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.270 
it would respond to non-physical events
so<00:01:22.850> he<00:01:23.000> set<00:01:23.240> up<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.539> series<00:01:23.959> of<00:01:23.990> studies<00:01:24.560> applied

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
so he set up a series of studies applied

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.940 
so he set up a series of studies applied
mental<00:01:25.849> stimuli<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.810> photographed<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:27.799> with

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
mental stimuli and photographed it with

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.550

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.030 

we<00:02:06.120> first<00:02:06.540> take<00:02:06.720> photographs<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.500> water<00:02:07.740> that

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
we first take photographs of water that

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.730 
we first take photographs of water that
we<00:02:08.160> did<00:02:08.310> not<00:02:08.399> put<00:02:08.640> any<00:02:08.700> information<00:02:09.540> then<00:02:10.500> we

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
we did not put any information then we

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.830 
we did not put any information then we
take<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.460> water<00:02:11.670> with<00:02:11.940> information<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:12.630> do

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
take the water with information you do

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.490 
take the water with information you do
the<00:02:12.960> same<00:02:13.200> procedure<00:02:13.350> just<00:02:13.950> described<00:02:15.500> you

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
the same procedure just described you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.410 
the same procedure just described you
take<00:02:16.710> those<00:02:16.920> before<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.610> after<00:02:18.210> photographs

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
take those before and after photographs

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.059 
take those before and after photographs
and<00:02:19.080> compare<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.740> differences

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.849 

I<00:02:28.329> when<00:02:29.329> we<00:02:29.420> projected<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:30.049> feeling<00:02:30.439> of<00:02:30.590> love

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
I when we projected the feeling of love

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.530 
I when we projected the feeling of love
and<00:02:30.889> thanks<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.459> water<00:02:31.579> it<00:02:31.999> made<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.389> most

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
and thanks to water it made the most

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.580 
and thanks to water it made the most
beautiful<00:02:32.659> crystal<00:02:34.840> times<00:02:35.840> like<00:02:36.079> this<00:02:36.319> I

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
beautiful crystal times like this I

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.070 
beautiful crystal times like this I

you<00:03:28.030> can<00:03:28.180> see<00:03:28.420> where<00:03:28.630> he<00:03:28.750> taped<00:03:29.020> that<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.920> this

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
you can see where he taped that to this

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.580 
you can see where he taped that to this
bottle<00:03:30.490> here<00:03:30.990> amid<00:03:31.990> if<00:03:32.080> you<00:03:32.170> read<00:03:32.410> Japanese

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
bottle here amid if you read Japanese

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.490 
bottle here amid if you read Japanese
you<00:03:33.010> already<00:03:33.310> knew<00:03:33.460> that<00:03:36.660> mr.<00:03:37.660> Emoto<00:03:37.900> speaks

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
you already knew that mr. Emoto speaks

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.310 
you already knew that mr. Emoto speaks
of<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.580> thought<00:03:39.970> or<00:03:40.270> intense<00:03:40.780> being<00:03:41.140> the

of the thought or intense being the

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
driving force in all of this the science

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.810 
driving force in all of this the science
of<00:03:44.440> how<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.650> actually<00:03:44.830> affects<00:03:45.280> the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
of how that actually affects the

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.900 
of how that actually affects the
molecules<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:46.780> unknown<00:03:47.380> that<00:03:48.220> except<00:03:48.580> to<00:03:48.790> the

molecules is unknown that except to the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.350 
molecules is unknown that except to the
water<00:03:49.120> molecules<00:03:49.720> of<00:03:49.900> course<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:51.360> it's

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
water molecules of course and it's

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.940 
water molecules of course and it's
really<00:03:52.600> fascinating<00:03:52.840> when<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:53.470> keep<00:03:53.740> in<00:03:53.920> mind

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
really fascinating when you keep in mind

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:07.460 
really fascinating when you keep in mind
that<00:03:54.460> 90%<00:03:55.240> of<00:03:55.750> our<00:03:55.930> bodies<00:03:56.080> are<00:03:56.680> water

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.040 

makes<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.220> wonder<00:04:08.400> doesn't

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
makes you wonder doesn't

makes you wonder doesn't
if<00:04:10.530> thoughts<00:04:10.860> can<00:04:11.070> do<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.580> water<00:04:11.790> imagine

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
if thoughts can do that to water imagine

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:37.670 
if thoughts can do that to water imagine
what<00:04:14.100> our<00:04:14.130> thoughts<00:04:14.490> can<00:04:15.030> do<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.180> us

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680
