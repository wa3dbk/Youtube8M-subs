00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
retirement accounts so when you look at

taking<00:02:19.470> stocks<00:02:19.980> why<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.310> want<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.610> hold<00:02:20.730> those

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
taking stocks why you want to hold those

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.180 
taking stocks why you want to hold those
also<00:02:21.180> in<00:02:21.540> an<00:02:21.660> outside<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.470> your<00:02:22.709> retirement

also in an outside of your retirement

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.680 
also in an outside of your retirement
account<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.580> because<00:02:23.790> stocks<00:02:24.150> are<00:02:24.360> volatile

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
account is because stocks are volatile

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.630 
account is because stocks are volatile
they<00:02:24.810> go<00:02:24.959> up<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.260> they<00:02:25.349> go<00:02:25.530> down<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.489> so

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
they go up and they go down and so

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.070 
they go up and they go down and so
there's<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.880> tax<00:02:27.209> planning<00:02:27.540> move<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.050> can

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
there's a tax planning move that you can

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.890 
there's a tax planning move that you can
take<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.620> advantage<00:02:29.099> of<00:02:29.280> but<00:02:29.550> also<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.870> want

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
take it advantage of but also you want

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.150 
take it advantage of but also you want
to<00:02:31.260> make<00:02:31.349> sure<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.709> do<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:31.950> correctly

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
to make sure that you do this correctly

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.430 
to make sure that you do this correctly
because<00:02:32.819> if<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.300> take<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.540> look<00:02:33.870> at<00:02:34.080> what<00:02:34.230> most

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
because if you take a look at what most

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.199 
because if you take a look at what most
people<00:02:34.800> do<00:02:34.950> when<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.220> stock<00:02:35.459> market<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:35.970> high

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
people do when the stock market is high

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.910 
people do when the stock market is high
you<00:02:36.269> get<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.870> greed<00:02:37.230> factor<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.830> then

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
you get that greed factor and then

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.620 
you get that greed factor and then
that's<00:02:38.069> when<00:02:38.250> they<00:02:38.370> want<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.670> buy<00:02:38.849> but<00:02:39.510> when

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
that's when they want to buy but when

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.509 
that's when they want to buy but when
the<00:02:39.750> market<00:02:40.140> starts<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.530> slide<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> little<00:02:41.130> bit

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
the market starts to slide a little bit

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.820 
the market starts to slide a little bit
then<00:02:41.760> that's<00:02:42.000> where<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.930> fear<00:02:43.170> factor<00:02:43.410> comes

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
then that's where the fear factor comes

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.590 
then that's where the fear factor comes
in<00:02:44.010> that's<00:02:44.250> what<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.519> want<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:44.940> get<00:02:45.120> out<00:02:45.269> and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
in that's what I want to get out and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.539 
in that's what I want to get out and
then<00:02:46.049> you<00:02:46.260> continue<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.950> repeat<00:02:47.160> that

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
then you continue to repeat that

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.670 
then you continue to repeat that
behavior<00:02:47.730> until<00:02:48.480> you're<00:02:48.840> broke<00:02:49.170> because

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
behavior until you're broke because

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.740 
behavior until you're broke because
we're<00:02:49.980> twice<00:02:50.250> as<00:02:50.519> fearful<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.239> lose<00:02:51.450> money

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
we're twice as fearful to lose money

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.840 
we're twice as fearful to lose money
than<00:02:51.989> we<00:02:52.110> are<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.470> gain<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.250> if<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.489> just<00:02:53.670> put

than we are to gain and if you just put

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.280 
than we are to gain and if you just put

if that million dollars went to 50,000

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.780

fill those various asset classes and we

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
would recommend that you go with that

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.250 
would recommend that you go with that
low-cost<00:04:12.810> index<00:04:13.200> funds<00:04:13.920> or<00:04:14.069> ETFs<00:04:15.019> because<00:04:16.019> the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
low-cost index funds or ETFs because the

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.110 
low-cost index funds or ETFs because the
retail<00:04:16.500> mutual<00:04:17.100> funds<00:04:17.310> out<00:04:17.459> there<00:04:17.669> are<00:04:17.850> very

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
retail mutual funds out there are very

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.420 
retail mutual funds out there are very
expensive<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:18.930> research<00:04:19.680> tells<00:04:20.130> us<00:04:20.370> that

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
expensive and research tells us that

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.750 
expensive and research tells us that
over<00:04:20.849> time<00:04:21.060> they<00:04:21.690> do<00:04:21.750> not<00:04:21.930> beat<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.740> index

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
over time they do not beat the index

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.240 
over time they do not beat the index
so<00:04:23.850> it's<00:04:24.000> important<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.540> stay<00:04:24.810> low-cost<00:04:25.470> but

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
so it's important to stay low-cost but

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.150 
so it's important to stay low-cost but
don't<00:04:26.490> just<00:04:26.730> buy<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.330> ignore<00:04:28.100> rebalance<00:04:29.100> your

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
don't just buy and ignore rebalance your

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.310 
don't just buy and ignore rebalance your
portfolio<00:04:29.310> as<00:04:30.060> appropriate<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.930> simply

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
portfolio as appropriate that simply

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.630 
portfolio as appropriate that simply
means<00:04:31.500> if<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:31.740> have<00:04:31.860> one<00:04:32.010> asset<00:04:32.220> class<00:04:32.400> that

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
means if you have one asset class that

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.240 
means if you have one asset class that
starts<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.360> make<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.570> run<00:04:33.870> sell<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.710> little<00:04:35.100> bit

starts to make a run sell a little bit

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.070 
starts to make a run sell a little bit
of<00:04:35.370> that<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.790> get<00:04:36.000> back<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.480> your<00:04:36.630> proper

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
of that to get back to your proper

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.070 
of that to get back to your proper
allocation<00:04:37.280> forcing<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.460> sell<00:04:38.970> higher<00:04:39.300> by

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
allocation forcing you to sell higher by

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.990 
allocation forcing you to sell higher by
the<00:04:40.140> asset<00:04:40.650> class<00:04:40.830> that<00:04:40.860> hasn't<00:04:41.250> done<00:04:41.460> as<00:04:41.790> well

the asset class that hasn't done as well

the asset class that hasn't done as well
your<00:04:42.540> emotions<00:04:43.080> would<00:04:43.260> tell<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.560> to<00:04:43.680> do<00:04:43.830> just

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
your emotions would tell you to do just

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.010 
your emotions would tell you to do just
the<00:04:44.340> opposite<00:04:44.850> but<00:04:45.090> that's<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.540> way<00:04:45.690> that<00:04:45.870> you

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
the opposite but that's the way that you

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.200 
the opposite but that's the way that you
successfully<00:04:46.770> invest<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:47.430> then<00:04:47.940> you<00:04:48.060> also

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
successfully invest and then you also

that capital loss against any future

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.010 
that capital loss against any future
capital<00:05:25.470> gain<00:05:25.740> in<00:05:26.010> any<00:05:26.310> capital<00:05:26.700> asset<00:05:27.210> so<00:05:27.780> now

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
capital gain in any capital asset so now

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.650 
capital gain in any capital asset so now
that<00:05:28.080> will<00:05:28.500> create<00:05:29.250> a<00:05:29.370> mechanism<00:05:29.760> for<00:05:30.450> me<00:05:30.540> to

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
that will create a mechanism for me to

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.110 
that will create a mechanism for me to
create<00:05:30.930> tax-free<00:05:31.650> income<00:05:31.890> when<00:05:32.760> I<00:05:32.790> start

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
create tax-free income when I start

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.730 
create tax-free income when I start
pulling<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.510> money<00:05:33.690> out<00:05:33.810> for<00:05:34.290> a<00:05:34.350> retirement

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
pulling the money out for a retirement

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.010 
pulling the money out for a retirement
income<00:05:34.950> strategy<00:05:35.610> because<00:05:36.330> if<00:05:36.480> you<00:05:36.600> can<00:05:36.780> pay

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
income strategy because if you can pay

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.500 
income strategy because if you can pay
less<00:05:37.050> in<00:05:37.500> tax<00:05:37.800> then<00:05:38.250> you<00:05:38.370> can<00:05:38.580> take<00:05:38.820> less<00:05:39.120> risk

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
less in tax then you can take less risk

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.720 
less in tax then you can take less risk
in<00:05:39.660> the<00:05:39.780> overall<00:05:40.140> portfolio<00:05:40.580> what<00:05:41.580> the
