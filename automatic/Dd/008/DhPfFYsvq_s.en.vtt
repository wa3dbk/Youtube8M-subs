00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the professionals you see what they do

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.090 
the professionals you see what they do
is<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.790> thin<00:01:30.780> down<00:01:30.960> enamel<00:01:31.470> paint<00:01:31.740> till

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
it's like tea light consistency so this

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.069 
it's like tea light consistency so this
way<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.640> flows<00:01:36.060> wherever<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.570> push<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.930> it's

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
way it flows wherever you push it it's

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.480 
way it flows wherever you push it it's
kind<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> wash<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.189> with<00:01:38.310> more

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
kind of like a wash but with more

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.910 
kind of like a wash but with more
control<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.170> basically<00:01:40.380> have

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
control on it and you basically have

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.039 
control on it and you basically have
more<00:01:41.070> control<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.700> over<00:01:41.939> into<00:01:42.150> crevices

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
more control of going over into crevices

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.469 
more control of going over into crevices
