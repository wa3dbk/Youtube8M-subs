reason I do have trouble separating some
of<00:03:06.860> these<00:03:07.040> songs<00:03:07.220> from<00:03:07.430> each<00:03:07.579> other<00:03:07.790> though

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
of these songs from each other though

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.210 
of these songs from each other though
even<00:03:08.329> with<00:03:08.599> this<00:03:08.720> album<00:03:09.049> requiring<00:03:09.470> many<00:03:09.950> more

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
even with this album requiring many more

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.949 
even with this album requiring many more
lessons<00:03:10.610> than<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.849> was<00:03:10.970> initially<00:03:11.180> expecting

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
lessons than I was initially expecting

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.900 
lessons than I was initially expecting
when<00:03:12.110> going<00:03:12.290> into<00:03:12.739> it<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.160> can't<00:03:13.370> help<00:03:13.519> but<00:03:13.670> feel

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
when going into it I can't help but feel

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.640 
when going into it I can't help but feel
like<00:03:13.940> apathy<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:14.750> writer's<00:03:15.079> block<00:03:15.110> whether

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
like apathy and writer's block whether

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.500 
like apathy and writer's block whether
the<00:03:15.829> creation<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.430> certain<00:03:16.609> tracks<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.450> the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
the creation of certain tracks and the

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.270 
the creation of certain tracks and the
music<00:03:17.810> surrounding<00:03:18.260> them<00:03:18.410> often<00:03:18.799> feels<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.160> bit

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
music surrounding them often feels a bit

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.220 
music surrounding them often feels a bit
underwhelming<00:03:19.910> too<00:03:20.180> as<00:03:20.389> a<00:03:20.420> result<00:03:20.930> I'm

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
underwhelming too as a result I'm

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.870 
underwhelming too as a result I'm
indifferent<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.980> some<00:03:22.130> of<00:03:22.220> these<00:03:22.280> other<00:03:22.519> Tunes

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
indifferent to some of these other Tunes

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.759 
indifferent to some of these other Tunes
and<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:23.180> almost<00:03:23.359> feel<00:03:23.690> like<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.079> should<00:03:24.470> like

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
and I almost feel like I should like

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.890 
and I almost feel like I should like
moments<00:03:25.220> like<00:03:25.400> swing<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.030> stationary<00:03:26.690> it's

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
moments like swing and stationary it's

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.569 
moments like swing and stationary it's
just<00:03:27.139> that<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.290> can't<00:03:27.739> muster<00:03:28.130> up<00:03:28.280> too<00:03:28.459> many

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
just that I can't muster up too many

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.670 
just that I can't muster up too many
feelings<00:03:28.910> one<00:03:29.389> way<00:03:29.420> or<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.840> other<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.380> guitar

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
feelings one way or the other the guitar

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.620 
feelings one way or the other the guitar
sounds<00:03:31.100> nice<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.400> hits<00:03:31.819> home<00:03:31.970> on<00:03:32.209> both<00:03:32.450> of

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
sounds nice and hits home on both of

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.330 
sounds nice and hits home on both of
these<00:03:32.750> songs<00:03:32.959> and<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.470> really<00:03:33.739> do<00:03:33.889> think<00:03:34.100> both

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
these songs and I really do think both

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.400 
these songs and I really do think both
songs<00:03:34.639> are<00:03:34.910> well-crafted<00:03:35.480> it's<00:03:35.930> just<00:03:36.230> that

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
songs are well-crafted it's just that

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.140 
songs are well-crafted it's just that
there's<00:03:36.650> some<00:03:36.920> sort<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.340> spark<00:03:37.730> that's

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
there's some sort of spark that's

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.879 
there's some sort of spark that's
missing<00:03:38.720> something<00:03:39.139> that<00:03:39.170> makes<00:03:39.470> these<00:03:39.680> songs

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
missing something that makes these songs

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.160 
missing something that makes these songs
special<00:03:40.459> that's<00:03:40.639> lacking<00:03:40.910> in<00:03:41.239> my<00:03:41.420> mind<00:03:41.690> flip

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
special that's lacking in my mind flip

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.900 
special that's lacking in my mind flip
