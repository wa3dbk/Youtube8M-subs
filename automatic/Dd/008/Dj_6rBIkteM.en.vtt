00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
into new year resolutions and what that

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.810 
into new year resolutions and what that
means<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:28.710> I've<00:00:28.830> been<00:00:28.949> thinking<00:00:29.279> about<00:00:29.400> that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
means and I've been thinking about that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.179 
means and I've been thinking about that
and<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.359> realized<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> think<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
and I realized that I think this is a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.709 
and I realized that I think this is a
year<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.669> let<00:00:32.850> go<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.780> resolutions<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:35.719> be

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
year to let go of all resolutions and be

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.700 
year to let go of all resolutions and be
at<00:00:36.840> peace<00:00:36.870> with<00:00:37.380> being<00:00:37.590> perfectly<00:00:38.579> imperfect

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
at peace with being perfectly imperfect

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.069 
at peace with being perfectly imperfect
because<00:00:40.710> when<00:00:41.010> you're<00:00:41.129> perfectly<00:00:41.579> imperfect

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
because when you're perfectly imperfect

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.400 
because when you're perfectly imperfect
and<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.200> allow<00:00:43.440> yourself<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.579> try<00:00:44.730> new<00:00:44.969> things

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
and you allow yourself to try new things

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.000 
and you allow yourself to try new things
to<00:00:46.410> make<00:00:46.559> mistakes<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:48.079> think<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.200> opens<00:00:49.559> up<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
to make mistakes I think it opens up a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.250 
to make mistakes I think it opens up a
door<00:00:50.309> from<00:00:50.640> magic<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> happen<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:51.840> real

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
door from magic to happen and for real

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
door from magic to happen and for real
personal<00:00:52.800> growth<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.309> happen<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:54.000> I've

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
personal growth to happen so I've

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.500 
personal growth to happen so I've
decided<00:00:54.920> with<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.100> my<00:00:56.340> imperfections<00:00:56.789> that
