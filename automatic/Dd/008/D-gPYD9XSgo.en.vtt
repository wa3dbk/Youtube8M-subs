really weird it smells like perfume like
you're<00:03:55.510> putting<00:03:55.690> a<00:03:55.900> perfume<00:03:56.440> on<00:03:56.560> your<00:03:56.709> lips

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
but the color is nice so if you can't

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.800 
but the color is nice so if you can't
stand<00:03:59.950> that<00:04:00.190> then<00:04:00.549> it's<00:04:01.150> probably<00:04:01.299> not<00:04:01.510> for

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
stand that then it's probably not for

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.390 
stand that then it's probably not for
you<00:04:01.930> but<00:04:02.049> I<00:04:02.110> like<00:04:02.379> it<00:04:02.590> because<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.099> colors

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.200 
and the reason I'm pushing it up with
without<00:04:41.290> clamping<00:04:41.920> it<00:04:42.040> is<00:04:42.190> because<00:04:42.580> that

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
without clamping it is because that

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.460 
without clamping it is because that
usually<00:04:43.570> clumps<00:04:43.960> them<00:04:44.140> all<00:04:44.260> together

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
usually clumps them all together

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.070 
usually clumps them all together
especially<00:04:45.190> with<00:04:45.550> this<00:04:45.640> mascara<00:04:46.090> so<00:04:46.420> that's

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
especially with this mascara so that's

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.810 
especially with this mascara so that's
why<00:04:47.200> I'm<00:04:47.320> just<00:04:47.350> doing<00:04:47.770> this<00:04:47.890> and<00:04:48.190> it's<00:04:48.340> such<00:04:48.610> a

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
why I'm just doing this and it's such a

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.940 
why I'm just doing this and it's such a
dry<00:04:49.300> mascara<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:50.020> it'll<00:04:50.290> just<00:04:50.320> bend<00:04:50.740> to

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
dry mascara that it'll just bend to

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.010 
dry mascara that it'll just bend to
wherever<00:04:51.160> shape<00:04:52.120> whatever<00:04:52.480> shape<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.750> like

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
wherever shape whatever shape you like

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.330 
wherever shape whatever shape you like
so<00:04:53.260> that's<00:04:53.350> why<00:04:53.470> I'm<00:04:53.530> doing<00:04:53.590> that<00:04:56.250> all<00:04:57.250> right

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
so that's why I'm doing that all right

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.890 
so that's why I'm doing that all right
so<00:04:57.550> now<00:04:57.700> I'm<00:04:57.790> going<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.030> do<00:04:58.180> my<00:04:58.330> effortless
