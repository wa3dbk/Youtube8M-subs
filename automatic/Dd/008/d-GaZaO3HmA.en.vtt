00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
640 now that's a very rude resolution

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.290 
640 now that's a very rude resolution
and<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.739> kind<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.040> weird<00:00:44.280> screen<00:00:44.610> size<00:00:44.850> but

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
and the kind of a weird screen size but

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.060 
and the kind of a weird screen size but
actually<00:00:45.570> does<00:00:45.690> make<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.899> lot<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.110> sense<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.920> you

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
actually does make a lot of sense if you

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.770 
actually does make a lot of sense if you
do<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> math<00:00:47.340> with<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:47.969> equates<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.660> an

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
do the math with this equates to is an

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.930 
do the math with this equates to is an
extra<00:00:49.110> row<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.289> icons<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.460> basically<00:00:50.820> this

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
extra row of icons so basically this

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.729 
extra row of icons so basically this
will<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.239> exact<00:00:51.480> same<00:00:51.510> width<00:00:52.020> screen<00:00:52.440> all

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
will be the exact same width screen all

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.020 
will be the exact same width screen all
would<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:53.430> would<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.640> adding<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
would be is they would be adding a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.340 
would be is they would be adding a
little<00:00:54.239> bit<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> top<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.110> make<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
little bit to the top to make it a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.959 
little bit to the top to make it a
little<00:00:55.440> bit<00:00:55.620> taller<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.579> example<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
little bit taller so for example the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.430 
little bit taller so for example the
aspect<00:00:57.360> ratio<00:00:57.449> would<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> little<00:00:58.140> bit<00:00:58.289> more

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
aspect ratio would be a little bit more

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.189 
aspect ratio would be a little bit more

hardware the iphone is also likely going
to<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.680> totally<00:01:22.920> redesigned<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.210> are

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
to be totally redesigned so there are

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.609 
to be totally redesigned so there are
all<00:01:24.450> kinds<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> different<00:01:24.900> rumors<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
all kinds of different rumors and

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.870 
all kinds of different rumors and
speculation<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.549> could<00:01:26.700> look<00:01:26.820> like

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
speculation on what it could look like

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.700 
speculation on what it could look like
so<00:01:27.570> some<00:01:27.780> people<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.170> said<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:28.650> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
so some people have said it's going to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.140 
so some people have said it's going to
look<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.130> macbook<00:01:29.520> air<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.970> kind<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
look like the macbook air and kind of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
look like the macbook air and kind of
have<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> taper<00:01:30.600> others<00:01:31.470> say<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.009> be

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
have a taper others say it's going to be

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.740 
have a taper others say it's going to be
all<00:01:32.220> curved<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.000> all<00:01:33.119> kinds<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.509> stuff

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
all curved and all kinds of stuff

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.420 
all curved and all kinds of stuff
honestly<00:01:34.500> i'm<00:01:34.740> not<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.250> take<00:01:35.400> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
honestly i'm not really going to take a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.950 
honestly i'm not really going to take a
lot<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.640> speculation<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.420> exactly<00:01:36.570> it's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
lot of speculation on what exactly it's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.390 
lot of speculation on what exactly it's
going<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> look<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.380> hopefully<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.310> gonna

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
going to look like hopefully it's gonna

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.710 
going to look like hopefully it's gonna
be<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> little<00:01:38.670> bit<00:01:38.790> thinner<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.270> definitely<00:01:39.420> do

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
be a little bit thinner I definitely do

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.060 
be a little bit thinner I definitely do
believe<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.170> will<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.470> totally<00:01:40.619> different

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
believe that will be totally different

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.649 
believe that will be totally different
from<00:01:41.159> our<00:01:41.369> current<00:01:41.520> iPhone<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.360> beyond<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
from our current iPhone but beyond that

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.050 
from our current iPhone but beyond that
who<00:01:43.110> knows<00:01:43.380> internally<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> expected<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> come

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
who knows internally I expected to come

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.450 
who knows internally I expected to come
with<00:01:45.180> an<00:01:45.270> apple<00:01:45.600> a6<00:01:45.810> dual-core<00:01:46.439> processor<00:01:47.040> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
with an apple a6 dual-core processor and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.560 
with an apple a6 dual-core processor and
while<00:01:47.579> quad-core<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.090> definitely<00:01:48.390> an<00:01:48.450> option

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
while quad-core is definitely an option

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.389 
while quad-core is definitely an option
I<00:01:48.899> really<00:01:49.110> don't<00:01:49.200> see<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.530> happening<00:01:49.590> for

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
I really don't see this happening for

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.609 
I really don't see this happening for

one most iOS apps barely take advantage

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.889 
one most iOS apps barely take advantage
of<00:01:52.740> two<00:01:52.920> cores<00:01:53.220> much<00:01:53.490> less<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.570> top<00:01:54.780> of

that the right shows some really awesome

that the right shows some really awesome
dual<00:01:56.340> core<00:01:56.549> parts<00:01:56.850> right<00:01:57.000> now<00:01:57.210> such<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:57.689> what

dual core parts right now such as what

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.810

you find in the ATT version of the HTC
One<00:02:00.360> X<00:02:00.479> which<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:00.990> reviewed<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.920> internal

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
One X which I just reviewed so internal

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.740 
One X which I just reviewed so internal
I<00:02:02.369> expect<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:02.939> very<00:02:03.149> similar<00:02:03.390> probably

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
I expect it to be very similar probably

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.480 
I expect it to be very similar probably
going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.140> clutch<00:02:04.350> around<00:02:04.619> 1.5<00:02:05.219> gigahertz

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
going to be clutch around 1.5 gigahertz

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.969 
going to be clutch around 1.5 gigahertz
it'll<00:02:06.210> also<00:02:06.299> be<00:02:06.450> packed<00:02:06.810> with<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.990> nice<00:02:07.229> GPU<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
it'll also be packed with a nice GPU and

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.040 
it'll also be packed with a nice GPU and
a<00:02:08.009> full<00:02:08.220> gigabyte<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.729> RAM<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.270> think<00:02:09.629> LTE<00:02:09.959> is

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
a full gigabyte of RAM I think LTE is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.420 
a full gigabyte of RAM I think LTE is
definitely<00:02:10.530> going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> given<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
if we do not see LTE on the new iphone I

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.430 
if we do not see LTE on the new iphone I
wouldn't<00:02:26.360> be<00:02:26.420> surprised<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:27.050> see<00:02:27.110> the<00:02:27.320> new

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
wouldn't be surprised to see the new

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.870 
wouldn't be surprised to see the new
iphone<00:02:27.830> come<00:02:28.070> with<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.430> same<00:02:28.610> 8-megapixel

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
iphone come with the same 8-megapixel

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.510 
iphone come with the same 8-megapixel
camera<00:02:29.420> from<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.930> iphone<00:02:30.260> 4s<00:02:30.650> well<00:02:31.370> they're

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
camera from the iphone 4s well they're

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.710 
camera from the iphone 4s well they're
definitely<00:02:31.580> some<00:02:31.940> better<00:02:32.090> cameras<00:02:32.480> coming

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
definitely some better cameras coming

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.690 
definitely some better cameras coming
with<00:02:32.960> 10<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.230> 12<00:02:33.500> megapixels<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.460> wider

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
with 10 and 12 megapixels and wider

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.580 
with 10 and 12 megapixels and wider
apertures<00:02:35.240> but<00:02:35.720> overall<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.050> still<00:02:36.320> think<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
apertures but overall I still think the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.530 
apertures but overall I still think the
iphone<00:02:36.920> 4s<00:02:37.310> has<00:02:37.520> one<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:37.970> best<00:02:38.150> cameras

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
iphone 4s has one of the best cameras

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.180 
iphone 4s has one of the best cameras
out<00:02:38.690> there<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.200> while<00:02:39.620> they<00:02:39.710> may<00:02:39.740> tweak<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.160> a

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
out there and while they may tweak you a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.770 
out there and while they may tweak you a
little<00:02:40.370> bit<00:02:40.460> for<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.670> new<00:02:40.790> iphone<00:02:41.210> overall<00:02:41.750> i

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
little bit for the new iphone overall i
