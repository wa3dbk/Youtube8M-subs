00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
display i was actually quite a fan of

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.690 
display i was actually quite a fan of
the<00:00:38.149> glossy<00:00:38.510> display<00:00:38.600> i<00:00:39.260> know<00:00:39.770> not<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:40.039> lot<00:00:40.309> of

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
the glossy display i know not a lot of

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.430

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
people are but i actually am i think it

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.770 
people are but i actually am i think it
makes<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.770> colors<00:00:42.980> look<00:00:43.160> more<00:00:43.399> crisp

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
makes the colors look more crisp

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.240 
makes the colors look more crisp
although<00:00:44.780> it<00:00:45.050> is<00:00:45.199> quite<00:00:45.590> a<00:00:45.620> pain<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:45.920> it

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
although it is quite a pain that it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.369 
although it is quite a pain that it
reflects<00:00:46.670> but<00:00:47.030> you<00:00:47.570> know<00:00:47.660> regardless<00:00:48.170> the

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
reflects but you know regardless the

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.310 
reflects but you know regardless the

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
let's open up safari so you can see if

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.740 
let's open up safari so you can see if
you're<00:03:50.580> playing<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.880> bind<00:03:51.150> this<00:03:51.300> just<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.630> run

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
you're playing a bind this just to run

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.030 
you're playing a bind this just to run
out<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:51.900> 636<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.890> then<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.100> runs<00:03:53.190> ok<00:03:53.400> but<00:03:55.040> you

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
out of 636 and then it runs ok but you

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.340 
out of 636 and then it runs ok but you
know<00:03:56.160> it's<00:03:56.310> really<00:03:56.520> not<00:03:56.810> not<00:03:57.810> worth<00:03:58.020> it<00:03:58.170> just

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
know it's really not not worth it just

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.700 
know it's really not not worth it just
to<00:03:58.500> buy<00:03:58.740> it<00:03:58.800> for<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.070> so<00:04:00.380> this<00:04:01.380> is<00:04:01.500> what<00:04:01.650> it

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
to buy it for that so this is what it

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.650 
to buy it for that so this is what it
looks<00:04:01.860> like<00:04:02.010> here<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.550> can<00:04:02.910> see<00:04:03.090> this<00:04:03.480> is

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
looks like here you can see this is

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.540 
looks like here you can see this is

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
seen enough of mac on Scott about this

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.330 
seen enough of mac on Scott about this
mac<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:18.600> see<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:18.870> sees<00:04:19.080> that<00:04:19.260> it's<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.830> n2

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
mac you see it sees that it's the n2

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.110 
mac you see it sees that it's the n2
81.6<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.480> gigahertz<00:04:21.890> my<00:04:22.890> gigabyte<00:04:23.130> SD<00:04:23.460> ran<00:04:23.880> so

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
81.6 is gigahertz my gigabyte SD ran so

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.670 
81.6 is gigahertz my gigabyte SD ran so
picks<00:04:24.360> up<00:04:24.510> everything<00:04:24.630> pretty<00:04:25.050> well<00:04:25.140> so

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
picks up everything pretty well so

here this is Windows 7 Professional now
windows<00:04:35.850> seven<00:04:36.150> does<00:04:36.360> actually<00:04:36.540> run<00:04:36.900> quite

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
windows seven does actually run quite

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.720 
windows seven does actually run quite
good<00:04:37.440> I<00:04:37.620> mean<00:04:37.860> for<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.070> most<00:04:38.220> part<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.580> runs

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
good I mean for the most part it runs

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.530 
good I mean for the most part it runs
pretty<00:04:38.880> nicely<00:04:40.610> so<00:04:41.610> this<00:04:41.730> is<00:04:41.760> windows<00:04:42.180> seven

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
pretty nicely so this is windows seven

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.180 
pretty nicely so this is windows seven
starting<00:04:42.930> up<00:04:43.020> here<00:04:43.290> this<00:04:43.620> is<00:04:43.800> what<00:04:43.980> it<00:04:44.070> looks

actually<00:05:35.850> quite<00:05:36.150> like<00:05:36.210> it<00:05:36.419> I<00:05:36.600> think<00:05:36.630> because

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
actually quite like it I think because

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.420

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.530 
but besides that I think it's a really
really<00:05:41.070> good<00:05:41.310> netbook<00:05:41.730> and<00:05:41.940> you<00:05:42.360> should
