00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.720
 friends 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.760
 hello I'm mild and I'm sleepy but still 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.530
 I bring you this tutorial and not even 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.769
 it's tutorial is rather an explanation 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.660
 to the achievement called hunter gatherer killed 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.939
 to 20 with package-bomb as a hunter 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.759
 wild in multiplayer confrontation 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.650
 this with the pack of force maps of 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.060
 the nature this that just came out 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.789
 it does good 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.859
 I do this explanation because many people 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.140
 they will ask what the hell is a 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.660
 dibos pump package or in explosives but 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.820
 which is exactly a package-pump is 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.650
 something that many times uses but 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.170
 exists and it is simply to paste a 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.739
 grenade and push for that is a 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.710
 package-pump something not very used in 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.300
 metz and making because of its inefficiency is not 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.680
 so practical it might be practical but 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.980
 the truth fits me or that they use it 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.260
 I the only time I use it I think 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.060
 it served me I do not remember the truth how 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.910
 it's done you just have to grab 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.280
 someone like shield will change your grenade 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.680
 as if you changed barren normally and 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.020
 then I will automatically push to 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.840
 this person that you are grabbing with the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.110
 Granada nailed him either ink 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.690
 fragmentation or good smoke do it 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.210
 25 times and for me managed to unlock the 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.450
 hunter gatherer now there is a small 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:29.440
 problem with this achievement and I killed more 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.869
 of 20 using this method and I do not 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.820
 they gave the achievement after those 20 I had 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.280
 to do it many times more so that 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.070
 I got the achievement but they helped me 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.470
 some compas and you also get 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.630
 and friends can do it in a game 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.570
 private put all weapons as 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.070
 fragmentation grenades that is to say 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.020
 of price number there is a grenade of 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.119
 fragmentation they grab it and they're already 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.759
 of agreement and they take out he managed quickly 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.460
