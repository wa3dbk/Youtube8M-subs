00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.120
 hi everyone seems to be the motto of 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.070
 today we're going to see something you have me 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.289
 required in many and that is the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.809
 leaven precisely today we will go to 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.880
 compare the yeast 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.039
 I took this master here 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.510
 baker of the paneangeli than that one there 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.180
 that I use normally because I am 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.300
 very well then I took the yeast of 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.490
 ocean beer always used there 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.030
 This here I have never found then 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.670
 we will try together and then I don't actually have 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.739
 taken because I already know the result 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.210
 fresh yeast dough 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.739
 the classic one there 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.010
 now in fact I want to go talk 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.030
 a little bit of the difference between the two 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.460
 because I didn't get it 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.980
 I didn't take it because I actually already know the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.850
 result that gives me and for this reason 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.920
 then I had to throw the dough for 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.870
 what I would have liked lives 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.420
 even to throw the dough what 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.940
 will do does a thing that does me i knew that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.189
 makes many people of you precisely a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.750
 me from an intolerance that is once 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.299
 that uses it inside the dough 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.869
 I know like a stomach ache for the whole 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.459
 day 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.639
 so for that it wo n't have either 

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:18.149
 approve, however, apart from the part we say 

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:21.329
 chemical that happens to me there is also a 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.729
 another against, that is, it does not always work 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.429
 well the limitation being a product 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.529
 fresh and refrigerated sometimes six 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.779
 too old or if it is not used 

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:33.719
 correctly from some problems 

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:36.959
 in the result therefore for me it is a 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:39.119
 produced in quotation marks rejected then 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.859
 instead now I wanted to try just the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.469
 difference between what I use 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.370
 normally that is brand and that one 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:49.020
 in quotes I don't miss but 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.880
 first to see the prices that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.060
 of paneangeli is a package that 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.660
 within three sachets each sachet 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.300
 okay than a pound of flour 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.780
 here we have five sachets and here too 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.360
 they are good for a pound of flour 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.679
 I paid him 79 cents 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.940
 this is the package I paid for 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.800
 one euro and 09 so more or less the price 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.430
 is the one there sometimes the other monica 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.560
 euro therefore we are actually paying 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.350
 26.3 cents per bag what 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.110
 paneangeli and about 20 cents in 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.860
 this one here and therefore leaves the savings 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.350
 there is actually but anyway we go to 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.270
 see what the result is because it seems 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.650
 little savings can be sought precisely 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.470
 to assess which is the best 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.740
 product to see the result 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.690
 I will go to apply the ribs to a 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.980
 pizza dough obviously because 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.590
 the lives books that lend themselves very well 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.750
 for the pizza and I'll show you the two 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.310
 limitations ie after the first 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.320
 leavening and after the second 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.600
 I do not obviously do leavening 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.730
 see a recipe but if you are looking for some 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.160
 recipe I have to use beer here 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.570
 below I will put some links where you can 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.459
 click to go see some 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.410
 some of my pizzas made 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.940
 now let's go try yours 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.950
 products 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.260
 I have just finished making the two 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.709
 dough this has been made here 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.340
 with paneangeli this one with yeast 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.049
 auchan 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.110
 as you can see they look 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.390
 absolutely identical as a point of 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.130
 reference or used two bowls 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.170
 in the same dimension so we will be 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.510
 certain of not being influenced and then vi 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.230
 I have a look at the content 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.140
 I do n't know if you can see the envelope 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.060
 well the difference between the two yeasts e 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.730
 that the one of the paneangeli is 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.790
 really very very fine then 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.880
 almost give the feeling that yes 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.799
 but it manages to dissolve this better 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.080
 obviously it's just an impression 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.100
 then what matters is the result 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.470
 the final 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.450
 now then we 'll let it rise we 'll do 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.710
 do the first levitation and we will go to 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.230
 see a little if already from the first 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.480
 levitation there will be difference after the 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.930
 before leavening the yeast 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.030
 paneangeli gave a better result 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.330
 as you can see this is the ocean here 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.880
 remained smaller it is not leavened 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.920
 a lot however after the first levitation one 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.930
 what can happen now I will go to 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.700
 knead and see instead after one 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.890
 second leavening what will happen 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.410
 after the second leavening the 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.510
 overall result has not changed 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.350
 that is, we have doubling 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.780
 of the dough made with paneangeli e 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.240
 instead not a doubling but one 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.730
 leavening a little milder done with 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.970
 that of the ocean 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.550
 then summarizing we got a 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.950
 excellent result with the master baker 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.920
 of the angels valley the package is 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:56.070
 doubled not to intense motor of 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.620
 brewer's yeast and above all came 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.410
 beautiful smooth and homogeneous 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.470
 while for what concerns those 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.510
 of the ocean as you see and I did 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.270
 see even before the product is not 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:13.160
 absolutely doubled though anyway 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.680
 has given me a leavening in my opinion 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.000
 maybe it needs to be remixed a few more times 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.460
 as is done with brewer's yeast 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.530
 the cool one until then 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.140
 obviously it will not reach precisely the 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.410
 double of his volume then my vote 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.190
 general for the master product form 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.620
 bathers 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.590
 a 10 has them really I could not live 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.110
 without this yeast reused because 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.420
 it's really amazing to make it rise 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.670
 very well everyone mixes it into 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.980
 very little time and does not give me the problem 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.040
 of the digestibility that instead gives me 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.280
 the cool one this here from the ocean 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.550
 as I said, it's cheaper though 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.830
 I did not get the same result 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.750
 so I can't obviously give it 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.640
 same fantastic world I gave to 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.570
 that of teheran and angels but do 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:06.210
 however a good grade I give a 7 for that 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.970
 however it has the advantage of having it 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.510
 always in the pantry ready to use 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.900
 but for me with 6 cents a packet I am 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.900
 well spent 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.820
 unfortunately I have to make a small one 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:23.760
 correction and that is the vote that he gave to the 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.280
 ocean yeast is too high 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.140
 this because I had not yet given one 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.460
 look at the cooking of pizza by 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.830
 euro realized 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.140
 here it is, I can see you look 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.170
 how it came about is actually enough despite it 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:40.620
 I have made other doughs and 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:43.410
 leavening anyway then in cooking not 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.510
 pasta has grown well so if a 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.730
 yeast does not give the result of 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.620
 double to the minute volume is not 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.040
 succeeded in making yeast 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.620
 so unfortunately it barely reaches one 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.870
 enough actually not even that much 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.390
 obviously if instead you want to see the 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.980
 result of cooking using the 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.070
 yeast paneangeli way of seeing 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.960
 any video of my facts with 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.150
 precisely the limitation of the yeast of 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.960
 beer type for example those you find 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.520
 below 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.820
 I hope this video review 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.650
 he believes a kiss is useful to all and to us 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.730
 see you at the next review or video 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.730
 hello recipe hello
