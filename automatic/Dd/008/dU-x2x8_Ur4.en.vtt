it's<00:02:36.380> very<00:02:36.650> noisy<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.340> dark<00:02:39.250> Everage<00:02:40.250> camera

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
it's very noisy and dark Everage camera

it's very noisy and dark Everage camera
so<00:02:40.880> does<00:02:41.000> much<00:02:41.210> better

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
so does much better

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.949 
so does much better
but<00:02:43.220> as<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.489> can<00:02:43.610> see<00:02:43.670> there's<00:02:44.599> still<00:02:44.780> some

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
but as you can see there's still some

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599

a fixed property of Ivan's camera it

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.720 
a fixed property of Ivan's camera it
came<00:03:06.230> into<00:03:06.379> life<00:03:06.650> while<00:03:07.189> the<00:03:07.310> cameras

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
came into life while the cameras

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.000 
came into life while the cameras
manufacturing<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:09.379> will<00:03:09.590> be<00:03:09.739> there

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
manufacturing and it will be there

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.720

however<00:03:11.510> it's<00:03:11.689> additive<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:12.379> so<00:03:13.040> if<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.640> know

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
however it's additive and so if you know

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.330 
however it's additive and so if you know
what<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.209> noise<00:03:14.359> is<00:03:14.659> like<00:03:14.920> we<00:03:15.920> can<00:03:16.099> just

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
what the noise is like we can just

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.710 
what the noise is like we can just
abstract<00:03:16.639> it<00:03:16.879> from<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.209> picture

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
abstract it from the picture

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.530 
abstract it from the picture
luckily<00:03:18.680> average<00:03:19.400> camera<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:19.909> capable<00:03:20.120> of

luckily average camera is capable of

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.530 
luckily average camera is capable of
doing<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:22.670> here's<00:03:23.599> how<00:03:23.810> first<00:03:25.450> we<00:03:26.450> have

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
doing this and here's how first we have

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.020 
doing this and here's how first we have
to<00:03:26.720> show<00:03:26.900> average<00:03:27.290> camera<00:03:27.730> what<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.879> noise

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
to show average camera what the noise

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.720 
to show average camera what the noise
looks<00:03:29.359> like

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
looks like

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.330 
looks like
for<00:03:31.330> this<00:03:31.420> purpose<00:03:31.720> we<00:03:32.200> take<00:03:32.440> just<00:03:32.709> for<00:03:33.160> one

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
for this purpose we take just for one

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.610 
for this purpose we take just for one
single<00:03:33.640> time<00:03:34.000> an<00:03:34.180> average<00:03:34.599> picture<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.410> a

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
single time an average picture of a

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.550 
single time an average picture of a
white<00:03:35.769> area<00:03:36.360> we<00:03:37.360> do<00:03:37.540> this<00:03:37.750> by<00:03:38.110> setting<00:03:38.319> the

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
white area we do this by setting the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.559 
white area we do this by setting the
picture<00:03:38.890> number<00:03:39.040> parameter<00:03:39.610> to<00:03:40.090> its<00:03:40.209> maximum

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
picture number parameter to its maximum

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.800 
picture number parameter to its maximum
to<00:03:41.349> achieve<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:42.129> best<00:03:42.160> possible<00:03:42.550> result<00:03:43.209> and

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
to achieve the best possible result and

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.500 
to achieve the best possible result and
then<00:03:44.440> better<00:03:45.099> take<00:03:45.400> these<00:03:45.580> pictures<00:03:45.849> with<00:03:46.450> a

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
then better take these pictures with a

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.640 
then better take these pictures with a
piece<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:47.110> white<00:03:47.319> paper<00:03:47.349> put<00:03:48.160> over<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.970> camera

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
piece of white paper put over the camera

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.920 
piece of white paper put over the camera
then<00:03:50.650> we<00:03:50.800> will<00:03:51.010> tell<00:03:51.250> average<00:03:51.670> camera<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.750> use

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
then we will tell average camera to use

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.750 
then we will tell average camera to use
this<00:03:53.140> picture<00:03:53.560> as<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.769> noise<00:03:54.099> fingerprint

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
this picture as the noise fingerprint

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.509 
this picture as the noise fingerprint
from<00:03:55.720> no.1<00:03:55.900> we<00:03:56.500> can<00:03:56.709> remove<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.220> banging

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
from no.1 we can remove the banging

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.580 
from no.1 we can remove the banging
noise<00:03:57.549> from<00:03:57.880> any<00:03:58.090> picture<00:03:58.480> we<00:03:58.599> take<00:03:58.810> by<00:03:59.290> just

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
noise from any picture we take by just

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.729 
noise from any picture we take by just
