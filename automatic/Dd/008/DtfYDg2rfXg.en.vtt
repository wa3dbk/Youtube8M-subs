00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
wall and that's that's what happens with

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.109 
wall and that's that's what happens with
the<00:02:05.799> growth<00:02:05.979> plate<00:02:06.189> injuries<00:02:06.490> especially<00:02:06.759> the

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
the growth plate injuries especially the

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.060 
the growth plate injuries especially the
elbow<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:07.659> youth<00:02:08.019> baseball<00:02:08.259> players<00:02:08.649> so<00:02:08.920> as

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
elbow and youth baseball players so as

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.300 
elbow and youth baseball players so as
they<00:02:09.220> get<00:02:09.369> older<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.690> growth<00:02:10.869> plate<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:12.010> just

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
they get older the growth plate it just

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.310 
they get older the growth plate it just
goes<00:02:12.459> away<00:02:12.610> or<00:02:13.030> no<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.810> growth<00:02:13.989> plate<00:02:14.170> goes

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
goes away or no the growth plate goes

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.630 
goes away or no the growth plate goes
through<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.560> process<00:02:14.650> called<00:02:14.920> ossification

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
through a process called ossification

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.130 
through a process called ossification
where<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.090> cartilage<00:02:16.390> will<00:02:16.630> turn<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.989> bone

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
where the cartilage will turn to bone

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.930 
where the cartilage will turn to bone
it's<00:02:17.380> just<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:17.709> your<00:02:17.860> plaster<00:02:18.310> wall<00:02:18.489> turning

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
it's just like your plaster wall turning

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.000 
it's just like your plaster wall turning
into<00:02:19.180> cement<00:02:19.510> now<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.019> anchor<00:02:20.380> point<00:02:20.709> is<00:02:20.860> no

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
into cement now the anchor point is no

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.740 
into cement now the anchor point is no
longer<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.370> weak<00:02:21.519> spot<00:02:21.790> now<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.269> weak<00:02:22.510> spot

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
longer the weak spot now the weak spot

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.300 
longer the weak spot now the weak spot
becomes<00:02:23.019> a<00:02:23.170> muscle<00:02:23.470> or<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.680> tendon<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.160> the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
becomes a muscle or the tendon so the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.710 
becomes a muscle or the tendon so the
older<00:02:24.579> kids<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.970> high<00:02:25.120> schooler's<00:02:25.570> the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
older kids the high schooler's the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.840 
older kids the high schooler's the
college<00:02:26.049> kids<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.829> course<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.160> pros<00:02:27.370> they

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
college kids and of course the pros they

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.610 
college kids and of course the pros they
develop<00:02:28.269> tendonitis<00:02:28.870> because<00:02:29.200> their<00:02:29.410> growth

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
develop tendonitis because their growth

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.259 
develop tendonitis because their growth
plates<00:02:29.890> are<00:02:30.040> no<00:02:30.160> longer<00:02:30.370> cartilage<00:02:30.910> they've

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
plates are no longer cartilage they've

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.000 
plates are no longer cartilage they've
turned<00:02:31.480> they've<00:02:31.750> turned<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.110> bone<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:32.560> the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
turned they've turned to bone so the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.220 
turned they've turned to bone so the
younger<00:02:33.280> kids<00:02:33.549> are<00:02:34.269> having<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.600> growth<00:02:34.989> plate

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
younger kids are having a growth plate

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.750 
younger kids are having a growth plate
problem<00:02:35.590> because<00:02:35.829> that's<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.220> weakest<00:02:36.549> point

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
problem because that's the weakest point

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.430 
problem because that's the weakest point
the<00:02:37.269> older<00:02:37.510> kids<00:02:37.690> are<00:02:37.810> having<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.110> tendon

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
the older kids are having the tendon

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.780 
the older kids are having the tendon
problem<00:02:38.799> or<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:38.980> muscle<00:02:39.280> problem<00:02:39.519> because

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
problem or the muscle problem because

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.670 
problem or the muscle problem because
that's<00:02:40.000> that's<00:02:40.540> correct<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:41.500> growth

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
that's that's correct is that growth

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.770 
that's that's correct is that growth
plate<00:02:41.709> plate<00:02:42.400> problem<00:02:42.730> coming<00:02:42.940> from<00:02:43.209> overuse

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
plate plate problem coming from overuse

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.640 
plate plate problem coming from overuse
or<00:02:43.989> in

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
or in

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.520 
or in
correct<00:02:44.890> use<00:02:45.159> both<00:02:46.140> overuse<00:02:47.140> injuries

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
correct use both overuse injuries

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.009 
correct use both overuse injuries
basically<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.819> it's<00:02:49.180> too<00:02:49.360> much<00:02:49.540> too<00:02:49.780> soon

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
basically is is it's too much too soon

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.500 
basically is is it's too much too soon
too<00:02:50.500> much<00:02:50.709> throwing<00:02:51.040> too<00:02:51.579> many<00:02:51.819> pitches<00:02:52.090> too

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
too much throwing too many pitches too

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.660 
too much throwing too many pitches too
much<00:02:52.689> hitting<00:02:52.930> too<00:02:53.170> much<00:02:53.349> running<00:02:53.620> any<00:02:54.280> tissue

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
much hitting too much running any tissue

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.309 
much hitting too much running any tissue
whether<00:02:55.000> it's<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.239> muscle<00:02:55.480> attendant<00:02:56.230> a

whether it's a muscle attendant a
cartilage<00:02:56.739> growth<00:02:56.980> plate<00:02:57.280> or<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.489> bone<00:02:57.700> has<00:02:58.180> has

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
cartilage growth plate or a bone has has

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.179 
cartilage growth plate or a bone has has
a<00:02:58.720> threshold<00:02:58.959> of<00:02:59.230> failure<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.680> can<00:02:59.950> have<00:03:00.069> the

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
a threshold of failure you can have the

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.429 
a threshold of failure you can have the
most<00:03:00.400> perfect<00:03:00.819> technique<00:03:01.150> known<00:03:01.750> but<00:03:02.260> there's

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
most perfect technique known but there's

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.660 
most perfect technique known but there's
always<00:03:02.590> going<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.799> be<00:03:02.859> some<00:03:03.129> threshold<00:03:03.280> where

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
always going to be some threshold where

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.009 
always going to be some threshold where
that<00:03:03.790> tissue<00:03:04.000> fails<00:03:04.359> and<00:03:04.629> then<00:03:04.689> becomes

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
that tissue fails and then becomes

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.170 
that tissue fails and then becomes
injured<00:03:05.349> so<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.159> kids<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.489> have<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:07.060> have

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
injured so the kids that have that have

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.880 
injured so the kids that have that have
poor<00:03:07.450> technique<00:03:07.659> that<00:03:08.109> might<00:03:08.260> drop<00:03:08.470> their<00:03:08.709> arm

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
poor technique that might drop their arm

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.349 
poor technique that might drop their arm
that<00:03:09.099> might<00:03:09.220> open<00:03:09.489> up<00:03:09.609> too<00:03:09.790> soon<00:03:10.000> or<00:03:10.239> they

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
that might open up too soon or they

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.509 
that might open up too soon or they
throw<00:03:10.540> all<00:03:10.840> arm<00:03:11.319> then<00:03:11.829> those<00:03:12.010> kids<00:03:12.250> are<00:03:12.400> going

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
throw all arm then those kids are going

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.699 
throw all arm then those kids are going
to<00:03:12.579> have<00:03:12.790> have<00:03:13.090> an<00:03:13.299> injury<00:03:13.569> resulting<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.349> lot

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
to have have an injury resulting a lot

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:15.929 
to have have an injury resulting a lot
sooner<00:03:14.920> than<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.280> kid<00:03:15.430> with<00:03:15.579> with<00:03:15.760> better

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939 
sooner than the kid with with better

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.089 
sooner than the kid with with better
technique<00:03:16.359> so<00:03:16.690> how<00:03:17.109> do<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.319> know<00:03:17.349> that<00:03:17.500> it's

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
technique so how do you know that it's

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.490

see somebody and I think it's that type
of<00:04:16.810> scenario<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.680> we're<00:04:17.949> trying<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.280> avoid

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
of scenario that we're trying to avoid

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
it early enough it's easier to treat

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.210 
it early enough it's easier to treat
usually<00:04:25.659> it<00:04:25.750> is<00:04:25.840> now<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.139> fracture<00:04:26.620> well<00:04:26.800> those

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
treat the growth plate injury in an arm

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.969 
treat the growth plate injury in an arm
well<00:04:40.690> when<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:40.930> kid<00:04:41.020> starts<00:04:41.530> complaining<00:04:41.800> of

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
well when a kid starts complaining of

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.680 
well when a kid starts complaining of
elbow<00:04:42.310> pain<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.729> they<00:04:42.789> see<00:04:42.849> us<00:04:43.000> it<00:04:43.240> hurts<00:04:43.360> over

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
elbow pain and they see us it hurts over

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.180 
elbow pain and they see us it hurts over
here<00:04:43.870> by<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.050> inner<00:04:44.260> part<00:04:44.590> of<00:04:44.680> my<00:04:44.770> elbow<00:04:44.919> when

I throw to me if they're under 14 that's

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.170 
I throw to me if they're under 14 that's
a<00:04:47.949> growth<00:04:48.159> plate<00:04:48.370> injury<00:04:48.699> to<00:04:48.849> a<00:04:48.880> proven

in hopefully you don't have to operate
it<00:05:12.590> all<00:05:12.680> depends<00:05:13.070> on<00:05:13.130> how<00:05:13.250> far<00:05:13.520> that<00:05:13.760> growth

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
it all depends on how far that growth

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.340 
it all depends on how far that growth
plate<00:05:14.000> separates<00:05:14.690> if<00:05:14.900> that<00:05:15.110> growth<00:05:15.320> plate

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
plate separates if that growth plate

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.320 
plate separates if that growth plate
pulls<00:05:15.830> apart<00:05:15.980> feathers<00:05:16.760> there's<00:05:16.970> different

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
pulls apart feathers there's different

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.820 
pulls apart feathers there's different
parameters<00:05:17.720> but<00:05:17.870> I<00:05:17.900> use<00:05:18.080> nine<00:05:18.320> millimeters

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
parameters but I use nine millimeters

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.320 
parameters but I use nine millimeters
which<00:05:19.010> isn't<00:05:19.160> very<00:05:19.400> far<00:05:19.610> if<00:05:19.820> it<00:05:19.940> separates

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
which isn't very far if it separates

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.480 
which isn't very far if it separates
nine<00:05:20.630> millimeters<00:05:21.170> from<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:21.410> main<00:05:21.680> bone<00:05:21.920> then

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
nine millimeters from the main bone then

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.830 
nine millimeters from the main bone then
that's<00:05:22.670> an<00:05:22.820> indication<00:05:22.940> for<00:05:23.510> a<00:05:23.540> surgical

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840

that's an indication for a surgical
referral<00:05:24.380> where<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.890> surgeons<00:05:25.280> will<00:05:25.430> have<00:05:25.550> to
