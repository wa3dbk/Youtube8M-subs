00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
like Jessa and I to represent is a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.030 
like Jessa and I to represent is a
picture<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.799> hope<00:03:07.100> for<00:03:07.820> how<00:03:08.000> this<00:03:08.329> can<00:03:08.600> change

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
picture of hope for how this can change

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.759 
picture of hope for how this can change
and<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.100> think<00:03:10.430> that<00:03:11.140> all<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.380> we've<00:03:12.500> talked

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
and I think that all that we've talked

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.340 
and I think that all that we've talked
about<00:03:13.390> through<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.540> years<00:03:14.810> working<00:03:15.110> together

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
about through the years working together

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.069 
about through the years working together
is<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.970> good<00:03:17.630> example<00:03:17.810> of<00:03:18.380> how<00:03:18.440> any<00:03:19.400> people<00:03:20.079> can

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
is a good example of how any people can

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.120 
is a good example of how any people can
work<00:03:21.739> to<00:03:22.519> a<00:03:22.549> point<00:03:23.140> where<00:03:24.140> we<00:03:24.290> can<00:03:24.500> understand

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
work to a point where we can understand

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.550 
work to a point where we can understand
this<00:03:25.549> issue<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.329> way<00:03:26.360> that<00:03:26.750> allows<00:03:27.140> us<00:03:27.410> to

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
this issue in a way that allows us to

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.530 
this issue in a way that allows us to
work<00:03:27.680> together<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:28.489> this<00:03:28.940> picture<00:03:29.180> of<00:03:29.450> this

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
work together so this picture of this

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.390 
work together so this picture of this
older<00:03:29.900> woman<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.380> this<00:03:30.440> younger<00:03:30.860> man<00:03:30.890> who

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
older woman and this younger man who

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.400 
older woman and this younger man who
have<00:03:31.549> figured<00:03:31.940> it<00:03:32.060> out<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.750> me<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.140> real

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
have figured it out to me is a real

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.199 
have figured it out to me is a real
picture<00:03:33.680> of<00:03:33.920> hope<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.430> think<00:03:34.670> that's<00:03:35.030> what's
