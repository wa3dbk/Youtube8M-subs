00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.009
 textures here I think many of you 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:14.499
 faced let's then who works with 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:17.080
 interiors and whether recently passed 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:19.150
 going to go to the exterior me too 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.359
 always started working with my 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.800
 the interiors went away when somehow wrong 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.859
 lucky i started with furniture 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.150
 production in a company job 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.939
 visualization is a matter of which designers 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.550
 long worked painted designer 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.379
 they themselves began to treat her later 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.180
 visualization of exteriors I wanted 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.699
 try and then another job and 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.789
 the first project and your tumbled down and saw 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.440
 those projects that are before and after the most 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:50.410
 term project when read description 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:52.780
 to this master class I think you saw him 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.109
 was such a very primitive such 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.440
 quality is how can finally be done and 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:01.149
 civilizations and from not like i don't 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.890
 I think in fact that such a strong 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.320
 the difference may be between the interior and 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.070
 Exterior Although the principle seems to be the same 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.250
 the most code there is a big difference in what 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.210
 Illumination there is a difference and say what 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.310
 cardinal but it is there is a difference in 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.340
 textures there is a difference of materials and 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.369
 accordingly in the cameras too 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.759
 in large all over a little bit 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:31.329
 but in the price of work is a separate topic 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.479
 exteriors are more expensive if you take in 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:39.159
 section but the project so here are the batteries we 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:41.079
 see all objects pretty close example 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.939
 there is a sofa 2 meters away from us we can 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.690
 see us the field of what color 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.700
 there are flowers of new products 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.010
 what texture if there is no relief or 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.890
 there is no relief here it will depend 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.590
 realistic detailing and so on in 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.240
 the case with interiors is not so we see 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.670
 object as a rule from afar 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.360
 let's see what we can here 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.030
 see see plaster here 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.580
 if they are the house of fault is harm 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.820
 foreground take something there yes he sure 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.160
 will be 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.160
 or in this case it is noticeable that there is 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.240
 some spots on the pest 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.700
 small such blotches that is 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.880
 the texture is not perfect white it is not easy 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.920
 white color this texture texture with 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.880
 such unwind such a dingy and 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.130
 stained plaster as if small 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.090
 changes somewhere may be 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:38.300
 chipped everything you draw all that u 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:41.990
 on tour contains we see and in too 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.470
 time we see large areas behind 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:49.820
 textured that fence here metro-2 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.270
 probably this part here yes meter too 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.900
 three 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.209
 This is the bigger part of here. 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.020
 tiles will do however that is we 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.930
 see huge pieces of the surface behind 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.459
 Due to this we need high quality 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.770
 seamless texture without bright 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.230
 duplicate elements to avoid 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:14.480
 You can see the ring example if there were 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.670
 motley texture in this place texture 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.519
 it would not be very good quality 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.920
 not brought this full perfect bichon 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.400
 nasty we could see incomprehensible 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.180
 aging 1 1 2 darkening on texture 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.190
 it would not be very pretty sure that 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.380
 here it is dark really repeating 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.870
 ugly clear that this is visualization 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.720
 does not look very good as before 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.370
 to avoid 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.700
 well, and in general for those who do not know it 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.890
 repeat element repeat fragment 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.550
 texture texture ends with its end 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.450
 here goes seam and beautiful and begins 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:57.250
 new texture i.e. end with beginning 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:00.440
 fits in as the beginning with the end is different 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.680
 the texture is not seamless it turns out 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.170
 trolling point of view from this side 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.210
 repetition no the ring this is a seam 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.530
 not visible on the other side as the length 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.840
 but nevertheless we see these white ones 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.359
 bright reason they repeat although they 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.900
 different they are all the same repeated and this 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.479
 too ugly this should be avoided 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.270
 for large surfaces you need to do 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:29.210
 I feel more evenly in color so that 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.280
 nothing there will do and sulla to 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.550
 I could not see these white stripes verse 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.620
 need to do as per color as the whole country 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.620
 so that there is no such contrast 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:48.329
 that is, these are these items 

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:53.689
 explained, that is, you need a good 

00:04:48.329 --> 00:05:01.159
 remember the picture where we where I showed 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:05:05.339
 near steam for now we are here 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:09.509
 detail all the maximum here to 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:12.239
 boards with detailed various point knots 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.619
 and so on it is all seen on above neighbors 

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:16.259
 clans but is it necessary in the plans 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:18.360
 Well, these little details will not see 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.699
 that is, we do not need them so this 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.179
 detailed texture can not be used 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:27.539
 can take a big piece 

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:31.939
 primitive usually texture like wood 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:34.169
 either the earth grandpa is not important for a long time 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:36.059
 plaster with this bank too 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.179
 draw not necessarily given 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:39.539
 case, the display would have been better in the Middle 

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:41.489
 plan 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.469
 task of the planet but I will not be confused 

00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:47.039
 will not be visible moreover he will 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.749
 give you such ugly noises and points 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.529
 various 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:51.529
 not only photos 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:06:00.830
 photos of the hotel he is 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:03.469
 showed go back texture then 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:08.800
 immediately you need to start a project 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:08.800
 decide yourself which part you are doing 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:18.620
 a proximal inner angle and far 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:23.180
 rogoz watching what you will work out 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.870
 based on this already before the texture if you 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.029
 do 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.889
 the distant plan is generally a birdie ie view 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:30.909
 on top of the landscape 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:33.469
 then there needs even less elaboration and 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:37.849
 smaller bump displays as little as possible 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:38.120
 so that there is no noise well, that is this 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.930
 here 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.930
 necessarily
