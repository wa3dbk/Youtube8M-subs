 Welcome to another class 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.279
 of an advanced xp hindu 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.389
 there are no teachers henrique rabbit 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.389
 and today I'll be explaining to you one more resource 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.409
 that windows xp offers for us is the weight in reality are two resources 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.259
 that I will be present in the room 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:20.060
 which 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.720
 the first one is the following I am and how 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.810
 it is his cause that owen's voice 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.619
 is that they are chat files from msn d 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.250
 want to see that those who come in such a program 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.520
 that it also makes the computer a little heavy at the time the 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.640
 unnecessary 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.670
 and other 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.220
 The way we are going to learn is common 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.390
 blair 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.370
 disappeared or made to disappear the icons does not hide all the icons 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.200
 take care of work 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.030
 and do 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.800
 these icons come back again 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.319
 why is it important 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:56.339
 what sometimes 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.660
 by some slip 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.750
 or is some of you stayed somewhere 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.890
 Flag Inappropriate Content 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.549
 someplace wrong in the store and work 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.340
 did this procedure without wanting to 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.549
 know how to do 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.130
 how it does and how it undoes 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.130
 this option said 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.640
 the dust rabat 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.940
 so to do inspections or click with my right side, do not start with 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.370
 hide the icons of work 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.270
 right side 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.270
 I'm going to come here unorganized and with that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.280
 it has this option here person shows desktop icons I go 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
 Unchecked, I can see that it's marked 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.370
 Uncheck assumption he'll think a little bit that I said 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.520
 hide all icons 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.860
 from my desktop 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.880
 to make me go back and perform the same procedure 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.710
 even if the right side maristela basso 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.060
 organize and with that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.060
 I'll show work icons 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.330
 He will think a little about the father. 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.980
 bring me back all my month 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.379
 from my desktop 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.640
 now we go 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.340
 was the second step that is 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.879
 delete the log files 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.540
 Windows XP era 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.270
 it's all clicking start 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.889
 involved in researching 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.319
 there are kilos or pastes 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.169
 one that moves satellite 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.389
 I'll come here in every file or folder 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:33.039
 and here I ask the first list all here I hope to do a scan 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.110
 in my hd 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.150
 no click 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.460
 and I put this syntax asterisk dot 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.399
 and ran inter 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:44.870
 he will get it for me 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.140
 all nanda log files do a search 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.140
 in all the log files says that I have inside my Hindus and skewer 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:57.169
 it's logical that it has some files I must say they can not be deleted 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:02.029
 that they are needed there for a smooth operation of the system. 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:05.300
 operational such but do not worry that excess 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.880
 it was the regis this year do not go 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.189
 they will not be deleted 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.729
 The rest is interesting, you're deleting it, okay? 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.219
 Let's check in a rare one with the amount that you give me as soon as I 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:20.149
 have 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:21.009
 tiger 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.389
 is finding one more 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.499
 As you will have done a lot of research, it will 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.569
 is that the kinea is going up the bar takeoff ne 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.049
 Look, we took over a little bit. 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.129
 all that you can 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.389
 It's personal, you're deleting 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.349
 a ways to delay all of this if it does not add up to all such dates select 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.489
 all 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.119
 tight milk 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:52.579
 Let's wait for the message she's sure to be sent to 44 items 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.929
 he will delete what he gets will delete 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:04:00.889
 and what is not me in this saleh will not let flow 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.269
 I did not delete it 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.579
 so we will not have as we explain everything 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.349
 but let's go with her a little bit in a bit then 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.079
 that's right 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.279
 Let's check it out. 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:15.279
 This study induced I think I will not stop fighting 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.379
 He has not stopped fighting in those days. 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.379
 one of them here 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.659
 did not stop fighting 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.379
 Let's see this here. 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.999
 Look there, I'm an adult. 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.999
 Oedipus of lyrics but a little could not avoid 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.789
 Let's try a little bit more 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.789
 it is also not possible to handle these icons 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.419
 in these he also did not stop fighting 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.520
 each person 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.509
 so do not worry what you do not 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.509
 could not delete it, it will not let 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.279
 but whatever is feasible 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:07.279
 He is letting it be deleted there. 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.839
 there there 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.839
 drink a little 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.809
 It is certain that the center 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:21.740
 it is necessary to make that scan there 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.740
 on your pc 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.240
 are files that are not 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.240
 required 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.559
 Let's see if it will delete 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.460
 director 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:50.520
