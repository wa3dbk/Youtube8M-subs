00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
do we have here of a pretty much a

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.650 
do we have here of a pretty much a
freighter<00:00:36.360> doc<00:00:37.010> for<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.040> ships<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.460> course<00:00:38.700> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
freighter doc for the ships of course it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.049 
freighter doc for the ships of course it
is<00:00:39.840> very<00:00:40.200> very<00:00:40.410> arena<00:00:41.129> based<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.640> would<00:00:41.820> always

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
is very very arena based I would always

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.720 
is very very arena based I would always
almost<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.870> very<00:00:43.440> halo<00:00:43.890> esque<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.309> remembered

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
almost a very halo esque I remembered

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.240 
almost a very halo esque I remembered
that<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.030> Halo<00:00:45.300> 3<00:00:45.420> there<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.110> level<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.770> I

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that in Halo 3 there is a level and I

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.610 
that in Halo 3 there is a level and I
think<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.670> might<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.180> downloadable<00:00:49.110> content

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
think it might be a downloadable content

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
think it might be a downloadable content
level<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.340> came<00:00:50.550> later<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.329> very

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
level that came later that is very

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.400 
level that came later that is very
similar<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:53.059> this<00:00:54.059> map<00:00:54.809> actually<00:00:54.989> does

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
similar to this this map actually does

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.610 
similar to this this map actually does
support<00:00:55.940> two-way<00:00:56.940> capture<00:00:57.420> flag<00:00:57.629> which<00:00:58.379> I

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
support two-way capture flag which I

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.229 
support two-way capture flag which I
think<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.920> would<00:00:59.070> be<00:00:59.100> perfect<00:00:59.550> for<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.030> it

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
think it would be perfect for it is it

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.990 
think it would be perfect for it is it
has<00:01:00.719> varied<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.230> classic<00:01:01.710> classic<00:01:02.010> feel<00:01:02.370> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
has varied a classic classic feel you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.200 
has varied a classic classic feel you
know<00:01:03.090> quake<00:01:04.010> unreal<00:01:05.810> halo<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.840> would<00:01:07.140> also<00:01:08.210> fit

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
know quake unreal halo I would also fit

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.520 
know quake unreal halo I would also fit
in<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.950> I'm<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.369> solid<00:01:12.530> multiplayer

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
in there I'm just a solid multiplayer

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.880 
in there I'm just a solid multiplayer
madness<00:01:14.189> thing<00:01:14.570> they<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.720> turrets<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.619> each

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
madness thing they have turrets on each

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.649 
madness thing they have turrets on each
of<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.070> platform's<00:01:17.580> down<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.509> course

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
of the platform's down there of course

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.179 
of the platform's down there of course
is<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> most<00:01:19.140> space<00:01:19.470> though<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.979> some

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.490 
is the most space though you have some
cover<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:21.060> though<00:01:21.479> there<00:01:21.780> are<00:01:21.900> those<00:01:22.080> you

diamond in a way what's interesting is

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.399 
diamond in a way what's interesting is
that<00:01:41.130> way<00:01:41.700> point<00:01:41.970> 1<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.390> 1<00:01:42.479> point2<00:01:42.869> are<00:01:43.380> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
that way point 1 and 1 point2 are a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.020 
that way point 1 and 1 point2 are a
little<00:01:43.649> bit<00:01:43.829> further<00:01:44.100> away<00:01:44.430> from<00:01:44.610> each<00:01:44.880> other

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
tickets we are going very equally so the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.089 
tickets we are going very equally so the
balance<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.049> this<00:02:55.170> map<00:02:55.379> is<00:02:55.560> pretty<00:02:55.980> good

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
balance that this map is pretty good

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.210 
balance that this map is pretty good
though<00:02:56.359> even<00:02:57.359> though<00:02:57.420> what<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.599> said<00:02:57.840> about<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
though even though what I said about the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.000 
though even though what I said about the
turret<00:02:59.220> maybe<00:02:59.700> they<00:02:59.879> have<00:02:59.970> also<00:03:00.239> some<00:03:00.540> Turin

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
turret maybe they have also some Turin

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.309 
turret maybe they have also some Turin
okay<00:03:02.209> well<00:03:03.209> they<00:03:03.299> have<00:03:03.389> that<00:03:03.569> too<00:03:03.840> right<00:03:03.870> over

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
okay well they have that too right over

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:12.740 
okay well they have that too right over
there<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:06.440> choose<00:03:07.440> rockets<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.340> get<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:11.750> guess

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
there I choose rockets I get it I guess

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.059 
there I choose rockets I get it I guess
that<00:03:12.930> bounces<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.410> out<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.560> little<00:03:13.769> bit<00:03:13.859> but

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
that bounces it out a little bit but

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.520 
that bounces it out a little bit but
still<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.239> just<00:03:15.419> it<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.199> think

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
still it is just it is it is I think

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.309

to<00:04:15.010> capture<00:04:15.190> something<00:04:19.500> actually<00:04:20.500> halos

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
to capture something actually halos

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.310 
to capture something actually halos
another<00:04:21.940> force<00:04:22.390> not<00:04:22.540> about<00:04:22.750> capturing<00:04:22.990> stuff

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
another force not about capturing stuff

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.250 
another force not about capturing stuff
but<00:04:23.530> you<00:04:24.070> know<00:04:24.160> what<00:04:24.280> i<00:04:24.310> mean<00:04:24.750> just<00:04:25.750> supporting

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
but you know what i mean just supporting

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.510 
but you know what i mean just supporting
an<00:04:26.350> area

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.939 

but<00:04:33.240> i<00:04:33.300> would<00:04:33.360> guess<00:04:33.479> like<00:04:33.810> my<00:04:34.289> most<00:04:34.650> watched

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
but i would guess like my most watched

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.570 
but i would guess like my most watched
video<00:04:35.280> is<00:04:35.629> battle<00:04:36.629> arena<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.199> i<00:04:38.009> think<00:04:38.370> people

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
video is battle arena and i think people

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.270 
video is battle arena and i think people
just<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.300> they<00:04:39.690> love<00:04:39.990> this<00:04:40.259> type<00:04:40.500> of<00:04:40.530> you<00:04:41.220> know

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
just I they love this type of you know

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.730 
just I they love this type of you know
arena<00:04:41.639> play<00:04:41.909> and<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.150> think<00:04:42.479> they<00:04:43.379> would<00:04:43.530> also

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
arena play and I think they would also

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.260 
arena play and I think they would also
really<00:04:44.250> love<00:04:44.460> this<00:04:44.639> map<00:04:44.879> so<00:04:45.030> this<00:04:45.150> is

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
really love this map so this is

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.869 
really love this map so this is
definitely<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.690> recommendation<00:04:45.990> for<00:04:46.530> those

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
definitely a recommendation for those

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.180 
definitely a recommendation for those
who<00:04:47.879> like<00:04:48.150> that<00:04:48.479> you<00:04:48.690> know<00:04:48.720> halo<00:04:49.409> type<00:04:50.039> of

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
who like that you know halo type of

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.629 
who like that you know halo type of
gameplay<00:04:50.930> halo<00:04:51.930> unreal<00:04:52.470> so<00:04:53.069> that<00:04:53.250> old-school

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
gameplay halo unreal so that old-school

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.480 
gameplay halo unreal so that old-school
fuel<00:04:54.139> like<00:04:55.139> I<00:04:55.259> said<00:04:55.470> it<00:04:55.590> does<00:04:55.800> support<00:04:56.009> capture

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
fuel like I said it does support capture

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.330 
fuel like I said it does support capture
the<00:04:56.580> flag<00:04:56.819> too<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:57.449> think<00:04:58.169> it<00:04:58.349> is<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.740> great<00:04:59.009> map

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
the flag too I think it is a great map

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.540 
the flag too I think it is a great map
for<00:04:59.610> that<00:05:00.590> though<00:05:01.590> like<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:01.860> said<00:05:02.039> still<00:05:02.310> the

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
for that though like I said still the

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.980 
for that though like I said still the
the<00:05:02.789> turrets<00:05:03.240> might<00:05:03.569> be<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.780> little

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
the turrets might be a little

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.580 
the turrets might be a little
overpowered<00:05:05.270> that's<00:05:06.270> my<00:05:06.449> only<00:05:06.630> concern<00:05:06.750> but

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
overpowered that's my only concern but

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.980 
overpowered that's my only concern but
other<00:05:07.800> than<00:05:07.979> that<00:05:08.090> this<00:05:09.090> is<00:05:09.300> a<00:05:09.330> perfect

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
other than that this is a perfect

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.909 
other than that this is a perfect
balance<00:05:10.110> Serena<00:05:10.740> map<00:05:12.229> and<00:05:13.229> we<00:05:13.319> had<00:05:13.470> maps<00:05:13.740> you

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
balance Serena map and we had maps you

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.409 
balance Serena map and we had maps you
know<00:05:14.039> that<00:05:14.190> would<00:05:14.310> trippy<00:05:14.639> like<00:05:14.819> that<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.030> duel

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
know that would trippy like that a duel

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.960 
know that would trippy like that a duel
arena<00:05:15.870> map<00:05:16.380> thing<00:05:16.680> which<00:05:17.250> just<00:05:17.490> was<00:05:17.669> pretty

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
arena map thing which just was pretty

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.230 
arena map thing which just was pretty
bad<00:05:18.560> but<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:19.710> is<00:05:19.919> this<00:05:20.220> is<00:05:20.340> really<00:05:20.520> solid<00:05:20.909> I

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.790 

think<00:05:24.240> Geno's<00:05:24.539> is<00:05:24.659> also<00:05:24.870> you<00:05:24.930> know<00:05:25.139> a<00:05:25.169> very

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.790 
think Geno's is also you know a very
good<00:05:25.979> setting<00:05:26.759> for<00:05:26.789> this<00:05:27.349> the<00:05:28.349> color<00:05:28.590> scheme

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
good setting for this the color scheme

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.260 
good setting for this the color scheme
really<00:05:29.250> fits<00:05:29.669> that

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:44.740
