00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.780
 or more 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.570
 it's another night that I wake up without power 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.000
 sleep there is a voice inside me that 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.099
 it means something that fights for my dream 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.529
 with patience and commitment that despite 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.900
 the obstacles do not stop trying 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.050
 I'm still here unloading my anger in the 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.110
 mine even if you think nothing happens to me 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.900
 I carry that emptiness inside you for a long time 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.230
 I see I'm laughing 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.390
 matured I wonder what the fuck 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.970
 is happening in this world families 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.250
 evicted people voted in the streets without 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.470
 right nothing in these times that run 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.940
 where the rich richer and the poor are more 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.610
 poor 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.320
 suffering tremendous political situation 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.600
 they believe that the valuable thing is in their 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.180
 pockets but what's really valuable is 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.690
 in the heart if they knew how many times 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.710
 I fell but I got up again 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.650
 If they knew how many times I lost 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.130
 to later be able to earn more now I do not 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.510
 I will give up I will never leave 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.360
 to fight I know that the road will not be easy 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.100
 but I have a dream that achieve live the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.220
 life and let live 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.950
 that the best is yet to come that the most 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.290
 important is the dirty money if not 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.950
 outside the people who most want to smile 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.649
 that hip hop real union we are not 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.369
 problems are the solution I imagine 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.280
 that we all unite and together we fight 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.979
 for the revolution I know that everything will change 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.140
 sooner or later they do not catalog us 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.539
 to close because apart from closing 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.119
 we are also human beings always me 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.520
 has turned when I've been lost cougars 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.119
 understood when I've been wrong and 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.390
 thanks to you is smiled and learned that 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.819
 I have nothing to hide I have nothing 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.770
 that hide there is a voice inside me that 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.290
 I have to take out so as not to suffer 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.120
 and to be able to feel what I want 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.160
 make me convey what I write in 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.770
 the paper I have nothing to hide there 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.160
 a voice inside me that I have to take out 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.290
 not to suffer and be able to explain to 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.570
 meaning I want to make it transmit 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.830
 what I write on the paper convey what 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.830
 I live in the moment
