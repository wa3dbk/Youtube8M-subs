00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.500
 good morning everyone is alive 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.960
 on the brand new video today I'm here for 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.930
 show you the best of the gta casette 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.550
 of hgh 9th 10 with the flywheel for the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.170
 farming this video was me 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.519
 requested by some users and therefore I have 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.750
 decided to wear veil 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.300
 I recommend boys if you have any 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.609
 questions of opinions express the pure 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.859
 below in the comments provided they are 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.600
 peaceful therefore likely a vote also 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.770
 make mistakes on the layout however they are 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.329
 those that I think work 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.129
 better and then just let me know you 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.960
 left immediately a nice like and now 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.670
 let's start immediately with the video 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.829
 boys the first of the exhibition will be 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.450
 that of the town hall on level 7 which 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.309
 as you can see from the image is 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.260
 precisely this facts here I find that i 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.879
 deposits desire the gold deposits are 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.500
 positioned and very positions 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.699
 favorable also by black elixir like 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 you can see they are three mortals 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.719
 within the sorcerer's authors 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.250
 after which more air defenses on the sides e 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.350
 how to predict the flywheel is located in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.180
 lower right here maybe here you can 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.939
 discuss why you could find them 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.470
 however other villages however I have put 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.570
 those that I think are the best 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.799
 then a personal opinion and precisely 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.229
 I also tried it on my village 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.630
 I must say that it can go very well for 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.549
 the farming have me 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.049
 they have never taken me but 100 percent 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.110
 of all the resources they could 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.240
 take me maximum maximum 30 40 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.829
 percent took me out of 200,000 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.380
 70 milan have taken anyway guys 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.030
 I think it's very very good like 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.189
 village we now pass to the town hall a 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.399
 level 8 where the flywheel defends 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.009
 the black elixir deposits of 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.200
 elixir and gold indeed as you see 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.759
 this point has its own towards them too 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.810
 the barbarian king and the bran castle are 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.789
 well protected otherwise it is a classic 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.009
 construction let's say of th 8 for the 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.750
 making me is not something special 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.640
 however, boys are not bad at all 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.830
 as village 15 we will have a spring onion 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.360
 seat in farming I recommend you do it 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.610
 try it and tell me below in 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.189
 comments if it was useful or not 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.689
 here we are with the layout of th 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.759
 level 9 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.429
 as you can see it is very very nice 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.110
 to be seen also very well located now 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.950
 I know I'm good at talking though now 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.750
 I'll explain you better 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.190
 as you can see the two arcs x1 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.290
 right in the center of the village e 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.780
 they will defend the deposits very well 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.600
 after that all the expenses are located at 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.010
 sides of the walls we say to the borders as 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.090
 if it were a kind in the boys castle 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.519
 think of it as if we are all gods 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.269
 towers that best defend resources 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.609
 internal 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.280
 there are sectors of the sorcerer mortars 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:33.980
 and even to the theses the most the flywheel 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.489
 that defends the air defense down a 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.170
 right 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.299
 the only thing I didn't understand is on 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.310
 made of the town hall that put those 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.260
 murals on the sides but let's leave these 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.410
 they are simply details at last 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.780
 guys we arrived at th 10 then 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.660
 this is also a very based village 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.940
 and I say a lot but a lot on the 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.150
 operation of the flywheel that in fact 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.170
 defends the two air defenses located in 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.730
 lower right 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.019
 I think this village has aspects 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.910
 very negative but also aspects 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.760
 quite negative and I am 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.370
 here also for 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.500
 of the latter as you see in 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.720
 top left of the village are missing 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.610
 air defenses then attacking with the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.760
 dragons from the al would be very easy 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.860
 access to resources is not everything 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.260
 to underestimate guys since it was 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.810
 voted one of the best villages then 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.730
 I personally liked it too 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.620
 I will try even if I still miss two 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.900
 bows so I can't do that right now 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.310
 but I tell you guys that it can yield 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.500
 so much so if you have it 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.970
 try it especially to save a state 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.140
 following this video please provole 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.269
 let me know your opinion 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.359
 and very important yes as if one is me 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.650
 at 10 level 230 and no boys in 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.450
 these days I'm very busy 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.909
 so I will recharge about a million 3 o 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.409
