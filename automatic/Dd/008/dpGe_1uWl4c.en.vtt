some<00:01:28.829> formations<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.610> think<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
some formations that I think are on the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
some formations that I think are on the
up<00:01:30.390> another<00:01:30.780> ones<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.259> are<00:01:31.380> hot<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
up another ones that are hot on the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.910 
up another ones that are hot on the
decline<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.630> first<00:01:33.780> pack<00:01:34.049> sucks<00:01:34.409> there's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
decline so the first pack sucks there's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.429 
decline so the first pack sucks there's
no<00:01:35.189> other<00:01:35.220> way<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> saying<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.509> was<00:01:36.659> it

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
no other way of saying that it was it

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.980 
no other way of saying that it was it
was<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> low-quality<00:01:38.670> pack<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.420> my<00:01:39.659> friends

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
was a low-quality pack and my friends

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.630 
was a low-quality pack and my friends
keep<00:01:40.140> encouraging<00:01:40.470> me<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.040> open<00:01:41.250> packs

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
keep encouraging me to open packs

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.410 
keep encouraging me to open packs
because<00:01:41.820> they're<00:01:42.030> having<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.329> this

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
because they're having all this

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.960 
because they're having all this
incredible<00:01:42.689> luck<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.189> haven't<00:01:44.670> had<00:01:44.939> that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
incredible luck but I haven't had that

that EA made with this new patch is the
finesse<00:02:19.829> shots<00:02:20.099> have<00:02:20.280> been<00:02:20.480> definitely

finesse shots have been definitely

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.589 
finesse shots have been definitely
nerfed<00:02:21.900> out<00:02:22.200> there<00:02:22.950> no<00:02:23.219> new<00:02:23.519> nowhere<00:02:24.060> near<00:02:24.389> as

overpower they kind of balanced him down

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.619

with<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.459> power<00:02:26.639> shot<00:02:26.969> and<00:02:27.150> that's<00:02:27.209> cool<00:02:27.480> with

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
with the power shot and that's cool with

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.899 
with the power shot and that's cool with
me<00:02:27.659> but<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.230> really<00:02:28.709> loved<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.579> finesse

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
me but I really loved the finesse

me but I really loved the finesse
shooting<00:02:30.329> prior<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.200> patch<00:02:31.469> I<00:02:31.769> just

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
shooting prior to this patch I just

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.369 
shooting prior to this patch I just
thought<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.909> was<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.209> much<00:02:33.359> fun<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.959> know<00:02:34.200> it

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
thought it was so much fun I know it

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.920 
thought it was so much fun I know it
wasn't<00:02:34.530> realistic<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.340> know<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.760> was<00:02:35.939> crazy<00:02:36.180> and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
wasn't realistic I know it was crazy and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.250 
wasn't realistic I know it was crazy and
it<00:02:37.290> was<00:02:37.980> not<00:02:38.180> not<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.329> any<00:02:39.599> sort<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.109> game

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
it was not not like any sort of game

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.300 
it was not not like any sort of game
you've<00:02:40.439> ever<00:02:40.499> watched<00:02:40.859> when<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.159> can<00:02:41.280> use

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
you've ever watched when you can use

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.399 
you've ever watched when you can use
40-yard<00:02:41.879> furness<00:02:42.180> shots<00:02:42.450> as<00:02:42.659> you<00:02:42.780> get<00:02:42.930> coke<00:02:43.169> a

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
40-yard furness shots as you get coke a

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.140 
40-yard furness shots as you get coke a
and<00:02:43.680> Phil<00:02:43.919> Jones<00:02:44.480> but<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:46.370> just<00:02:47.370> enjoyed<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.909> and

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
and Phil Jones but I just enjoyed it and

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.789 
and Phil Jones but I just enjoyed it and
I<00:02:48.569> think<00:02:48.810> there's<00:02:48.989> got<00:02:49.199> to<00:02:49.290> be<00:02:49.319> a<00:02:49.409> balance

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
I think there's got to be a balance

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.800 
I think there's got to be a balance
between<00:02:50.129> realism<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.150> having<00:02:51.419> fun<00:02:51.599> playing

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
between realism and having fun playing

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.259 
between realism and having fun playing
fifa<00:02:52.379> and<00:02:52.620> that's<00:02:53.250> something<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:53.639> he<00:02:53.909> has<00:02:54.150> to

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
fifa and that's something that he has to

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.520 
fifa and that's something that he has to
deal<00:02:54.449> with<00:02:54.629> it's<00:02:54.840> kind<00:02:55.049> of<00:02:55.109> a<00:02:55.199> tricky

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
deal with it's kind of a tricky

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.890 
deal with it's kind of a tricky
situation<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:56.129> balance<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.639> two<00:02:56.819> because<00:02:57.689> you

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
situation to balance the two because you

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.619 
situation to balance the two because you
want<00:02:58.109> that<00:02:58.169> arkad<00:02:58.709> feel<00:02:59.069> and<00:02:59.459> then<00:02:59.579> you<00:03:00.419> also

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
want that arkad feel and then you also

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.199 
want that arkad feel and then you also
want<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.199> have<00:03:01.349> that<00:03:01.609> simulation<00:03:02.609> type<00:03:03.030> of

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
want to have that simulation type of

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.580 
want to have that simulation type of
deal<00:03:03.389> by<00:03:03.599> here<00:03:03.780> while<00:03:04.079> you're<00:03:04.230> playing<00:03:04.319> like

you feel like you have full control if

last year than this year i think because
strength<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.519> still<00:03:50.729> relevant<00:03:51.090> but<00:03:51.389> let's<00:03:51.569> get

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
strength is still relevant but let's get

sucked oh another squat douche got a
swag<00:03:56.849> bag<00:03:57.139> but<00:03:58.139> number<00:03:59.069> two<00:03:59.099> is<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.549> they

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
swag bag but number two is that they

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:00.920 
swag bag but number two is that they
change<00:03:59.969> the<00:04:00.090> game<00:04:00.269> speed<00:04:00.509> and<00:04:00.689> this<00:04:00.780> is<00:04:00.900> a

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
change the game speed and this is a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.869 
change the game speed and this is a
really<00:04:01.349> important<00:04:01.889> change<00:04:02.189> because<00:04:02.729> it

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
really important change because it

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.520 
really important change because it
affects<00:04:03.150> other<00:04:03.359> aspects<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.109> game<00:04:04.139> and

affects other aspects of the game and

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.979 
affects other aspects of the game and
the<00:04:05.400> reason<00:04:05.699> that<00:04:05.729> that<00:04:06.299> i'm<00:04:06.509> saying<00:04:06.719> that<00:04:06.900> is

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
the reason that that i'm saying that is

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.659 
the reason that that i'm saying that is
because<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.289> skill<00:04:07.650> move<00:04:07.829> guru's<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.519> guys

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
because the skill move guru's the guys

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.099 
because the skill move guru's the guys
there<00:04:08.939> are<00:04:08.969> scalars<00:04:09.719> they<00:04:09.900> were<00:04:09.989> getting

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
there are scalars they were getting

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.969 
there are scalars they were getting
screwed<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:11.719> pre<00:04:12.719> patch<00:04:12.989> people's

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
screwed and the pre patch people's

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.189 
screwed and the pre patch people's
mateen<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:14.639> was<00:04:14.729> so<00:04:14.909> slow<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.599> tackling<00:04:16.049> you

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
mateen that was so slow the tackling you

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.870 
mateen that was so slow the tackling you
just<00:04:16.380> hold<00:04:16.560> double<00:04:16.949> team<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.669> really

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
just hold double team that really

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.000 
just hold double team that really
weren't<00:04:18.150> any<00:04:18.299> fouls<00:04:18.630> being<00:04:18.870> called<00:04:19.169> it<00:04:19.500> didn't

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
weren't any fouls being called it didn't

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.319 
weren't any fouls being called it didn't
allow<00:04:20.190> for<00:04:20.400> schools<00:04:20.789> they<00:04:20.880> came<00:04:21.029> out<00:04:21.150> very

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
allow for schools they came out very

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.670 
allow for schools they came out very
slow<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:21.989> think<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.409> lot<00:04:22.469> of<00:04:22.620> people

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
slow and I think that a lot of people

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.310 
slow and I think that a lot of people
were<00:04:22.860> stronger

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
were stronger

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.110 
were stronger
link<00:04:23.500> in<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.680> aspect<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:24.610> I'm<00:04:24.670> glad<00:04:24.940> they

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
link in that aspect so I'm glad they

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.000 
link in that aspect so I'm glad they
sped<00:04:25.330> up<00:04:25.420> the<00:04:25.450> game<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:26.410> allows<00:04:26.680> for<00:04:26.710> more

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
sped up the game it allows for more

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.790 
sped up the game it allows for more
chances<00:04:27.430> better<00:04:27.610> counter-attack<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:29.590> can<00:04:29.710> do

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
chances better counter-attack you can do

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.900 
chances better counter-attack you can do
a<00:04:29.830> lot<00:04:29.950> of<00:04:30.010> different<00:04:30.100> things<00:04:30.340> but<00:04:30.730> they're
