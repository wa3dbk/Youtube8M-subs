00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello everyone welcome to the channel 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.170
 3518 550 m with you Kutuzov interesting 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.910
 news a week ago and full boasted 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.759
 that sold over 600 million 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.049
 ios based devices 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.420
 of course with android it doesn't go either 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.400
 what a comparison but for convenience 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.010
 using android also does not go to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.859
 what comparison do i want you 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.689
 tell about the function in is over 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.660
 This function is mainly intended for 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.920
 visually impaired but i 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.920
 I use at all to the destination 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.860
 one of the very convenient options when i 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.860
 have dinner 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.450
 and I don't want to soil my tablet 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.640
 I just want to listen to the news 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.809
 let's take an example of a pair of news 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.850
 how does it work to enable i 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.350
 configured to triple press the home button 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.320
 and when i turn on the voiceover top 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.480
 stop working for ordinary gestures 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.700
 order to move up and down if 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.290
 all of a sudden we need to do this 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.770
 three fingers gesture 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.890
 but to read all the news first 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.150
 you need to set the cursor to the beginning to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.900
 news headline 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.790
 and then hold down with two fingers 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.900
 this way the tablet will read 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.229
 the tablet will read full screen 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.780
 I will have a pause 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.520
 if you need to be distracted by two 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.509
 fingers just touch once 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.189
 the screen and the pause function will turn on. 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.390
 in the same way you can continue 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:54.400
 conditionally speaking 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:58.420
 did not hit the first time yet showing such 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.340
 works on absolutely any site i 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.340
 I turn off so that it is convenient to move 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:10.000
 here by the way it may be interesting that 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.509
 the news will be somewhere in 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.490
 the middle 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:21.270
 and when we turn on the voiceover page 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:27.390
 will be at the top and for this with three fingers 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.390
 very hard gesture what is 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.820
 how do we get to the one we need 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:45.670
 some news and just gesture down we 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:47.380
 we begin to read it function it is possible 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.209
 adjust for example this speed 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.260
 pronouncing text is this 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.160
 basic universal access and 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.160
 directly is over 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.070
 and if you put a high speed then 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:07.480
 will understand nothing from the first but all 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:14.880
 depends on habit and here it will be 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.880
 look like very slow speech wow wow 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:32.459
 settings you yourself hear 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.500
 in order to enable quick activation 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.680
 functions howling comm need to descend into 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.530
 universal access down and select 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.129
 only one point more precisely 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.860
 your item is super that's all 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:52.739
 this way you can read news 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:57.269
 and for example, eat and meal thank you 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:04:00.379
 watched the channel 3518 550 m before the meeting 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.379
 good news for you
