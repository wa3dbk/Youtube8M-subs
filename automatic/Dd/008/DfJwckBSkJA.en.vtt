00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
pretty darn quick and pretty close to

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.950

what<00:03:04.710> this<00:03:04.890> GT<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.490> capable<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.150> doing<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.630> mean

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
what this GT is capable of doing I mean

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.440 
what this GT is capable of doing I mean
I<00:03:07.230> was<00:03:07.650> expecting<00:03:08.340> some<00:03:08.970> much<00:03:09.180> bigger

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
I was expecting some much bigger

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.780 
I was expecting some much bigger
differences<00:03:10.230> between<00:03:10.410> these<00:03:10.770> two<00:03:10.830> cars<00:03:11.340> and

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
differences between these two cars and

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.780 
differences between these two cars and
that<00:03:12.300> does<00:03:12.660> go<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:12.990> show<00:03:13.290> how<00:03:13.590> well<00:03:13.890> Porsche

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
that does go to show how well Porsche

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.690 
that does go to show how well Porsche
developed<00:03:15.450> their<00:03:15.540> first<00:03:15.840> 4-door<00:03:16.410> stand<00:03:16.830> okay

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
developed their first 4-door stand okay

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.300 
developed their first 4-door stand okay
so<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.090> r8<00:03:18.510> GT<00:03:18.930> set<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.470> performance<00:03:20.070> bar

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
so the r8 GT set the performance bar

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.280 
so the r8 GT set the performance bar
pretty<00:03:20.730> high<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:21.480> was<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.630> really<00:03:21.810> quick<00:03:22.020> car
