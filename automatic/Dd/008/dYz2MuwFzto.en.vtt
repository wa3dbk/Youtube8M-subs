do with the eight beers is an eight-week
trial<00:00:37.280> of<00:00:37.670> how<00:00:37.909> the<00:00:37.969> carbonation<00:00:38.690> stays<00:00:38.960> I've

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
trial of how the carbonation stays I've

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.729 
trial of how the carbonation stays I've
traditionally<00:00:40.609> bottled<00:00:41.289> with<00:00:42.289> priming<00:00:42.710> sugar

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
traditionally bottled with priming sugar

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.919 
traditionally bottled with priming sugar
in<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.460> past<00:00:43.699> so<00:00:44.359> I<00:00:44.420> just<00:00:44.539> want<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.719> see<00:00:44.839> how

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
in the past so I just want to see how

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.099 
in the past so I just want to see how
carbonation<00:00:45.530> holds<00:00:45.890> up<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:46.219> how<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:47.109> product

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
carbonation holds up and how the product

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.229 
carbonation holds up and how the product
works<00:00:48.170> out<00:00:48.589> for<00:00:48.829> me<00:00:48.859> so<00:00:49.729> I<00:00:49.760> just<00:00:49.819> want<00:00:50.089> to<00:00:50.149> show

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
works out for me so I just want to show

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.459 
works out for me so I just want to show
you<00:00:50.300> a<00:00:50.359> couple<00:00:50.479> of<00:00:50.629> things<00:00:50.839> here<00:00:51.079> and<00:00:51.260> have<00:00:51.379> it

you a couple of things here and have it
sit<00:00:51.620> here<00:00:51.829> in<00:00:51.889> a<00:00:51.979> thing<00:00:52.909> of<00:00:53.030> sanitizer<00:00:53.510> but<00:00:54.469> as

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
sit here in a thing of sanitizer but as

sit here in a thing of sanitizer but as
you<00:00:54.679> can<00:00:54.829> see<00:00:55.069> you<00:00:55.639> have<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.879> trigger<00:00:56.440> to

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
you can see you have the trigger to

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.169 
you can see you have the trigger to
release<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:57.889> air<00:00:58.010> that's<00:00:58.609> coming<00:00:58.729> out<00:00:59.030> the

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
release the air that's coming out the

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.579 
release the air that's coming out the
end<00:01:00.850> see<00:01:01.850> some<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.210> water<00:01:02.359> deflect<00:01:03.260> off<00:01:03.440> of

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
end see some the water deflect off of

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.180 
end see some the water deflect off of
there<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.150> then<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:05.360> you<00:01:05.720> have<00:01:05.870> your<00:01:06.190> co2

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
your beer feeding in from the end here

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.030 
your beer feeding in from the end here
goes<00:01:12.950> over<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:14.150> my<00:01:14.420> three<00:01:14.990> gallon<00:01:15.350> corny<00:01:15.860> of

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
goes over to my three gallon corny of

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.270 
goes over to my three gallon corny of
the<00:01:16.850> gas<00:01:17.060> then<00:01:17.840> i<00:01:17.960> also<00:01:17.990> have<00:01:18.410> an<00:01:18.560> another<00:01:18.890> gas

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
line that's feeding in to the back of

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.360 
line that's feeding in to the back of

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
want to show you the rate of flow that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.230 
want to show you the rate of flow that
comes<00:01:26.870> out<00:01:27.460> obviously<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.610> want<00:01:28.820> this<00:01:28.940> in<00:01:29.150> the

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
comes out obviously you want this in the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.510 
comes out obviously you want this in the
bottom<00:01:29.510> of<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.660> bottle<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.520> everything's

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
bottom of the bottle and everything's

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.550 
bottom of the bottle and everything's
great<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:32.390> just<00:01:32.540> gives<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:32.810> an<00:01:32.900> idea<00:01:32.990> because

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
great it just gives you an idea because

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.630 
great it just gives you an idea because
once<00:01:33.740> you<00:01:33.800> have<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.040> in<00:01:34.160> there<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:34.400> really

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
once you have it in there you really

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.520 
once you have it in there you really
can't<00:01:34.850> see<00:01:34.910> it<00:01:35.120> after<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.480> time<00:01:35.690> and<00:01:36.290> since

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
can't see it after the time and since

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.860 
can't see it after the time and since
this<00:01:36.740> beer<00:01:37.040> isn't<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.430> best<00:01:37.790> I<00:01:38.090> don't<00:01:38.690> feel

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
this beer isn't the best I don't feel

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.800 
this beer isn't the best I don't feel
bad<00:01:39.080> we<00:01:39.260> seeing<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.680> so<00:01:39.920> we<00:01:40.040> can<00:01:40.220> demonstrate

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
bad we seeing it so we can demonstrate

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.660 
bad we seeing it so we can demonstrate
how<00:01:41.810> it's<00:01:41.990> coming<00:01:42.170> out<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.530> bottom<00:01:42.680> okay

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
how it's coming out of the bottom okay

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.000 
how it's coming out of the bottom okay
so<00:01:44.120> ideally<00:01:44.630> your<00:01:44.990> rubber<00:01:45.260> would<00:01:45.530> be<00:01:45.650> against

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
so ideally your rubber would be against

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.980 
so ideally your rubber would be against
the<00:01:46.070> bottom<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:47.090> can<00:01:47.270> see<00:01:47.480> the<00:01:47.510> spread

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
the bottom and you can see the spread

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.450 
the bottom and you can see the spread
that<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.320> get<00:01:48.560> when<00:01:48.710> I<00:01:48.740> have<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:48.950> push<00:01:49.160> against

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
that you get when I have to push against

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.730 
that you get when I have to push against
it<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.330> it's<00:01:50.480> going<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.630> minimize<00:01:50.990> film<00:01:51.320> at

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
it and it's going to minimize film at

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.500 
it and it's going to minimize film at
very<00:01:52.010> little<00:01:52.250> foaming<00:01:53.200> none<00:01:54.200> at<00:01:54.620> all<00:01:54.920> almost

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
very little foaming none at all almost

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.060 
very little foaming none at all almost
this<00:01:56.510> is<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.720> well<00:01:57.020> carbonated<00:01:57.590> beer<00:01:57.770> as<00:01:57.950> you

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
this is a well carbonated beer as you

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.690 
this is a well carbonated beer as you
can<00:01:58.250> see<00:01:58.460> in<00:01:58.640> my<00:01:58.670> dumb<00:01:59.540> pitcher<00:01:59.900> there<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:00.890> the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
can see in my dumb pitcher there so the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.450 
can see in my dumb pitcher there so the
bottles<00:02:02.060> did<00:02:02.300> really<00:02:02.659> well<00:02:03.159> let's<00:02:04.159> see<00:02:04.310> if<00:02:04.370> we

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
bottles did really well let's see if we

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.700 
bottles did really well let's see if we
can<00:02:04.610> take<00:02:04.730> a<00:02:04.790> look<00:02:05.060> at<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.240> couple<00:02:05.420> of<00:02:05.600> them<00:02:05.780> okay

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
can take a look at a couple of them okay

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.580 
can take a look at a couple of them okay
so<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.190> see<00:02:07.370> a<00:02:07.400> little<00:02:07.610> bit<00:02:07.760> on<00:02:07.880> this<00:02:08.090> one<00:02:08.590> one

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
so you see a little bit on this one one

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.710 
so you see a little bit on this one one
thing<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:09.950> didn't<00:02:10.369> do<00:02:10.550> they<00:02:11.000> recommended<00:02:11.600> that

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
thing I didn't do they recommended that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.840 
thing I didn't do they recommended that
you<00:02:11.900> put<00:02:12.170> your<00:02:12.319> bottles

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
you put your bottles

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.670 
you put your bottles
in<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.850> fridge<00:02:17.090> before<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.630> do<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.780> my

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
in a in the fridge before you do it my

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.890 
in a in the fridge before you do it my
basement<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:19.160> pretty<00:02:19.370> cold<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.540> wasn't

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
basement is pretty cold so I wasn't

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.510 
basement is pretty cold so I wasn't
going<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.200> go<00:02:21.320> that<00:02:21.500> extends<00:02:21.920> for<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.340> first

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
going to go that extends for the first

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.280 
going to go that extends for the first
time<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.030> here's<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.660> average<00:02:23.990> of<00:02:24.110> what<00:02:24.260> I

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
time and here's the average of what I

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.890 
time and here's the average of what I
had<00:02:24.860> off<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.160> most<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.640> bottles<00:02:26.000> just

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
had off the most of the bottles just

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.160 
had off the most of the bottles just
that<00:02:27.080> little<00:02:27.110> tiny<00:02:27.890> bit<00:02:28.250> at<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.790> top<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.480> I'm

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
that little tiny bit at the top and I'm

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.080 
that little tiny bit at the top and I'm
sure<00:02:30.380> as<00:02:30.620> my<00:02:30.770> technique<00:02:31.160> gets<00:02:31.370> better<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.730> can

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
sure as my technique gets better I can

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.140 
sure as my technique gets better I can
eliminate<00:02:32.690> all<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.310> one<00:02:34.310> thing<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:34.700> did<00:02:34.940> do

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
eliminate all that one thing I did do

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.370

green bottle just so you can see what
happens<00:02:39.050> here<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:41.560> probably<00:02:42.560> be<00:02:42.890> better<00:02:45.640> ok

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
happens here and probably be better ok

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.400 
happens here and probably be better ok
so<00:02:46.700> my<00:02:47.090> green<00:02:47.390> bottle<00:02:47.810> here<00:02:48.050> it's<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.260> wall
