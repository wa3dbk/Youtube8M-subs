 the link in the description in xerém 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.880
 video description a podcast I did 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.890
 honoring keys and chapolin citing 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.959
 some episodes that I got my name 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.170
 really remarkable 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.440
 I will not say it's sad people, right? 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.540
 It's sad, it's another that rested and I hope. 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.319
 the side of the side 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.989
 angels rested but what remains is the 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.810
 that he represented here and he 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.040
 is represented right and caring which it is 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.220
 your records 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.620
 The phenomenal work he has done is 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:17.500
 always and is inspired and if he was inspired 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:20.450
 not a character highlight this spirit 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.959
 that inspired that humor has expired is in the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.549
 castelão of the era aside the fat and the lean 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:32.150

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.280

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.100
 they are not that I am desiring death 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.359
 What do you say god loves everyone? 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.760
 but Po 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.829
 It's a shame though that roberto gomes 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.690
 steering wheel was really sick already makes 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.670
 some time and someone who 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.209
 impressed also when I saw was the 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.940
 your belly that edgar vivar quevedo it 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.160
 today is since they say that there was I could 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.630
 see you participating in the 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.150
 mouse such a daughter mouse has a 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.630
 special with roberto carlos bolanos was 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.769
 In Mexico, she interviewed him there and there. 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.720
 his health was really good. 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.670
 until then the health and maybe he 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.530
 was very weak and 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.290
 because for example would be your belly 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.489
 there fat chubby and this is seen slimmed 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.409
 damn right 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:24.110
 I ended up getting thin and Roberto 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:25.880
 roberto bolano if he really does too 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.010
 was also getting sick 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.800
 was old suffering from health problem 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.920
 but as said here the news of the g1 site 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.140
 He did not ask for the cap and I already 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.110
 I want to say here that only when you do not lose 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.180
 the good humor and that is not stopped from 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.890
 to weaken by illness this happened 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.530
 also with bixby bill you can see in 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.870
 video and voice and a share linked charlie 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.190
 in the description of the video bic suffered from 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.620
 prostate cancer 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.390
 but even so he wanted to live did not 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.290
 leaves him not weakened by the 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.620
 disease 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.590
 Felipe these are only examples of the same 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.440
 person who takes life seriously 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.250
 They want to live more and more, right? 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.210
 matter or size no matter what 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.310
 cost right? 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.050
 no matter if there are barriers of series 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.510
 adversities 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.000

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.820
