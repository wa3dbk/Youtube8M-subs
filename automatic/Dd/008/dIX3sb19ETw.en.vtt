they had so so this is pretty much where
I<00:00:44.040> work<00:00:44.390> faculty<00:00:45.390> Department<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.379> Physics<00:00:47.070> is

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
I work faculty Department of Physics is

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.479 
I work faculty Department of Physics is
actually<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.940> side<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:49.100> this<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.250> pretty

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
actually on this side and this is pretty

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.639 
actually on this side and this is pretty
much<00:00:50.550> my<00:00:50.940> environment<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> planets

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
much my environment I have the planets

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.830 
much my environment I have the planets
so<00:00:52.860> astrophysics<00:00:53.550> right<00:00:53.730> there<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.809> have

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
so astrophysics right there and we have

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.930 
so astrophysics right there and we have
the<00:00:55.020> Observatory<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.160> fifth<00:00:56.370> floor<00:00:56.610> where

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the Observatory on the fifth floor where

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.910 
the Observatory on the fifth floor where
we<00:00:57.000> usually<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.510> visit<00:00:57.840> whenever<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.800> have

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
we usually a visit whenever we have

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.439 
we usually a visit whenever we have
solar<00:00:59.129> observing<00:00:59.730> during<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.329> noon<00:01:01.230> time<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
solar observing during a noon time and

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.299 
solar observing during a noon time and
yes<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.229> my<00:01:04.409> work<00:01:04.559> environment<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.159> have

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
yes so it's my work environment I have

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
yes so it's my work environment I have
my<00:01:05.400> professors<00:01:05.909> close<00:01:06.119> by<00:01:06.390> everything<00:01:07.320> else

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
my professors close by everything else

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.950 
my professors close by everything else
is<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.640> perfect<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.150> think<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.750> terms

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
is here so it's perfect I think in terms

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.780 
is here so it's perfect I think in terms
of<00:01:10.110> doing<00:01:10.290> research<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.979> think<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.310> gives<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.760> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
of doing research I think it gives you a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.690 
of doing research I think it gives you a
great<00:01:12.330> opportunity<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.860> course<00:01:14.130> get<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
great opportunity to of course get a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.789 
great opportunity to of course get a
foothold<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.450> what<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.810> want<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.200> me<00:01:16.710> in

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
foothold on what you want for me in

student work-study program and once I
applied<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.110> got<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> funds

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
applied for that I got the funds

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.370 
applied for that I got the funds
successful<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
successful and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.340 
successful and
Here<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:48.650> am<00:01:48.740> doing<00:01:49.070> research<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:49.869> my<00:01:50.869> research

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
Here I am doing research so my research

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.320 
Here I am doing research so my research
in<00:01:51.500> particular<00:01:51.770> it's<00:01:52.189> mainly<00:01:52.400> data

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
in particular it's mainly data

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.899 
in particular it's mainly data
aggregation<00:01:53.920> what<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.159> essence<00:01:55.490> if<00:01:55.580> I<00:01:55.640> were<00:01:55.820> to

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
aggregation what in essence if I were to

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.240 
aggregation what in essence if I were to
put<00:01:56.090> in<00:01:56.270> layman<00:01:56.690> terms<00:01:56.720> it<00:01:57.110> would<00:01:57.170> be<00:01:57.380> taking

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
put in layman terms it would be taking

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.219 
put in layman terms it would be taking
data<00:01:58.369> from<00:01:58.820> international<00:01:59.450> telescopes<00:01:59.960> on

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
data from international telescopes on

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.590 
data from international telescopes on
online<00:02:00.890> archives<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.970> then<00:02:02.149> setting<00:02:02.420> up<00:02:02.540> a

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
online archives and then setting up a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.210 
online archives and then setting up a
database<00:02:02.990> for<00:02:03.409> students<00:02:03.799> here<00:02:03.950> and

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
database for students here and

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.660 
database for students here and
professors<00:02:05.030> who<00:02:05.570> can<00:02:05.750> use<00:02:05.899> it<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.670> yeah

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
professors who can use it and yeah

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.040 
professors who can use it and yeah
that's<00:02:07.909> pretty<00:02:07.970> much<00:02:08.209> my<00:02:08.479> research<00:02:08.869> it's

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
that's pretty much my research it's

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.140 
that's pretty much my research it's
sitting<00:02:09.920> in<00:02:10.009> front<00:02:10.069> of<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.280> computer<00:02:10.429> getting

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
sitting in front of the computer getting

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.940 
sitting in front of the computer getting
that<00:02:11.360> data<00:02:11.569> programming<00:02:12.319> it<00:02:12.440> in<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.800> making

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
that data programming it in and making

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.920 
that data programming it in and making
sure<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:13.489> updated<00:02:13.970> daily<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.450> setting<00:02:14.720> up<00:02:14.840> a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
sure it's updated daily and setting up a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.710 
sure it's updated daily and setting up a
database<00:02:15.200> for<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.590> so<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.489> live<00:02:17.030> on<00:02:17.330> campus

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
database for that so I live on campus

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.229 
database for that so I live on campus
