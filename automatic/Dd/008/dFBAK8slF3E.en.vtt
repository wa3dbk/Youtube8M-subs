ability to roll your ankle I don't
really<00:02:02.969> think<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.359> that<00:02:03.600> supportive<00:02:04.439> it's

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
really think it's that supportive it's

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.379 
really think it's that supportive it's
just<00:02:05.310> supposed<00:02:05.429> to<00:02:05.700> kind<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.060> be<00:02:06.209> like<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
just supposed to kind of be like a

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:08.960 
just supposed to kind of be like a
barefoot<00:02:06.959> shoe<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.649> way<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:08.759> on

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
barefoot shoe in a way but it's like on

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.830 
barefoot shoe in a way but it's like on
on<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.690> heel<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.740> in<00:02:11.250> my<00:02:11.640> opinion<00:02:11.939> it<00:02:12.510> doesn't

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
on a heel so in my opinion it doesn't

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.120 
on a heel so in my opinion it doesn't
support<00:02:13.019> as<00:02:13.439> well

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
support as well

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.910 
support as well
the<00:02:14.280> Fivefinger<00:02:14.640> Vibram<00:02:15.120> shoes<00:02:15.770> so<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
the Fivefinger Vibram shoes so the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.680 
the Fivefinger Vibram shoes so the
second<00:02:17.250> category<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.820> going<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.180> be<00:02:18.270> balance

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
second category is going to be balance

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.720 
second category is going to be balance
and<00:02:18.930> we're<00:02:19.590> gonna<00:02:19.680> talk<00:02:19.980> about<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.310> five

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
rooms first there isn't really much to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.890 
rooms first there isn't really much to
say<00:02:23.460> it's<00:02:24.150> flat

say it's flat
you're<00:02:25.800> on<00:02:25.920> balance<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.370> whole<00:02:26.520> time<00:02:26.760> it's

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
you're on balance the whole time it's

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.970 
you're on balance the whole time it's
just<00:02:27.120> like<00:02:27.240> being<00:02:27.420> barefoot<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.890> know

it's a winner so now we're going to talk

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.080 
it's a winner so now we're going to talk
about<00:02:30.960> balance<00:02:31.350> for<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.590> Nike<00:02:31.740> fries<00:02:32.190> they<00:02:33.030> do

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
about balance for the Nike fries they do

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.430 
about balance for the Nike fries they do
a<00:02:33.210> good<00:02:33.330> job<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.540> keeping<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.960> on<00:02:34.080> balance

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
a good job of keeping you on balance

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.150 
a good job of keeping you on balance
they<00:02:34.800> have<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> nice<00:02:35.190> good<00:02:36.150> sliding<00:02:36.810> scope<00:02:37.200> on

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
they have a nice good sliding scope on

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.520 
they have a nice good sliding scope on
their<00:02:38.400> heel<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:39.030> their<00:02:39.180> toe<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:40.260> does<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.500> really

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
their heel to their toe it does a really

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.950 
their heel to their toe it does a really
good<00:02:40.860> job<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.070> keeping<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:41.670> balance<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.330> don't

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
good job of keeping on balance I don't

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.170 
good job of keeping on balance I don't
think<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.170> does<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.320> good<00:02:43.530> job<00:02:43.710> as<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.790> Vibrams

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
think it does a good job as the Vibrams

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.170 
think it does a good job as the Vibrams
do<00:02:45.360> because<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.960> bottoms<00:02:46.320> are<00:02:46.470> flat<00:02:46.710> footing

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
do because the bottoms are flat footing

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.580 
do because the bottoms are flat footing
but<00:02:48.180> if<00:02:48.300> you're<00:02:48.420> just<00:02:48.540> looking<00:02:48.630> for<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.020> shoe<00:02:49.260> to

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
but if you're just looking for a shoe to

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.410 
but if you're just looking for a shoe to
just<00:02:49.950> go<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.220> gym<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.760> work<00:02:50.850> out<00:02:51.000> do<00:02:51.240> some

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
just go to the gym and work out do some

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.880 
just go to the gym and work out do some
white<00:02:51.600> stuff<00:02:51.780> maybe<00:02:52.230> do<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.500> little<00:02:52.740> bit<00:02:52.860> of

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
white stuff maybe do a little bit of

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.660 
white stuff maybe do a little bit of
bench<00:02:53.100> whatever

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
bench whatever

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.880 
bench whatever
I<00:02:53.700> think<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.420> Nike<00:02:54.690> fries<00:02:54.900> are<00:02:55.050> pretty<00:02:55.770> good

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
I think the Nike fries are pretty good

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.420 
I think the Nike fries are pretty good
bet<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.400> onto<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.760> third<00:02:57.030> category<00:02:57.410> longevity

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
bet so onto the third category longevity

we're talking about the Vibrams first
the<00:03:01.680> five<00:03:01.890> rooms<00:03:02.130> I've<00:03:02.490> been<00:03:02.760> weighing<00:03:03.000> this

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
the five rooms I've been weighing this

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.260 
the five rooms I've been weighing this
exact<00:03:03.780> same<00:03:04.020> pair<00:03:04.350> for<00:03:05.070> over<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> year<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.210> a

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
exact same pair for over a year and a

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.430 
exact same pair for over a year and a
half<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.040> they<00:03:08.040> have<00:03:08.250> not<00:03:08.400> ripped<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.440> they

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
half and they have not ripped and they

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.890 
half and they have not ripped and they

the<00:03:13.830> only<00:03:13.980> problem<00:03:14.370> may<00:03:14.520> be<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.670> little<00:03:14.880> bit

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
the only problem may be a little bit

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.600 
the only problem may be a little bit
sometimes<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.810> cleaning<00:03:16.110> them<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.590> might<00:03:17.250> scrub

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
sometimes is cleaning them I might scrub

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.550 
sometimes is cleaning them I might scrub
them<00:03:17.760> out<00:03:17.910> with<00:03:18.120> like<00:03:18.270> a<00:03:18.300> scotch-brite<00:03:18.990> you

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
them out with like a scotch-brite you

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.200 
them out with like a scotch-brite you

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
the dirt out on the inside but other

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.110 
the dirt out on the inside but other
than<00:03:23.070> that<00:03:23.160> I'm<00:03:23.340> just<00:03:23.370> throwing<00:03:23.670> in<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:23.940> wash

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
than that I'm just throwing in the wash

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.450 
than that I'm just throwing in the wash
and<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.450> let<00:03:24.600> them<00:03:24.690> air<00:03:24.870> dry<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.460> they've

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
and I let them air dry and they've

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.770 
and I let them air dry and they've
worked<00:03:26.670> fine<00:03:26.970> for<00:03:27.000> over<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.450> year<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.690> half

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
worked fine for over a year and a half

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.930 
worked fine for over a year and a half
now<00:03:28.080> on<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.620> longevity<00:03:29.130> for<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.370> Nike<00:03:29.520> freeze

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
now on to longevity for the Nike freeze

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.940 
now on to longevity for the Nike freeze
I've<00:03:30.510> also<00:03:30.750> had<00:03:31.050> these<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> really<00:03:31.800> long

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
I've also had these for a really long

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.060 
I've also had these for a really long
time<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:33.200> think<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.320> they're<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> great<00:03:34.650> shoe

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
time I think that they're a great shoe

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.340 
time I think that they're a great shoe
they<00:03:35.670> have<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:35.910> little<00:03:36.120> bit<00:03:36.300> of<00:03:36.360> Tears<00:03:36.750> here<00:03:36.960> and

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
they have a little bit of Tears here and

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.430 
they have a little bit of Tears here and
there<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.710> the<00:03:37.800> scuffs<00:03:38.190> on<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.520> front<00:03:39.440> but

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
there and the scuffs on the front but

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.900 
there and the scuffs on the front but
other<00:03:40.590> than<00:03:40.830> that<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.310> think<00:03:41.370> they<00:03:41.700> hold

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
other than that I think they hold

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.730 
other than that I think they hold
together<00:03:42.060> pretty<00:03:42.540> well<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.680> would

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
together pretty well and I would

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.350 
together pretty well and I would
definitely<00:03:44.160> recommend<00:03:44.610> this<00:03:44.970> shoot<00:03:45.209> at

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
definitely recommend this shoot at

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.230 
definitely recommend this shoot at
people<00:03:45.630> who<00:03:45.810> don't<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.500> Vibrams<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:48.030> in

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
people who don't like Vibrams so in

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.699 
people who don't like Vibrams so in
conclusion<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.780> think<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.200> Vibrams<00:03:49.590> were

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
conclusion I think that the Vibrams were

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.620 
conclusion I think that the Vibrams were
better<00:03:50.010> shewed<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.850> Nike<00:03:51.000> freeze<00:03:51.420> at

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
better shewed in the Nike freeze at

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.150 
better shewed in the Nike freeze at
least<00:03:51.780> for<00:03:51.990> me<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.680> work<00:03:53.340> out<00:03:53.580> in<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:55.260> Vipers

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
least for me I work out in the Vipers

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.640 
least for me I work out in the Vipers
because<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:57.000> feel<00:03:57.540> like<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.780> flatfoot<00:03:58.260> helps

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
because I feel like the flatfoot helps

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.940 
because I feel like the flatfoot helps
me<00:03:58.940> bench<00:03:59.940> better<00:04:00.240> it<00:04:00.870> helps<00:04:01.110> me<00:04:01.230> deadlift

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
me bench better it helps me deadlift

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.390 
me bench better it helps me deadlift
it<00:04:02.070> helps<00:04:02.430> me<00:04:02.610> squat<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.720> can't<00:04:04.470> squat<00:04:05.100> or

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
it helps me squat I can't squat or

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.180 
it helps me squat I can't squat or
deadlift<00:04:06.000> with<00:04:06.510> with<00:04:07.110> basketball<00:04:07.590> shoes<00:04:07.860> or

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
deadlift with with basketball shoes or

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.490 
deadlift with with basketball shoes or
with<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.820> Nike<00:04:09.120> freeze<00:04:09.330> anymore<00:04:09.750> because<00:04:10.380> I'm

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
with the Nike freeze anymore because I'm

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.410 
with the Nike freeze anymore because I'm
so<00:04:10.770> used<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.160> being<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:11.610> flat<00:04:11.910> on<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.180> ground

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
so used to being so flat on the ground

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.510 
so used to being so flat on the ground
then<00:04:13.020> even<00:04:13.320> if<00:04:13.410> I<00:04:13.470> don't<00:04:13.530> have<00:04:13.860> my<00:04:13.980> vitamins<00:04:14.370> at

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
then even if I don't have my vitamins at

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.250 
then even if I don't have my vitamins at
the<00:04:14.610> gym<00:04:14.880> I<00:04:15.060> will<00:04:15.240> take<00:04:15.420> my<00:04:15.570> shoes<00:04:15.780> off<00:04:15.959> and

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
the gym I will take my shoes off and

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.060 
the gym I will take my shoes off and
deadlift<00:04:17.040> or<00:04:17.250> squat<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.299> sucks<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:19.620> once<00:04:19.980> you

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
deadlift or squat and sucks so once you

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.770 
deadlift or squat and sucks so once you
get<00:04:20.190> used<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.520> the<00:04:20.640> Vibrams<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.420> takes<00:04:21.690> a

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
get used to the Vibrams it takes a

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.330 
get used to the Vibrams it takes a
little<00:04:21.900> bit<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.140> learning<00:04:22.500> curve<00:04:22.710> but<00:04:23.160> you

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
little bit of learning curve but you

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.960 
little bit of learning curve but you
will<00:04:23.520> not<00:04:23.750> squat<00:04:24.750> or<00:04:24.930> deadlift<00:04:25.350> in<00:04:25.560> any

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
will not squat or deadlift in any

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.690 
will not squat or deadlift in any
but<00:04:26.210> Vibrams<00:04:26.660> from<00:04:26.870> now<00:04:27.020> on<00:04:27.230> I<00:04:27.890> think<00:04:28.370> the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
but Vibrams from now on I think the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.130 
but Vibrams from now on I think the
vibrance<00:04:29.090> beat<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.420> Nike<00:04:29.690> freeze-out<00:04:29.990> in

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
vibrance beat the Nike freeze-out in

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.430 
vibrance beat the Nike freeze-out in
every<00:04:30.350> category<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:32.330> is<00:04:32.540> definitely<00:04:32.960> my

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
every category and that is definitely my

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.320 
every category and that is definitely my
