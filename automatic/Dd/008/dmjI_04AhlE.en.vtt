00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:09.020
 so dear friends live on beatles tv and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:14.390
 we are reviewing the boss from bosh 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:18.600
 tee model w key 86,103 rq 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:21.630
 black this kettle was ordered 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.510
 on ozon.ru and here he finally came 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.510
 what do we open and see something inside 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:42.739
 as you can see everything is well packed we shoot 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.739
 protective 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:00.120
 and so here is the kettle itself 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:16.899
 further packed there 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:19.799
 his base is like that 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:24.909
 little teapots means a kettle 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:29.409
 ease and a half liters power 2400 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.890
 black watt material combination 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.360
 plastic and metal 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.369
 the most important thing that seems to be in this 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.549
 kettle this function thermopotov 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.890
 as you can see here the buttons plus or minus can 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.520
 adjust the temperature from 70 to 100 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.619
 degrees 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.569
 This kettle supports this 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.409
 temperature within 30 minutes after 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:53.229
 boiling is not very much but in principle 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.689
 as if pretty well considering 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.869
 what is it just a kettle what else does it mean 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.100
 scales 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.380
 As you can see the divisions here are visible with what 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.789
 would n't the sides have grabbed that is 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:13.239
 wide enough school opens 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.950
 kettle by pressing the button on top as you can see 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.440
 here is the only way out b consider 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.940
 a serious minus is that the cap is not 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.180
 opens completely but this is due to 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.310
 so that the thermo care function buttons 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.530
 also located on the top panel 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.819
 therefore, it will not fully open at 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.650
 whom low crane low located on 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.040
 it will be well, a little bit will probably 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.409
 inconvenient means standard here 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.939
 filter 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.999
 Well, in general, that's what else you need 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:46.469
 Mark the kettle is made with double 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:49.920
 walls which also significantly helps 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:53.639
 he keeps the water warm 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:58.010
 for a long time now 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.010
 so now we will try to boil it 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.200
 so the kettle is connected to the mains 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:10.810
 he has plenty of water 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.970
 about 1 and 3 liters here means we include 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.670
 see how fast he boils water 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.190
 and how noisy 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.740
 press the power button select 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:31.090
 we are interested in temperature 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:33.360
 let's say 90 degrees let that remain 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.130
 you started to boil the kettle 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.240
 It works enough like the main 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.240
 currency kettles 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:59.930
 and so it took a little more than a minute 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.930
 ball against 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.340
 What more can be said 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.030
 and dogs 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.750
 the main advantage of it is in the way 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.489
 thermopot function of this 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.489
 the cold way is there any 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.660
 household appliances or black 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:28.300
 give 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.300
 Generally if someone 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.300
 and 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.560
 that is, modernity 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.560
 see a fist boss 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.570
 went from the moment it 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.570
 turning on 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.610
 and so exactly three minutes
