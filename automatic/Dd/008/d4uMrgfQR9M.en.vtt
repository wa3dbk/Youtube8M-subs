Booker where they would pretty much say
if<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.040> was<00:00:35.160> up<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.340> them<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.969> how<00:00:36.090> they

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
if it was up to them this is how they

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.910 
if it was up to them this is how they

don't want to see Shawn Michaels come
back<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.480> think<00:00:39.860> just<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.010> Ric<00:00:41.190> Flair<00:00:41.460> his

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
back I think just like Ric Flair his

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.490 
back I think just like Ric Flair his
career<00:00:42.120> should<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:42.480> ended<00:00:42.629> at<00:00:42.870> WrestleMania

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
career should have ended at WrestleMania

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.670 
career should have ended at WrestleMania
where<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.219> attended<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.789> end<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:46.379> look<00:00:46.530> at

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
where it was attended to end you look at

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
where it was attended to end you look at
Ric<00:00:46.829> Flair<00:00:47.100> his<00:00:47.700> career<00:00:48.030> ended<00:00:48.390> he<00:00:48.480> had<00:00:48.570> his

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
Ric Flair his career ended he had his

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.400 
Ric Flair his career ended he had his
big<00:00:48.899> old<00:00:49.079> stand<00:00:49.379> off<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.890> he<00:00:50.820> went<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> TNA<00:00:51.539> now

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
big old stand off and he went to TNA now

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.590 
big old stand off and he went to TNA now
I<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:53.250> everyone<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.940> agree<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.239> after

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
I think everyone can agree that after

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.470 
I think everyone can agree that after
TNA<00:00:55.140> things<00:00:55.680> went<00:00:55.920> downhill<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.550> him<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.090> I'm

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
TNA things went downhill for him and I'm

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.119 
TNA things went downhill for him and I'm
not<00:00:57.629> saying<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:57.989> Shawn<00:00:58.289> Michaels<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.829> going

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
not saying that Shawn Michaels is going

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.010 
not saying that Shawn Michaels is going
to<00:00:59.309> some<00:00:59.520> second-rate<00:00:59.940> company<00:01:00.449> he's<00:01:00.719> staying

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
to some second-rate company he's staying

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.490 
to some second-rate company he's staying
with<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> WWE<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.820> fact<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.290> he<00:01:04.290> had

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
with the WWE but the fact that he had

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500 
with the WWE but the fact that he had
his<00:01:04.650> whole<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.189> whole<00:01:05.339> story<00:01:05.700> building<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.360> to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
his whole the whole story building up to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.210 
his whole the whole story building up to
it<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.689> think<00:01:06.900> started<00:01:07.170> at<00:01:07.260> WrestleMania<00:01:07.770> 25

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
it I think started at WrestleMania 25

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.560 
it I think started at WrestleMania 25
where<00:01:08.610> him<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.820> taker<00:01:09.119> had<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.689> classic<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
where him and taker had that classic and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.330 
where him and taker had that classic and
Shawn<00:01:12.570> was<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:12.930> close<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.619> was<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:14.010> such

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
Shawn was so close and it was like such

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.630 
Shawn was so close and it was like such
a<00:01:14.369> historic<00:01:15.000> match<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.830> after<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.979> he<00:01:17.430> kind

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640

Performance<00:05:04.030> Center<00:05:04.360> but<00:05:04.540> it's<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.500> big

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
Performance Center but it's a big

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.560 
Performance Center but it's a big
difference<00:05:06.070> between<00:05:06.130> that<00:05:06.310> and<00:05:06.460> being<00:05:06.940> in

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
difference between that and being in

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.830 
difference between that and being in
front<00:05:07.780> of<00:05:07.870> 80,000<00:05:08.350> people<00:05:08.670> so<00:05:09.670> I<00:05:09.910> don't<00:05:10.660> know

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
front of 80,000 people so I don't know

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.750 
front of 80,000 people so I don't know
Shawn's<00:05:11.170> great<00:05:11.440> best<00:05:11.710> wrestler<00:05:12.250> I<00:05:12.280> would<00:05:12.580> say

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
Shawn's great best wrestler I would say

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.870 
Shawn's great best wrestler I would say
of<00:05:12.910> all<00:05:13.030> time<00:05:13.560> but<00:05:14.560> when<00:05:14.860> it<00:05:14.980> comes<00:05:15.190> down<00:05:15.430> to<00:05:15.490> it

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
of all time but when it comes down to it

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.050 
of all time but when it comes down to it
just<00:05:16.120> keep<00:05:16.390> him<00:05:16.690> on<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:16.990> side<00:05:17.950> have<00:05:18.460> Triple<00:05:18.940> H

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
just keep him on the side have Triple H

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.670 
just keep him on the side have Triple H
versus<00:05:19.360> Daniel<00:05:19.540> Bryan<00:05:19.900> because<00:05:20.200> I<00:05:20.230> think<00:05:20.350> that

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
versus Daniel Bryan because I think that

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.140 
versus Daniel Bryan because I think that
match<00:05:20.890> would<00:05:21.160> make<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:21.340> lot<00:05:21.580> more<00:05:21.760> sense<00:05:21.820> than

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
match would make a lot more sense than

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.270 
match would make a lot more sense than
having<00:05:22.510> a<00:05:22.570> Shawn<00:05:22.780> Michaels<00:05:23.170> return<00:05:23.530> because

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
having a Shawn Michaels return because

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.160 
having a Shawn Michaels return because
this<00:05:24.820> whole<00:05:25.030> thing's<00:05:25.330> been<00:05:25.420> building<00:05:25.900> up<00:05:26.020> and

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
this whole thing's been building up and

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.080 
this whole thing's been building up and
building<00:05:26.200> up<00:05:26.530> to<00:05:26.770> an<00:05:27.040> obvious<00:05:27.220> Daniel<00:05:27.850> Bryan

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
building up to an obvious Daniel Bryan

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.330 
building up to an obvious Daniel Bryan
versus<00:05:28.330> Triple<00:05:28.570> H<00:05:28.690> match<00:05:28.980> but<00:05:29.980> I<00:05:30.010> don't<00:05:30.190> think

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
versus Triple H match but I don't think

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.940 
versus Triple H match but I don't think
she<00:05:30.430> I<00:05:30.460> should<00:05:30.640> get<00:05:30.760> involved<00:05:30.940> he<00:05:31.510> should<00:05:31.950> do

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
she I should get involved he should do

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.300 
she I should get involved he should do
what<00:05:33.100> he's<00:05:33.190> gonna<00:05:33.310> do<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:33.850> Hell<00:05:34.090> in<00:05:34.210> a<00:05:34.300> Cell<00:05:34.480> and

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
what he's gonna do a Hell in a Cell and

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.650

that's it he's only there to be a

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.360 
that's it he's only there to be a
referee<00:05:38.110> he<00:05:38.290> shouldn't<00:05:38.590> have<00:05:38.620> any<00:05:38.890> other<00:05:39.100> role

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
referee he shouldn't have any other role

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.700 
referee he shouldn't have any other role
in<00:05:39.550> it<00:05:39.700> let<00:05:40.300> Triple<00:05:40.600> H<00:05:40.690> go<00:05:40.900> on<00:05:40.990> his<00:05:41.110> power<00:05:41.320> trip
