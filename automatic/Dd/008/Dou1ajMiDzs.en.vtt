that camera viewfinder I'm gonna do a

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.970 
that camera viewfinder I'm gonna do a
combination<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.930> looking<00:03:55.260> at<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.470> viewfinder

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980

and my mirror here so I have three
things<00:03:58.860> it's<00:03:59.520> a<00:03:59.640> combination<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.480> making<00:04:00.960> a

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
things it's a combination of making a

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.800

very<00:04:01.230> loose<00:04:01.710> braid<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.550> a<00:04:03.210> somewhat<00:04:03.540> tight

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
very loose braid and a somewhat tight

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.840

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
braids I keep my arms relaxed I think

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.940 
braids I keep my arms relaxed I think
that's<00:04:06.000> really<00:04:06.270> important<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.590> just<00:04:07.770> start

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
that's really important and I just start

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.700 
that's really important and I just start
grabbing<00:04:08.070> hair<00:04:08.550> up<00:04:08.670> front<00:04:09.000> like<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.650> this<00:04:10.650> is

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
grabbing hair up front like this this is

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.860 
grabbing hair up front like this this is
more<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.040> my<00:04:11.130> bangs<00:04:11.460> and<00:04:11.700> putting<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.420> I'm

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.020 
more of my bangs and putting in and I'm
keeping<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.410> off<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.830> side<00:04:13.950> up<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.880> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
keeping it off to the side up to the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.590 
keeping it off to the side up to the
left<00:04:15.270> side<00:04:15.690> or<00:04:15.720> this<00:04:16.410> is<00:04:16.590> my<00:04:16.709> left<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.340> way<00:04:17.600> it

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
left side or this is my left the way it

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.449 
left side or this is my left the way it
is<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.900> reality<00:04:19.049> but<00:04:19.440> it's<00:04:19.560> reversed<00:04:19.890> probably

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
is in reality but it's reversed probably

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.290 
is in reality but it's reversed probably
when<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.640> see<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.260> I'm<00:04:22.260> not<00:04:22.560> worrying<00:04:22.950> about

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
when you see it I'm not worrying about

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.870 
when you see it I'm not worrying about
how<00:04:24.530> smooth<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.710> is<00:04:25.740> i<00:04:26.100> just<00:04:26.130> kind<00:04:26.580> of<00:04:26.669> like

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
how smooth it is i just kind of like

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.490 
how smooth it is i just kind of like
naturally<00:04:27.450> pull<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.840> in<00:04:27.960> as<00:04:28.080> long<00:04:28.110> as<00:04:28.380> you've

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
naturally pull it in as long as you've

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.770 
naturally pull it in as long as you've
combed<00:04:28.800> your<00:04:29.010> hair<00:04:29.070> before<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:30.600> don't

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
combed your hair before and you don't

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.360 
combed your hair before and you don't
have<00:04:30.900> like<00:04:31.169> rough<00:04:31.440> tangles<00:04:32.040> sort<00:04:32.280> of

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
have like rough tangles sort of

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.670 
have like rough tangles sort of
interrupting<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.630> way<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:33.840> grab<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.440> hair

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
interrupting the way you grab the hair

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.920 
interrupting the way you grab the hair
it<00:04:34.890> should<00:04:35.220> be<00:04:35.310> really<00:04:35.610> easy<00:04:35.640> it's<00:04:36.210> easiest<00:04:36.630> if

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
it should be really easy it's easiest if

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.010 
it should be really easy it's easiest if
you<00:04:37.080> just<00:04:37.350> try<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:37.710> add<00:04:38.160> to<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.090> hair<00:04:39.360> equal

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
you just try and add to the hair equal

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.840 
you just try and add to the hair equal
amounts<00:04:40.560> on<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.800> left<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.190> right<00:04:41.250> side<00:04:41.610> so

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
amounts on the left and right side so

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.310 
amounts on the left and right side so
whenever<00:04:42.120> you're<00:04:42.270> adding<00:04:42.750> hair<00:04:42.990> like<00:04:43.169> I'm

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
whenever you're adding hair like I'm

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.260 
whenever you're adding hair like I'm
pulling<00:04:44.100> right<00:04:44.400> here<00:04:44.640> i'm<00:04:44.730> not<00:04:44.850> gonna<00:04:44.970> take<00:04:45.210> a

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
pulling right here i'm not gonna take a

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.909 
pulling right here i'm not gonna take a
huge<00:04:45.600> clump<00:04:45.960> because<00:04:46.320> then<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.560> may<00:04:46.710> get<00:04:46.890> a

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
huge clump because then it may get a

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.820 
huge clump because then it may get a
little<00:04:47.010> off-kilter<00:04:48.110> so<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.410> just<00:04:49.590> go<00:04:49.800> like

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
little off-kilter so you just go like

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.020 
little off-kilter so you just go like
this<00:04:50.220> keep<00:04:51.000> adding<00:04:51.390> a<00:04:51.479> bit

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.270 

now<00:04:56.020> I'm<00:04:56.170> just<00:04:56.290> sort<00:04:56.500> of<00:04:56.530> adding<00:04:56.860> I<00:04:56.980> should<00:04:57.160> the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
now I'm just sort of adding I should the

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.670 
now I'm just sort of adding I should the
top<00:04:57.460> of<00:04:57.670> my<00:04:57.790> head<00:04:58.000> I'm<00:04:58.810> adding<00:04:59.290> up<00:04:59.440> here

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
top of my head I'm adding up here

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.670 
top of my head I'm adding up here
already<00:04:59.980> I<00:05:00.540> still<00:05:01.540> have<00:05:01.720> a<00:05:01.750> lot<00:05:01.990> of<00:05:02.020> hair<00:05:02.320> on<00:05:02.560> my

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
already I still have a lot of hair on my

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:11.999 
already I still have a lot of hair on my
left<00:05:02.920> side<00:05:03.840> over<00:05:04.840> here<00:05:04.990> to<00:05:05.140> keep<00:05:05.290> adding

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.249 

I<00:05:12.129> think<00:05:12.849> if<00:05:12.939> you<00:05:13.029> just<00:05:13.059> smooth<00:05:13.539> it<00:05:13.719> out<00:05:13.869> while

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
I think if you just smooth it out while

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.019 
I think if you just smooth it out while
you're<00:05:14.409> putting<00:05:14.770> it<00:05:15.009> in<00:05:15.159> you<00:05:15.580> get<00:05:15.759> a<00:05:15.789> much

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:16.029 
you're putting it in you get a much

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.149 
you're putting it in you get a much
better<00:05:16.089> braid<00:05:16.659> a<00:05:16.990> lot<00:05:17.559> of<00:05:17.589> people<00:05:17.710> don't<00:05:18.069> like

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
better braid a lot of people don't like

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:39.760 
better braid a lot of people don't like
bumps<00:05:18.759> and<00:05:18.999> little<00:05:19.749> things<00:05:19.779> like

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.529 

I've<00:05:40.280> reached<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:40.849> point<00:05:41.060> now<00:05:41.300> where<00:05:41.330> I'm

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
I've reached the point now where I'm

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.390 
I've reached the point now where I'm
going<00:05:41.690> to<00:05:41.780> start<00:05:42.050> turning<00:05:42.379> the<00:05:42.620> braid<00:05:42.979> I<00:05:43.009> do<00:05:43.250> a

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
going to start turning the braid I do a

00:05:43.400 --> 00:06:10.920 
going to start turning the braid I do a
little<00:05:43.669> turn<00:05:44.210> around<00:05:44.690> this<00:05:44.810> point

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.360 

now<00:06:11.930> is<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.170> point<00:06:12.410> where<00:06:12.560> all<00:06:12.890> the<00:06:13.070> French

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
now is the point where all the French

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.010 
now is the point where all the French
braiding<00:06:13.700> is<00:06:13.910> done<00:06:14.210> and<00:06:14.450> we<00:06:14.510> are<00:06:14.720> just<00:06:14.870> going

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
braiding is done and we are just going

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.330 
braiding is done and we are just going
to<00:06:15.440> kind<00:06:15.650> of<00:06:15.730> so<00:06:16.730> this<00:06:16.910> is<00:06:17.000> a<00:06:17.090> slight<00:06:17.360> bit<00:06:18.340> get

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
to kind of so this is a slight bit get

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.070 
to kind of so this is a slight bit get
elusive<00:06:19.850> braid<00:06:20.090> and<00:06:20.390> now<00:06:20.480> i'm<00:06:20.600> just<00:06:20.720> doing<00:06:20.990> a

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
elusive braid and now i'm just doing a

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:35.279 
elusive braid and now i'm just doing a
normal<00:06:21.260> braid<00:06:21.710> that<00:06:21.980> runs<00:06:22.670> down<00:06:22.940> the<00:06:23.120> side

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.329 

I<00:06:35.409> just<00:06:36.129> take<00:06:36.369> it<00:06:36.520> almost<00:06:36.759> all<00:06:36.999> the<00:06:37.119> way<00:06:37.240> down

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:38.339 
I just take it almost all the way down

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:42.420 
I just take it almost all the way down
not<00:06:39.339> much<00:06:39.520> hair<00:06:39.759> left<00:06:39.789> I<00:06:40.800> like<00:06:41.800> these<00:06:41.979> clear

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
not much hair left I like these clear

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.939 
not much hair left I like these clear
elastic<00:06:43.089> hair<00:06:43.300> ties<00:06:43.509> they<00:06:44.379> work<00:06:44.559> really<00:06:44.800> well

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949 
elastic hair ties they work really well

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:47.700 
elastic hair ties they work really well
when<00:06:45.789> you<00:06:45.909> have<00:06:46.089> a<00:06:46.389> really<00:06:46.960> small<00:06:47.379> piece<00:06:47.680> of

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
when you have a really small piece of

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.790 
when you have a really small piece of
hair<00:06:48.129> that<00:06:48.689> you're<00:06:49.689> trying<00:06:49.960> to<00:06:50.139> fasten<00:06:50.649> I

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
hair that you're trying to fasten I

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.219 
hair that you're trying to fasten I
think<00:06:51.039> a<00:06:51.129> big<00:06:51.309> chunky<00:06:51.789> black<00:06:52.210> rubber<00:06:52.569> band<00:06:52.869> or

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:53.229 
think a big chunky black rubber band or

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:54.179 
think a big chunky black rubber band or
something<00:06:53.349> thicker<00:06:53.770> it<00:06:53.919> would<00:06:54.009> really

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:54.189 
something thicker it would really

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:56.879 
something thicker it would really
interfere<00:06:54.879> with<00:06:55.089> the<00:06:55.749> style<00:06:56.050> I<00:06:56.289> have<00:06:56.439> going<00:06:56.740> on

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:56.889 
interfere with the style I have going on

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:59.939 
interfere with the style I have going on
so<00:06:57.339> you<00:06:57.669> can<00:06:57.879> see<00:06:58.149> how<00:06:58.180> it<00:06:58.719> goes<00:06:59.379> i'll<00:06:59.649> try<00:06:59.860> and

00:06:59.939 --> 00:06:59.949 
so you can see how it goes i'll try and

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:05.579 
so you can see how it goes i'll try and
rotate<00:07:00.309> around<00:07:00.460> in<00:07:00.789> my<00:07:00.909> chair<00:07:01.830> like<00:07:02.830> this<00:07:04.589> and

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:05.589 
rotate around in my chair like this and

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:07.999 
rotate around in my chair like this and
it's<00:07:05.889> just<00:07:06.069> sort<00:07:06.249> of<00:07:06.309> a<00:07:06.430> nice<00:07:06.610> waterfall<00:07:07.240> braid

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:08.009 
it's just sort of a nice waterfall braid

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:12.329 
it's just sort of a nice waterfall braid
