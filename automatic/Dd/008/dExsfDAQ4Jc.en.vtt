 we are at mwc 2014 on the lg stand and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.459
 I have in front of me the lg she 90 who is 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.710
 the most upmost device of the 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.720
 new range wing series 3 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.390
 so as a reminder there is the 40 they ol 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.700
 70 yaÃ«l 80 we will not have in France and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.280
 there is the she 90 that will be proposed in 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.010
 April in France at 179 euros 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.150
 it's a device that is 3G despite the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.610
 actually they're basically from the range on 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.649
 is not sure of the f series or the top of 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.600
 range and side spec 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.100
 so what do we have a screen 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.710
 4.7 inches seduces ps 960 by 540 we have a 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.420
 quad core processor 1.2 gigahertz a 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.039
 battery of 2500 40 min in pernes 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.440
 8 megapixel camera at the back 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.170
 5 megapixel in the front what can be 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.969
 nice tone below kit kat is it at this 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.069
 system as low as all the wings 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.719
 series knock knock code 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.789
 that's the way to unlock 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.280
 doing some kind of code a kind of 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.920
 figure a shape on the screen by typing 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.979
 it's pretty cool 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.259
 design still very classic but to 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.189
 its ends pretty enough worked out it's 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.140
 true that when we take it in hand like 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.969
 it does not feel like it's a 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.409
 mid-range device this is it 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:21.689
 rather pleasant we will say up there 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.119
 front camera sensors buttons 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.909
 classic back menu home button 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.520
 on / off lock unlock jack and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.969
 secondary microphone and a port offers a 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.740
 red apparently for wiimote this volume 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:38.170
 camera with flash 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.220
 microphone jack 3.5 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.900
 sorry speakers I bugged there 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.360
 on there we have a little design a little 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:50.380
 especially see with a small form 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.640
 Bush is nice ok side interface 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.140
 great classics and there it looks 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.930
 still not bad at what we have on a 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:03.340
 g2 or a g 2 min we'll say because the 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.340
 screen size is closer 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.319
 Main Menu 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:14.480
 music I'm just watching if there are any 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.730
 interesting stuff the calendar by 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.549
 example here is with a system of 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.420
 fine distribution of two columns finally 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.610
 guen get our columns the multitasking that 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.190
 looks like that the notifications well 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.799
 sure of it's classic way here 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.110
 we also have ku sly quick memo 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.860
 so the q that's displayed here after 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.750
 it makes small applications 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.160
 floating that appears on the screen so 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.220
 there for example with a video why 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.640
 no phone sorry that we already have 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.739
 watched his hits ex now that the screen 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.480
 4.7 inches a year portrait you when 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.130
 even you can type 1 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.109
 no problem in landscape it gives that 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:02.900
 the screen looks pretty good that's the 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:04.609
 ass hd for 4.7 inch give up without it 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.739
 seems to me not so badly played it's a 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.359
 device that seems to me quite 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.859
 quite interesting everything depends 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:14.060
 how it will be put forward for recall 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:15.290
 April 179 euros naked in France 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.859
 I hope this little video has you 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.859
 see you soon
