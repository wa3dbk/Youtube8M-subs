just to at the beginning where your
wrist<00:01:57.509> rest<00:01:57.719> would<00:01:57.840> release<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.920> can

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
wrist rest would release it so you can

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.940 
wrist rest would release it so you can
do<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.250> low<00:01:59.490> sensitivity<00:01:59.909> gaming<00:02:00.659> why<00:02:01.380> why

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
do the low sensitivity gaming why why

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.100 
do the low sensitivity gaming why why
you<00:02:02.009> move<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:02.430> over<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.939> still<00:02:03.659> rest<00:02:03.930> your

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
you move all over and still rest your

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.649 
you move all over and still rest your
hand<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.820> feel<00:02:05.820> good<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.180> comfortable<00:02:06.299> with

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
hand and feel good and comfortable with

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.960 
hand and feel good and comfortable with
it<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.649> other<00:02:07.770> benefit<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:08.670> it's<00:02:08.819> so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
it the other benefit is because it's so

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.240 
it the other benefit is because it's so
thick<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.629> going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.020> wrinkle<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.649> any

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
thick it's not going to wrinkle in any

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.559 
thick it's not going to wrinkle in any
way<00:02:11.459> or<00:02:11.610> form<00:02:11.640> and

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
way or form and

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.959 
way or form and
it's<00:02:12.719> not<00:02:13.499> going<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.829> you<00:02:14.040> know<00:02:14.159> move<00:02:14.730> around

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:14.969 
it's not going to you know move around

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.940 
it's not going to you know move around
very<00:02:15.150> easy<00:02:15.659> either<00:02:15.930> because<00:02:16.379> it<00:02:16.560> gets<00:02:16.709> this<00:02:16.889> a

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
very easy either because it gets this a

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.220 
very easy either because it gets this a
really<00:02:17.879> great<00:02:18.209> rubber<00:02:18.569> texture<00:02:19.079> on<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
really great rubber texture on the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.089 
really great rubber texture on the
bottom<00:02:20.269> so<00:02:21.269> it's<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.510> pretty<00:02:21.749> pretty<00:02:22.739> neat<00:02:22.920> name

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
bottom so it's a pretty pretty neat name

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.619 
bottom so it's a pretty pretty neat name
because<00:02:23.459> most<00:02:23.730> mouse<00:02:23.999> companies<00:02:24.480> out<00:02:24.599> there

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
because most mouse companies out there

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.739 
because most mouse companies out there
mouse<00:02:25.230> pad<00:02:25.530> companies<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.299> have<00:02:27.299> a<00:02:27.329> whole<00:02:27.599> lot

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:27.749 
mouse pad companies I have a whole lot

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.990 
mouse pad companies I have a whole lot
of<00:02:27.900> products<00:02:28.409> and<00:02:28.680> then<00:02:28.889> they<00:02:29.489> share<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.969> same

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
of products and then they share the same

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.910 
of products and then they share the same
features<00:02:30.510> with<00:02:30.719> other<00:02:31.049> companies<00:02:31.349> products

features with other companies products

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.369 
features with other companies products
but<00:02:32.489> this<00:02:32.700> one<00:02:32.879> I<00:02:32.909> think<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.299> standing<00:02:34.109> alone

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
but this one I think is standing alone

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.629 
but this one I think is standing alone
right<00:02:34.709> now<00:02:34.739> there's<00:02:35.129> no<00:02:35.250> one<00:02:35.370> else<00:02:35.459> that

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
right now there's no one else that

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.530 
right now there's no one else that
really<00:02:35.790> offers<00:02:36.209> fat<00:02:37.170> mousepad<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.359> you're

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
really offers fat mousepad so if you're

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.849 
really offers fat mousepad so if you're
interested<00:02:39.959> in<00:02:40.079> having<00:02:40.319> something<00:02:40.680> that's

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
interested in having something that's

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.369 
interested in having something that's
easy<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.669> the<00:02:41.760> hands<00:02:42.060> has<00:02:42.659> a<00:02:42.689> really<00:02:43.109> great

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
easy on the hands has a really great

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.300 
easy on the hands has a really great
cloth<00:02:44.249> top<00:02:44.669> to<00:02:44.909> it<00:02:45.060> very<00:02:45.299> similar<00:02:45.689> to<00:02:45.719> the

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
cloth top to it very similar to the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.390 
cloth top to it very similar to the
steelseries<00:02:47.359> qck<00:02:48.359> I<00:02:48.389> think<00:02:48.840> nice<00:02:49.709> glide<00:02:50.069> you

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
steelseries qck I think nice glide you

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.729 
steelseries qck I think nice glide you
know<00:02:50.599> that's<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.719> mouse<00:02:51.840> glide<00:02:52.139> across<00:02:52.290> but

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
know that's the mouse glide across but

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.349 
know that's the mouse glide across but
it<00:02:52.829> gives<00:02:52.919> you<00:02:53.040> enough<00:02:53.219> friction<00:02:53.879> that<00:02:54.090> you

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
it gives you enough friction that you

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.399 
it gives you enough friction that you
don't<00:02:54.540> feel<00:02:54.659> like<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> Gnostic<00:02:55.169> just<00:02:55.290> going

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
don't feel like the Gnostic just going

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.080 
don't feel like the Gnostic just going
to<00:02:55.500> fly<00:02:55.650> away<00:02:55.799> from<00:02:56.069> you<00:02:56.189> which<00:02:56.699> is<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.969> way<00:02:57.060> I

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
to fly away from you which is the way I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.920 
to fly away from you which is the way I
like<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.389> personally<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:59.790> become<00:03:00.120> what

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
like it personally and it's become what
