00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.090
 known to me saving 14 but judging 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.740
 around due to madden hawaii party 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.960
 although still not figured out where 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.860

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.710

 such people who are not just corny 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.430
 not least 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.890
 there is no point in deceiving me 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.640
 I certainly expressed myself as a person in 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.500
 comments but i'm not like that after all 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.170
 culture must be everywhere 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.840
 not only at home when you communicate but 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.349
 And on the Internet, yes, here they are only the Fifers 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.879

 guys thanks for the distrust it's just 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:55.409
 real nonsense in many people i 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.829
 disillusioned so these people can 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:02.730
 leave with the channel I'm not very full 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.530
 seriously tell you this is somewhere a career 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.859
 I was even talking for this career 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.510
 i just don't want to cut anything anymore 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:16.769
 Sorry, of course, but most likely all 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.419
 haters go fuck just sign off 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.040
 from the channel if something doesn't suit you 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:25.349
 these guys these players are all there 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.780
 I do n't know him, I don't know, I can only 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.720
 for the national team to take these guys and say 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.609
 that type all bye vasin to 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.000
 dating everyone else but I would stand 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.349
 old men real old men at the gate 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.439
 will anyone else put in general 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.180
 there are two types of stick on 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.019
 spattered ships with center on steel okay i 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.400
 I can do that 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.759
 kombarov will nail tune play sense 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.590
 I do something more and do not understand 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:54.870
 sense to me at all to shoot a career if you 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.470
 I still do not believe that people do not 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.900
 believed in a career for a player that they do not believe 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.879
 now in a career for the club does not believe that 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.549
 these players are not cheat many disputes about 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.500
 the sheriff was not known at all who 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.250
 he is so I still can not understand 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.380
 where did it all come from I will take it to him 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.500
 say that all the guys they will not play 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.409
 but it makes sense to me to play play 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.100
 created and it means it's time to use it 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:27.830
 to the full 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.350
 okay, I accept the challenge here to play without 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.360
 them selling them what other club if 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.550
 although I won't have them in the reding 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.580

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.700

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.970
 release and I can only say 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.970
 I don't need one such subscribers 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:51.680

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.140

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.830
 so let's shuruet wear four 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.480

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.200
 shark to watch someone else 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.190
 I do not need such viewers all on this 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.620
 probably all 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.890
 The series today will not be likely 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.850
