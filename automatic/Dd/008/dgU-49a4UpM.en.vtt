ashley need a prime but think two
testers<00:00:34.980> might<00:00:35.219> not<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.520> enough

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.960 

it's<00:00:40.790> going<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:40.970> be<00:00:41.120> just<00:00:41.150> a<00:00:42.340> ridge<00:00:43.340> where<00:00:43.760> it

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
it's going to be just a ridge where it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.840 
it's going to be just a ridge where it
joins<00:00:47.890> this<00:00:48.890> is<00:00:49.070> this<00:00:49.309> is<00:00:49.460> something<00:00:49.700> could

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
joins this is this is something could

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.840 
joins this is this is something could
make<00:00:50.390> it<00:00:50.600> cover<00:00:50.989> about<00:00:51.290> that<00:00:51.530> much<00:00:51.770> i<00:00:52.190> need

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
make it cover about that much i need

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.560 
make it cover about that much i need
about<00:00:52.940> 20<00:00:53.510> testers<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.140> do<00:00:54.290> this<00:00:54.470> i<00:00:55.570> thought

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
about 20 testers to do this i thought

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.430 
about 20 testers to do this i thought
one<00:00:56.840> would<00:00:57.080> be<00:00:57.199> enough<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:57.980> start<00:00:58.309> with<00:00:58.519> first

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
one would be enough to start with first

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:07.780 
one would be enough to start with first
clearly<00:01:00.440> not

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.840 

seems<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.510> be<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.720> right<00:01:08.810> color<00:01:09.050> though<00:01:09.850> is

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
seems to be the right color though is

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.050 
seems to be the right color though is
this<00:01:11.030> big<00:01:11.450> crack<00:01:11.810> here<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:13.610> actually<00:01:13.730> goes

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
this big crack here and it actually goes

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.340 
this big crack here and it actually goes
through<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.480> the<00:01:14.600> other<00:01:14.630> side<00:01:14.840> there's<00:01:15.290> a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
through to the other side there's a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.770 
through to the other side there's a
corresponding<00:01:15.890> crack<00:01:16.430> on<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.760> other<00:01:16.940> side<00:01:17.150> so

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
corresponding crack on the other side so

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.050 
corresponding crack on the other side so
this<00:01:18.380> was<00:01:18.590> probably<00:01:18.830> not<00:01:19.190> really<00:01:19.460> safe<00:01:19.670> fill

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
this was probably not really safe fill

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.590 
this was probably not really safe fill
it<00:01:20.210> back<00:01:20.360> it's<00:01:20.660> going<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.870> fall<00:01:21.110> in<00:01:21.260> on<00:01:21.380> me<00:01:21.560> so

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
it back it's going to fall in on me so

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.750 
it back it's going to fall in on me so
it's<00:01:23.600> not<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:24.830> greatest<00:01:25.010> rule<00:01:25.670> in<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.940> world

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
it's not the greatest rule in the world

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.420 
it's not the greatest rule in the world
stick<00:01:28.760> wit<00:01:29.000> but<00:01:29.330> that<00:01:29.960> might<00:01:30.170> make<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.590> well

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
stick wit but that might make it well

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.070 
stick wit but that might make it well
all<00:01:31.729> that's<00:01:31.970> happening<00:01:32.240> now<00:01:32.450> is<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.810> paint's

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
all that's happening now is the paint's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.219 
all that's happening now is the paint's
coming<00:01:33.350> back<00:01:33.500> off<00:01:33.650> for<00:01:33.800> their<00:01:34.720> needs<00:01:35.720> do<00:01:35.960> all

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
coming back off for their needs do all

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.270 
coming back off for their needs do all
of<00:01:36.260> that<00:01:36.380> as<00:01:36.680> well<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:39.530> I've<00:01:39.680> always<00:01:39.860> used

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
of that as well and I've always used

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.370 
of that as well and I've always used
most<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.820> paint<00:01:41.060> already<00:01:41.300> so<00:01:43.930> yeah<00:01:44.930> anyway

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380

most of the paint already so yeah anyway
I've<00:01:45.619> just<00:01:45.830> spent<00:01:46.070> quite<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.430> long<00:01:46.640> time<00:01:46.670> trying

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
I've just spent quite a long time trying

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.070 
I've just spent quite a long time trying
to<00:01:47.240> paint<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:47.660> it's<00:01:48.470> not<00:01:48.920> going<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.970> work<00:01:50.240> it's

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
to paint it it's not going to work it's

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.950 
to paint it it's not going to work it's
sort<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.470> nearly<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.070> right<00:01:52.250> color<00:01:52.660> but<00:01:53.660> it's

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
sort of nearly the right color but it's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.990 
sort of nearly the right color but it's
not<00:01:54.140> blending<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:54.890> very<00:01:54.920> well<00:01:55.460> i'm<00:01:55.759> going<00:01:55.910> to

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
not blending in very well i'm going to

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.790 
not blending in very well i'm going to
do<00:01:56.270> loads<00:01:56.540> more<00:01:56.840> coats<00:01:57.110> before<00:01:57.530> it's<00:01:57.650> even

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
do loads more coats before it's even

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.280 
do loads more coats before it's even
close<00:01:58.220> and<00:01:58.610> when<00:01:59.210> it<00:01:59.300> got<00:01:59.420> as<00:01:59.540> far<00:01:59.570> as<00:01:59.840> that<00:02:00.050> and

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
close and when it got as far as that and

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.749 
close and when it got as far as that and
i've<00:02:00.350> got<00:02:00.500> no<00:02:00.650> game<00:02:00.860> I've<00:02:01.070> now<00:02:01.220> got<00:02:01.400> that<00:02:01.550> bit

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.750 

anyway<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.780> Saturday<00:02:13.710> think<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.280> which<00:02:14.730> is

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760

but it is history I mean it's not like
grand<00:03:10.320> history<00:03:10.800> it's<00:03:10.950> not<00:03:11.070> like<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.340> history

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
it's gone so that is the actual

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.090
