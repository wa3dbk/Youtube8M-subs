00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.570 

I<00:00:13.759> came<00:00:14.759> up<00:00:14.910> with<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.240> concept<00:00:15.890> of<00:00:16.890> Lucille

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
I came up with the concept of Lucille

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.970 
I came up with the concept of Lucille
Bob's<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> beginning<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.710> just

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
Bob's just in the beginning really just

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.250 
Bob's just in the beginning really just
thinking<00:00:20.279> about<00:00:20.400> redheads<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.270> iconic

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
thinking about redheads and iconic

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.500 
thinking about redheads and iconic
redhead<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> think<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.000> thing<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.240> was

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
redhead but I think the thing that was

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.750 
redhead but I think the thing that was
most<00:00:24.570> interesting<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.800> exciting<00:00:25.949> about<00:00:26.400> her

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
most interesting and exciting about her

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.990 
most interesting and exciting about her
it's<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.539> her<00:00:28.109> dynamic<00:00:28.710> personality<00:00:29.250> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
it's just her dynamic personality to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.089 
it's just her dynamic personality to
really<00:00:30.269> put<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.630> together<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.109> really

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
really put that together with really

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.190 
really put that together with really
beautiful<00:00:32.550> styling<00:00:33.120> from<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> 40s<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.050> 50s

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
beautiful styling from the 40s and 50s

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.950 
beautiful styling from the 40s and 50s
so<00:00:34.649> something<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.190> really<00:00:35.460> finished

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
so something that was really finished

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.280 
so something that was really finished
really<00:00:36.960> romantic<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:38.010> feminine<00:00:38.719> and<00:00:39.719> then

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
really romantic really feminine and then

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.680 
really romantic really feminine and then
of<00:00:40.739> course<00:00:40.800> bringing<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.820> modern<00:00:42.180> elements

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
of course bringing that modern elements

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.150 
of course bringing that modern elements
of<00:00:42.809> an<00:00:42.930> edge<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.800> seemed<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:43.950> it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
of an edge to that just seemed like it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.229 
of an edge to that just seemed like it
would<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.399> something<00:00:44.640> really<00:00:44.879> interesting

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
would be something really interesting

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.670 
would be something really interesting
that<00:00:45.780> maybe<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.260> haven't<00:00:46.649> really<00:00:46.920> seen<00:00:47.250> before

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
that maybe I haven't really seen before

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.220 
that maybe I haven't really seen before
so<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.340> concept<00:00:50.760> Lucille<00:00:51.059> Ball<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:52.050> me

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
so the the concept Lucille Ball for me

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.709 
so the the concept Lucille Ball for me
obviously<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.860> instantly<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.910> short

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
obviously I instantly think of short

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.310 
obviously I instantly think of short
little<00:00:54.840> curly<00:00:55.260> hair<00:00:55.530> red<00:00:56.100> hair<00:00:56.930> but<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.199> my

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
little curly hair red hair but for my

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.380 
little curly hair red hair but for my
personal<00:00:58.680> sense<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.340> aesthetic<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.030> like

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
personal sense of aesthetic I like

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.670 
personal sense of aesthetic I like
fashion<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> little<00:01:01.350> more<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.620> little

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
fashion to have a little more a little

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.009 
fashion to have a little more a little
bit<00:01:01.890> more<00:01:02.070> grit<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.480> therefore<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
bit more grit to it so therefore I

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.859 
bit more grit to it so therefore I
wanted<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.710> take<00:01:05.189> those<00:01:05.489> shapes<00:01:05.850> like<00:01:06.600> again

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
wanted to take those shapes like again

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.380 
wanted to take those shapes like again
into<00:01:07.229> small<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.650> geometric<00:01:08.130> patterns<00:01:08.580> by

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
into small little geometric patterns by

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.620 
into small little geometric patterns by
shaving<00:01:09.810> off<00:01:10.080> sides<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.770> heads<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.630> creating

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
shaving off sides of heads and creating

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.219 
shaving off sides of heads and creating
short<00:01:13.200> little<00:01:13.409> peaks<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> bangs<00:01:14.430> um<00:01:15.229> that

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
short little peaks and bangs um that

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.830 
short little peaks and bangs um that
would<00:01:16.470> still<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.890> pretty<00:01:17.100> pretty<00:01:17.390> but<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
would still be pretty pretty but it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.580 
would still be pretty pretty but it
wouldn't<00:01:19.229> be<00:01:19.320> commercial<00:01:19.830> pretty<00:01:20.070> pretty

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
wouldn't be commercial pretty pretty

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.020 
wouldn't be commercial pretty pretty
redheads<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> blast<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.520> get<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.820> color

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
redheads are a blast to get to color

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
redheads are a blast to get to color
because<00:01:24.420> they're<00:01:25.020> intense<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.890> they're

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
because they're intense and they're

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.910 
because they're intense and they're
bright<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.759> they're<00:01:27.030> fun<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.689> they're<00:01:27.920> witty

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and you know they're enjoyable to look

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.609 
and you know they're enjoyable to look
at<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.280> different<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:34.200> something

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
at so it's different it's it's something

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.499 
at so it's different it's it's something
that<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:34.950> everyone<00:01:35.400> wears<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.880> time<00:01:36.150> so

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
that not everyone wears all the time so

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.859 
that not everyone wears all the time so
of<00:01:36.630> course<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.110> fun<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.680> create<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.780> know

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
of course it's fun to create so you know

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.780 
of course it's fun to create so you know

a<00:02:13.560> little<00:02:13.890> bit<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.460> our<00:02:14.730> edge<00:02:15.300> putting

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
a little bit of our edge putting

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.530 
a little bit of our edge putting
something<00:02:16.620> with<00:02:17.010> strong<00:02:17.370> geometry<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.330> her

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
something with strong geometry on her

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.320 
something with strong geometry on her
was<00:02:18.780> really<00:02:19.370> exciting<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.520> then<00:02:20.970> being<00:02:21.180> able

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
was really exciting and then being able

is<00:04:16.100> something<00:04:16.400> that<00:04:16.820> there's<00:04:17.390> nothing<00:04:17.750> else

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
is something that there's nothing else

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.430 
is something that there's nothing else
like<00:04:18.380> it<00:04:18.440> there's<00:04:19.040> no<00:04:19.489> other<00:04:19.760> color<00:04:20.120> line<00:04:20.440> that

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
like it there's no other color line that

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.500 
like it there's no other color line that
works<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.890> way<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.160> debater<00:04:22.400> does<00:04:22.640> so<00:04:23.480> I

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
works the way the debater does so I

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.900 
works the way the debater does so I
think<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.960> excitement<00:04:24.350> is<00:04:24.770> really<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.550> team

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
think the excitement is really the team

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.390 
think the excitement is really the team
gelling<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.840> process<00:04:27.470> gelling<00:04:28.010> and<00:04:28.250> then

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
gelling the process gelling and then

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.640 
gelling the process gelling and then
allowing<00:04:28.930> through<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.170> prepared

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
allowing through that prepared

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.820 
allowing through that prepared
environment<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:32.210> creative<00:04:32.960> process<00:04:33.140> to<00:04:33.620> just
