00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:28.289 
then the top floor is going to be suites
or<00:03:25.920> maybe<00:03:26.920> top<00:03:27.189> two<00:03:27.430> floors<00:03:27.639> i<00:03:28.030> don't<00:03:28.180> know<00:03:28.269> i

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
or maybe top two floors i don't know i

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.789 
or maybe top two floors i don't know i
might<00:03:28.569> only<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:28.959> three<00:03:29.230> floors<00:03:29.549> because<00:03:31.799> well

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
might only do three floors because well

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.830 
might only do three floors because well
look<00:03:33.010> at<00:03:33.099> how<00:03:33.250> much<00:03:33.430> resources<00:03:33.790> this<00:03:34.180> took<00:03:34.450> i'm

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
look at how much resources this took i'm

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.190 
look at how much resources this took i'm
almost<00:03:35.200> out<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.650> like<00:03:36.310> everything<00:03:37.060> wool<00:03:37.989> wise

I make stuff for other people but i'm

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.920 
I make stuff for other people but i'm
not<00:04:00.250> sure<00:04:00.310> what<00:04:00.760> color<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.269> make<00:04:01.419> the<00:04:01.599> floors

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.920 
not sure what color to make the floors
and<00:04:02.579> what<00:04:03.579> i<00:04:03.609> want<00:04:03.879> to<00:04:04.090> be<00:04:04.209> able<00:04:04.299> to<00:04:04.450> do<00:04:04.569> is<00:04:04.719> to

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
and what i want to be able to do is to

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.000 
and what i want to be able to do is to
make<00:04:05.049> them<00:04:05.230> tan<00:04:05.639> but<00:04:06.639> there<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.120> just<00:04:07.299> no<00:04:07.719> way

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
make them tan but there is just no way

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.580 
make them tan but there is just no way
absolutely<00:04:09.010> not<00:04:09.930> because<00:04:10.930> i<00:04:11.200> would<00:04:11.409> have<00:04:11.560> to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
absolutely not because i would have to

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:19.110 
absolutely not because i would have to
get<00:04:11.859> ten<00:04:12.599> wool<00:04:13.599> and<00:04:14.519> i<00:04:15.519> just<00:04:16.320> know<00:04:17.909> the<00:04:18.909> amount

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
get ten wool and i just know the amount

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.000 
get ten wool and i just know the amount
of<00:04:21.330> that<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.630> amount<00:04:22.900> i<00:04:23.080> guess<00:04:23.440> that<00:04:23.800> would<00:04:23.979> be

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
of that the amount i guess that would be

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.210 
of that the amount i guess that would be
happening<00:04:24.370> is<00:04:24.789> pretty<00:04:25.360> low<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:26.289> probability

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
happening is pretty low the probability

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.670 
happening is pretty low the probability
not<00:04:27.460> amount<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:28.720> probability<00:04:29.500> of<00:04:29.530> that

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
not amount the probability of that

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.219 
not amount the probability of that
happening<00:04:29.860> is<00:04:30.310> quite<00:04:30.490> low<00:04:31.020> anyway<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:34.229> haven't

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
happening is quite low anyway I haven't

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.200 
happening is quite low anyway I haven't
really<00:04:35.349> done<00:04:35.560> anything<00:04:35.740> down<00:04:36.039> here<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.699> almost

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
really done anything down here I almost

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.820 
really done anything down here I almost
think<00:04:37.659> that<00:04:37.810> might<00:04:38.110> be<00:04:38.139> a<00:04:38.289> finishing<00:04:38.680> touch

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
think that might be a finishing touch

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.550 
think that might be a finishing touch
like<00:04:39.669> after<00:04:39.880> I<00:04:40.090> have<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.389> other<00:04:40.630> places<00:04:41.289> the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
like after I have the other places the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.620 
like after I have the other places the
rest<00:04:41.770> of<00:04:41.860> this<00:04:42.009> building<00:04:42.610> done<00:04:42.849> because<00:04:43.419> it's

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
rest of this building done because it's

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.649 
rest of this building done because it's
going<00:04:43.780> to<00:04:43.840> be<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:43.960> very<00:04:44.020> tall<00:04:44.530> building<00:04:45.630> with<00:04:46.630> a

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659 
going to be a very tall building with a

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:50.460 
going to be a very tall building with a
lot<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:46.900> detail<00:04:48.270> I'm<00:04:49.270> thinking<00:04:49.990> only<00:04:50.080> three

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
lot of detail I'm thinking only three

00:04:50.470 --> 00:05:00.310 
lot of detail I'm thinking only three
floors<00:04:51.210> that<00:04:52.210> is

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.340 

well<00:05:01.320> that<00:05:01.860> is<00:05:02.190> I<00:05:02.940> don't<00:05:03.600> I<00:05:03.810> think<00:05:04.020> if<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:04.170> made

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
well that is I don't I think if I made

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.870 
well that is I don't I think if I made
that<00:05:04.500> four<00:05:04.770> floors<00:05:05.040> that<00:05:05.190> might<00:05:05.370> look<00:05:05.580> awkward

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
that four floors that might look awkward

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.670 
that four floors that might look awkward
especially<00:05:06.540> since<00:05:07.080> it's<00:05:07.230> going<00:05:07.350> to<00:05:07.410> be<00:05:07.470> two

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
especially since it's going to be two

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.650 
especially since it's going to be two
blocks<00:05:08.070> between<00:05:08.430> each<00:05:08.760> floor<00:05:09.120> because<00:05:09.540> i'm

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
blocks between each floor because i'm

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.580 
blocks between each floor because i'm
not<00:05:09.810> going<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.550> keep<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:15.110> what<00:05:16.110> is<00:05:16.230> it<00:05:16.350> i'm<00:05:16.440> not

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
not going to keep the what is it i'm not

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.220 
not going to keep the what is it i'm not
going<00:05:16.710> to<00:05:16.740> keep<00:05:16.980> the<00:05:17.250> I<00:05:17.840> don't<00:05:18.840> know<00:05:18.930> maybe<00:05:19.080> I

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
going to keep the I don't know maybe I

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.720 
going to keep the I don't know maybe I
won't<00:05:19.380> have<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.620> do<00:05:19.770> two<00:05:19.920> blocks<00:05:20.220> between<00:05:20.490> the

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
won't have to do two blocks between the

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.040 
won't have to do two blocks between the
next<00:05:21.000> floor<00:05:21.240> because<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:23.810> no<00:05:24.810> I<00:05:24.870> definitely

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
next floor because the no I definitely

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.870 
next floor because the no I definitely
don't<00:05:25.530> want<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:25.770> make<00:05:25.920> the<00:05:26.040> ceiling<00:05:26.400> read<00:05:26.670> as

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
don't want to make the ceiling read as

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.520 
don't want to make the ceiling read as
well<00:05:28.640> so<00:05:29.640> yeah<00:05:29.820> three<00:05:30.210> floors<00:05:30.510> two<00:05:30.960> floors<00:05:31.290> of

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
well so yeah three floors two floors of

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.680 
well so yeah three floors two floors of
these<00:05:31.650> small<00:05:32.010> hotel<00:05:32.550> rooms<00:05:32.850> and<00:05:33.120> then<00:05:33.300> sweets

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
so what do you guys think of that a good

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.300 
so what do you guys think of that a good

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
idea that's more than enough people or
