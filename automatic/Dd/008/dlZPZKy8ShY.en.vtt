system the cool thing about you lace is
at<00:00:16.930> its<00:00:17.080> modular<00:00:17.619> so<00:00:18.250> each<00:00:19.090> of<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.360> segments

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
at its modular so each of the segments

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.480 
at its modular so each of the segments
is<00:00:19.930> only<00:00:20.140> about<00:00:20.500> two<00:00:20.830> and<00:00:20.980> a<00:00:21.010> half<00:00:21.160> inches<00:00:21.430> long

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
of time and is actually gonna be much

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.049 
of time and is actually gonna be much
faster<00:00:36.100> than<00:00:36.340> anything<00:00:36.579> you've<00:00:36.820> ever<00:00:36.910> done

stuff
we're<00:00:42.850> gonna<00:00:42.970> do<00:00:43.180> it<00:00:43.329> with<00:00:43.480> these<00:00:43.780> six

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
we're gonna do it with these six

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.500 
we're gonna do it with these six
segments<00:00:44.829> and<00:00:44.980> this<00:00:45.520> one<00:00:45.760> lace<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:46.270> came

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
segments and this one lace that came

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.340 
segments and this one lace that came
with<00:00:47.290> the<00:00:47.650> shoe<00:00:47.890> so<00:00:48.280> let's<00:00:48.460> get<00:00:48.610> right<00:00:48.790> at<00:00:49.000> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
with the shoe so let's get right at it

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.050 
with the shoe so let's get right at it
so<00:00:50.350> I'm<00:00:50.500> just<00:00:50.590> gonna<00:00:50.860> go<00:00:51.070> in<00:00:51.250> first<00:00:51.489> and<00:00:51.820> I'm

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
so I'm just gonna go in first and I'm

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.840 
so I'm just gonna go in first and I'm
gonna<00:00:52.180> do<00:00:52.450> the<00:00:53.110> parallel<00:00:53.560> lacing<00:00:54.190> which<00:00:54.460> is

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
gonna do the parallel lacing which is

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.690 
gonna do the parallel lacing which is
very<00:00:55.060> simple<00:00:55.450> let's<00:00:55.660> just<00:00:55.780> push<00:00:56.440> pull<00:00:57.430> and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
very simple let's just push pull and

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.540 
very simple let's just push pull and
lock<00:00:58.630> together<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.680> product<00:01:00.070> actually<00:01:00.220> in

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
lock together the product actually in

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.910 
lock together the product actually in
locks<00:01:00.880> together<00:01:01.030> in<00:01:01.450> most<00:01:01.989> shoes<00:01:02.260> in<00:01:02.590> in<00:01:02.829> a

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
locks together in most shoes in in a

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.580 
locks together in most shoes in in a
straight<00:01:03.190> line<00:01:03.399> as<00:01:03.790> like<00:01:04.180> this<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:04.780> it's<00:01:05.500> gonna

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
straight line as like this so it's gonna

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.219 
straight line as like this so it's gonna
run<00:01:05.860> through<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:07.210> do<00:01:07.390> all<00:01:07.540> of<00:01:07.570> my<00:01:07.689> parallels

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
run through and do all of my parallels

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:16.620 
run through and do all of my parallels
first<00:01:10.770> Lauren<00:01:11.770> gin<00:01:13.440> come<00:01:14.440> through<00:01:15.450> with<00:01:16.450> my

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
first Lauren gin come through with my

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.680 
first Lauren gin come through with my
red<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.260> that's<00:01:18.070> gonna<00:01:18.220> be<00:01:18.310> my<00:01:18.430> last<00:01:19.120> parallel

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
red and that's gonna be my last parallel

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.560 
red and that's gonna be my last parallel
for<00:01:19.870> this<00:01:19.990> one<00:01:20.170> side<00:01:20.470> then<00:01:21.159> just<00:01:21.430> simply<00:01:21.670> pull

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
for this one side then just simply pull

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.680 
for this one side then just simply pull
them<00:01:22.659> too<00:01:22.869> they<00:01:23.140> stretch<00:01:23.670> pop<00:01:24.670> through<00:01:25.000> on<00:01:25.570> the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
them too they stretch pop through on the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.250 
them too they stretch pop through on the
opposite<00:01:26.110> side<00:01:26.640> pull<00:01:27.640> push<00:01:28.630> through<00:01:28.900> and<00:01:29.080> then

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
opposite side pull push through and then

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.410 
opposite side pull push through and then
pull

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
pull

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.960 
pull
kind<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.750> lock<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.260> place<00:01:34.670> if<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.790> make<00:01:35.940> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
kind of lock on the place if you make a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.000 
kind of lock on the place if you make a
mistake<00:01:36.150> would<00:01:36.510> you<00:01:36.630> laced<00:01:36.870> actually<00:01:37.860> no

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
mistake would you laced actually no

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.700 
mistake would you laced actually no
problem<00:01:38.400> because<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:38.760> pop<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.780> pop<00:01:39.810> back

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
problem because they pop in and pop back

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.190 
problem because they pop in and pop back
out<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.220> as<00:01:41.430> fast<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.270> made<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> mistake<00:01:42.720> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
out just as fast so I made a mistake and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.740 
out just as fast so I made a mistake and
didn't<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.650> this<00:01:43.830> red<00:01:44.150> it's<00:01:45.150> no<00:01:45.270> problem<00:01:45.510> to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
didn't like this red it's no problem to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.250 
didn't like this red it's no problem to
change<00:01:45.870> it<00:01:46.110> out<00:01:46.250> as<00:01:47.250> quickly<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.820> goes<00:01:47.940> in

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
change it out as quickly as it goes in

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.870 
change it out as quickly as it goes in
pops<00:01:49.260> back<00:01:49.440> up<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.100> let's<00:01:50.460> put<00:01:50.580> it<00:01:50.670> right<00:01:50.700> back

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
pops back up so let's put it right back

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.490 
pops back up so let's put it right back
in<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.110> keep<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.500> way<00:01:54.470> what<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
in and keep on the way what a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.660 
in and keep on the way what a
checkerboard<00:01:55.800> pattern<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.280> always<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.640> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
checkerboard pattern I always like to

quite frankly you spent about two years

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.350 
quite frankly you spent about two years
engineering<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.800> products<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:24.090> amount

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
engineering the products so the amount

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.850 
engineering the products so the amount
