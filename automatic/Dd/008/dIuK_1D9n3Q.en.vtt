00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
go but we know that there's a lot of

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.350 
go but we know that there's a lot of
good<00:01:22.799> pieces<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.340> work<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.700> well<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.330> year

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
good pieces to work with well this year

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.740 
good pieces to work with well this year
we<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:25.200> more<00:01:26.159> pieces<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.610> figure<00:01:27.240> out<00:01:27.390> even

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
we have more pieces to figure out even

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.810 
we have more pieces to figure out even
more<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> last<00:01:28.320> year<00:01:28.680> with<00:01:29.310> some<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.700> the

ten new players that are here and a lot
of<00:01:33.840> reversible<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.979> putting<00:01:35.850> them<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.180> spots

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
of reversible so putting them in spots

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.960 
of reversible so putting them in spots
to<00:01:37.409> see<00:01:37.590> where<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> matchups<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.759> where<00:01:38.880> are

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
to see where the matchups and where are

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330 
to see where the matchups and where are
combinations<00:01:39.570> are<00:01:39.750> our<00:01:39.960> best<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:41.100> got<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
combinations are our best so we got to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
combinations are our best so we got to
get<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> big<00:01:41.790> game<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.329> really<00:01:42.540> evaluate

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
and teacher than the game with

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.900 
and teacher than the game with
we<00:01:45.690> have<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.590> that's<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:46.980> balance<00:01:47.190> of<00:01:47.550> what

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
we have and that's the balance of what

we have and that's the balance of what
we<00:01:48.150> want<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.450> accomplished<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.380> lot<00:01:50.040> of

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
we want to get accomplished a lot of

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.500 
we want to get accomplished a lot of
these<00:01:50.310> new<00:01:50.520> players<00:01:50.760> just<00:01:51.120> the<00:01:51.300> general

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
these new players just the general

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.460 
these new players just the general
principles<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.410> what<00:01:52.650> we're<00:01:53.280> trying<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.640> play

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
principles and what we're trying to play

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.440 
principles and what we're trying to play
are<00:01:55.470> also<00:01:55.860> instill<00:01:56.430> at<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:56.640> same<00:01:56.820> time<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.300> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
are also instill at the same time so it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.650 
are also instill at the same time so it
it's<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.320> crash<00:01:58.560> course<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.450> coaching<00:02:00.450> and

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
it's a crash course and coaching and

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.510 
it's a crash course and coaching and
also<00:02:00.990> trying<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.410> figure<00:02:01.770> out<00:02:01.830> what<00:02:02.100> our<00:02:02.160> best

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
also trying to figure out what our best

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.210 
also trying to figure out what our best
unit<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:04.350> know<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.530> we<00:02:04.800> have<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.980> week

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
unit is and to know that we have a week

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.970 
unit is and to know that we have a week
to<00:02:05.430> do<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.820> before<00:02:06.000> first<00:02:06.420> contest<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.170> it's

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
to do that before first contest is it's

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.520 
to do that before first contest is it's
a<00:02:08.040> big<00:02:08.160> challenge<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.790> one<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:10.170> know

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
a big challenge but one that you know

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.270 
a big challenge but one that you know
we're<00:02:10.710> all<00:02:10.740> ready<00:02:11.040> to<00:02:11.130> face<00:02:11.370> look<00:02:11.850> after
