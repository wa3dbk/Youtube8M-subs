well alright moving on up here here's
your<00:02:27.360> IDE<00:02:27.720> port<00:02:28.080> now<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.560> like<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.980> way<00:02:29.100> it's<00:02:29.280> a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
your IDE port now I like the way it's a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.310 
your IDE port now I like the way it's a
you<00:02:29.820> know<00:02:29.910> they've<00:02:30.090> kind<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.390> moved<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
you know they've kind of moved it to the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.050 
you know they've kind of moved it to the
back<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.190> board<00:02:32.310> that's<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:32.700> you're<00:02:32.910> up

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
back of the board that's so you're up

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.820 
back of the board that's so you're up
using<00:02:33.330> one<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.600> big<00:02:33.720> graphics<00:02:34.050> cards<00:02:34.260> 8800

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
using one of the big graphics cards 8800

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.280 
using one of the big graphics cards 8800
gtx<00:02:35.480> 8800<00:02:36.480> ultra<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:36.900> I'm<00:02:36.960> like<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.170> you're

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
gtx 8800 ultra so I'm like that you're

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.720 
gtx 8800 ultra so I'm like that you're
not<00:02:37.410> going<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> cover<00:02:37.860> up<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.250> port<00:02:38.550> and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
not going to cover up that port and

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.880 
not going to cover up that port and
speaking<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.390> not<00:02:39.540> covering<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:40.020> here<00:02:40.650> are<00:02:40.770> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
speaking of not covering up here are the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.350 
speaking of not covering up here are the
SATA<00:02:41.130> ports<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.550> got<00:02:41.700> four<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:41.970> those<00:02:42.090> right

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
SATA ports you got four of those right

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.610 
SATA ports you got four of those right
there<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.750> they're<00:02:42.930> out<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.260> way<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
there and they're out of the way of the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.800 
there and they're out of the way of the
PCI<00:02:43.920> Express<00:02:44.190> as<00:02:44.430> well<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.820> again<00:02:45.090> using<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.630> big

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
PCI Express as well so again using a big

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.960 
PCI Express as well so again using a big
graphics<00:02:46.170> card<00:02:46.350> no<00:02:46.709> problem<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.550> think<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:47.940> got

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
graphics card no problem I think we got

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.390 
graphics card no problem I think we got
the<00:02:48.120> floppy<00:02:48.330> right<00:02:48.870> there<00:02:49.050> moving<00:02:49.770> on<00:02:49.890> down<00:02:50.100> we

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
the floppy right there moving on down we

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.340 
the floppy right there moving on down we
got<00:02:50.520> three<00:02:50.730> PCI<00:02:51.090> expansion<00:02:51.660> slots<00:02:52.050> here<00:02:52.230> so

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
got three PCI expansion slots here so

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.570 
got three PCI expansion slots here so
you<00:02:52.410> can<00:02:52.530> put<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.770> sound<00:02:53.010> card<00:02:53.220> or<00:02:53.430> something

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
you can put in a sound card or something

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.979 
you can put in a sound card or something
like<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.790> maybe<00:02:54.090> even<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.390> physics<00:02:54.690> card<00:02:54.900> I'm

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
like that maybe even a physics card I'm

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.960 
like that maybe even a physics card I'm
one<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.230> ones<00:02:55.350> on<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.530> bottom<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:56.550> would

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
one of the ones on the bottom I would

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.220 
one of the ones on the bottom I would
probably<00:02:57.060> put<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.330> sound<00:02:57.540> card<00:02:57.720> at<00:02:58.020> a<00:02:58.050> physical

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
probably put a sound card at a physical

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.350 
probably put a sound card at a physical
card<00:02:58.560> right<00:02:58.709> there<00:02:58.890> on<00:02:59.760> over<00:03:00.060> here<00:03:00.180> we've<00:03:00.330> got

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
card right there on over here we've got

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.810 
card right there on over here we've got
the<00:03:00.480> ones<00:03:00.959> be<00:03:01.110> PCI<00:03:01.440> Express<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.100> there's<00:03:02.730> the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
the ones be PCI Express and there's the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.910 
the ones be PCI Express and there's the
16<00:03:03.360> speed<00:03:03.630> PCI<00:03:03.989> Express<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.440> like<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.650> said<00:03:04.709> this

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
16 speed PCI Express so like I said this

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.130 
16 speed PCI Express so like I said this
is<00:03:04.980> designed<00:03:05.400> for<00:03:05.459> one<00:03:05.700> graphics<00:03:06.120> card<00:03:06.360> and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
is designed for one graphics card and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.240 
is designed for one graphics card and
like<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.470> said<00:03:07.530> if<00:03:07.650> you're<00:03:07.709> gonna<00:03:07.830> be<00:03:07.950> using<00:03:08.070> one

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
like I said if you're gonna be using one

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.470 
like I said if you're gonna be using one
grabs<00:03:08.459> card<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.820> real<00:03:08.970> good<00:03:09.000> way<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.270> go

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
grabs card it's a real good way to go

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.300 
grabs card it's a real good way to go
with<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.020> motherboard<00:03:10.320> there's<00:03:11.040> another

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
with this motherboard there's another

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.610 
with this motherboard there's another
one<00:03:11.430> speed<00:03:12.060> PCI<00:03:12.390> Express<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.260> can<00:03:13.380> install

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
one speed PCI Express so you can install

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.350 
one speed PCI Express so you can install
maybe<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.920> TV<00:03:14.520> tuner<00:03:14.730> or<00:03:14.850> something<00:03:15.209> like<00:03:15.300> that

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
maybe a TV tuner or something like that

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.970 
maybe a TV tuner or something like that
right<00:03:15.570> there<00:03:15.750> alright<00:03:16.560> let's<00:03:16.680> look<00:03:16.769> at<00:03:16.890> the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
right there alright let's look at the

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.560 
right there alright let's look at the
ins<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.190> outs<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.580> back<00:03:17.790> alright<00:03:18.420> we've

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
ins and outs on the back alright we've

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.270 
ins and outs on the back alright we've
got<00:03:18.600> 7.1<00:03:19.380> channel<00:03:19.410> audio<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.190> have

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
got 7.1 channel audio so you have

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.789 
got 7.1 channel audio so you have
surround<00:03:20.580> sound<00:03:20.910> onboard<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:22.440> that's<00:03:22.590> nice

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
surround sound onboard so that's nice

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.370 
surround sound onboard so that's nice

here when you put this in the
motherboard<00:03:59.610> take<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.269> look<00:04:00.390> right<00:04:00.540> here

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
motherboard take a look right here

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.199 
motherboard take a look right here
notice<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.260> SATA<00:04:01.500> ports<00:04:01.799> on<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:01.980> back<00:04:02.010> here

they're not covered at all and also the
ID<00:04:05.130> on<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.549> back<00:04:05.700> right<00:04:05.880> there<00:04:06.060> it's<00:04:06.540> not

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
ID on the back right there it's not

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.240 
ID on the back right there it's not
going<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.900> cover<00:04:07.049> any<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.440> those<00:04:07.530> ports<00:04:07.980> so

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
going to cover any of those ports so

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.949 
going to cover any of those ports so
this<00:04:08.940> would<00:04:09.060> be<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.180> great<00:04:09.299> way<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.540> go<00:04:09.690> with<00:04:09.840> if
