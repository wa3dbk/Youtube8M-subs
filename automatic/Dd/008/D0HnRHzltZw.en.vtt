00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
carpet out there today isn't it

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.750 
carpet out there today isn't it
it<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.719> perfect<00:00:40.230> by<00:00:40.350> suppose<00:00:40.710> if<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.010> were<00:00:41.219> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
it is perfect by suppose if you were to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.010 
it is perfect by suppose if you were to
get<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.210> heavy<00:00:42.360> ground<00:00:42.629> than<00:00:42.870> that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
get really heavy ground than that

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.630 
get really heavy ground than that
knocked<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.530> few<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.800> them<00:00:43.890> out<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.219> we

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
knocked a few of them out and then we

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.760 
knocked a few of them out and then we
know<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:44.969> would<00:00:45.420> handle<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.350> anyway

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
know we would handle that but anyway

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.310 
know we would handle that but anyway
it's<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:48.149> probably<00:00:48.270> fair<00:00:48.629> for<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:48.870> all

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
all taken off with the idea to be

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.280 
all taken off with the idea to be
eventually<00:02:32.629> to<00:02:32.810> have<00:02:32.900> more<00:02:33.079> than<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.230> hundred

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
eventually to have more than a hundred

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.100 
eventually to have more than a hundred
horses<00:02:33.590> Devin<00:02:34.129> yeah<00:02:34.910> on-site<00:02:35.420> well<00:02:35.660> we<00:02:35.840> will

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
horses Devin yeah on-site well we will

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.270 
horses Devin yeah on-site well we will
be<00:02:36.140> looking<00:02:36.379> we<00:02:36.590> wouldn't<00:02:36.799> I<00:02:36.860> wouldn't<00:02:37.099> have

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
be looking we wouldn't I wouldn't have

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.039 
be looking we wouldn't I wouldn't have
thought<00:02:37.459> we'd<00:02:37.670> be<00:02:37.790> going<00:02:37.819> more<00:02:38.180> than<00:02:38.239> so<00:02:38.870> many

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
thought we'd be going more than so many

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.050 
thought we'd be going more than so many
more<00:02:39.200> than<00:02:39.410> hundred<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:39.829> forty<00:02:40.250> odd<00:02:40.370> that's

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
more than hundred and forty odd that's

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.589 
more than hundred and forty odd that's
probably<00:02:41.450> what<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:42.019> site<00:02:42.560> would<00:02:42.859> hold

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
probably what the site would hold

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.020 
probably what the site would hold
comfortably<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:46.250> yeah<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.640> would<00:02:46.730> be<00:02:46.879> the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
comfortably so yeah that would be the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.699 
comfortably so yeah that would be the
grand<00:02:47.480> plan<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:47.870> obviously<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.319> need<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.500> few

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709
