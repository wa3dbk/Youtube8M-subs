00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.040
 at the moment wanted that commenting that today 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.109
 I bring you a video again as a step 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.280
 prestige here we have the fourth 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.470
 prestige teacher that I will pass 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.290
 showed us and in the 3 as you see 950 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.150
 and as always as I saw that you love 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.890
 that you see many digital 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.690
 I'm teaching like that but statistics and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.860
 all of that here so here we have the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.150
 next master latch the beginning 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.430
 teacher number four as always 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.840
 you choose a permanent unlocking for the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.430
 you ask me the accessories are 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.960
 they keep in the prestigious teachers except 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.789
 the assault rifles look the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.590
 silencer the grip and another new 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.879
 agreement wall but good you do some 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.739
 how many lows you get to do is very 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.670
 easy to take off the stock and everyone is a 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.749
 little more annoying that you have it saved 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.639
 and good 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:40.409
 without wanting it to be worth but good that 

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:41.460
 you know what will happen next prestige 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.809
 teacher and you have level in the next 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.760
 prestige teacher the position number 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.049
 four carry an advanced supply that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.839
 he has it right now on the screen that 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:50.789
 I'll open in the episode opening 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.949
 supplies that I will upload tomorrow is worth 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.659
 I'll upload it tomorrow and here you have the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.120
 permanent unlocking that the son that in 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.800
 this case if I'm not wrong I chose the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.899
 music 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.090
 x as you have seen before and here I teach you 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.159
 the afternoon 19 sledgehammer that is the weapon 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.380
 that you get when passing prestige cattle 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.750
 of precision wins one of the charger and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.460
 It has less mobility and also costs 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.570
 a little more to lift after 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.070
 sprint but the truth is quite 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.270
 well because it has 20% less than 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.860
 dispersion of career with which this 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.390
 Shotgun to shoot from hip is 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.830
 Quite better than any other model 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.229
 and also has an endorsement and is more in the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.909
 charger so good then here I am going 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.580
 to teach again as always 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.680
 statistics and I went back up a bit 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 the statistics is quite true 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.149
 well there you have uploaded this vestige in 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.640
 about 7 hours and 8 pico will cost a 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.890
 little more than the previous one but good not 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.090
 I think it's 9 hours it can be or if 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.350
 nine hours or ten that what have been 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.820
 if it cost me a little more than the previous 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.929
 I did not have any blind spots at all 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.550
 style 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.869
 there you have split actions that the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.830
 true pretty well except for something or 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.630
 not generally pretty well with 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.340
 proportion of at least three and we're going to 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.590
 see if you like the game by the way 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.090
 I have almost reached 500 points for 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.500
 minute that in my opinion is quite 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.759
 well also as spice again rose 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.229
 the proportions of the points 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.850
 minute so I'm getting better 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.140
 statistics then I do not understand 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.759
 why there are people who even say that 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.959
 I do reverse guti I do not know how I'm going to 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.580
 make it last look a production of two 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.520
 and peak it is impossible for us to do we have 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.820
 typical so there we are the example 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.440
 with the shotgun 19 we are at a point 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.210
 hot on the solar map and it's a 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.410
 most important streak with the shotgun that 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.550
 he tells me like that in an improvised plan 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.560
 we are playing for this game mode 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.820
 to help for example to see rumÃ­ 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.010
 that he lacked a challenge or something like that 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.240
 and I got this game that is 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.590
 pretty cool that I leave it in the background 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.570
 so you can see how this works 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.980
 shotgun that seems to me of the best 19 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.090
 there is another one that I like more than 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.280
 professional but it was very good 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.020
 that is afterwards since they improved it 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.250
 killed one shot is quite far and if 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.830
 it goes hit marker, yes it is fast 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.970
 after putting another shot, no pity is 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.620
 how good it is that close 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.500
 Marquez Rare and they kill you not because of 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.300
 close uncle 31m one but good is 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.830
 pretty good the shotgun in my opinion 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.200
 It is one of the best shotguns in the game 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.230
 it's so it's very good and good 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.690
 we'll see 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.730
 I bring you this already since it brings us a 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.260
 review with this sentence from the rom house 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.519
 I think it's good enough to have a 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.930
 shotgun review I suppose in 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.549
 equally so that the statistics that 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.810
 It has to be pretty good but good 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.269
 since I have this simple piece and for 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.430
 talk about it this good of a couple of 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.950
 things you want to say today or have 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.239
 summarized see upload a little cut the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.250
 direct that yes I did another day in 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.500
 tweets and us saying my twitter channel 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.970
 in the description so that you follow me if 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.860
 you want to see better the director of one or 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.659
 two direct a week and maybe today 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.489
 do another I do not know if I'll have time but if 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.620
 I have time I will do another then in that 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.540
 direct so you know how to open 20 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.860
 advanced supplies and also opens the 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.030
 normal supplies hotels do not 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.290
 agreement right now and we also open 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.940
 during the games already after 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.319
 split squares open several 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.450
 normal supplies that were touching 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.129
 so I'm going to force it so that 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.450
 you see are the supplies and departures and 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.129
 I also know that a game very much touches the 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.480
 first table with acting is a 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.010
 departure of more than 10,000 points 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.650
 markers and that you are caught in 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.090
 999 so good because the live came out 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.859
 very well what happens that was cut not what 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.480
 I said but it was cut because of a fault 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.099
 tuit fell live from around the world 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.049
 of all the we go of we arrived all the 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.280
 world wishing streaming it will fit like that 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.109
 that it was not my fault I thought that if it was 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.130
 my fault but it was not my fault 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.830
 how good today 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.480
 the ported summary director and such and 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.830
 I may also do for my part 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.060
 another direct one is that if it comes out cool as 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.440
 the other day then I'll summarize it to youtube 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.450

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.130
 that of the so I will summarize without any type 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.480
 of problem and you'll see I'm not going to 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.570
