00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.120
 Hi, I'm Jessica from the company 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.040
 Image consulting and personal shopper 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.959
 vy style today we are going to continue 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.449
 talking about body typologies 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.240
 today we are going to talk about the silhouette 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:19.150
 rectangle in which this is characterized 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.250
 type of silhouette would be those people 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.560
 those women who have shoulders 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.570
 and some hips aligned but against 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.730
 they do not have a defined waist then 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.250
 that we are going to look here with what kind of 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.020
 garments we will use to try 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.149
 reach the ideal of beauty that in this 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.739
 case would be the clock around 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.039
 sand what we have to do about 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.499
 everything in the upper part is to structure 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:45.429
 the shoulders worth we have to look for a 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:46.929
 inverted triangle where the shoulders 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.719
 they go in the protagonism is to say 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.519
 we would have to wear clothes that are 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.519
 very structured like this jacket 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.739
 type beat all you can make a 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.239
 blazer that structure us a lot 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.909
 shoulders we have to imagine that the 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.530
 part of top we have we have a 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.150
 inverted triangle and then in the part 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.770
 below what we have to look for is 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.710
 try 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.270
 define a little waist because 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.060
 because these people are totally 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.979
 straight an example of this kind of 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.360
 people would be to cameron dÃ­az that is 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.270
 aligned in terms of shoulders and hips 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.829
 but it lacks waist what kind of 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.420
 garments we will use below what 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.579
 we have to search above all are lines 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.009
 triangular is to say garments that are 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.560
 a little wider from below like a 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.390
 balloon skirt or a skirt in the type 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.369
 tulip and have a defined waist 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.569
 in this way we will not get the 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.709
 hourglass silhouette 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.689
 we have to avoid wearing clothes that 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:42.640
 be very narrow or on the contrary 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.220
 clothes that are also very wide 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.590
 because then you are going to see 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.200
 even more that we do not have waist if 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.119
 let's go with a tube type dress let's 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.979
 see what we lack waist or if we go with 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.619
 very wide clothes will still be seen 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.479
 more than we are as very straight then 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.950
 we will simply try to imagine 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.899
 that the garments have figures 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.060
 geometric and look for structures a lot 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.739
 the shoulders and define the waist either 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.079
 with belts also in the part of the 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:10.840
 waist or with this type of skirts and 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:12.700
 clothes that I have commented 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.190
 and if you want to continue seeing another type 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.810
 of female typologies here below 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.790

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.950
