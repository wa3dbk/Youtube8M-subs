00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.990
 so much manna for all the boys here 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.519
 would also reboot welcome back with 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.639
 this new video we are with the second 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.769
 gta 5 top five fashions episode on 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.749
 pc sorry for the delay compared to 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.819
 first episode but unfortunately I was 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.800
 very busy with other videos from 

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.839
 register and I had to leave it back 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.029
 a bit this series anyway we are there 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:29.059
 this second episode we are going to see 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.519
 immediately which are the fashions that I have found 

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:33.579
 interesting this last period la 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.440
 the first fashion I want to talk about is 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:39.589
 called assassination or a fashion 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.589
 that being activated will indicate us in the 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.480
 map of targets to kill and to one 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.699
 once completed we say this mission 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.550
 that is, to kill the target we will see 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.100
 rewarded with money so it's one 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.050
 great fashion for anyone who wants to do 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.989
 we say very fast and a lot of money 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.260
 it is easily a fashion still in alpha 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.300
 so at a very early stage we say 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.859
 of development is in fact one of the 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.269
 criticisms that could be moved to 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.689
 this fashion is the very fact that 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.630
 these because the emissions are a bit 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.430
 too simple but still it 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.350
 developer promised he is 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.770
 working to increase the difficulty 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.119
 also of the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.950
 5 makes these loads here therefore not 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.590
 all that remains is to wait for a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.259
 future update in second place 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.850
 guys we find a mod that really 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.409
 very much fun especially for 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.259
 make disasters in the city ​​explosions 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.569
 chaotic and practically consists of 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.600
 give our character the power 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:45.149
 of the strength that the famous in the films of 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.090
 star wars and with this with this 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.049
 skill and our character can 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.579
 in fact let it rise around you 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.119
 any object found in the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.090
 nearby cars and trucks 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.489
 anything that is nearby 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.729
 which can be moved will be raised into 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:08.549
 air and simply then it can be 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.319
 hit on the ground but above all in the 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.099
 traffic jams on the highway etc. yes 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.720
 really reveals a lot of fun 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.099
 a tip use the makeup of the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.290
 visibility otherwise you will die 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.049
 crushed by a car for an explosion 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.090
 within a few seconds of the 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.459
 day if it is a fashion born very much 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.799
 interesting very well done going 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.590
 at los santos airport we could 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.200
 be transported let's say 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.420
 in the north customer ton ie in that area 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.660
 of the map where the game begins with the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.810
 first robbery they play together trevor 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.220
 and michael then a bike that five 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.010
 this is what school goals are 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.190
 new map area and see us for 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.390
 then return to the old map 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.140
 let's say holy god will move you back to the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.819
 in the area indicated with the airplane is 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.860
 possible among other things to collect and do 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.980
 snowballs to throw at them 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.390
 people in short , passers-by and there is none 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.790
 much to do in this area of ​​the map 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.459
 unfortunately, perhaps in the future they will come 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.680
 also added activities but for the 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.430
 moment there is only the spawn 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.079
 casual of vehicles and people 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.430
 nothing more really very much anyway 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.260
 interesting that they are spying 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.930
 engineering to increase the size 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.239
 map and to explore other areas 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.430
 of the map point to the players by way 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.799
 this is a motorcycle for the day 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.780
 which will allow us to use the turbo 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.299
 and marry the literary call it what you like 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.639
 on machines on any machine is 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.129
 really very useful in fortunes 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:45.340
 straight to go in general more 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:48.909
 fast and really very well done 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.310
 the turbo lasts a few seconds and if necessary 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.639
 he should give to slam some 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.659
 other car or have some 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.000
 collision 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.430
 the tour will be immediately deactivated 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.060
 in order to avoid dying on me 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.620
 an impact from the latest fashions of today 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.379
 guys it's one of the most bikes 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.200
 pussies I've ever seen is the 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:15.400
 zombie mode let's say for grand theft 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:19.269
 car and that is a way that will allow us 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.300
 to play randomly and in 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.080
 continuation of the zombies in the map 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.690
 that will come to attack us 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.430
 constantly even here is a mod that yes 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.729
 still finds itself in an alpha state 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.440
 so much to perfect however 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.750
 however already well done for the fact that 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.599
 they constantly move zombies to the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.310
 fact that you have the detector we say 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.810
 police the various stars that 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.880
 increase as that kills s ing 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.580
 me but the police will never come then 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.800
 you don't have to worry about any 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.430
 attacks we say also from the 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.229
 policy 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.280
 these guys were all five way 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.990
 most interesting I've found in 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.820
 this period can bring it with 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.199
 as much constancy as possible 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.120
 you are bikes to recommend to me 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.039
 do it also in the comments or read them 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.630
 all of them therefore focused on life 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.080
 also offers and see you with a neighbor 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.080
 video
