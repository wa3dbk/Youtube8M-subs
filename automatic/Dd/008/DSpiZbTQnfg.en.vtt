 every day so a bit of data stream 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.250
 So monday to thursday of this week 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.860

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.940

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.620
 on tuesday a bit earlier 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.170
 probably between 12 and 13 o'clock 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.790
 about Wednesday in a bit later turn 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.400
 We still have 15 o'clock maybe 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.890

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.709

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.630
 earlier again between 21 and friday 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.130
 Definitely there until sunday right 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.310
 cool thing still no precise time 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:46.250
 but he is really good and I hope so 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:48.120
 was good start publicly 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.250
 what do we have this week in 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.610
 starcraft field professional note 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.190
 but expect no shit paytv stands 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.590
 for professionalism he has today 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.500
 the good lotus league was at 17h30 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.880
 to lead against the crowd yes map 4 and 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.810
 potential value five men the 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.910
 then balance out the measures 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.459
 could and then it continues with 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.060
 this war in legacy of the void 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:17.190
 tuesday professional was there now 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.930
 lotus and 14 clock already going on five matches 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.040
 in the current could produce but 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.840
 be a few more 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.329
 So there is definitely hard action 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.940
 At the start then let me think briefly 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.130
 wednesday the kuka the again heart of 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.340
 the swarm then 15 30 there the state again 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.310
 a target group so five best street 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.530
 and a bit shorter 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.000
 you have to say because that's really not 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.060
 good management schedule like me 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.010
 see thursday 15:30 same game 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.930
 However, there was again in the evening 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.190
 I'll try a lotus match 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.650
 maybe the gap is still a bit 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.140
 to fill and then that would be two 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.269
 matches like this until 23 o'clock show maybe 22 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.810
 i would go there on thursday 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.410
 continue 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.450
 sorry Friday 18 o'clock lotus also 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.410
 currently three matches but one friday 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.819
 perhaps to ring four or 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.920
 five matches in the village each case completely 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.290
 new i know a few players can 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.810
 not at work, for example, he grabbed 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.640
 is the whole time in the bus the 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.110
 so is the box speaks only times 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.930
 not at home and on Saturday 14:00 tus 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.459
 18 and 19 o'clock lotus and 21 abs 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.769
 like you see quite a few gaps 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.639
 if you want to know about changes because 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.770
 Of course we try these 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.320
 best to then fill easy to 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.000
 live.de ev.net stop by then 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.889
 the whole then also regularly update 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.340
 when the gaps are filled and sunday 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.560
 yes the classic gossau 2 and 14 o'clock and 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.490
 at 21 o'clock then that's it and it 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.140
 if it was still day then it was on everyone 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.550
 fall for this week and hope of course 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.780
 that we have a few going on matches 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.460
 clean and pack next week, of course 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.050
 directly going again that would be more 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.720
 seven days we are at the piece so 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.340
 I think at 43 and the absolutely crazy 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.580
 I hope, of course , we'll see each other 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.580
 in the stream
