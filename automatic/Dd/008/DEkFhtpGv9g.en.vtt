why<00:00:02.260> this<00:00:02.320> just<00:00:02.650> a<00:00:02.770> very<00:00:02.980> quick<00:00:03.160> video<00:00:03.310> to<00:00:03.520> show

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:03.670 
why this just a very quick video to show

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.450 
why this just a very quick video to show
the<00:00:03.940> correct<00:00:04.330> setup<00:00:04.660> of<00:00:04.930> the<00:00:05.350> blade<00:00:05.890> 300<00:00:06.340> X

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:06.460 
the correct setup of the blade 300 X

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.640 
the correct setup of the blade 300 X
helicopter<00:00:07.060> this<00:00:07.600> is<00:00:07.779> as<00:00:07.960> it<00:00:08.230> came<00:00:08.379> out<00:00:08.440> the

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
helicopter this is as it came out the

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.739 
helicopter this is as it came out the
box<00:00:08.889> I<00:00:09.160> haven't<00:00:09.490> touched<00:00:09.610> any<00:00:09.969> of<00:00:10.119> the<00:00:10.299> AR

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:10.749 
box I haven't touched any of the AR

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.890 
box I haven't touched any of the AR
7,200<00:00:11.589> px<00:00:11.799> settings<00:00:12.219> I've<00:00:12.789> only<00:00:13.089> set<00:00:13.299> up<00:00:13.480> my<00:00:13.629> DX

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
7,200 px settings I've only set up my DX

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.019 
7,200 px settings I've only set up my DX
I<00:00:14.139> asked<00:00:14.559> per<00:00:14.709> the<00:00:14.889> manual<00:00:15.249> and<00:00:15.639> I've<00:00:15.879> made

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
I asked per the manual and I've made

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.160 
I asked per the manual and I've made
some<00:00:16.150> tweaks<00:00:16.330> the<00:00:16.570> throttle<00:00:16.840> curve<00:00:16.990> but

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
some tweaks the throttle curve but

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.390 
some tweaks the throttle curve but
nothing<00:00:17.410> that<00:00:17.530> makes<00:00:17.680> a<00:00:17.860> difference<00:00:18.160> to<00:00:18.220> this

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
nothing that makes a difference to this

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.070 
nothing that makes a difference to this
so<00:00:19.150> I've<00:00:19.240> got<00:00:19.390> a<00:00:19.420> throttle<00:00:19.540> curve

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
so I've got a throttle curve

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.070 
so I've got a throttle curve
I<00:00:20.110> sort<00:00:20.380> of<00:00:20.410> hold<00:00:20.680> on<00:00:20.980> I<00:00:21.310> plug<00:00:22.120> it<00:00:22.240> in<00:00:22.360> the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
I sort of hold on I plug it in the

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.740 
I sort of hold on I plug it in the
lights<00:00:23.350> on<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:24.000> cemetery<00:00:25.000> except<00:00:25.360> flicking

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
lights on the cemetery except flicking

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.510 
lights on the cemetery except flicking
now<00:00:25.870> but<00:00:26.020> you<00:00:26.080> won't<00:00:26.230> see<00:00:26.440> them<00:00:26.650> and<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:27.250> swash

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
now but you won't see them and the swash

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.760 
now but you won't see them and the swash
will<00:00:27.789> pop<00:00:28.300> up<00:00:28.420> and<00:00:28.570> down<00:00:28.750> when<00:00:29.410> it<00:00:29.500> finishes

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
will pop up and down when it finishes

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.220 
will pop up and down when it finishes
initializing<00:00:30.630> there<00:00:31.630> you<00:00:31.690> go<00:00:31.780> and<00:00:31.960> that<00:00:31.990> means

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
initializing there you go and that means

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.229 
initializing there you go and that means
it's<00:00:32.409> ready<00:00:32.589> okay<00:00:33.070> so<00:00:33.789> now<00:00:33.940> I've<00:00:34.059> got

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
it's ready okay so now I've got

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.479 
it's ready okay so now I've got
something<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.539> hold<00:00:34.659> on<00:00:34.839> but<00:00:35.019> basically<00:00:35.489> mid

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
something to hold on but basically mid

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
something to hold on but basically mid
stick<00:00:36.909> for<00:00:37.809> pitch<00:00:38.339> that's<00:00:39.339> forward<00:00:39.999> elevator

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
stick for pitch that's forward elevator

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.470 
stick for pitch that's forward elevator
backward<00:00:41.800> elevator

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
backward elevator

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.389 
backward elevator
that's<00:00:43.480> right<00:00:43.929> side<00:00:44.260> click<00:00:44.499> and<00:00:44.979> left<00:00:45.190> side

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
that's right side click and left side

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.279 
that's right side click and left side
click<00:00:45.640> so<00:00:46.179> the<00:00:46.300> swash<00:00:46.510> tilts<00:00:46.839> the<00:00:46.899> direction

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
click so the swash tilts the direction

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.029 
click so the swash tilts the direction
you<00:00:47.409> would<00:00:47.499> expect<00:00:48.149> OC<00:00:49.149> pitch<00:00:49.929> up<00:00:50.199> the<00:00:50.530> swash

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
you would expect OC pitch up the swash

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.790 
you would expect OC pitch up the swash
drops<00:00:51.429> pitch<00:00:52.030> down<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:52.329> swash<00:00:52.749> goes<00:00:52.960> up<00:00:53.139> now

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
drops pitch down the swash goes up now

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.529 
drops pitch down the swash goes up now
the<00:00:53.859> important<00:00:54.370> thing<00:00:54.399> for<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:54.670> gyro<00:00:54.940> is<00:00:55.269> that

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
the important thing for the gyro is that

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.029 
the important thing for the gyro is that
when<00:00:55.690> you<00:00:55.809> tilt<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.170> helicopter<00:00:56.289> the<00:00:56.769> swash

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
when you tilt the helicopter the swash

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.029 
when you tilt the helicopter the swash
stays<00:00:57.339> flat<00:00:57.609> so<00:00:57.789> if<00:00:57.879> I<00:00:57.940> tilt<00:00:58.120> forward<00:00:58.889> you<00:00:59.889> can

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
stays flat so if I tilt forward you can

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.710 
stays flat so if I tilt forward you can
see<00:01:00.069> it<00:01:00.339> pushes<00:01:00.760> back<00:01:02.699> yeah<00:01:03.699> and<00:01:03.940> if<00:01:04.030> I<00:01:04.120> tell<00:01:04.330> to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
see it pushes back yeah and if I tell to

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.380 
see it pushes back yeah and if I tell to
me<00:01:04.870> you<00:01:05.800> can<00:01:05.950> see<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.280> that<00:01:06.610> side<00:01:06.880> is<00:01:07.000> pushing

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
me you can see the that side is pushing

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.649 
me you can see the that side is pushing
up

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.649 

the<00:01:13.200> easiest<00:01:13.619> way<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> tell<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.729> let's<00:01:15.479> pick

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the easiest way to tell this let's pick

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.990 
the easiest way to tell this let's pick
up<00:01:15.750> maybe<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.170> easier<00:01:16.549> is<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.700> look<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
up maybe it's easier is to look at the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.539 
up maybe it's easier is to look at the
servo<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.350> when<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.590> move<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.070> will<00:01:20.340> see

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
servo and when you move it you will see

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.060 
servo and when you move it you will see
the<00:01:20.670> servo<00:01:21.030> twitch<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:22.290> when<00:01:22.440> I<00:01:22.470> move<00:01:22.799> when<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the servo twitch now when I move when I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.999 
the servo twitch now when I move when I
tilt<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.700> towards<00:01:24.180> me<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.649> servos<00:01:25.649> pushing

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
tilt this towards me that servos pushing

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.710 
tilt this towards me that servos pushing
up<00:01:26.250> which<00:01:26.729> means<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.119> holding<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> swash

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
up which means it's holding the swash

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.719 
up which means it's holding the swash
flat<00:01:28.020> which<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.200> correct<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.369> tilt<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
flat which is correct if I tilt the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.230 
flat which is correct if I tilt the
helicopter<00:01:30.240> forward<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:31.530> again<00:01:31.880> that<00:01:32.880> front

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
helicopter forward then again that front

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.749 
helicopter forward then again that front
servo<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.750> pushing<00:01:34.110> up<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> holding<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
servo is pushing up which is holding the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.190 
servo is pushing up which is holding the
swash<00:01:36.630> flap

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
swash flap

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.770 
swash flap
so<00:01:37.440> again<00:01:37.680> -<00:01:37.860> that's<00:01:38.039> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:38.970> see<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.270> moving

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so again - that's you can see it moving

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.570 
so again - that's you can see it moving
the<00:01:39.869> right<00:01:39.990> way<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.580> tilt<00:01:41.759> sideways<00:01:43.580> you

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
the right way and if I tilt sideways you

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.029 
the right way and if I tilt sideways you
see<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> swash<00:01:45.179> not<00:01:46.050> to<00:01:46.259> confuse<00:01:46.619> when<00:01:46.890> you

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
see the swash not to confuse when you

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.010 
see the swash not to confuse when you
move<00:01:47.429> it<00:01:47.580> it'll<00:01:47.789> twitch<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.330> it'll<00:01:48.600> end<00:01:48.720> drift

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
move it it'll twitch and it'll end drift

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.749 
move it it'll twitch and it'll end drift
back<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.440> level<00:01:51.679> so<00:01:52.679> ignore<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.220> second

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
back to level so ignore that second

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.090 
back to level so ignore that second
movement<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.050> first<00:01:55.350> response<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
movement it's the first response the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.040 
movement it's the first response the
matters<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.819> super<00:01:57.210> critical<00:01:57.390> if

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
matters and it's super critical if
