00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.210
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.580
 new pc video in this video would like 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.800
 I'll show you how a ssh 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:26.699
 connecting to a server under mac os 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:29.340
 So you can already record iks 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.520
 we would like to contact our ssh server 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.239
 connect the whole under mac os ickx 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.610
 and we can and we have to 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.340
 not an addition or use for it 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.629
 the whole works that is the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.030
 I would like at this point ever 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.460
 actually say as well as in the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.370
 tutorial to linux but of course show 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.890
 I do it all on mac os too 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.250
 we switch directly to the desktop and it 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.149
 let's go so here we are now up 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.190
 our mac os desktop and as already 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.830
 told us on our ssh server 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.570
 We can actually log in exactly 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.390
 the way we do it under 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.570
 linux 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.659
 is clear both mac os and the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.430
 example ubuntu based on unix so 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.470
 start and first a terminal 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.720
 I'm doing spotlight here now 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.450
 here now a terminal and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.220
 has reused much in too 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.590
 this video I would like to briefly the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.560
 help for ssh command show so wants 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.020
 she works the whole thing me 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.869
 use only the parameter line l because 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.420
 I want to log in 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.640
 if your hostname is not more or 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.430
 rather, if your server is not on 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.020
 would like to meet the standard poor 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.829
 he ran for parametres vienna 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.570
 connect 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.250
 at my this is now, however, 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.290
 not so ssh and l now 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.780
 but I want to be in my 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.580
 log in well and finally 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.920
 enter the ip address 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.020
 when i asked if the rsa key 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.810
 fingerprint which is displayed to me 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.480
 really the key fingerprint 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.310
 is that really too my server 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.590
 heard that I can find out by 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.990
 I get the kick fingerprint either 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.300
 sewn or mine 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.670
 poster but where i have the server house 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.990
 to get 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.840
 In my case , that's the case now 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.340
 this is only to check if 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.080
 the server I am here with 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.180
 also really is the right one 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.370
 So I type in now 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.700
 enter and must now root password 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.640
 Enter or the password of the user 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.190
 with which I log in and we see 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.740
 already there i am able to sign up 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.459
 now here in normal milan sleeves 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.880
 For example, an update can move 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.480
 make update or whatever I do 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.880
 want to do 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.280
 we do not see that everything is wonderful 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.670
 this is a full ssh connection 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.280
 so the command was finished now 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.860
 filled out and we assume I'm with 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.209
 I want to finish all my stuff 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.580
 Log out now 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.510
 of course I could do that now 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.700
 do nothing about it 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.650
 This is the ssh connection, however 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.070
 not completed properly want to the 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.870
 we so we type exit 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.620
 and we see the connection was 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.870
 closed 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.269
 when we first of all as normal 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.170
 have a user logged in and then 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.360
 later, for example, by sudo stroke the 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.370
 Having learned good status we have two 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.769
 times extra to enter namely once 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.019
 to close this sudo connection 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.310
 and then where to log it out properly 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.230
 but we see here now 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.400
 the connection was closed and 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.280
 Now I can do it again 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.630
 shut down 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.950
 that was it again from these 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.200
 professor pc video 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.330

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.930

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.549
