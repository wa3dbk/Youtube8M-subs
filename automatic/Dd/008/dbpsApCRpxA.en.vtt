these<00:00:03.580> are<00:00:03.730> 4,500<00:00:04.210> batteries<00:00:05.430> just<00:00:06.430> to<00:00:06.640> show

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:06.939 
these are 4,500 batteries just to show

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:12.930 
these are 4,500 batteries just to show
you<00:00:07.620> how<00:00:08.620> much<00:00:10.800> weight<00:00:11.800> this<00:00:12.070> plane<00:00:12.400> can<00:00:12.640> carry

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
you how much weight this plane can carry

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.220 
you how much weight this plane can carry
we're<00:00:13.210> going<00:00:13.330> to<00:00:13.390> put<00:00:13.570> them<00:00:13.660> on<00:00:13.750> center<00:00:14.110> of

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
we're going to put them on center of

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:22.019 
we're going to put them on center of
gravity<00:00:20.070> throw<00:00:21.070> a<00:00:21.099> couple<00:00:21.460> of<00:00:21.550> rubber<00:00:21.730> bands

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
gravity throw a couple of rubber bands

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:33.450 
gravity throw a couple of rubber bands
over<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.509> top<00:00:22.720> here<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.880> they<00:00:28.029> can't<00:00:28.300> move<00:00:32.460> so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
over the top here so they can't move so

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.120 
over the top here so they can't move so
right<00:00:33.640> now<00:00:33.820> there's<00:00:34.030> 18,000<00:00:34.980> milliamps<00:00:35.980> on

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
right now there's 18,000 milliamps on

00:00:36.130 --> 00:01:45.950 
right now there's 18,000 milliamps on
this<00:00:36.340> plane

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.430 

the<00:01:46.440> plane<00:01:46.650> is<00:01:46.830> basically<00:01:47.310> playing<00:01:47.730> itself

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:31.890 

carrying<00:01:52.440> all<00:01:52.530> those<00:01:52.680> batteries

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.750 

this<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.110> storm<00:02:33.470> chaser<00:02:33.710> from<00:02:34.250> crash<00:02:34.460> test

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
this is a storm chaser from crash test

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.020 
this is a storm chaser from crash test
hobby<00:02:35.170> six-foot<00:02:36.170> wingspan<00:02:36.520> just<00:02:37.520> finished<00:02:37.880> a

hobby six-foot wingspan just finished a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.410 
hobby six-foot wingspan just finished a
flight<00:02:38.330> with<00:02:38.720> carrying<00:02:39.820> 18,000<00:02:40.820> milliamps<00:02:41.330> of

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420
