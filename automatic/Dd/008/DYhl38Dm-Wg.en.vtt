but mix these two together and then in a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
but mix these two together and then in a
cup<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:36.989> half<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.590> cup<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.920> hot<00:00:38.129> water<00:00:38.190> and

cup I have half a cup of hot water and
in<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.420> I'm<00:00:39.600> dissolving<00:00:40.070> three-quarters<00:00:41.070> of

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
in that I'm dissolving three-quarters of

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.470

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
combines and starts to come together to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.290 
combines and starts to come together to
form<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.620> ball<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.280> never<00:00:56.640> cook<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:56.940> lard

the idea just roll it out into roughly a
circular<00:01:34.530> shape<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.820> roll<00:01:35.970> my

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
circular shape and I like to roll my

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.999 
circular shape and I like to roll my
really<00:01:36.659> really<00:01:36.930> thin<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.590> where<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.829> can

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
really really thin to where you can

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.830 
really really thin to where you can
almost<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.520> right<00:01:38.729> through<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.689> is

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
almost see right through it so this is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.660 
almost see right through it so this is
still<00:01:40.079> way<00:01:40.259> too<00:01:40.320> thick<00:01:40.710> for<00:01:40.740> me<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.130> roll<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.520> out

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
still way too thick for me I roll it out

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.179 
still way too thick for me I roll it out
about<00:01:42.240> twice<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.869> size<00:01:43.110> if<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
about twice this size if I can then I

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
about twice this size if I can then I
lower<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.729> heat<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.030> my<00:01:45.149> skillet<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> low

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
lower the heat on my skillet to a low

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.080 
lower the heat on my skillet to a low
setting<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.829> once<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> 30<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> way

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
setting and once the 30 is all the way

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
setting and once the 30 is all the way
rolled<00:01:48.360> out<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:49.079> pop<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.439> right<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.649> there<00:01:49.979> on

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
rolled out just pop it right on there on

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.069 
rolled out just pop it right on there on
a<00:01:50.130> dry<00:01:50.430> skillet<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.060> don't<00:01:51.240> need<00:01:51.390> any<00:01:51.600> oil<00:01:51.689> or

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
a dry skillet you don't need any oil or

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.870 
a dry skillet you don't need any oil or
anything<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:53.070> put<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.369> right<00:01:53.490> there<00:01:53.549> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
anything just put it right there and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.760 
anything just put it right there and
almost<00:01:54.299> instantly<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.140> should<00:01:55.350> start<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.740> see

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
almost instantly you should start to see

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.499 
almost instantly you should start to see
these<00:01:56.070> bubbles<00:01:56.520> forming<00:01:56.939> up<00:01:57.090> meaning<00:01:57.390> it's

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
these bubbles forming up meaning it's

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.139 
these bubbles forming up meaning it's
cooking<00:01:57.869> through<00:01:58.110> okay<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.649> cook<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> maybe<00:01:59.729> 30

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
cooking through okay I cook it maybe 30

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.209 
cooking through okay I cook it maybe 30
to<00:02:00.299> 45<00:02:00.810> seconds<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.350> each<00:02:01.380> side<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.920> may<00:02:02.070> need

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
to 45 seconds on each side you may need

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.830 
to 45 seconds on each side you may need
a<00:02:02.280> little<00:02:02.460> longer<00:02:02.729> depending<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.450> how<00:02:03.600> warm

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
a little longer depending on how warm

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.109 
a little longer depending on how warm
your<00:02:04.079> skillet<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.579> let<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.939> bubble

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
your skillet is but just let it bubble

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.600 
your skillet is but just let it bubble
up<00:02:06.390> most<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> bubbles<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:07.560> one<00:02:07.740> side<00:02:08.009> then

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
up most of the bubbles on one side then

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.339 
up most of the bubbles on one side then
I<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.879> take<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> spatula<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.780> flip<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.229> over

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
I just take a spatula and flip it over

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.330 
I just take a spatula and flip it over
and<00:02:10.619> cook<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.430> about<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.910> same

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
and cook it about the same

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.759 
and cook it about the same
time<00:02:12.670> on<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.330> second<00:02:13.660> side<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.260> let's<00:02:14.410> flip<00:02:14.560> it

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
time on the second side so let's flip it

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.380 
time on the second side so let's flip it
over<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:15.099> can<00:02:15.129> see<00:02:15.280> on<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.700> other<00:02:15.879> side<00:02:16.209> it

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
over you can see on the other side it

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.850 
over you can see on the other side it
starts<00:02:16.569> to<00:02:16.780> puff<00:02:16.989> up<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.379> you<00:02:17.440> get<00:02:17.590> some

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
starts to puff up so you get some

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.500 
starts to puff up so you get some
bubbles<00:02:18.190> on<00:02:18.280> each<00:02:18.430> side<00:02:18.700> it's<00:02:19.060> nice<00:02:19.300> and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
bubbles on each side it's nice and

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.180 
bubbles on each side it's nice and
golden-brown<00:02:19.840> in<00:02:20.140> some<00:02:20.349> spots<00:02:20.650> it's<00:02:20.920> cooked

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
golden-brown in some spots it's cooked

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.890 
golden-brown in some spots it's cooked
all<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.459> way<00:02:21.489> through<00:02:21.610> then<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.480> just<00:02:22.690> layer

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
all the way through then I just layer

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.390 
all the way through then I just layer
them<00:02:22.930> on<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.200> plate<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.530> keep<00:02:23.950> them<00:02:24.129> covered

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
them on a plate and keep them covered

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.070 
them on a plate and keep them covered
since<00:02:24.730> we're<00:02:24.910> cooking<00:02:25.030> them<00:02:25.300> one<00:02:25.450> at<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.629> time

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
since we're cooking them one at a time

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.720 
since we're cooking them one at a time
cover<00:02:26.500> them<00:02:26.680> up<00:02:26.739> with<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.920> kitchen<00:02:27.310> towel<00:02:27.489> to
