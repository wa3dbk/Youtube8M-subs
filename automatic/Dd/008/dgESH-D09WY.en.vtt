like we did in exercise number six so

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.840 
like we did in exercise number six so
our<00:00:27.850> first<00:00:28.029> chord<00:00:28.330> in<00:00:28.420> the<00:00:28.480> C<00:00:28.660> blues<00:00:28.930> c7<00:00:29.850> and

our first chord in the C blues c7 and
we're<00:00:30.970> gonna<00:00:31.090> start<00:00:31.420> by<00:00:31.529> embellishing<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.739> C

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
each note by half steps so our C triad

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:48.299 
each note by half steps so our C triad
is<00:00:38.699> or<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:39.789> root<00:00:39.969> third<00:00:40.329> and<00:00:40.539> fifth<00:00:40.659> of<00:00:41.289> c7<00:00:47.309> our

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.830 
figuring out and identifying all notes
to<00:03:31.980> try<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.580> approaching<00:03:33.030> them<00:03:33.180> by<00:03:33.420> half

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
to try and approaching them by half

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.530 
to try and approaching them by half
steps<00:03:34.200> now<00:03:35.190> I've<00:03:35.490> written<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:35.910> exercise<00:03:36.330> out

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
steps now I've written this exercise out

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.600 
steps now I've written this exercise out
on<00:03:36.630> all<00:03:36.780> 12<00:03:36.930> keys<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.770> can<00:03:37.950> either<00:03:38.069> do<00:03:38.310> one

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
on all 12 keys so you can either do one

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.210 
on all 12 keys so you can either do one
of<00:03:38.730> two<00:03:38.880> things<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.870> can<00:03:40.140> play<00:03:40.800> through<00:03:41.130> all

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
of two things you can play through all

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.040 
of two things you can play through all
of<00:03:41.310> them<00:03:41.520> in<00:03:41.610> 12<00:03:41.850> keys<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.390> then<00:03:42.720> move<00:03:42.900> on<00:03:43.020> to

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
of them in 12 keys and then move on to

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.410 
of them in 12 keys and then move on to
the<00:03:43.200> next<00:03:43.380> step<00:03:43.650> or<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:44.280> can<00:03:44.400> work<00:03:44.580> on<00:03:44.850> one<00:03:45.209> key

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
the next step or you can work on one key

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.110 
the next step or you can work on one key
Center<00:03:45.690> at<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.840> time<00:03:46.050> so<00:03:46.550> for<00:03:47.550> this<00:03:47.670> exercise

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
Center at a time so for this exercise

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.760 
Center at a time so for this exercise
I'll<00:03:48.360> show<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.600> just<00:03:48.690> working<00:03:49.410> through<00:03:49.530> one

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
I'll show you just working through one

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.260 
I'll show you just working through one
key<00:03:49.980> setting<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.370> time<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:50.819> we'll<00:03:50.970> play

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
key setting the time so we'll play

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.150 
key setting the time so we'll play
through<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.200> C<00:03:52.380> blues<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.860> then<00:03:52.950> we'll<00:03:53.070> do

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
through the C blues and then we'll do

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.130 
through the C blues and then we'll do
the<00:03:53.250> singing<00:03:53.519> exercises<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.420> then<00:03:54.900> we<00:03:55.050> would

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
the singing exercises and then we would

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.680 
the singing exercises and then we would
move<00:03:55.290> on<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.650> next<00:03:55.860> key<00:03:56.130> maybe<00:03:56.400> F<00:03:56.700> or<00:03:57.090> maybe

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
move on to the next key maybe F or maybe

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.479 
move on to the next key maybe F or maybe
G<00:03:58.019> if<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.410> wanted<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.709> play<00:03:58.860> around<00:03:59.310> the

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
G if you wanted to play around the

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.890 
G if you wanted to play around the
circle<00:03:59.790> of<00:03:59.850> fifths<00:03:59.910> instead<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.600> circle

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
circle of fifths instead of the circle

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.330 
circle of fifths instead of the circle
of<00:04:00.989> fourths<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.470> step<00:04:01.680> two<00:04:01.890> of<00:04:01.920> this<00:04:02.070> exercise

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
of fourths so step two of this exercise

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.100 
of fourths so step two of this exercise
would<00:04:02.730> be<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:03.120> sing<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.660> play<00:04:03.780> through<00:04:04.050> the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
would be to sing and play through the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:57.600 
would be to sing and play through the
progression

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.400 

now<00:04:58.610> as<00:04:58.910> I've<00:04:59.060> explained<00:04:59.510> in<00:04:59.780> other<00:04:59.930> exercises

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
now as I've explained in other exercises

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.650 
now as I've explained in other exercises
from<00:05:00.560> this<00:05:00.740> series<00:05:01.100> I<00:05:01.340> often<00:05:02.150> change<00:05:02.390> the

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
from this series I often change the

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.570 
from this series I often change the
octave<00:05:03.050> and<00:05:03.140> I'm<00:05:03.290> singing<00:05:03.590> him<00:05:03.800> so<00:05:04.340> that<00:05:04.430> it

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
octave and I'm singing him so that it

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.010 
octave and I'm singing him so that it
doesn't<00:05:04.850> match<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.180> exact<00:05:05.420> octave<00:05:05.840> in<00:05:05.960> a

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
doesn't match the exact octave in a

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.750 
doesn't match the exact octave in a
plane<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:06.590> now<00:05:07.220> I<00:05:07.250> don't<00:05:07.370> think<00:05:07.640> it's

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
plane and now I don't think it's

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.580 
plane and now I don't think it's
necessary<00:05:08.300> that<00:05:08.570> you<00:05:08.810> match<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.260> octave<00:05:09.560> that

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
necessary that you match the octave that

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.290 
necessary that you match the octave that
you're<00:05:09.800> playing<00:05:10.070> and<00:05:10.310> with<00:05:10.880> your<00:05:11.030> right<00:05:11.150> hand

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
you're playing and with your right hand

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.270 
you're playing and with your right hand
but<00:05:11.630> if<00:05:11.930> you<00:05:12.320> think<00:05:12.500> that<00:05:12.620> that'll<00:05:13.010> make<00:05:13.160> you

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
but if you think that that'll make you

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.530 
but if you think that that'll make you
more<00:05:13.310> comfortable<00:05:13.640> in<00:05:14.030> the<00:05:14.120> long<00:05:14.300> run<00:05:14.510> I

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
more comfortable in the long run I

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.510 
more comfortable in the long run I
suggest<00:05:15.020> that<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.260> do<00:05:15.410> that<00:05:15.620> so<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.340> third

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
suggest that you do that so the third

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.190 
suggest that you do that so the third
step<00:05:16.550> is<00:05:16.940> to<00:05:17.060> sing<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.510> ghost<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.870> notes<00:05:18.050> with

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
step is to sing and ghost the notes with

00:05:18.200 --> 00:06:11.800 
step is to sing and ghost the notes with
your<00:05:18.290> right<00:05:18.440> hand

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:21.540
