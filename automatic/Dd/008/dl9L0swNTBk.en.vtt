00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.320
 good afternoon, friends of friends 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.199
 manises and we are here to make us 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.060
 another new recommendation from another of the 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.860
 products that we are getting to know in this 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.970
 case the product that can not miss the 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.220
 for 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.410
 when the children arrive at 6 months 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.470
 that lead to start eating solids 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.449
 good 6 5 months each father gives him when 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.629
 consider your little ones I have started 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.489
 just before 6 months there is no need to go 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.610
 and anticipate a lot because then this 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.980
 little hands are not yet prepared and good 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.699
 about those who prefer to wait and about 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.940
 insurance and being able to start feeding 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.640
 already in serious plan once the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.739
 six months is the world's brave otter 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.799
 is another more advanced cooking voice of the 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.890
 market with more functions and also with 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.380
 lifetime guarantee that that today 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.780
 does not give them any brand for any 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.850
 product no longer just children's products 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.250
 but products for the home or 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.810
 electronic, whatever you always know 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.030
 who have two years of warranty as 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.619
 general norm, since this one does not have 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.100
 guarantee by regulated this robot of 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:31.490
 kitchen I met him when I gave birth to my 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.480
 daughter or just before but for a few things or 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.460
 by others than if the 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.010
 and my family told me it was better 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.230
 make it home that if once it's back 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.830
 in the end he never gets to buy it and 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.550
 now for my son 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.430
 I have not paid attention to what they told me and 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.740
 I 've really bought it I used it and 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.180
 I am totally delighted and I 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.280
 I regret not having done it before 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.770
 because now time saves me work 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.320
 saves energy expenditure that is to say makes me 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.180
 save and set apart thanks to him he 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.430
 they retain all the nutrients and all 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.050
 the vitamins things that by making them from 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.460
 traditional way is to say that 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.260
 doing it because the truth is that it 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.080
 they lose a lot and now we go with the 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.760
 functions of the note and baby that as I have 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.130
 commented from today a brand 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.840
 French that also has a lot of 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.959
 products to achieve the welfare of 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.209
 the little ones or that make our lives easier 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.530
 to parents because like this robot 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.470
 kitchen for example that has so many 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.190
 functions that saves us having several 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.650
 appliances for really a short 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.080
 length of time a few months stabilizes 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.510
 As I already told you, it heats up 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.380
 three baby bottles heated up to three 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.840
 little dots has the option of 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.200
 according to the temperature of what we are going to 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.400
 heat either pot and it's the baby bottle 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.770
 put then if it comes from snow and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.690
 room temperature so that it 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.490
 hot properly because we know 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.160
 that if something is cold, it takes longer 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.230
 warm up then is nutri baby well 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.090
 what he has is that he knows if it's cold 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.980
 this quality or this room temperature 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.819
 then depending on that then what 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.079
 heats properly 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.670
 thaw also in a way 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.519
 progressive so that all are maintained 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.290
 the nutrients costs to steam and is a 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.700
 kitchen robot that has it all and with 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.620
 which will save us a lot too 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.019
 space because it's going to save us having 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.670
 a sterilizer will save us the 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.840
 have to stain the blender a 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.859
 container to be able to beat the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.870
 another food to cook another one for 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.090
 heat the bottle or thaw it 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.799
 using the microwave to me is going to 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.780
 limit that you do not know that you have slings and 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.639
 it is better not to use it for 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.030
 small good the truth is that it's the 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:47.960
 benefits for the kitchen robot and it's 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.790
 a product that since I've known 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.050
 I recommend it to everyone we go to 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.760
 everyone who knows me can not be 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.340
 much better than I thought and no longer 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.440
 Let's talk about taste has nothing to do 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.210
 what I did before I want to know 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.100
 what it also lost the flavor 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.630
 they lost the nutrients now that 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.760
 retains all the flavor all 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.010
 nutrients and is really super human 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.050
 that I advise you to have me 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.570
 delighted its use is super simple and 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.620
 super easy and as soon as you drive it a 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.600
 little you are going to make a very good 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.380
 also for example what is the jara 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.780
 comes with 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.060
 the different measures for example if 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.920
 let's bake I feel in the measurements and 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.790
 let's sterilize or warm up and heron 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.150
 is also also have the option of 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:39.290
 indicate if we spend 150 milliliters 90 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.440
 180 2 210 that is to say it adapts to the 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.080
 needs of each of each function by 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.460
 example if we are going to heat 150 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.910
 milliliters is not the same as if we are going to 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.710
 heating 240 evidently takes longer in 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.870
 heat 240 so you have to 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.000
 adjust it is always why not 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.630
 All the hot bottles are 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.790
 equally effective or do not leave our 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.610
 hot enough taste or what 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.970
 they heat up too much this is not suitable 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.160
 the exact amount you have and that we have 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.830
 thrown in the bottle or that has the 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.210
 potito depending on the type of food 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.760
 that we are going to steam cook 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.700
 we put more or less minutes in addition 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.500
 with the indications of the type of 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.450
 food in duration that 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.860
 he needs every food to cook 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:31.289
 steamed properly you stay 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:36.240
 I have done in its point one has to be 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:38.220
 then you have what are two 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.360
 two containers for steam cooking 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:44.360
 that we can put together we can put 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.360
 separated 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.030
 In addition, these containers can be removed 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.949
 what is the basis for which we are going to 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.770
 heat bottles that are great 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:58.050
 size or we're going to thaw or we're going to 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.090
 sterilize baby bottles because of these 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.800
 they are with a lot of capacity that are more 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.630
 high so that they lose 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.210
 perfectly when we know the steam 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.460
 is recent here, because there is all the 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.569
 juice with which in case what 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.569
 we would like a little more 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.680
 more liquid then we would add the juice 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.660
 that has nothing else also all the 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:23.580
 spatula nutrients with which we can 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:25.200
 then move the total and good food 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.500
 then I have commented before on the 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.840
 container that drops the juice so as not to 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.270
 burn us at home that want 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.360
 incorporate them we could simply the 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:39.390
 spatula that makes like a hook 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:42.450
 so that we do not have to burn and so 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:46.320
 we would add the broth and feel that 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:48.300
 every meal we make is delicious with 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.180
 which the crickets are going to him is going to 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.950
 love one less to mine and I tell ya 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.630
 that you like a lot more what I do 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.540
 the nourished and that those who are buying 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.820
 but much more can be eaten then 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.920
 better double or triple than what 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.450
 eat with a little bit of normal buying 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.920
 I hope you liked it though 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.180
 complete the food processor for 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.850
 any doubt or anything that 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.980
 you need me here and then nothing 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:14.960
 thank you very much for watching us and until the 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.960
 next recommendation a hug
