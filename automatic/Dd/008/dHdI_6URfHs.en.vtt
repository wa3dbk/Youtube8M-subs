6 is what's the oldest book you own and
I<00:02:06.030> am<00:02:06.210> pretty<00:02:06.630> sure<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.320> my<00:02:07.469> edition<00:02:08.069> of

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
I am pretty sure it is my edition of

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.419 
I am pretty sure it is my edition of
Little<00:02:08.929> Women<00:02:08.960> this<00:02:09.740> was<00:02:09.950> published<00:02:10.130> when

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
Little Women this was published when

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.060 
Little Women this was published when
books<00:02:10.700> didn't<00:02:11.030> usually<00:02:11.210> include<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.260> date<00:02:12.590> in

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
books didn't usually include a date in

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
books didn't usually include a date in
the<00:02:13.340> fright<00:02:13.610> but<00:02:14.570> there<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.320> hand<00:02:15.710> written

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
the fright but there is a hand written

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.770 
the fright but there is a hand written
message<00:02:17.090> right<00:02:17.660> here<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.830> date<00:02:19.010> on<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.220> is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
message right here and the date on it is

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.490 
message right here and the date on it is
1897<00:02:20.800> so<00:02:21.800> I'm<00:02:22.490> pretty<00:02:23.300> sure<00:02:23.660> this<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:24.110> my

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
1897 so I'm pretty sure this is my

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.590 
1897 so I'm pretty sure this is my
oldest<00:02:24.950> book<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:25.850> think<00:02:26.090> my<00:02:26.240> runners-up
