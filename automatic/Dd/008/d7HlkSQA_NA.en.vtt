00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.029
 is what the wolf says we come to the question 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.610
 number three who are sad 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:40.850
 see advertised consider qer 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:46.040
 are simple propositions that can be 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:50.210
 judged to be true g with false 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:56.290
 with respect to the logical operations of 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:01:00.289
 denial of the injunction and injunction 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:07.100
 implication ju who inject subsequent 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:10.539
 I'm not even three feets or so. 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.490
 what top level 2011 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:18.200
 went right and wrong 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:25.869
 item says kolm of table rows 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:28.569
 truth of the proposition cip that then r 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:39.220
 less than 6 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:39.220
 right or wrong let's function solution 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:56.450
 we know that the number of rows in the table 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:02:00.440
 truth is equal to 2 and brought him the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:04.819
 them the truth table name is equal to 2 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.929
 high n today chiellini is the number of 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:12.140
 simple propositions on is the number of 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.099
 simple propositions that make up this 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.090
 position with the proposal his name and 12h 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.670
 n 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:27.140
 in our case not know how long we 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:30.860
 we have the simple proposition pqer 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:35.250
 so we have three 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:42.330
 simple transpositions soon 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:46.910
 lines and is equal to 2 high there that is 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:55.860
 equal to the high index is 32 cube 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:58.380
 go 2 times 2002 and twice twice 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:04.310
 two equals 8 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.310
 therefore we have broad lines 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:14.400
 the table is true of this proposition 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:17.730
 composed will have 8 lines 8 yen week 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.470
 stated that the number of lines in 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.950
 less than 6 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:28.349
 no no no number of lines equal to 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.090
 eight is greater than 6 and not that lower 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.510
 as one item said 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:42.900
 therefore question number 3 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:47.160
 is wrong is wrong is wrong is superior 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:56.130
 to 6 and not less than six 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:58.470
 the wrong answer is wrong a way 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:03.600
 interesting that the student should know 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.040
 for the cesp test good luck for 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.160
 you 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.160
 and until the next social issue
