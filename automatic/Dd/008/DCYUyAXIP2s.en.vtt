00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.420
 I'll teach here how to install the tube 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:16.510
 sandy is very simple I'm using here one 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.250
 PVC pipe the thickness more or less than 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.650
 It has to be a car escape to 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:27.750
 discard the mouth 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:31.510
 she must be at least 1 5 centimeter 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.090
 can fit exactly what you need to 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.940
 be done just pick up a tube only when 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.940
 arrive to loosen up the rifles ak 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:52.569
 to fit this one into the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:54.850
 discharge tighten the screw out 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:56.729
 close also tighten the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.760
 inside 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:06.040
 soon installed 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:13.780
 so remembering that this is a 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:15.969
 simulator and depends on the moment it depends 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:23.609
 of engine status 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:26.859
 generally are promoters of 1.6 2.0 and 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:29.680
 also the discharge can not be that 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:33.899
 stolen product is not suitable for 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:43.469
 bend at least straight 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:46.469
 hope here is around us 11 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.469
 centimeters 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.219
 so she can not be cowards fire 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.689
 stolen will not fit into the download 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:58.990
 straight with the approximate five-mouth 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.319
 centimeters and straight 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.530
 so it is only fitting to tighten the 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.530
 screw 

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:13.959
 install make the test be happy 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.959
 the killer
