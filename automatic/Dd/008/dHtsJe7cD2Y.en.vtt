recently<00:00:21.460> I<00:00:21.520> revisited<00:00:22.300> a<00:00:22.450> particular

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
recently I revisited a particular

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.330 
recently I revisited a particular
palette<00:00:23.230> that's<00:00:23.320> got<00:00:23.470> me<00:00:23.590> thinking<00:00:23.920> it's

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
palette that's got me thinking it's

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.530 
palette that's got me thinking it's
called<00:00:24.580> the<00:00:24.670> piledriver<00:00:25.090> and<00:00:25.240> comes<00:00:25.480> from

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
called the piledriver and comes from

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.410 
called the piledriver and comes from

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
the manufacturer claims these pallets

the manufacturer claims these pallets
offer<00:00:29.890> and<00:00:30.220> rivaled<00:00:30.579> levels<00:00:30.849> of<00:00:30.939> efficiency

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
question is does it really deliver

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.520 
question is does it really deliver
superior<00:00:37.149> efficiency<00:00:37.960> downrange<00:00:38.380> for
