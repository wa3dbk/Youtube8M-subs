valance all underneath it and then I

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.760 
valance all underneath it and then I
sanded<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.579> out<00:00:41.730> feathered<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> out<00:00:42.510> saw<00:00:42.960> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
this under here right like that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.850 
this under here right like that
obviously<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.890> being<00:01:14.130> fed<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> dog<00:01:15.860> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
obviously all being fed the dog the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
obviously all being fed the dog the
drips<00:01:17.220> anyway<00:01:19.369> there<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.430> go<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.869> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
drips anyway there you go so this is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.810 
drips anyway there you go so this is
black<00:01:22.200> primer<00:01:23.869> which<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.650> it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
black primer which is on it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.720 
black primer which is on it
this<00:01:27.660> is<00:01:27.870> because<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.800> planet<00:01:28.920> League<00:01:29.310> green

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
this is because the planet League green

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.530 
this is because the planet League green
isn't<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.290> good<00:01:31.290> color<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.620> covering<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.540> I

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
isn't a good color for covering and I

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.700 
isn't a good color for covering and I
didn't<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> light<00:01:34.380> color

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
didn't want to have a light color

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.830 
didn't want to have a light color
underneath<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.520> simply<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:36.330> it<00:01:36.690> would

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
underneath just simply because it would

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.340 
underneath just simply because it would
leach<00:01:37.080> through<00:01:38.630> lighten<00:01:39.630> off<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.990> green

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
leach through lighten off the green

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.520 
leach through lighten off the green
because<00:01:40.620> going<00:01:40.890> into<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.550> gray<00:01:42.530> British

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
because going into that gray British

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.230 
because going into that gray British
racing<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:44.190> green<00:01:44.550> Jaguar<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.820> there<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.030> go

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
racing that green Jaguar so there you go

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.930 
racing that green Jaguar so there you go
so<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.740> next<00:01:49.950> thing<00:01:50.190> I<00:01:50.280> should<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.580> doing<00:01:50.670> on

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
so the next thing I should be doing on

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.270 
so the next thing I should be doing on
it<00:01:51.229> because<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.440> moment<00:01:53.010> it's<00:01:53.190> just

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
it because of this moment it's just

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
it because of this moment it's just
going<00:01:53.550> to<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:54.830> left<00:01:55.830> as<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.490> I've<00:01:56.970> got<00:01:57.150> all

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
going to be left as it is I've got all

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.230 
going to be left as it is I've got all
the<00:01:57.570> wiring<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.410> read<00:01:58.590> redo<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.400> it<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.910> do

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the wiring to read redo on it and I do

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.999 
the wiring to read redo on it and I do
have<00:02:00.420> its<00:02:00.570> original<00:02:00.720> eye<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:01.770> I

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
have its original eye on this but I

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.240 
have its original eye on this but I
don't<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.150> bullet<00:02:03.570> connectors<00:02:04.250> of

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
don't like the bullet connectors of

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.490 
don't like the bullet connectors of
which<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.759> constant<00:02:06.750> nightmare<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.350> old

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
which it on constant nightmare for old

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.199 
which it on constant nightmare for old
cars<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.009> those<00:02:10.070> forces<00:02:11.070> it's<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.550> wiring<00:02:12.060> and

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
cars so those forces it's all wiring and

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.350 
cars so those forces it's all wiring and
it's<00:02:12.390> looking<00:02:12.600> well<00:02:13.110> within<00:02:13.410> its<00:02:13.620> edge<00:02:14.360> I'm

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
it's looking well within its edge I'm

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.560 
it's looking well within its edge I'm
plus<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.720> ended<00:02:15.930> up<00:02:16.050> putting<00:02:16.260> I've<00:02:16.530> got<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.709> a

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
plus it ended up putting I've got a a

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.390 
plus it ended up putting I've got a a
harness<00:02:18.570> engine<00:02:19.290> anise<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.250> that

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
harness engine anise for that so that

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.910 
harness engine anise for that so that
needs<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:20.730> cutting<00:02:21.530> it's<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.680> too<00:02:22.800> much

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
needs to be cutting it's just too much

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.170 
needs to be cutting it's just too much
better<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.370> I'm<00:02:23.459> going<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.640> build<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.910> new<00:02:24.030> one

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
better so I'm going to build a new one

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.780 
better so I'm going to build a new one
it's<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:25.410> engine<00:02:25.950> anise<00:02:26.220> which<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.520> have<00:02:26.640> that

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
it's the engine anise which I have that

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.970 
it's the engine anise which I have that
I'll<00:02:26.910> cut<00:02:27.180> into<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.790> am<00:02:29.790> putting<00:02:30.239> there<00:02:30.510> a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
I'll cut into it and am putting there a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.570 
I'll cut into it and am putting there a
fuse<00:02:31.980> box<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.550> from<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.880> Jaguar<00:02:33.620> s-type<00:02:34.620> freely

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
fuse box in from a Jaguar s-type freely

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.670 
fuse box in from a Jaguar s-type freely
a<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:36.180> success<00:02:36.600> factor<00:02:37.230> under<00:02:37.950> bonnet<00:02:39.680> fuse

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
a be success factor under bonnet fuse

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.680 
a be success factor under bonnet fuse
box<00:02:40.980> as<00:02:41.280> number<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.060> relays<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.690> different

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
box as number of relays in and different

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.729 
box as number of relays in and different
types<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.290> fuels<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.130> different<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:48.739> ratings

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
types of fuels is different to ratings

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.160 
types of fuels is different to ratings
so<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.940> should<00:02:51.150> be<00:02:51.239> more<00:02:51.600> than<00:02:51.780> well<00:02:51.930> enough

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
so that should be more than well enough

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.759 
so that should be more than well enough
because<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.440> cab<00:02:52.620> original<00:02:52.950> only<00:02:53.160> had<00:02:53.250> two

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
because the cab original only had two

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.870 
because the cab original only had two
fuses<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:55.980> under<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.280> bonnet<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.730> that

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
fuses in it under the bonnet and that

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.060 
fuses in it under the bonnet and that
obviously<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.450> not<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.690> good<00:02:58.140> none<00:02:58.410> I'm<00:02:58.890> not

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
obviously is not a good none I'm not

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.830 
obviously is not a good none I'm not
putting<00:02:59.250> electric<00:02:59.700> windows<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.239> or<00:03:00.480> anything

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
putting electric windows in or anything

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.080 
putting electric windows in or anything
stupid<00:03:01.080> like<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.799> it<00:03:02.489> is<00:03:02.700> going<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:02.970> be

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
stupid like that it is going to be

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.509 
stupid like that it is going to be
really<00:03:03.390> quite<00:03:03.600> basic<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.950> normal<00:03:05.310> running

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
really quite basic the normal running

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.490 
really quite basic the normal running
electrical<00:03:06.150> running<00:03:06.510> system<00:03:06.690> shall<00:03:07.110> be<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.380> it

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
electrical running system shall be in it

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.990 
electrical running system shall be in it
and<00:03:08.600> I'm<00:03:09.600> putting<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.519> half-decent<00:03:11.519> steady

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
and I'm putting it a half-decent steady

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.420 
and I'm putting it a half-decent steady
or<00:03:12.180> system<00:03:12.600> in<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.810> nothing<00:03:13.470> too<00:03:13.830> silly<00:03:14.130> it's

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
or system in it nothing too silly it's

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.650 
or system in it nothing too silly it's
not<00:03:14.549> going<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.760> be<00:03:14.850> radical<00:03:15.269> it's<00:03:15.450> not<00:03:15.570> as

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
not going to be radical it's not as

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.680

that's to go in a few little bits of

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.260 
that's to go in a few little bits of

while some messing around fitting it all
but<00:03:54.390> there<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.600> go<00:03:54.720> that's<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.500> fast

that's<00:03:58.380> quite<00:03:58.620> good<00:03:58.650> SATs<00:03:58.980> in<00:03:59.130> what<00:03:59.280> don't<00:03:59.459> it

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
that's quite good SATs in what don't it

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.660 
that's quite good SATs in what don't it
