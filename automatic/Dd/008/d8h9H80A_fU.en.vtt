connect it towards the bottom there the
blu-ray<00:04:45.430> drive<00:04:45.669> sensor<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.930> hopefully

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
blu-ray drive sensor and hopefully

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.140 
blu-ray drive sensor and hopefully
everything<00:04:47.620> works<00:04:47.740> out<00:04:47.950> well<00:04:48.220> so<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.490> don't
