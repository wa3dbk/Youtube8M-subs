00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.060
 congestion opened in 1700 second year 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.340
 German astronomer a year at that 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.340
 when he was looking for a comet 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.449
 that is what 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.630
 yesterday the ministry methyl this is a cluster 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.260
 like a misty speck 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
 not allowing it stars in 1764 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.850
 So 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.820
 for the night of May 23-24 1706 the fourth year I 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.720
 discovered a beautiful hazy constellation 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.320
 Ophiuchus There is not one star in it 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.470
 large and well visible 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.020
 responsibility even with a conventional telescope 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.090
 in 1 pound 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.219
 in 1795 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.089
 william herschel counted it up 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.660
 two hundred individual stars 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.710
 what happened then the reflector i watched 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.460
 team star 35 sighed zenith 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.900
 open 170 1764 universities turned out that this 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.140
 beautiful clusters I counted about 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.159
 two hundred inhabitants 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.070
 in the center it is so tight that 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 impossible to divide into stars 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.470
 mts can be seen with binoculars or a telescope 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.470
 near a star to change it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.470
 cluster has reached 165 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.070
 light years is considered one of 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
 the biggest and oldest milky way 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.950
 over a hundred thousand stars which are on 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.400
 about 24 and a half thousand away 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.730
 light years away from us 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.270
 that five of these stars are considered a change 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.010
 and 90 of them are buried 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.030
 such stars on which astronomers 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.650
 can determine the distance from these 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.650
 of companies 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.330
 was discovered here 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.800
 dwarf new system of two stars 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.580
 one of which is material stages with 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.070
 another periodically flare up raising 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.480
 brightness 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.480
 network hit several times 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.089
 he 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.599
 f 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:33.209
 about 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.669
 he 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.029
