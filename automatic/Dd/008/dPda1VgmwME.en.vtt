thought it would be a good idea to do

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420 
thought it would be a good idea to do
that<00:01:30.329> because<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.140> kind<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> make<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
that because I kind of want to make it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.910 
that because I kind of want to make it
funny<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.939> not<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:33.720> pull<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> P<00:01:34.170> out<00:01:34.439> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
funny and not really pull the P out of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.800 
funny and not really pull the P out of
all<00:01:35.220> those<00:01:35.369> morning<00:01:35.670> routines<00:01:36.000> because<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.570> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
all those morning routines because as I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.780

but when eventually I do get up this is

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.740 
but when eventually I do get up this is
where<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.430> second<00:02:44.820> expectation<00:02:45.600> starts<00:02:47.750> now

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
where the second expectation starts now

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.420 
where the second expectation starts now
I<00:02:48.780> don't<00:02:48.990> know<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.410> anyone<00:02:49.740> else's<00:02:50.040> dogs<00:02:50.250> are

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
like this but my dogs expect the best

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.640 
like this but my dogs expect the best
food<00:02:53.010> for<00:02:53.310> breakfast<00:02:53.700> but<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:55.200> never

food for breakfast but that never

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.220 
food for breakfast but that never
happens<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.090> what<00:02:57.270> usually<00:02:57.510> does

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
happens and this is what usually does

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.170 
happens and this is what usually does
now<00:02:58.680> it's<00:02:58.860> sad<00:02:59.070> but<00:02:59.250> their<00:02:59.400> pizza<00:02:59.760> dream<00:03:00.000> is

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
replaced too so this next expectation is

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.230 
replaced too so this next expectation is
one<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.440> my<00:03:10.590> expectations<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.580> not<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.000> dogs
