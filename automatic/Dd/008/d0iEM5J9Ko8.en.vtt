there is a bit of a technique to back
combing<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.140> learnt<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.500> years<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
combing and I learnt this years and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.660 
combing and I learnt this years and
years<00:00:50.190> ago<00:00:50.399> from<00:00:51.620> from<00:00:52.620> our<00:00:52.739> hairstyles<00:00:53.309> used

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
years ago from from our hairstyles used

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.069 
years ago from from our hairstyles used
to<00:00:53.730> do<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:53.879> those<00:00:54.000> fabulous<00:00:54.420> sixties

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
bouffant sand and what have you and the

bouffant sand and what have you and the
way<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> do<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.920> actually<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.340> start<00:00:59.850> at<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
way to do it is actually to start at the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.860 
way to do it is actually to start at the
root<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.960> work<00:01:01.739> back<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.300> shaft<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
root and work back up the shaft of the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.740 
root and work back up the shaft of the
hair<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:05.430> you're<00:01:05.519> teasing<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
hair so but when you're teasing if you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.560 
hair so but when you're teasing if you
just<00:01:06.930> basically<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.270> basically<00:01:09.270> if

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
just basically if you basically if

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.469 
just basically if you basically if
you're<00:01:09.750> teasing<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.560> start<00:01:10.890> back<00:01:11.130> here

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
you're teasing and you start back here

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.969 
you're teasing and you start back here
you're<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> get<00:01:13.049> you're<00:01:13.710> not<00:01:13.799> going

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
you're not going to get you're not going

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.800 
you're not going to get you're not going
to<00:01:14.040> get<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.280> lift<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.210> roots<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.659> that's

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
to get the lift on the roots and that's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.179 
to get the lift on the roots and that's
just<00:01:16.049> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> fall<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:16.500> straightaway

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
just going to fall out straightaway

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.330 
just going to fall out straightaway
ultimately<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:18.900> want<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.340> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
ultimately what we really want is the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130 
ultimately what we really want is the
lift<00:01:20.580> right<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> row<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.509> start<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
lift right on the row to start at the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.780 
lift right on the row to start at the
roots<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.100> volume<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.490> there<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
roots you get that volume in there and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.060 
roots you get that volume in there and
then<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:23.939> loosely<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.750> kind

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.660 

I'm<00:01:32.400> slightly<00:01:32.760> brush

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.190 

fantastic<00:01:37.670> texture<00:01:38.000> from<00:01:38.210> tying<00:01:38.659> at<00:01:38.780> before

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
fantastic texture from tying at before

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.990 
fantastic texture from tying at before
so<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.530> still<00:01:39.860> got<00:01:39.950> all<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.280> lift<00:01:40.700> on<00:01:40.880> the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
so I still got all that lift on the

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.780 
so I still got all that lift on the
roots<00:01:41.920> what<00:01:42.920> I'm<00:01:43.070> just<00:01:43.250> doing<00:01:43.400> it's<00:01:43.940> just

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.820 

take<00:01:48.910> that<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.600> end<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:53.110> how<00:01:53.260> easily<00:01:53.500> that

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
take that to the end see how easily that

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.450 
take that to the end see how easily that
just<00:01:54.070> rushes<00:01:54.490> out<00:01:54.820> like<00:01:55.120> that<00:01:55.300> because<00:01:56.460> that's

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
just rushes out like that because that's

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.670 
just rushes out like that because that's
really<00:01:57.670> important<00:01:58.150> it's<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.330> technique<00:01:58.870> that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
really important it's the technique that

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.200 
really important it's the technique that
you<00:01:59.800> back<00:02:00.100> home<00:02:00.460> it<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:01.390> very<00:02:01.690> important<00:02:03.210> it's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
you back home it is very important it's

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.430 
you back home it is very important it's
very<00:02:04.330> important<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.810> getting<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.140> lift<00:02:05.320> on

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
very important to getting the lift on

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.090 
very important to getting the lift on
the<00:02:05.530> roof

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
the roof

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.370 
the roof
very<00:02:06.910> important<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.450> styling<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.140> then<00:02:08.259> at

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
very important to styling and then at

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.960 
very important to styling and then at
the<00:02:08.470> end<00:02:08.500> it's<00:02:08.860> also<00:02:08.979> very<00:02:09.250> important<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.910> way

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
the end it's also very important the way
