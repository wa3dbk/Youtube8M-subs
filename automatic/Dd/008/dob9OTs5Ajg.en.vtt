 hi friends from youtube I am your friend 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.450
 server to see that you fast today 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.450
 bringing this video where we are going to 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.240
 learn how to increase ram memory 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.600
 without having to put more cards to 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.210
 our computer or our cpu 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.310
 this this way to increase memory 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.560
 ram is allowed by our systems 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.150
 operative that is well signed by 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.670
 microsoft 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.220
 this this way of increasing memory 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.950
 ram is legal 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.450
 but by increasing the memory to rne I want 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:41.180
 clarify that if we put bigger what 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.050
 have our pc do not reason they will discount 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.600
 our local record has seen that then 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.390
 so they know that they will be diminished or 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.829
 it will be put as use the amount of rne 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.350
 that we add to 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.600
 to our our pressure 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.800
 computer can I start to increase 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.800
 what are we going to start on my pc 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.790
 will open this window and from here we 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.730
 come on advanced options 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.400
 we give it in configuration 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.100
 we're going to advanced options we 're going 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.070
 to change well we also 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.040
 come here marked here we put 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.740
 Custom size us here 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.580
 we can put bigger what 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.610
 we have recommend that we put 2000 and 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.040
 here down maximum 3000 forgiveness if you want 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.100
 have more than 4 gigas to capon four thousand 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.530
 to almost six thousand or the amount of ram a 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.530
 Once you give it to him to establish in 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.540
 accept to accept accept and you 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.900
 will ask me to restart the computer to me not me 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.120
 he asked because I did not make any changes 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.210
 how can you believe that this is true 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.930
 good that you want to teach that I already 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.440
 I made here I know I have 384 megs of ram 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.660
 but here in the studio performance are 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.030
 255 and you do nothing that I can use 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.679
 press as two gigs 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.140
 in 3 to 2 to 3 gigas and good you 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.640
 reboots that equipment and it will already be done 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.040
 which are the ram memory changes 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.010
 good until then I hope this video 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.010
 have already served them or if they are already
