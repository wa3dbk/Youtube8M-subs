spare I'm going to go back to that for a

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.840 
spare I'm going to go back to that for a
while<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.860> take<00:03:43.700> off<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.980> trim<00:03:45.980> rings<00:03:46.220> that's

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
while and take off the trim rings that's

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.370 
while and take off the trim rings that's
the<00:03:46.970> only<00:03:47.120> reason<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.480> have<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.810> trim<00:03:48.019> rings<00:03:48.230> on

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
the only reason I have the trim rings on

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.120 
the only reason I have the trim rings on
there<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.890> because<00:03:49.550> one<00:03:49.790> of<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:49.910> rims<00:03:50.150> are

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
there is because one of the rims are

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.759 
there is because one of the rims are
6465<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:52.660> all<00:03:53.660> four<00:03:54.050> rims<00:03:54.230> are<00:03:54.500> actually

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
6465 and all four rims are actually

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.570 
6465 and all four rims are actually
painted<00:03:55.720> pearl<00:03:56.720> white<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:58.160> they<00:03:58.310> have<00:03:58.430> been

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
painted pearl white so they have been

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.050 
painted pearl white so they have been
painted<00:03:58.910> at<00:03:59.030> one<00:03:59.150> time<00:04:00.310> your<00:04:01.310> roof<00:04:01.489> stuff<00:04:01.820> like
