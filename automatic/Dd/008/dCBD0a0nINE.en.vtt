00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 and I'm going to show you something that seems to me 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.179
 me scary but it is a fact of the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.019
 reality because because it is sold in the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.589
 country 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.259
 as a result of the assaults of thefts of 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.240
 the assaults actually occurring 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:21.579
 fundamentally at the traffic lights that 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.860
 one is standing at a traffic light comes 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.660
 someone from outside hits you the glass you 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.730
 it breaks it and it takes out some of the things 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.770
 that you have inside or you get a watch or 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.680
 a chain abuses you or even you can 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.440
 get off and steal the car 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.160
 is being marketed in the country 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.730
 form of self-defense that seems to me 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:47.090
 tremendous but tremendous and it sells 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.860
 free way one connects with a 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.030
 little bit of skill you can connect 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.580
 self in the vehicle itself is a 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.940
 device that is handled from inside 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.460
 of the car and that when you see that a 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.430
 person approaches or believes there is a 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.270
 suspect or that person tries to attack 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.409
 one by pressing a button generates two 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.830
 flamethrower 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.510
 and I'm going to show you the image 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.970
 look at that is this is that it started 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.000
 be done in principle as a 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.880
 ornamentation for vehicles in the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.640
 escape then the only sound did not put 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.200
 nor did it catch fire in the escape 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.210
 those flames were advancing but it was like a 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:38.210
 ornamentation and they found him around 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.450
 to adopt it under the doors and 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.430
 this before any inconvenience seems 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.650
 be that with the gas that comes out of the exhaust 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.580
 it does not catch fire I do not know the truth 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.310
 I have not technically read the mechanism 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.380
 by pressing a button these flames come out 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.490
 towards the sides a motorcycle that 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.490
 approach and kill him burns 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.090
 clear because they are fire 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.110
 escape 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.790
 some security and I do not know what things 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.459
 because they usually put them in 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.470
 the exhaust back to generate it 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.659
 what do I know about wave looks at flames strips in 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.069
 the escape that I to do the check 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:36.920
 but it turns out that this one is looking for him is not 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.409
 this system mir in those two go 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.110
 from a spark plug is a spark plug that pulls the 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.319
 spark and I do not know the truth because the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:50.060
 mechanism already have distanced 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:52.790
 exactly the silencer and they have 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.299
 placed for the sides under each 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.129
 Body body of each door must 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.959
 be a system that works with the 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.040
 electricity of the vehicle the truth that 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.569
 I do not know but that has flame flame flame 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.430
 clear the spark plug when I'm 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.310
 for the spark plug the gas surely 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.459
 they will call 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.090
 a brief thing but that only in 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.090
 South Africa 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:23.250
 that device is already purchased 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.170
 here you buy for the escape but what 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.290
 adapt and put them under the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.290
 doors 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.490
 is already here in some of the places 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.650
 who complained because they had to pay 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.960
 taxes and should control a 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.420
 little bit more what they sell this already 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.900
 Find for sale doubly 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.900
 dangerous 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.780
 in the car 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:05.110
 with a tremendous fright you think you're going to 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:07.720
 steal and most seriously with a madness a 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.280
 madness there are other devices telling me 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.890
 that also make them here that are 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.160
 landlords who put electricity to the 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.079
 doors but does nothing because of the 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.470
 vehicle battery you a kick 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:25.980
 It scares you and they pass you some little kick 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.129
 nothing happens but this is tremendous 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.179
 It is very serious and the truth 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.179
 It is very very dangerous
