the<00:02:10.550> map<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:11.180> spelled<00:02:11.750> place<00:02:11.989> like<00:02:12.230> ladders

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
the map you spelled place like ladders

the map you spelled place like ladders
and<00:02:13.640> torches<00:02:14.570> against<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.650> know<00:02:15.710> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860

but anyway this one what you do is you
tower<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:28.060> platform<00:02:29.110> besides<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.260> can<00:02:30.470> which

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
tower and platform besides you can which

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.260 
tower and platform besides you can which
I<00:02:30.860> kind<00:02:31.070> of<00:02:31.130> fail<00:02:31.310> at<00:02:31.520> it's<00:02:31.820> actually<00:02:31.910> quite

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
I kind of fail at it's actually quite

I kind of fail at it's actually quite
hard<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.840> do<00:02:33.580> in<00:02:34.580> Pocket<00:02:35.090> Edition<00:02:35.150> on<00:02:35.780> my<00:02:36.500> ipod

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
hard to do in Pocket Edition on my ipod

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.870 
hard to do in Pocket Edition on my ipod
with<00:02:37.790> my<00:02:37.940> fingers<00:02:38.300> on<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:39.320> screen<00:02:39.520> all<00:02:40.520> over

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
but anyway so you just platform as high

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.950 
but anyway so you just platform as high
as<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.560> can<00:02:54.650> until<00:02:55.070> we<00:02:55.760> get<00:02:55.880> stopped<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:56.600> it

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
as you can until we get stopped and it

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.420 
as you can until we get stopped and it
gets<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.470> top<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.800> world<00:02:58.450> as<00:02:59.530> the<00:03:00.530> map

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
gets to the top of the world as the map

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.570 
gets to the top of the world as the map
and<00:03:02.050> when<00:03:03.050> you're<00:03:03.230> on<00:03:03.320> top<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.830> block<00:03:04.130> when

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
and when you're on top of the block when

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.620 
and when you're on top of the block when
you<00:03:04.700> go<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.030> top<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.210> the<00:03:05.330> world<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:05.570> you

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
you go to the top of the world so you

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.880 
you go to the top of the world so you
normally<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.020> would<00:03:06.110> fly<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.710> could

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
normally you would fly and you could

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.340 
normally you would fly and you could
like<00:03:07.600> you<00:03:08.600> wouldn't<00:03:08.840> let<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.020> go<00:03:09.140> past

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
like you wouldn't let you go past

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.540 
like you wouldn't let you go past
certain<00:03:09.620> point<00:03:09.830> but<00:03:09.980> if<00:03:10.100> you're<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:10.310> top<00:03:10.520> of

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
certain point but if you're on top of

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.430 
certain point but if you're on top of
the<00:03:10.790> block<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.240> kind<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.450> pushes<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:12.020> out<00:03:12.050> of

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
the block it kind of pushes you out of

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.290 
the block it kind of pushes you out of
the<00:03:12.530> map<00:03:12.740> when<00:03:13.490> you<00:03:13.580> get<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.850> highest<00:03:13.970> spot

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
the map when you get to the highest spot

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.190 
the map when you get to the highest spot
and<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:15.950> think<00:03:16.910> this<00:03:17.180> might<00:03:17.390> be<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.720> let's

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
and so I think this might be it let's

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.580 
and so I think this might be it let's
see<00:03:22.150> ok<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:23.570> anyway<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.870> pushes<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:24.320> out<00:03:24.350> of

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
see ok so anyway it pushes you out of

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.040 
see ok so anyway it pushes you out of
the<00:03:24.650> map<00:03:24.800> off<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.160> top<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.610> from<00:03:26.510> there<00:03:26.750> you

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
the map off the top and from there you

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.530 
the map off the top and from there you
can<00:03:27.080> just<00:03:27.320> yep<00:03:28.600> climb<00:03:29.600> out<00:03:30.310> like<00:03:31.310> this<00:03:31.610> check

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
can just yep climb out like this check

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.180 
can just yep climb out like this check
it<00:03:32.660> out<00:03:32.810> oh<00:03:34.300> yeah<00:03:35.300> buddy<00:03:35.800> what<00:03:36.800> I'm<00:03:36.890> talking

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
had the when they update the distance

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.460 
had the when they update the distance
everything<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.210> removed<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.540> fog<00:03:50.780> you'd<00:03:51.320> be

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
everything and removed the fog you'd be

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.860 
everything and removed the fog you'd be
able<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.650> see<00:03:51.740> all<00:03:51.980> this<00:03:52.130> stuff<00:03:52.430> but<00:03:52.840> yeah<00:03:53.840> I

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
able to see all this stuff but yeah I

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.450 
able to see all this stuff but yeah I
don't<00:03:54.050> you<00:03:54.680> can't<00:03:54.890> really<00:03:55.010> see<00:03:55.130> anything

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
don't you can't really see anything

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.390 
don't you can't really see anything
because<00:03:56.300> it<00:03:56.480> so<00:03:56.690> there's<00:03:57.680> nothing<00:03:57.800> to<00:03:58.040> see<00:03:58.220> but

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
because it so there's nothing to see but

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.430 
because it so there's nothing to see but
anyway<00:03:58.850> so<00:03:59.300> this<00:03:59.480> side<00:03:59.690> of<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.870> block<00:04:00.050> is<00:04:00.320> on

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
anyway so this side of the block is on

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.840 
anyway so this side of the block is on
outside<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:00.950> map<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:01.280> they<00:04:01.370> don't<00:04:01.550> you<00:04:01.760> know

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
outside the map so they don't you know

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.550 
outside the map so they don't you know
they<00:04:02.030> have<00:04:02.120> placed<00:04:02.570> it<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:02.930> mean<00:04:03.320> it's<00:04:03.470> not

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
they have placed it I mean it's not

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.350 
they have placed it I mean it's not
there's<00:04:03.890> no<00:04:04.010> texture<00:04:04.280> for<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.550> side<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.330> you

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
there's no texture for that side so you

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.530 
there's no texture for that side so you
can<00:04:05.450> see<00:04:05.690> through<00:04:05.930> its<00:04:06.110> kind<00:04:06.260> of<00:04:06.290> weird<00:04:06.440> and

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
can see through its kind of weird and

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.120 
can see through its kind of weird and
yeah<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.600> can<00:04:08.750> make<00:04:08.930> like<00:04:09.080> a<00:04:09.110> whole<00:04:09.380> building

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
yeah you can make like a whole building

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.220 
yeah you can make like a whole building
up<00:04:10.459> there<00:04:10.700> but<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:11.630> can't<00:04:11.780> build<00:04:11.900> me<00:04:12.080> much

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
up there but you can't build me much

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.810 
up there but you can't build me much
higher<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:13.010> I<00:04:13.130> don't<00:04:13.310> know<00:04:13.370> what<00:04:13.459> I'm<00:04:13.550> walking

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
higher and I don't know what I'm walking
