degrees<00:01:37.920> when<00:01:38.369> you're<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.909> 82<00:01:39.659> degrees

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
degrees when you're there and 82 degrees

when you're away or asleep in the winter
a<00:01:42.420> common<00:01:42.990> recommendation<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.799> set<00:01:44.040> your

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
a common recommendation is to set your

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.980 
a common recommendation is to set your
thermostat<00:01:44.159> near<00:01:44.909> 70<00:01:45.360> degrees<00:01:45.390> when<00:01:45.869> your

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
thermostat near 70 degrees when your

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.230 
thermostat near 70 degrees when your
home<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.409> 62<00:01:47.250> degrees<00:01:47.430> while<00:01:47.820> you're<00:01:47.970> away

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
home and 62 degrees while you're away

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.999 
home and 62 degrees while you're away
and<00:01:48.479> at<00:01:48.570> night<00:01:48.750> once<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.649> know<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and at night once you know the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.679 
and at night once you know the
temperatures<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.579> want<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.119> when<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.479> want

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
temperatures you want and when you want

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.660 
temperatures you want and when you want
to<00:01:51.780> schedule<00:01:52.049> them<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.619> time<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.280> program
