submerged to up to the windshield and

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.480 
submerged to up to the windshield and
you<00:01:44.330> think<00:01:44.540> okay<00:01:44.840> we're<00:01:45.800> gonna<00:01:45.920> be<00:01:46.100> stuck<00:01:46.340> like

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.359 
you think okay we're gonna be stuck like
this<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:47.300> then<00:01:47.509> suddenly<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:49.040> four-wheel

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
this and then suddenly the four-wheel

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.060 
this and then suddenly the four-wheel
drive<00:01:49.610> kicks<00:01:49.880> in<00:01:50.060> we<00:01:51.050> make<00:01:51.290> it<00:01:51.440> out<00:01:51.560> each<00:01:51.890> and

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
drive kicks in we make it out each and

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.310 
drive kicks in we make it out each and
every<00:01:52.390> crossing<00:01:53.390> I<00:01:53.479> think<00:01:53.690> there<00:01:53.810> are<00:01:53.900> 72

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
every crossing I think there are 72

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.969 
every crossing I think there are 72
crosses<00:01:54.830> one<00:01:55.640> way<00:01:56.259> from<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:57.410> know<00:01:57.530> small

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
crosses one way from you know small

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.760 
crosses one way from you know small
little<00:01:58.340> streams<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:59.119> you<00:01:59.450> know<00:01:59.570> three<00:01:59.930> to<00:02:00.410> four

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
little streams to you know three to four

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.020 
little streams to you know three to four
feet<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:01.009> water<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:01.899> each<00:02:02.899> time<00:02:03.229> we<00:02:03.289> ended<00:02:03.770> up

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
feet of water so each time we ended up

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.100 
feet of water so each time we ended up
going<00:02:05.030> through<00:02:05.180> somewhere<00:02:05.509> extreme<00:02:05.960> we

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
going through somewhere extreme we

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.359 
going through somewhere extreme we
always<00:02:06.350> thought<00:02:06.530> okay<00:02:06.649> this<00:02:06.890> is<00:02:07.039> where<00:02:07.220> we're

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.070 
just investigating what are the
possibilities<00:05:10.180> there's<00:05:10.389> so<00:05:10.510> many<00:05:10.630> possible

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
possibilities there's so many possible

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.310 
possibilities there's so many possible
and<00:05:12.010> you<00:05:12.280> know<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.880> trip<00:05:13.330> too<00:05:13.990> long<00:05:14.139> on<00:05:14.290> that

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
and you know the trip too long on that

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.860 
and you know the trip too long on that
it<00:05:14.710> proved<00:05:15.010> that<00:05:15.130> if<00:05:16.030> you<00:05:16.240> want<00:05:16.419> to<00:05:16.539> do<00:05:16.630> it<00:05:16.750> it
