00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:04.090
 let's set up lm 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.450
 1 point 4 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.570
 we are going to start 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.059
 inside and pc 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.059
 let's see properties 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.799
 we look for jaguar 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.409
 device administrator 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.409
 and there it appears what ports are 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.289
 is the most difficult thing that this has I have a state itself in port 10 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.679
 it's not right 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.000
 we go to the programming they look for 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.160
 not the end of the s 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
 we give twice 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.720
 pd our model fiat in this case is not the same as jtb we select 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.950
 inside the engine are the two switchboards 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.260
 wrong all this before 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.260
 percent to configure it options 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.950
 the m3 27 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.920
 for all this 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.760
 in 10 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.190
 we can give you a test to see if the room is correct 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.620
 and apart everything 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.090
 the command that the command that commanded that we will accept ocher 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.270
 we confirm 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.270
 we choose the switchboard we want this case lamela first 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.090
 we give the connect button 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.090
 asks us to have xenon the key 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.980
 it seems that we approve and that to repeat them in this case has entered 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.330
 both the first 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.250
 here we have everything that would be inside the engine what he knew how to buy 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.880
 the mistakes 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.369
 the parameters for example kilometers odometer rams 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.050
 here the clubs do not mark but the car in which he needed seven thousand 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.670
 the to check the other things we give 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.829
 inside information that is the main page we give you to disconnect 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.700
 and we go to the main management that will be reserved address 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.759
 electronic which loving chassis 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.150
 we can go to the scorecard 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.080
 we give to dress 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.730
 let's read to connect 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.040
 Shoemaker approved the camera but it is on 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.170
 we are already inside 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.009
 well I think it's quite simple place to problems the configuration of 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.669
 puerto de nescafÃ© the best a couple of times 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.669
 because sometimes the lemos 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.329
 so you can see that nobody wants to enjoy a cable for a hundred 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.069
 madness 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.260
 good but this has been all if you have any questions do not hesitate to ask
