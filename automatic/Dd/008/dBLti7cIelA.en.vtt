00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
a couple seconds and just kind of work

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.640 
a couple seconds and just kind of work
it<00:05:52.090> around<00:05:52.240> and<00:05:52.660> then<00:05:52.690> when<00:05:53.139> I<00:05:53.169> wipe<00:05:53.349> it<00:05:53.560> away

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
it around and then when I wipe it away

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.770 
it around and then when I wipe it away
it<00:05:53.950> just<00:05:53.979> melts<00:05:54.729> all<00:05:54.910> the<00:05:55.030> makeup<00:05:55.180> right<00:05:55.630> off

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
it just melts all the makeup right off

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.420 
it just melts all the makeup right off
of<00:05:55.810> your<00:05:55.990> eye<00:05:56.110> I<00:05:56.530> don't<00:05:56.979> wear<00:05:57.130> waterproof

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
of your eye I don't wear waterproof

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.000 
of your eye I don't wear waterproof
mascara<00:05:58.030> but<00:05:58.690> I<00:05:58.960> think<00:05:59.229> that<00:05:59.260> because<00:05:59.680> it<00:05:59.800> is

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
mascara but I think that because it is

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.100 
mascara but I think that because it is
more<00:06:00.190> like<00:06:00.400> a<00:06:00.430> heavy<00:06:00.669> duty<00:06:00.849> remover<00:06:01.389> it<00:06:01.599> just

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
more like a heavy duty remover it just

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.839 
more like a heavy duty remover it just
is<00:06:02.349> that<00:06:02.590> much<00:06:02.770> easier<00:06:02.979> to<00:06:03.310> remove<00:06:03.520> all<00:06:03.700> of

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
is that much easier to remove all of

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.330 
is that much easier to remove all of
your<00:06:03.880> makeup<00:06:04.090> and<00:06:04.740> it<00:06:05.740> doesn't<00:06:06.070> leave<00:06:06.190> like<00:06:06.310> a

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
your makeup and it doesn't leave like a

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.010 
your makeup and it doesn't leave like a
greasy<00:06:06.760> feeling<00:06:06.970> or<00:06:07.150> anything<00:06:07.479> it<00:06:07.599> does<00:06:07.750> feel

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
greasy feeling or anything it does feel

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.480 
greasy feeling or anything it does feel
like<00:06:08.169> there's<00:06:08.380> some<00:06:08.590> kind<00:06:08.800> of<00:06:08.830> an<00:06:08.950> oil<00:06:09.130> but

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
like there's some kind of an oil but

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.700 
like there's some kind of an oil but
it's<00:06:10.000> very<00:06:10.180> light<00:06:10.539> and<00:06:10.570> it<00:06:10.930> absorbs<00:06:11.199> really

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
it's very light and it absorbs really

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.450 
it's very light and it absorbs really
quickly<00:06:12.039> and<00:06:12.280> then<00:06:12.340> I<00:06:13.240> am<00:06:13.740> just<00:06:14.740> use<00:06:14.949> my<00:06:15.130> makeup

a<00:06:48.909> custom<00:06:49.389> color<00:06:49.629> almost<00:06:49.930> so<00:06:50.349> you<00:06:50.439> can<00:06:50.589> kind<00:06:50.800> of

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
a custom color almost so you can kind of

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.260 
a custom color almost so you can kind of
see<00:06:51.009> ice<00:06:51.129> watch<00:06:51.369> that<00:06:51.639> a<00:06:51.669> little<00:06:51.939> bit<00:06:51.999> weird

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
see ice watch that a little bit weird

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.049 
see ice watch that a little bit weird
but<00:06:52.599> um<00:06:53.050> this<00:06:53.680> is<00:06:53.919> the<00:06:54.159> yellow<00:06:54.399> one<00:06:54.639> is<00:06:54.669> kind<00:06:54.999> of

00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:55.059 
but um this is the yellow one is kind of

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:56.579 
but um this is the yellow one is kind of
harder<00:06:55.270> to<00:06:55.389> get<00:06:55.479> to<00:06:55.599> pick<00:06:55.719> up<00:06:55.839> on<00:06:55.960> camera<00:06:56.349> but

00:06:56.579 --> 00:06:56.589 
harder to get to pick up on camera but

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:58.649 
harder to get to pick up on camera but
then<00:06:57.520> there's<00:06:57.669> the<00:06:57.759> orange<00:06:58.089> and<00:06:58.180> the<00:06:58.240> hot<00:06:58.389> pink

00:06:58.649 --> 00:06:58.659 
then there's the orange and the hot pink

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:00.209 
then there's the orange and the hot pink
and<00:06:59.020> then<00:06:59.229> I<00:06:59.289> think<00:06:59.559> my<00:06:59.770> favorite<00:06:59.979> is

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:00.219 
and then I think my favorite is

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:01.920 
and then I think my favorite is
definitely<00:07:00.399> the<00:07:00.849> tie<00:07:01.029> dye<00:07:01.059> color<00:07:01.509> pigment

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
definitely the tie dye color pigment

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.839 
definitely the tie dye color pigment
because<00:07:02.199> these<00:07:02.379> colors<00:07:02.770> just<00:07:03.009> remind<00:07:03.460> me<00:07:03.639> of

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:03.849 
because these colors just remind me of

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:06.360 
because these colors just remind me of
like<00:07:03.879> cotton<00:07:04.659> candy<00:07:04.689> the<00:07:05.259> pink<00:07:05.529> the<00:07:05.770> blue<00:07:05.800> and
