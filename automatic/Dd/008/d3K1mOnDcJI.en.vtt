00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
there how there's a glass looks like

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.410 
there how there's a glass looks like
it's<00:03:26.870> broken<00:03:27.260> into<00:03:27.940> that's<00:03:28.940> where<00:03:29.150> we<00:03:29.240> need<00:03:29.390> to

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
it's broken into that's where we need to

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.670 
it's broken into that's where we need to
go<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.020> you<00:03:30.080> want<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.320> go<00:03:30.380> ahead<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.620> keep

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
going until you get to that area right

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.760 
going until you get to that area right
there<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.760> now<00:03:34.810> we<00:03:35.810> need<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:35.990> get<00:03:36.290> into<00:03:36.500> that

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
there so now we need to get into that

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.680 
there so now we need to get into that
glass<00:03:37.070> even<00:03:37.370> though<00:03:37.580> we're<00:03:37.730> on<00:03:37.880> top<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.210> it<00:03:38.480> we
