any other finesse techniques you can
still<00:03:27.500> use<00:03:27.650> this<00:03:27.740> rod<00:03:27.980> may<00:03:28.610> want<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.820> put<00:03:29.000> on

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
still use this rod may want to put on

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.760 
still use this rod may want to put on
fluorocarbon<00:03:29.630> or<00:03:29.870> fluorocarbon<00:03:30.140> leader<00:03:30.500> to

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
fluorocarbon or fluorocarbon leader to

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.190 
fluorocarbon or fluorocarbon leader to
the<00:03:30.860> braid<00:03:31.100> but<00:03:31.820> for<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.030> most<00:03:32.180> part<00:03:32.270> this<00:03:33.140> is

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
the braid but for the most part this is

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.490 
the braid but for the most part this is
what<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.440> use<00:03:33.650> right<00:03:33.830> here<00:03:34.010> straight<00:03:34.430> braid<00:03:34.730> and

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
what I use right here straight braid and

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.070 
what I use right here straight braid and
six<00:03:36.500> six<00:03:36.710> medium<00:03:37.130> action<00:03:37.310> fast<00:03:37.700> tip<00:03:37.930> it's<00:03:38.930> a

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
six six medium action fast tip it's a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.210 
six six medium action fast tip it's a
great<00:03:39.380> all-around<00:03:39.560> rod

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
great all-around rod

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.690 
great all-around rod
I<00:03:41.410> like<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.590> shorter<00:03:43.280> action<00:03:43.550> on<00:03:43.640> the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
I like the shorter action on the

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.940 
I like the shorter action on the
spinning<00:03:43.970> rod<00:03:44.120> it's<00:03:44.780> because<00:03:45.170> uh<00:03:45.200> it's<00:03:45.770> more

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
spinning rod it's because uh it's more

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.770 
spinning rod it's because uh it's more
accurate<00:03:46.340> but<00:03:46.880> even<00:03:47.090> if<00:03:47.180> your<00:03:47.270> drop<00:03:47.420> shot<00:03:47.660> off

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
accurate but even if your drop shot off

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.760 
accurate but even if your drop shot off
the<00:03:47.900> front<00:03:48.050> of<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.170> boat<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.470> know<00:03:48.560> it's

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
the front of the boat you know it's

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.970 
the front of the boat you know it's
still<00:03:48.980> still<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.820> good<00:03:49.940> length<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:50.770> that's<00:03:51.770> five

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
still still a good length so that's five

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.820 
still still a good length so that's five
rods<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:52.520> guys<00:03:52.670> asked<00:03:53.240> for<00:03:53.480> six<00:03:53.690> rods<00:03:53.990> I<00:03:54.380> had

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
rods you guys asked for six rods I had

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.050 
rods you guys asked for six rods I had
to<00:03:54.920> pick<00:03:55.070> one<00:03:55.100> more<00:03:55.720> it<00:03:56.720> would<00:03:56.840> be<00:03:57.020> a<00:03:57.700> six<00:03:58.700> ten

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
to pick one more it would be a six ten

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.340 
to pick one more it would be a six ten
medium<00:03:59.960> heavy<00:04:01.000> extra<00:04:02.000> fast<00:04:02.180> action<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:02.810> this

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
medium heavy extra fast action and this

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.960 
medium heavy extra fast action and this
is<00:04:03.470> my<00:04:03.590> go-to<00:04:03.860> spinnerbait<00:04:04.460> rod<00:04:04.490> I<00:04:04.670> love

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
is my go-to spinnerbait rod I love

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.280 
is my go-to spinnerbait rod I love
throwing<00:04:05.150> spinner<00:04:05.480> bait<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:05.780> if<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:05.930> take<00:04:06.140> one

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
throwing spinner bait so if I take one

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.440 
throwing spinner bait so if I take one
more<00:04:06.320> rod<00:04:06.680> it'd<00:04:07.490> be<00:04:07.640> this<00:04:07.790> one<00:04:07.940> right<00:04:07.970> here

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
more rod it'd be this one right here

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.300 
more rod it'd be this one right here
it's<00:04:08.570> uh<00:04:08.720> it's<00:04:09.290> long<00:04:09.560> enough<00:04:09.800> to<00:04:09.920> make<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.040> good

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
it's uh it's long enough to make a good

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.010 
it's uh it's long enough to make a good
cast<00:04:10.550> but<00:04:10.970> it's<00:04:11.090> short<00:04:11.270> enough<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.600> where<00:04:11.900> it's

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
cast but it's short enough to where it's

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.080 
cast but it's short enough to where it's
accurate<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.620> with<00:04:13.130> that<00:04:13.250> extra<00:04:13.460> fast<00:04:13.730> tip<00:04:13.940> I

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
accurate and with that extra fast tip I

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.280 
accurate and with that extra fast tip I
can<00:04:14.240> feel<00:04:14.390> everything<00:04:14.630> those<00:04:14.900> blades<00:04:15.080> are

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
can feel everything those blades are

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.050 
can feel everything those blades are
doing<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:15.710> definitely<00:04:16.580> an<00:04:16.670> awesome<00:04:16.730> right

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
doing so definitely an awesome right

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.930 
doing so definitely an awesome right
here<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:17.420> is<00:04:17.480> Shimano<00:04:17.930> crucial<00:04:18.940> spinnerbait

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
here this is Shimano crucial spinnerbait

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.170 
here this is Shimano crucial spinnerbait
rod<00:04:19.970> so<00:04:20.920> guys<00:04:21.920> that's<00:04:22.100> it<00:04:22.310> that's<00:04:22.430> my<00:04:22.610> six<00:04:22.910> go

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
rod so guys that's it that's my six go

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.850 
rod so guys that's it that's my six go
to<00:04:23.240> rods<00:04:23.600> helix<00:04:24.170> that<00:04:24.260> I<00:04:24.320> pretty<00:04:24.530> much<00:04:24.620> get

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
to rods helix that I pretty much get

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.200 
to rods helix that I pretty much get
everything<00:04:25.070> done<00:04:25.310> with<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.640> first<00:04:25.760> five<00:04:26.030> that

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
everything done with the first five that

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.820 
everything done with the first five that
I<00:04:26.240> showed<00:04:26.510> you<00:04:26.540> if<00:04:27.140> I<00:04:27.260> were<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.470> pick<00:04:27.620> one<00:04:27.800> more

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
I showed you if I were to pick one more

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.140 
I showed you if I were to pick one more
it<00:04:28.250> would<00:04:28.340> definitely<00:04:28.430> be<00:04:28.640> this<00:04:28.820> rod<00:04:28.970> right

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
it would definitely be this rod right

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.020 
it would definitely be this rod right
