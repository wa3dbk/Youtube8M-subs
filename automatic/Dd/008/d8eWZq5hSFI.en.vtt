00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.910
 but you know perfectly now I feel 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.910
 more of pity affection 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.280

 this they know too well to know 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.190
 that I knew you 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:38.770
 so many times and they understand me 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.770
 and so deeply we leave behind 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:48.040
 I'm here to open your eyes 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.040

 How about mana well and you should not 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.440
 to be in alcohol I have been thrown out 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.790
 stick a fork in a fork in the 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.900
 eye apparently is not allowed 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.900
 be reasonable 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.950
 in this valley 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.069

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.450
 You should forget that's all that 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.590
 I have to do

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.940
 you have already begun to do your work you are going to 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.870
 have to sharpen your thirteen senses 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.870
 the needy 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.670
 fallen angels what has been written 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.670
 on 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.550
 we need it 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.100
 do not approach her , evil has 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.900
 endless ways to manifest 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.900
 but there is only one to fight it
