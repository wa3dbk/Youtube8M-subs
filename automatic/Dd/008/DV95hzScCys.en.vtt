energy writer version of curl cog a and
unless<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.510> completely<00:00:24.869> blanking<00:00:25.289> on<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.560> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
unless I completely blanking on it I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.929 
unless I completely blanking on it I
think<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.920> only<00:00:26.099> difference<00:00:26.580> between<00:00:26.670> him

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
think the only difference between him

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.370 
think the only difference between him
and<00:00:27.060> regular<00:00:27.150> crow<00:00:27.480> CAW<00:00:27.689> gay<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> driver

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
and regular crow CAW gay is the driver

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.669 
and regular crow CAW gay is the driver
being<00:00:29.310> Genesis<00:00:29.730> instead<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.029> sengoku<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.750> kind

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
being Genesis instead of sengoku so kind

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.200 
being Genesis instead of sengoku so kind
of<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> lame<00:00:32.009> choice<00:00:32.219> there<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.579> think<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.090> could

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
of a lame choice there I think it could

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.299 
of a lame choice there I think it could
have<00:00:33.329> been<00:00:33.420> neat<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> cool<00:00:34.410> slightly

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309

don't<00:00:58.739> even<00:00:58.920> need<00:00:59.010> an<00:00:59.219> example<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.789> think<00:01:00.059> I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
don't even need an example I think I

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.430 
don't even need an example I think I
don't<00:01:00.510> even<00:01:00.600> know<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.809> didn't<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
don't even know I didn't think it was a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.950 
don't even know I didn't think it was a
picture<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:02.190> yeah<00:01:02.570> like<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> said<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
picture on there but yeah like I said it

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.420 
picture on there but yeah like I said it
would<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.140> been<00:01:04.199> cool<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> different

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
would have been cool to have a different

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.649 
would have been cool to have a different
suit<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.850> him<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.270> guess<00:01:06.360> we're<00:01:06.600> not

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
suit for him but I guess we're not

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.300 
suit for him but I guess we're not
reviewing<00:01:07.020> their<00:01:07.140> decisions<00:01:07.530> reviewing<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
reviewing their decisions reviewing the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.010 
reviewing their decisions reviewing the
lock<00:01:08.460> seed<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> pretty<00:01:09.810> typical

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
lock seed so it's a pretty typical

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.660 
lock seed so it's a pretty typical
energy<00:01:10.350> locks<00:01:10.680> even<00:01:10.979> being<00:01:11.250> honest<00:01:11.520> even

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
energy locks even being honest even

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.240 
energy locks even being honest even
though<00:01:11.840> um<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.619> said<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.830> think<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.100> suit

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
though um like I said I think the suit

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.230 
though um like I said I think the suit
could<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.490> been<00:01:14.580> cooler<00:01:14.760> I'm<00:01:15.030> pretty

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
could have been cooler I'm pretty

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.550 
could have been cooler I'm pretty
pleased<00:01:15.450> with<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> lock<00:01:15.840> seat<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.409> like

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
pleased with the lock seat it's not like

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.140 
pleased with the lock seat it's not like
a<00:01:16.590> zom<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.100> need<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> own<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.580> lock<00:01:17.790> see<00:01:17.970> type

a zom you need to own this lock see type
of<00:01:18.270> deal<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> energy<00:01:19.770> lock

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
of deal but I do like the energy lock

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.260 
of deal but I do like the energy lock
seeds<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.430> nice<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.759> another<00:01:20.909> one

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
light from the activation noises like I

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.960 
light from the activation noises like I
some<00:02:12.990> of<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> little<00:02:14.520> press<00:02:14.730> button

it's supposed to but it's not the

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:15.709 
it's supposed to but it's not the
weights<00:04:08.810> it's<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:09.930> not<00:04:14.180> what<00:04:15.180> failed<00:04:15.510> this

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:15.719 
weights it's just not what failed this

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:22.039 
weights it's just not what failed this
pinecone<00:04:20.090> but<00:04:21.090> yeah<00:04:21.180> that's<00:04:21.389> pretty<00:04:21.599> much<00:04:21.720> it

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
pinecone but yeah that's pretty much it

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.909 
pinecone but yeah that's pretty much it
like<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.830> said<00:04:23.099> this<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:23.729> sort<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.919> personal

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
like I said this is sort of a personal

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.550 
like I said this is sort of a personal
preference<00:04:26.160> which<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.580> guess<00:04:26.759> all<00:04:26.970> things<00:04:27.210> are

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
preference which I guess all things are

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.050 
preference which I guess all things are
but<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.590> can't<00:04:28.710> say<00:04:29.039> that<00:04:29.250> this<00:04:29.340> is<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.550> must<00:04:29.849> own

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
but I can't say that this is a must own

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.640 
but I can't say that this is a must own
lock<00:04:30.360> seat<00:04:30.599> or<00:04:30.720> anything<00:04:31.080> it<00:04:31.169> didn't<00:04:31.380> blow<00:04:31.500> me

of<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:33.990> it's<00:04:34.110> got<00:04:34.259> good<00:04:34.470> sounds<00:04:35.009> so<00:04:35.160> if<00:04:35.280> you

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400
