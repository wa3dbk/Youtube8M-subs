simple really when the roads wet you
have<00:00:28.760> reduced<00:00:29.240> traction<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:30.860> it's<00:00:31.490> like<00:00:32.000> just

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
have reduced traction so it's like just

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.930 
have reduced traction so it's like just
pretend<00:00:33.170> that<00:00:33.440> you're<00:00:33.559> riding<00:00:33.890> around<00:00:34.100> this

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
is the best way I can think of it just

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.200 
is the best way I can think of it just
pretend<00:00:37.040> that<00:00:37.360> your<00:00:38.360> back<00:00:38.570> tire<00:00:38.870> blew<00:00:39.379> out<00:00:39.410> and

don't<00:02:00.909> really<00:02:01.000> need<00:02:01.179> to<00:02:01.299> take<00:02:01.509> it<00:02:01.659> easy<00:02:01.869> on<00:02:02.259> a

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
don't really need to take it easy on a

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.080 
don't really need to take it easy on a
scooter<00:02:02.560> because<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:03.250> scooter<00:02:03.579> is<00:02:03.759> already

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
scooter because a scooter is already

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.480 
scooter because a scooter is already
easy<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.810> begin<00:02:04.929> with<00:02:05.229> if<00:02:05.439> you<00:02:05.530> notice<00:02:05.770> what

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
easy to begin with if you notice what

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.759 
easy to begin with if you notice what
I'm<00:02:06.610> saying<00:02:06.959> but<00:02:07.959> like<00:02:08.140> yeah<00:02:08.379> if<00:02:08.440> you're<00:02:08.649> on

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
I'm saying but like yeah if you're on

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.699 
I'm saying but like yeah if you're on
like<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:09.390> 600cc<00:02:10.390> race<00:02:10.840> bike<00:02:11.170> or<00:02:11.349> something<00:02:11.620> like

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
like a 600cc race bike or something like

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.050 
like a 600cc race bike or something like
this<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:12.040> just<00:02:12.069> give<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.430> bit<00:02:12.580> of<00:02:12.610> gas<00:02:12.879> and

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
this you just give it a bit of gas and

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.699 
this you just give it a bit of gas and
the<00:02:13.150> front<00:02:13.360> tires<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.900> rear<00:02:14.200> tires<00:02:14.319> is<00:02:14.530> going

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
the front tires the rear tires is going

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.080 
the front tires the rear tires is going
to<00:02:14.769> spin<00:02:15.010> because<00:02:15.220> they<00:02:15.370> used<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:15.640> suppress

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
to spin because they used to suppress

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.569 
to spin because they used to suppress
traction<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.769> only<00:02:17.920> way<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.129> counter

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
traction and the only way to counter

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.539 
traction and the only way to counter
that<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.940> just<00:02:19.120> by<00:02:19.269> being<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.599> lot<00:02:19.750> smoother<00:02:20.549> you

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
that is just by being a lot smoother you

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.180 
that is just by being a lot smoother you
can<00:02:21.700> still<00:02:21.970> do<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:23.230> speed<00:02:23.530> do<00:02:23.709> you<00:02:23.799> want<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.069> do

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
can still do the speed do you want to do

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.580 
can still do the speed do you want to do
like<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.760> got<00:02:25.209> half<00:02:25.450> gone<00:02:25.660> out<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.260> pouring

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
like I got half gone out in the pouring

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.710 
like I got half gone out in the pouring
rain<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:27.010> gotten<00:02:28.000> up<00:02:28.120> hope<00:02:28.269> you<00:02:28.420> know<00:02:28.540> like

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
rain and gotten up hope you know like

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.770 
rain and gotten up hope you know like
gotten<00:02:29.440> up<00:02:29.530> there<00:02:29.680> like<00:02:29.799> I<00:02:30.220> feet<00:02:30.579> but<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.630> just

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
gotten up there like I feet but you just

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.509 
gotten up there like I feet but you just
need<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.079> start<00:02:32.290> breaking<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.890> lot<00:02:33.069> sooner<00:02:33.489> than

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
need to start breaking a lot sooner than

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.190 
need to start breaking a lot sooner than
you<00:02:33.730> normally<00:02:33.849> would<00:02:34.120> that's<00:02:34.510> all<00:02:34.690> like<00:02:35.019> if

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
you normally would that's all like if

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.440 
you normally would that's all like if
you<00:02:35.319> would<00:02:35.470> normally<00:02:35.650> break<00:02:36.280> 20<00:02:37.060> feet<00:02:37.299> before

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
you would normally break 20 feet before

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.360 
you would normally break 20 feet before
a<00:02:37.630> light<00:02:37.930> then<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.349> in<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.769> ring<00:02:38.950> you'd<00:02:39.160> want

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
a light then you in the ring you'd want

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.039 
a light then you in the ring you'd want
to<00:02:39.430> do<00:02:39.549> with<00:02:39.670> 40<00:02:40.000> feet<00:02:40.180> before<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.540> life<00:02:40.840> or

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
to do with 40 feet before the life or

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.080 
to do with 40 feet before the life or
something<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:42.069> if<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.340> normally<00:02:42.640> like<00:02:42.790> turn

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
something and if you normally like turn

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.550 
something and if you normally like turn
like<00:02:43.329> this<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.840> then<00:02:43.930> around<00:02:44.019> you<00:02:44.290> want<00:02:44.470> to

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
like this and then around you want to

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.259 
like this and then around you want to
turn<00:02:44.680> like<00:02:44.920> this<00:02:45.099> just<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.519> bit<00:02:45.640> smoother<00:02:46.090> you

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
turn like this just a bit smoother you

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.240 
turn like this just a bit smoother you
know<00:02:46.769> that's<00:02:47.769> all<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.160> when<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:48.790> rain<00:02:49.230> just<00:02:50.250> you

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
know that's all it when it rain just you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.610 
know that's all it when it rain just you
just<00:02:51.430> have<00:02:51.670> slightly<00:02:52.450> reduced<00:02:52.870> traction<00:02:53.410> so

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
just have slightly reduced traction so

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.379 
just have slightly reduced traction so
you<00:02:53.680> want<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.040> i<00:02:54.250> want<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.579> go<00:02:54.670> here<00:02:54.940> but<00:02:55.269> i'm

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
you want to i want to go here but i'm

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.319 
you want to i want to go here but i'm
talking<00:02:56.040> so<00:02:57.040> yeah<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.489> just<00:02:57.910> want<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.239> do

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
talking so yeah you just want to do

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.379 
talking so yeah you just want to do
things<00:02:58.359> a<00:02:58.630> little<00:02:58.660> bit<00:02:59.170> smoother<00:02:59.769> and<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.069> bit

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
things a little bit smoother and a bit

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.640 
things a little bit smoother and a bit
let's<00:03:01.389> set<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.780> keywords<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.350> just<00:03:02.470> want<00:03:02.590> to

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
let's set the keywords you just want to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.000 
let's set the keywords you just want to
accelerate<00:03:02.889> smoother<00:03:03.519> break<00:03:03.910> smoother<00:03:05.010> and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
accelerate smoother break smoother and

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.770 
accelerate smoother break smoother and
then<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.280> have<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.549> anticipate<00:03:06.940> for<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.600> you

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
then you have to anticipate for that you

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.990 
then you have to anticipate for that you
have<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.019> leave<00:03:08.230> leave<00:03:08.950> more<00:03:09.280> distance<00:03:09.790> you

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
have to leave leave more distance you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.289 
have to leave leave more distance you
know<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:11.380> for<00:03:11.680> emergency<00:03:12.280> braking<00:03:12.549> you<00:03:13.180> well

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
know and for emergency braking you well

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.640 
know and for emergency braking you well
you<00:03:13.540> pretty<00:03:13.630> much<00:03:14.049> like<00:03:14.290> if<00:03:14.440> i<00:03:14.500> give

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
you pretty much like if i give

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.990 
you pretty much like if i give
one<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.829> these<00:03:14.920> cars<00:03:15.130> swings<00:03:15.579> out<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.849> make<00:03:15.970> a

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
one of these cars swings out to make a

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.170 
one of these cars swings out to make a
u-turn<00:03:16.889> it<00:03:17.889> takes<00:03:18.160> me<00:03:18.250> twice<00:03:18.459> as<00:03:18.519> long<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.849> stop

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
u-turn it takes me twice as long to stop

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.670 
u-turn it takes me twice as long to stop
in<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.389> rain<00:03:19.540> as<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.780> normally<00:03:19.959> does<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.560> need

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
in the rain as it normally does you need

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.009 
in the rain as it normally does you need
to<00:03:20.739> keep<00:03:20.889> that<00:03:20.920> in<00:03:21.069> mind<00:03:21.389> but<00:03:22.389> as<00:03:22.510> far<00:03:22.630> as<00:03:22.690> speed

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
to keep that in mind but as far as speed

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.940 
to keep that in mind but as far as speed
yeah<00:03:24.000> about<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.180> we're<00:03:26.109> riding<00:03:26.500> in<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.680> rain

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
yeah about it we're riding in the rain

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.949 
yeah about it we're riding in the rain
right<00:03:28.550> how<00:03:28.700> you<00:03:28.730> normally<00:03:29.000> do<00:03:29.450> just<00:03:29.480> leave

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
right how you normally do just leave

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.460 
right how you normally do just leave
more<00:03:30.290> room<00:03:30.319> to<00:03:30.860> stop<00:03:31.099> and<00:03:31.430> leave

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.500 

uh

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
uh

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.110 
uh
disrespect<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.620> do<00:03:37.739> things<00:03:37.980> slower<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.819> bit

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
disrespect to do things slower and bit

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.839 
disrespect to do things slower and bit
smoother<00:03:39.860> with<00:03:40.860> regards<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.340> breaking

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
smoother with regards to breaking

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.479 
smoother with regards to breaking
accelerating<00:03:42.599> and<00:03:42.689> turning<00:03:43.189> but<00:03:44.189> as<00:03:44.310> far<00:03:44.430> as
