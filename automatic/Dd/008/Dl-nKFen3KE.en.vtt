I'm going to show you today a glitch
that<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.910> found<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:37.199> kind<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.710> make<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.920> easier

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
that I found to kind of make it easier

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.900 
that I found to kind of make it easier
and<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.269> did<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.199> and<00:00:40.379> made<00:00:41.370> my<00:00:41.579> board

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
and like I did it and made my board

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.410 
and like I did it and made my board
clean<00:00:42.269> and<00:00:43.219> I<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.309> proof<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.839> don't<00:00:46.679> know

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
clean and I have proof so I don't know

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
clean and I have proof so I don't know
let<00:00:48.420> me<00:00:48.510> show<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.749> my<00:00:48.899> my<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.739> backed

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
let me show you my my really backed

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.739 
let me show you my my really backed
recording<00:00:50.519> skills<00:00:50.850> because<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.300> don't<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
recording skills because I don't have a

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.130 
recording skills because I don't have a
tripod<00:00:52.079> or<00:00:52.409> anything

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
tripod or anything

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.690

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
show you what you have to do and I guess

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.130 
show you what you have to do and I guess
I'll<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.970> to<00:00:57.090> turn<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.480> light<00:00:57.660> on

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.060 

nice

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.720 

to<00:01:22.280> scream

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.359
