should<00:04:27.020> be<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.470> side<00:04:27.770> deck<00:04:28.010> card<00:04:28.280> but<00:04:28.580> I<00:04:28.610> mean<00:04:28.790> it

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
should be a side deck card but I mean it

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.030 
should be a side deck card but I mean it
works<00:04:29.090> for<00:04:29.270> him<00:04:29.420> so<00:04:29.720> all<00:04:29.990> more<00:04:30.410> power<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.890> him

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
works for him so all more power to him

works for him so all more power to him
