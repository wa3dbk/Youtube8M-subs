 the men of alexandre bompard had to revisit his ambitions downward remains 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.909
 that it is 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.270

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.670

 to leave us for the fnac and these sellers disguised as gardeners of 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.610
 Scottish who pretend not to hear when seeking advice 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.560
 about the functions of a printer or who look at you as if you were 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.720
 the man to honor when you ask him to apologize for them 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.850
 disturb in their idleness what they can advise you a goal for 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.890

 alexander bompard alain casanova not off sellers disguised as 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.799
 cossette gardener 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.560
 with the ajax amsterdam announced in his release he was going soon 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.260
 his jacket at the alary stage and rop usually 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.760
 during this kind of speech the fayots put himself at the forefront and auchel the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.660
 head ostensibly last agreed to about the boss and then there was 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.220
 nor speech with a kit in micro 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.900
 with microphone to announce good hearing results its microphone 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900
 when he wanted to create intimacy a connivance 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.050
 insisted on the big family side I do not know why I 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.530
 impression of his next intervention were coming together promises that 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.180
 the fayots will not rush to the front row we will be seriously 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.969
 why deny it this morning europe 1 is in shock 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.969
 the station was just recovering from the departure of thierry freret 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.459
 and that's good fart this story goes in turn yet it's true that a 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.819
 on the other hand the departure of brother thierry relativizes that of alexander 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.569
 bompard because it shows us that meal can survive survive the absence of 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.049
 bigger tops 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.530
 ap to finish let me become serious for a moment pointing out to what 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:14.130
 point 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.480
 under the presidency of bompard our freedom of tone was total whatever 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.630
 say the tartuffes and fake tits submitted they accuse us 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.999
 enslavement to power to better hide their own compromise 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.449
 that's why this morning we are sad a little disappointed a little 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.099
 distraught but especially a little concerned about our future because it is him 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.949
 who never intervened to give political guidance this 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:35.879
 writing 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.879
 thalassa 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:43.529
 it is alexander bompard of the liter to the box with the fnac
