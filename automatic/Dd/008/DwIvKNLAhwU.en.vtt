00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
special rig inside the car because if

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:24.989 
special rig inside the car because if
you<00:01:23.740> had<00:01:23.889> to<00:01:23.979> create<00:01:24.159> a<00:01:24.249> special<00:01:24.700> rig<00:01:24.850> inside

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:24.999 
you had to create a special rig inside

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:26.399 
you had to create a special rig inside
the<00:01:25.270> car<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.600> means<00:01:25.689> the<00:01:25.869> physics<00:01:26.259> don't

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
the car that means the physics don't

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:26.969 
the car that means the physics don't
make<00:01:26.619> sense

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
make sense

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:27.989 
make sense
so<00:01:27.039> which<00:01:27.159> case<00:01:27.369> now<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.670> doesn't<00:01:27.789> make<00:01:27.969> sense

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:27.999 
so which case now it doesn't make sense

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:29.940 
so which case now it doesn't make sense

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
really doubt it I just don't think so

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.469 
really doubt it I just don't think so
the<00:01:51.069> movie<00:01:51.340> has<00:01:51.520> established<00:01:51.909> that<00:01:52.209> that's

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
the movie has established that that's

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.179 
the movie has established that that's
impossible<00:01:53.170> so<00:01:53.319> when<00:01:53.469> that<00:01:53.590> happens<00:01:54.039> the

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
impossible so when that happens the

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.260 
impossible so when that happens the
movie<00:01:54.399> has<00:01:54.520> not<00:01:54.670> made<00:01:54.849> the<00:01:54.999> impossible

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
movie has not made the impossible

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.039 
movie has not made the impossible
possible

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
possible

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.629 
possible
but<00:01:56.139> the<00:01:56.229> impossible<00:01:56.709> is<00:01:56.829> now<00:01:56.950> possible<00:01:57.219> in

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:57.639 
but the impossible is now possible in

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:59.279 
but the impossible is now possible in
the<00:01:57.759> movie<00:01:58.029> that<00:01:58.209> established<00:01:58.749> what<00:01:58.899> is<00:01:58.929> and

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
the movie that established what is and

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.779 
the movie that established what is and
is<00:01:59.380> not<00:01:59.409> possible<00:01:59.590> in<00:02:00.099> which<00:02:00.159> case<00:02:00.369> that<00:02:00.549> is

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
is not possible in which case that is

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:01.499 
is not possible in which case that is
impossible

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
impossible

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.330 
impossible
