00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
50 unit construction model mine is 62

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.440 
50 unit construction model mine is 62
it's<00:00:58.790> just<00:00:59.000> been<00:00:59.980> modified<00:01:00.980> and

I've<00:01:41.270> really<00:01:42.230> won

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.510 

put<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:45.740> electronic<00:01:46.740> ignition<00:01:47.010> which<00:01:47.370> is

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
put on electronic ignition which is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.010 
put on electronic ignition which is
probably<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> real<00:01:48.240> good<00:01:48.420> move<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.840> these

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
probably a real good move for these

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.570 
probably a real good move for these
things<00:01:49.320> because<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.650> old<00:01:49.800> points<00:01:50.160> they<00:01:50.340> just

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
things because the old points they just

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.300 
things because the old points they just
didn't<00:01:50.940> come

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
didn't come

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:12.790 
didn't come
a<00:01:52.369> bit<00:01:53.619> small<00:01:54.619> some<00:01:54.860> basic

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.980 

it's<00:02:13.800> got<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> whole<00:02:14.190> collection<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.730> them<00:02:14.990> and

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
it's got a whole collection of them and

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.470 
it's got a whole collection of them and
he<00:02:16.710> actually<00:02:16.860> got<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.190> from<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.490> guy<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.000> I

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
he actually got it from a guy and I

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.950 
he actually got it from a guy and I
stood<00:02:19.020> there<00:02:19.440> was<00:02:20.160> 85<00:02:20.850> years<00:02:21.270> old<00:02:21.390> bringing

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
stood there was 85 years old bringing

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.630 
stood there was 85 years old bringing
young<00:02:22.140> when<00:02:22.830> he<00:02:22.920> got<00:02:23.070> off<00:02:23.130> him

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
young when he got off him

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.420 
young when he got off him
and<00:02:23.880> stopped<00:02:24.120> racing<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:25.980> probably<00:02:26.250> done

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
and stopped racing so it's probably done

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.140 
and stopped racing so it's probably done
a<00:02:26.460> few<00:02:26.730> reels<00:02:27.000> before<00:02:27.390> me<00:02:27.950> but<00:02:28.950> we've<00:02:29.820> had<00:02:29.970> to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
a few reels before me but we've had to

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.290 
a few reels before me but we've had to
read<00:02:30.360> modify<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.760> bring<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.850> up<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.030> speed<00:02:33.150> a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
read modify it bring it up to speed a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.070 
read modify it bring it up to speed a
little<00:02:33.510> bit<00:02:33.660> which<00:02:34.110> still<00:02:34.770> gonna<00:02:34.920> need
