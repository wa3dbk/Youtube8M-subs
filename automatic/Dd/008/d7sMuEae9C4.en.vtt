00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.759
 ah 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.010
 what a roll as it is so cheeky that very 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.869
 ok here are the hotel in this 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.140
 I'll bring you a mario gameplay 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.140
 kart 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:29.630
 fifa for you guys who left me there but 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.920
 well I brought them as I said in the first 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.040
 that the race in online by the way 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.809
 I think all are the first 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.290
 places more than aside I'm not 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.010
 safe 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.050
 I have several which decides to upload 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.449
 but I hope you like the video 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.960
 I hope they laugh that he did not win in 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.360
 on-line 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.940
 in the very good numbers although I 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.600
 like to play it 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.910
 it's fun especially as brothers 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.800
 good even with 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.979
 with control to pro computer machine 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.500
 x 1 that we are now also in the 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.690
 southern half but good this is the theme of 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.420
 creator now that he forgot a little bit 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:20.420
 fast I hope you like it and well 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.869
 I was thinking about 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.840
 how has this type of change been changing 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.060
 games racing games 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.300
 I remember that when I was more 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.700
 boy 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.310
 I can improve my games were games 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.159
 careers 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.289
 the resources had the video with racing 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.469
 the best the truth but I had the ex side 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.200
 by then he was a very very good player 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.450
 by the way very good mini-games about 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.840
 everything is football with the pathology of 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.810
 ge was my favorite also the I think that 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.810
 is that of the inmate's examination 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.810
 I do not know sure too very good 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.230
 obviously mark has karts number not 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.140
 do not 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:08.869
 of not having some games other games 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.990
 he also had one that was like 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.370
 futuristic that was called extremely 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.930
 I also really liked a time that 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.930
 I played it almost every day 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.680
 64 as they come more to my mind but 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.260
 I know there are too many more playstation 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.270
 obviously the great tourism very good 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.310
 game by the way for those times 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.370
 I remember that with my first 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.920
 now playing that game 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.530
 we grab the slower cars 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.319
 they are slow and I do not know why but it is the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.350
 last of cure grab says laugh you 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.410
 you laughed 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.430
 and this also the districts when 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.019
 they started to leave 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.810
 I'm not sure I think the first one 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.849
 they are operated precision 2 but of the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.959
 that I remember my favorite has been the 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.290
 harper suit 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.599
 Being first on the cover comes a 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.209
 lamborghini yellow and 2 post back 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.549
 pursuing it very good game by the way 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.090
 as my road says of my favorites if not 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.090
 my favorite 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.579
 also the new games 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:19.740
 forces some projects like the west ham 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:22.020
 the insurance but this is not the strength 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.850
 and then many more games than at 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.390
 better they are not as well known as others 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.890
 but since everyone already knows that they are more 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:35.670
 known is obviously a reader of 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:37.590
 great tourism and mario kart in internal 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.690
 Well, what I wanted to play was 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.120
 what 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.510
 over the years these games have 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.780
 like that lost popularity so 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.319
 say it I'm not sure if that's the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.629
 case 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.920
 pinches birds now first the fish 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.800
 now the birds 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.500
 but good as I said I do not know if they have 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.180
 lost popularity but I feel that they are 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.110
 games that people already like they do not 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.000
 buy or do not enjoy as before 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.000
 that is, they are still very games 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.070
 but I feel good all he has 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.670
 improved have been the graphics because 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.010
 I started but gameplay because it's a game 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.930
 Carranza do not expect that much I will 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.310
 switch to car mode looks more 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.190
 videos or something has more details but it 's 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.470
 the games but the cars have been for 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.740
 example the same ones for several 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.790
 The 2013 model is clarified 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.560
 because different to 2012 or x things but 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.480
 I do not know I think that this type of games 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.180
 It has been like what 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.340
 but it's not as popular as I said 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.800
 has been reflected by most of 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.729
 pressure games like Call of Duty 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.729
 central variety 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.240
 I do not know why it is 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.520
 like a month and it's not the same if it 's not very 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.040
 good games that I would recommend playing 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.650
 games that 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.270
 they enjoy themselves but seriously that is not 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.640
 as before, for example before 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.170
 you can pass because one day a day ago 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.840
 full playing mario kart one day 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.450
 complete when the nitro spiegel and now 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.060
 it's like I do not know is different does not have 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.250
 the same the same joke before that 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.580
 It's just like that I see it I'm not sure 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.580
 your 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.889
 to all this that we are good 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.600
 it was usually one that was called 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:32.600
 motogp motogp for tension created one 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.880
 obviously on motorcycles I also play very 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.980
 well then he remembered that he also played 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.010
 a lot with my cousins like I said hours 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.520
 playing the games and now I do not know if 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:47.390
 we have great tourism 5 ni first and which ones 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:51.140
 not that the most wanted and the rai came out 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.210
 search to leave are good games but 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.720
 you hear it, people talk so many 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.870
 games 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.840
 well that's my point of view as 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:05.440
 I said I listened so much that I can 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.440
 sing so like that but it is my opinion 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.350
 I told myself many times it's not the same anymore 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:17.060
 racing games like before 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:18.740
 they were kept more like the guy what 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.070
 I bought been caught or funds from 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.800
 game and now it 's what you're buying right now 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:28.379
 and already there you leave it in the background but the only 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.509
 but good to say the racita de 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:34.470
 now there's nothing we can see more 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:35.879
 that then if we are interested then highlight 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.849
 the games that people know about and 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:40.650
 leave the little circle in the same ones 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:43.379
 games that always play the same game 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.319
 Juan always to what I street so many 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:48.210
 but how much do they do 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:51.650
 bit difficult 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.650
 for different reasons 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:58.280
 Well Carlos DÃ­az in a video that I take 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:07:00.590
 that entertains you good that thinks that 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.599
 has recorded things that will entertain you 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.490
 but good is all I had to 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:06.080
 say now is that they like this video 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.629
 I know he is very stupid but hey 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:13.370
 the same is because there is a greet 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:15.050
 everyone and I hope that the video will 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.620
 please a little more and we see each other people 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.620
 goodbye
