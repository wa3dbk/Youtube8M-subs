actually changes as you shift focus or
that<00:00:26.970> when<00:00:27.210> you're<00:00:27.330> swapping<00:00:27.539> lenses<00:00:28.019> they're

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
that when you're swapping lenses they're

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.050 
that when you're swapping lenses they're
all<00:00:28.199> different<00:00:28.380> sizes<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.010> filter<00:00:29.789> threads

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
all different sizes and filter threads

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.389 
all different sizes and filter threads
and<00:00:30.240> all<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.480> stuff<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.650> lens<00:00:31.980> set<00:00:32.219> is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and all that stuff so this lens set is

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.040 
and all that stuff so this lens set is
designed<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.180> uniform<00:00:33.660> they're<00:00:33.809> all<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
designed to be uniform they're all the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.360 
designed to be uniform they're all the
same<00:00:34.079> size<00:00:34.440> they<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.890> same<00:00:35.070> front

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
same size they have the same front

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.970 
same size they have the same front
diameter<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.059> when<00:00:37.020> you're<00:00:37.290> focusing

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
diameter and when you're focusing

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.340 
diameter and when you're focusing
nothing<00:00:38.489> moves<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.270> internal<00:00:39.690> focusing

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
nothing moves it's all internal focusing

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.680 
nothing moves it's all internal focusing
and<00:00:40.500> you've<00:00:40.590> got<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> much<00:00:40.950> longer<00:00:41.480> distance<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and you've got a much longer distance to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.260 
and you've got a much longer distance to
actually<00:00:43.200> throw<00:00:43.920> your<00:00:44.190> focus<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.820> when

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
actually throw your focus so that when

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.000 
actually throw your focus so that when
you're<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.930> really<00:00:46.170> dial<00:00:46.469> things<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.920> i

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
you're you can really dial things in i

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.310 
you're you can really dial things in i
think<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.550> 200-degree<00:00:48.079> focus<00:00:49.079> throw

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
think this it's a 200-degree focus throw

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.260 
think this it's a 200-degree focus throw
on<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> lenses<00:00:50.100> themselves<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.789> these<00:00:51.149> are

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and they are all rated at T 1.5 so light

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.439 
and they are all rated at T 1.5 so light
transmission<00:00:59.250> should<00:00:59.609> be<00:00:59.730> uniform<00:01:00.149> across

that there are more to come if these are
successful<00:01:05.280> now<00:01:05.790> these<00:01:05.939> lenses<00:01:06.180> aren't<00:01:06.510> cheap

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
they are much cheaper than other cinema

they are much cheaper than other cinema
lenses<00:01:14.250> each<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.060> these<00:01:15.150> will<00:01:15.390> cost<00:01:15.780> around

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
lenses each of these will cost around

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.560 
lenses each of these will cost around
twenty<00:01:16.530> five<00:01:16.650> hundred<00:01:16.680> dollars<00:01:17.310> apiece<00:01:17.880> which

twenty five hundred dollars apiece which

twenty five hundred dollars apiece which

again is not cheap compared to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.249 
again is not cheap compared to
photography<00:01:20.970> glass<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.509> compared<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> cinema

photography glass but compared to cinema

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.230 
photography glass but compared to cinema
lenses<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:23.280> much<00:01:23.580> more<00:01:23.880> affordable

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
lenses it's much more affordable

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.170 
lenses it's much more affordable
especially<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> ballpark<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:27.000> being

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
especially it's in the ballpark of being

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.910 
especially it's in the ballpark of being
reasonably<00:01:27.659> affordable<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.320> an<00:01:28.380> individual

reasonably affordable for an individual

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.920 
reasonably affordable for an individual
but<00:01:29.070> still<00:01:29.430> something<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.479> might<00:01:30.689> want

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
but still something that you might want

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.410 
but still something that you might want
to<00:01:31.110> consider<00:01:31.439> renting<00:01:31.799> now<00:01:32.729> we'll<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.270> as

to consider renting now we'll see as

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.819 
to consider renting now we'll see as
more<00:01:33.600> tests<00:01:33.840> come<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.320> haven't<00:01:34.619> personally

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
more tests come out I haven't personally

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.679 
more tests come out I haven't personally
shot<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.430> these<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.790> cannot<00:01:36.150> speak<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
shot with these so I cannot speak to

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.230 
shot with these so I cannot speak to
their<00:01:36.900> optical<00:01:37.799> quality<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.670> their<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
their optical quality and their the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.030 
their optical quality and their the
quality<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.900> their<00:01:40.079> image<00:01:40.409> characteristics

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
quality of their image characteristics

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740 
quality of their image characteristics
but<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> trend<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.150> rokinon<00:01:42.600> is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
but I do like the trend that rokinon is

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.420 
but I do like the trend that rokinon is
on<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.079> bringing<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.470> stuff<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:44.280> people

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
on and bringing this stuff to people

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.880 
on and bringing this stuff to people
that<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.060> much<00:01:45.270> more<00:01:45.450> affordable<00:01:45.750> price<00:01:46.530> point

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that a much more affordable price point

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.830 
that a much more affordable price point
so<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.520> things<00:01:47.880> are<00:01:48.000> cheaper<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.689> more

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
so that things are cheaper and it's more

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.899 
so that things are cheaper and it's more
accessible<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.380> all<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.770> us<00:01:49.890> most<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.549> my<00:01:50.640> glass

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
accessible to all of us most of my glass

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.420 
accessible to all of us most of my glass
that<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> own<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.810> photography<00:01:52.320> lenses<00:01:53.220> just

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
that I own is photography lenses just

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.280 
that I own is photography lenses just
because<00:01:53.700> that's<00:01:53.939> what<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.540> affordable<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
because that's what is affordable and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.749 
because that's what is affordable and
for<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.560> most<00:01:55.740> part<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.280> make<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.549> work

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
for the most part you can make it work

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.719 
for the most part you can make it work
there<00:01:57.360> are<00:01:57.570> some<00:01:58.049> quirks<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.219> issues<00:01:59.579> that

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
there are some quirks and issues that

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.709 
there are some quirks and issues that
you<00:01:59.820> have<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.119> work<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:00.420> when<00:02:00.600> you're

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
you have to work out when you're

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.020 
you have to work out when you're
switching<00:02:00.930> from<00:02:01.259> lens<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.649> lens<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.850> end

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
switching from lens to lens but the end

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.179 
switching from lens to lens but the end
result<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.570> image<00:02:03.750> quality<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.350> usually

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
result the image quality it's usually

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.180 
result the image quality it's usually
there<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.270> make<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.600> work<00:02:06.810> but

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
there and you can make it work but

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.619 
there and you can make it work but
what's<00:02:08.190> something<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.879> you'd<00:02:09.330> have

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
what's something like this you'd have

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.479 
what's something like this you'd have
hopefully<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.649> image<00:02:10.950> quality<00:02:11.129> they're

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
hopefully that image quality they're

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.600 
hopefully that image quality they're
broken<00:02:11.700> on<00:02:11.879> makes<00:02:12.120> really<00:02:12.720> nice<00:02:12.959> lenses<00:02:13.349> I

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
broken on makes really nice lenses I

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.810 
broken on makes really nice lenses I
it<00:02:13.670> owned<00:02:13.880> their<00:02:14.330> 35<00:02:14.900> f<00:02:15.260> 1.4<00:02:15.770> for<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.280> while<00:02:16.430> love

it owned their 35 f 1.4 for a while love
that<00:02:16.970> lens<00:02:17.180> ended<00:02:17.570> up<00:02:17.660> selling<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.050> because<00:02:18.200> I

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
that lens ended up selling it because I

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.500 
that lens ended up selling it because I
got<00:02:18.590> something<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.920> replace<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.430> but<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.090> really

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
got something to replace it but I really

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.540 
got something to replace it but I really
like<00:02:20.690> their<00:02:20.900> class<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.740> like<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.160> see<00:02:22.340> them

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550

photography lenses to that way kind of

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.090 
photography lenses to that way kind of
get<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.420> best<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.720> both<00:02:29.780> worlds<00:02:30.350> but<00:02:30.830> if<00:02:30.980> you

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
get the best of both worlds but if you

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.290 
get the best of both worlds but if you
are<00:02:31.130> considering<00:02:31.550> getting<00:02:31.820> one<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.120> these

little bit more limited in terms of what
you<00:02:42.980> can<00:02:43.130> use<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.430> lenses<00:02:43.730> on<00:02:43.850> later<00:02:44.240> those

mountains<00:02:45.590> have<00:02:45.740> a<00:02:45.800> smaller<00:02:46.220> flange<00:02:46.670> distance

mountains have a smaller flange distance

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.900 
mountains have a smaller flange distance
so<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.510> can't<00:02:47.870> REM<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:49.370> something<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:49.880> a

so you can't REM to something with a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.000 
so you can't REM to something with a
bigger<00:02:50.180> flange<00:02:50.540> distance<00:02:50.990> so<00:02:51.110> say<00:02:51.320> like<00:02:51.560> for
