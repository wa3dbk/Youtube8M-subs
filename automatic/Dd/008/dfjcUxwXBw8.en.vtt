00:00:00.357 --> 00:00:05.357
Let's go to our first game,
it's called "Questions only".

00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:08.908
You guys at my right,
give me a place.

00:00:09.647 --> 00:00:15.419
Right. Let's try to not involve
penises or vaginas. I don't know.

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:19.636
There's this guy asking
"Gay sauna! Gay sauna!" Always.

00:00:19.636 --> 00:00:24.197
They were doing a show in Curitiba,
and there was "Gay sauna!"

00:00:24.197 --> 00:00:28.247
It was the same guy! He follows
Improvável just to yell "Gay sauna!"

00:00:28.247 --> 00:00:32.341
Poor Andy, he went to the subway
and there was "Gay sauna!"

00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:34.600
He's a stalker.

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.312
A place. Bring it on.

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.654
Open market. That's sweet.

00:00:42.654 --> 00:00:47.500
"Questions Only".
Cris, he will... I mean her...

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.812
Cris and Andy, right?

00:00:50.812 --> 00:00:53.047
Actually, all four of them play,
and the two will start.

00:00:53.612 --> 00:00:57.663
It's a game made only with questions,
they will make up a situation,

00:00:57.663 --> 00:01:01.289
at the open market, and they can only ask questions.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.442
When Cris fails, Elidio will enter.

00:01:03.442 --> 00:01:06.171
When Andy fails, Daniel will enter.

00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:10.942
The goal is to be on the scene for
the most time, only asking questions.

00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:13.573
"Questions only" at the open market, go.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.966
- How much is the papaya?
- How many do you want?

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.567
How many can you carry?

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:24.709
- Do you want papayas and pears too?
- Is there a discount?

00:01:37.277 --> 00:01:41.896
- Can you get your cart off of here?
- Who are you, the owner of this street?

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:46.519
- Can't you see I want to pass?
- You could lose some weight, right?

00:01:47.444 --> 00:01:51.211
Don't you know how that hurts?

00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:56.012
Want to buy some diet pills?

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.647
- Is there a discount?
- How much do you wanna pay?

00:02:14.713 --> 00:02:20.411
- Selling a lot? - You know you're
pretty hot for a marketer?

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:26.102
Would you like some fruits, ma'am?

00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:32.946
You have some really nice fruits... No!

00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:39.819
How much did you sell?

00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:43.959
Only 7 fishes, do you believe it?

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.789
- You think that's not much?
- How much did you sell?

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.777
Can you believe it was more than 15?

00:02:49.777 --> 00:02:52.133
What is your secret?

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:06.149
Is this fish fresh?

00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:09.064
Can't you see it's a mullet?

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.335
So mullets are now supposed to be fresh?

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.725
If you...

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:27.135
- Are these fruits fresh?
- Would you like to try some?

00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:29.529
Can't you see I'm an inspector?

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.778
You are here again?

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.987
Aren't you gonna pay?

00:03:43.526 --> 00:03:45.717
How much does he owe you?

00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:47.627
Are you his friend?

00:03:47.985 --> 00:03:50.089
Can't you see my name tag?

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:52.414
Can you give him my number?

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.494
Can I have your number?

00:03:55.933 --> 00:03:59.181
Can't you hear I want him
to have my number?

00:03:59.181 --> 00:04:01.533
Are you giving your number
to strangers again?

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:04.524
Honey, you're here?

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.759
Is this game becoming some kind of orgy?

00:04:08.854 --> 00:04:11.261
Well, not yet.

00:04:18.934 --> 00:04:21.423
That's great!

00:04:22.282 --> 00:04:23.857
- "Questions Only"!
- Way to go!

00:04:23.857 --> 00:04:27.171
- Pretty good.
- When you let me in, I'm really in.

00:04:27.171 --> 00:04:30.870
IMPROVÁVEL
Probably a good show.
