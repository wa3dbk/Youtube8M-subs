this<00:00:47.039> trick<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.340> kind<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.760> deceiving<00:00:48.030> starts

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
this trick is kind of deceiving starts

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.260 
this trick is kind of deceiving starts
off<00:00:48.870> completely<00:00:49.440> laid<00:00:49.829> down<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.030> goal

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
off completely laid down but the goal

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.880 
off completely laid down but the goal
essentially<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.320> create<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> lot<00:00:52.770> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
essentially is to create a lot of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
essentially is to create a lot of
momentum<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.520> put<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.059> into<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.570> foot<00:00:54.899> as

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
momentum and put it into this foot as

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.430 
momentum and put it into this foot as
you<00:00:55.350> lift<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:56.070> body<00:00:56.250> up<00:00:57.109> caster<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you lift your body up caster it to the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.990 
you lift your body up caster it to the
side<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.829> when<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:58.980> say<00:00:59.190> caster<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> mean

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
side and when I say caster I mean

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.060 
side and when I say caster I mean
instead<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:00.870> over<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.289> ledge<00:01:01.590> getting

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
instead of going over this ledge getting

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
instead of going over this ledge getting
your<00:01:02.190> body<00:01:02.539> caster<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.960> side<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.760> doing<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
your body caster to the side and doing a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.690 
your body caster to the side and doing a
backflip<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:06.869> some<00:01:07.110> variation<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.860> so

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
backflip or some variation of that so

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.240 
backflip or some variation of that so
check<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:09.930> first<00:01:10.470> thing<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.010> need<00:01:11.220> to

with whatever you're using and make sure

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.840 
with whatever you're using and make sure
that<00:01:23.100> your<00:01:23.280> ledge<00:01:23.520> itself<00:01:24.030> is

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
that your ledge itself is

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.050 
that your ledge itself is
Rippey<00:01:25.390> enough<00:01:25.900> okay<00:01:26.500> this<00:01:27.280> particular<00:01:27.820> ledge

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
Rippey enough okay this particular ledge

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.179 
Rippey enough okay this particular ledge
isn't<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:29.140> creepiest<00:01:29.770> thing<00:01:29.890> in<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.040> world

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
isn't the creepiest thing in the world

isn't the creepiest thing in the world
but<00:01:30.580> it<00:01:30.759> will<00:01:30.970> do<00:01:31.360> especially<00:01:31.930> because<00:01:32.080> I<00:01:32.409> got

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
but it will do especially because I got

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.850 
but it will do especially because I got
that<00:01:32.979> shoe<00:01:33.250> all<00:01:33.700> right<00:01:33.790> let's<00:01:34.210> do<00:01:34.299> it<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.710> check

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
it out there's a couple different ways

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.180 
it out there's a couple different ways
that<00:01:37.150> you<00:01:37.270> guys<00:01:37.390> can<00:01:37.630> do<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:37.810> I'm<00:01:38.740> teaching

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
that you guys can do this I'm teaching

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.399 
that you guys can do this I'm teaching
you<00:01:39.310> on<00:01:39.460> somewhat<00:01:39.970> of<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.149> lower<00:01:40.390> ledge<00:01:40.750> so<00:01:41.380> a

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
you on somewhat of a lower ledge so a

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.920 
you on somewhat of a lower ledge so a
lot<00:01:41.830> of<00:01:41.860> my<00:01:42.130> technique<00:01:43.000> in<00:01:43.180> this<00:01:43.360> is<00:01:43.540> going<00:01:43.750> to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
lot of my technique in this is going to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.800 
lot of my technique in this is going to
be<00:01:44.110> trying<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:44.740> get<00:01:45.100> our<00:01:45.340> body<00:01:45.640> up<00:01:45.940> into<00:01:46.360> the

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
be trying to get our body up into the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.920 
be trying to get our body up into the
air<00:01:46.990> if<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:48.130> want<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.520> much<00:01:48.729> higher<00:01:48.970> ledge<00:01:49.330> you

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
air if you want a much higher ledge you

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.719 
air if you want a much higher ledge you
can<00:01:50.049> actually<00:01:50.470> do<00:01:50.619> a<00:01:50.649> lot<00:01:51.039> less<00:01:51.369> of<00:01:51.610> the

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
can actually do a lot less of the

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.240 
can actually do a lot less of the
lifting<00:01:52.180> part<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:52.750> sort<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:53.680> just<00:01:53.890> cheat

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
lifting part and sort of just cheat

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.240 
lifting part and sort of just cheat
yourself<00:01:54.700> over<00:01:55.360> here<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.080> push<00:01:56.950> straight

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
yourself over here and push straight

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.309 
yourself over here and push straight
back<00:01:57.280> because<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:57.970> have<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.119> lot<00:01:58.330> more<00:01:58.360> time<00:01:58.780> to

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
back because you have a lot more time to

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.440 
back because you have a lot more time to
travel<00:01:59.560> up<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.250> over<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:00.729> get<00:02:00.850> your<00:02:00.940> rotation

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
travel up and over and get your rotation

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.059 
travel up and over and get your rotation
so<00:02:01.960> this<00:02:02.830> one<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:05.140> key<00:02:05.380> again<00:02:05.830> this<00:02:06.009> is

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
so this one is the key again this is

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.649 
so this one is the key again this is
going<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.250> be<00:02:06.340> very<00:02:06.520> important<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.030> try<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.300> get

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
going to be very important to try to get

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.870 
going to be very important to try to get
our<00:02:07.869> momentum<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:08.500> grip<00:02:08.649> into<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.100> foot<00:02:09.369> our

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
our momentum and grip into this foot our

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.690 
our momentum and grip into this foot our
body<00:02:10.179> is<00:02:10.360> starting<00:02:10.660> late<00:02:10.989> back<00:02:11.319> okay<00:02:11.890> from

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
body is starting late back okay from

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.900 
body is starting late back okay from
this<00:02:12.910> position<00:02:13.470> we<00:02:14.470> need<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.800> create<00:02:15.069> enough

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
this position we need to create enough

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.050 
this position we need to create enough
momentum<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:17.350> get<00:02:17.530> our<00:02:17.799> body<00:02:18.010> moving<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:18.940> what

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
momentum to get our body moving so what

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.970 
momentum to get our body moving so what
I<00:02:19.120> tend<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.450> do<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.780> drive<00:02:20.080> my<00:02:20.260> arms<00:02:20.560> forward

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
I tend to do is drive my arms forward

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.780 
I tend to do is drive my arms forward
and<00:02:21.069> then<00:02:21.940> around<00:02:22.660> small<00:02:23.470> like<00:02:23.709> back<00:02:24.310> circle

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
and then around small like back circle

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.930 
and then around small like back circle
and<00:02:24.970> get<00:02:25.600> my<00:02:25.780> lift<00:02:26.140> up<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.799> side<00:02:27.010> okay

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
and get my lift up and to the side okay

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.270 
and get my lift up and to the side okay
so<00:02:28.420> from<00:02:28.600> here<00:02:28.870> it's<00:02:29.410> all<00:02:29.560> about<00:02:29.799> trying<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.100> do

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
so from here it's all about trying to do

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.840 
so from here it's all about trying to do
a<00:02:30.340> good<00:02:30.519> strong<00:02:30.970> sit<00:02:31.360> up<00:02:31.480> boom<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.410> then<00:02:32.850> here

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
a good strong sit up boom and then here

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.430 
a good strong sit up boom and then here
is<00:02:34.000> where<00:02:34.329> everything<00:02:34.720> else<00:02:34.989> starts<00:02:35.320> to

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
is where everything else starts to

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.880 
is where everything else starts to
happen<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:36.280> foot<00:02:36.549> needs<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.910> be<00:02:37.000> planted

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
happen this foot needs to be planted

we got this front view take a look my
and<00:02:54.230> an<00:02:54.380> angle<00:02:54.860> that<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.040> Drive<00:02:55.280> them<00:02:55.550> up<00:02:55.760> and

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
and an angle that I Drive them up and

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.520 
and an angle that I Drive them up and
over<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.540> going<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.750> be<00:02:56.840> important<00:02:57.260> it's<00:02:57.440> not

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
over is going to be important it's not

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.680 
over is going to be important it's not
going<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.890> be<00:02:57.980> straight<00:02:58.400> over<00:02:58.700> my<00:02:58.850> head<00:02:59.060> okay

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
so after I get that initial drive from

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.070 
so after I get that initial drive from
the<00:03:02.780> sit<00:03:03.170> up<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.670> then<00:03:04.670> drive<00:03:05.000> my<00:03:05.240> arms<00:03:05.570> up<00:03:05.780> and

now a lot of power is gonna be needed

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.420 
now a lot of power is gonna be needed
out<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.359> this<00:03:51.450> leg<00:03:51.689> but<00:03:52.019> as<00:03:52.170> long<00:03:52.650> as<00:03:52.799> we<00:03:52.920> lift

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
out of this leg but as long as we lift

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.399 
out of this leg but as long as we lift
our<00:03:53.670> self<00:03:53.969> up<00:03:54.180> with<00:03:54.329> our<00:03:54.480> arms<00:03:54.870> using<00:03:55.139> that

our self up with our arms using that
little<00:03:55.650> circle<00:03:55.889> and<00:03:56.099> getting<00:03:56.370> ourselves

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
little circle and getting ourselves

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.819 
little circle and getting ourselves
enough<00:03:57.180> height<00:03:57.420> this<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.230> where<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.650> really

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
enough height this is where it really

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.920 
enough height this is where it really
gets<00:03:58.920> nice<00:03:59.280> because<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.639> have<00:03:59.670> this<00:04:00.060> foot<00:04:00.359> to

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
gets nice because you have this foot to

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.520 
gets nice because you have this foot to
really<00:04:01.290> help<00:04:01.500> drive<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.459> up<00:04:02.750> if<00:04:03.750> for<00:04:04.409> whatever

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
really help drive you up if for whatever

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.500 
really help drive you up if for whatever
reason<00:04:04.739> you<00:04:05.159> don't<00:04:05.189> feel<00:04:05.609> like<00:04:05.819> your<00:04:05.999> legs<00:04:06.209> are

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
reason you don't feel like your legs are

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.390 
reason you don't feel like your legs are
strong<00:04:06.780> enough<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.169> be<00:04:07.260> doing<00:04:07.409> this<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:08.310> could

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
strong enough to be doing this you could

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.220 
strong enough to be doing this you could
work<00:04:08.609> on<00:04:08.760> things<00:04:09.060> called<00:04:09.329> pistols<00:04:09.959> okay

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
work on things called pistols okay

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.979 
work on things called pistols okay
pistols<00:04:10.709> are<00:04:10.980> one-legged<00:04:11.579> squats<00:04:12.060> even<00:04:12.840> just

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
pistols are one-legged squats even just

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.599 
pistols are one-legged squats even just
doing<00:04:13.109> regular<00:04:13.290> scotch<00:04:13.680> will<00:04:13.859> actually<00:04:14.459> help

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
doing regular scotch will actually help

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.969 
doing regular scotch will actually help
but<00:04:15.209> if<00:04:15.299> this<00:04:15.449> is<00:04:15.629> your<00:04:15.780> leg<00:04:15.989> if<00:04:16.590> you're<00:04:16.829> not

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
but if this is your leg if you're not

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.120 
but if this is your leg if you're not
able<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.489> do<00:04:17.759> a<00:04:17.789> pistol<00:04:18.329> from<00:04:18.690> here<00:04:18.959> up<00:04:19.229> then

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
able to do a pistol from here up then

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.460 
able to do a pistol from here up then
it's<00:04:20.519> gonna<00:04:20.669> be<00:04:20.759> a<00:04:20.910> lot<00:04:21.209> harder<00:04:21.539> for<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:22.320> be

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
it's gonna be a lot harder for you to be

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.920 
it's gonna be a lot harder for you to be
able<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.680> be<00:04:22.830> explosive<00:04:23.669> in<00:04:23.910> this<00:04:24.180> foot<00:04:24.449> as<00:04:24.630> you

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
able to be explosive in this foot as you

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.279 
able to be explosive in this foot as you
drive<00:04:25.229> now<00:04:26.009> again<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.460> mentioned<00:04:27.000> higher<00:04:27.900> is

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
drive now again I mentioned higher is

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.710 
drive now again I mentioned higher is
going<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.800> be<00:04:28.889> easier<00:04:29.280> clearly<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.360> could<00:04:30.539> be

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
going to be easier clearly it could be

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.120 
going to be easier clearly it could be
more<00:04:30.900> dangerous<00:04:31.080> if<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.680> don't<00:04:31.860> get<00:04:31.979> the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
more dangerous if you don't get the

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.439 
more dangerous if you don't get the
right<00:04:32.250> technique<00:04:32.669> you're<00:04:32.849> enough<00:04:33.120> falling

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
right technique you're enough falling

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.640 
right technique you're enough falling
from<00:04:33.599> a<00:04:33.690> higher<00:04:33.870> spot<00:04:34.770> but<00:04:36.229> from<00:04:37.229> lower<00:04:37.410> you're

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
from a higher spot but from lower you're

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.719 
from a higher spot but from lower you're
really<00:04:37.860> gonna<00:04:37.949> need<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.280> really<00:04:38.490> drive

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
really gonna need to really drive

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.260 
really gonna need to really drive
through<00:04:39.000> that<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:39.660> as<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.830> drive<00:04:41.130> this<00:04:41.940> leg

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
through that so as you drive this leg

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.540 
through that so as you drive this leg
comes<00:04:42.630> in<00:04:42.810> driving<00:04:43.349> that<00:04:43.470> shin<00:04:43.919> and<00:04:44.099> knee<00:04:44.280> I

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
comes in driving that shin and knee I

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.339 
comes in driving that shin and knee I
think<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.060> focus<00:04:45.360> of<00:04:45.630> your<00:04:45.690> energy<00:04:46.139> isn't

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
think the focus of your energy isn't

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.520 
think the focus of your energy isn't
going<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:46.620> be<00:04:46.680> through<00:04:46.889> the<00:04:46.919> toe<00:04:48.080> because<00:04:49.080> both

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
going to be through the toe because both

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.439 
going to be through the toe because both
legs<00:04:49.800> need<00:04:50.039> to<00:04:50.130> come<00:04:50.310> up<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.729> end<00:04:51.120> up<00:04:51.240> working

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
legs need to come up and end up working

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.689 
legs need to come up and end up working
together<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.139> from<00:04:52.349> this<00:04:52.530> point<00:04:52.770> it's<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.520> back

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
together and from this point it's a back

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.490 
together and from this point it's a back
flip<00:04:53.940> your<00:04:54.570> arms<00:04:54.870> are<00:04:54.990> already<00:04:55.110> doing<00:04:55.409> a<00:04:55.470> lot

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
flip your arms are already doing a lot

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.589 
flip your arms are already doing a lot
of<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.770> work<00:04:55.949> it's<00:04:56.520> almost<00:04:56.759> like<00:04:57.030> a<00:04:57.060> slightly

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
of the work it's almost like a slightly

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.390 
of the work it's almost like a slightly
whipped<00:04:58.110> back<00:04:58.349> because<00:04:59.039> you're<00:04:59.159> allowing

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
whipped back because you're allowing

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.180 
whipped back because you're allowing
your<00:04:59.610> head<00:04:59.849> and<00:05:00.570> arms<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.259> take<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:01.680> most<00:05:01.949> of

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
your head and arms to take you most of

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.730 
your head and arms to take you most of
the<00:05:02.340> bakflip<00:05:02.789> way<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.270> then<00:05:03.870> spot<00:05:04.349> the<00:05:04.500> ground

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
the bakflip way and then spot the ground

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.749 
the bakflip way and then spot the ground
balls<00:05:05.699> of<00:05:05.909> the<00:05:05.970> feet<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.419> that's<00:05:07.139> pretty<00:05:07.530> much

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 
balls of the feet and that's pretty much

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.089 
balls of the feet and that's pretty much
the<00:05:08.759> key<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.330> doing<00:05:09.479> this<00:05:09.630> move<00:05:10.020> so<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:10.770> lot<00:05:11.070> of

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
the key to doing this move so a lot of

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.890 
the key to doing this move so a lot of
practice<00:05:11.490> is<00:05:11.610> going<00:05:11.729> to<00:05:11.789> be<00:05:11.909> needed<00:05:12.240> in<00:05:12.389> terms

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
practice is going to be needed in terms

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.980 
practice is going to be needed in terms
of<00:05:13.139> progressions<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:14.039> think<00:05:14.599> caster<00:05:15.599> gainers

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
of progressions I think caster gainers

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.110 
of progressions I think caster gainers
where<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:16.800> just<00:05:16.949> swing<00:05:17.250> leg<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.729> get<00:05:17.820> used<00:05:18.000> to

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
where you just swing leg and get used to

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.899 
where you just swing leg and get used to
going<00:05:18.270> sideways<00:05:18.630> with<00:05:19.050> your<00:05:19.169> back<00:05:19.320> flips

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
going sideways with your back flips

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.010 
going sideways with your back flips
obviously<00:05:20.909> being<00:05:21.330> able<00:05:21.509> to<00:05:21.690> do<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:21.840> regular

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
obviously being able to do a regular

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.820 
obviously being able to do a regular
backflip<00:05:22.620> is<00:05:22.770> definitely<00:05:23.159> going<00:05:23.310> to<00:05:23.400> help<00:05:23.669> and

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
backflip is definitely going to help and

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.260 
backflip is definitely going to help and
that's<00:05:25.830> it<00:05:26.070> I<00:05:26.099> guess<00:05:26.340> your<00:05:26.520> other<00:05:26.669> progression

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
that's it I guess your other progression

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.200 
that's it I guess your other progression
and<00:05:27.620> prereq<00:05:28.620> would<00:05:28.830> be<00:05:28.979> able<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.550> just<00:05:29.909> lounge

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
and prereq would be able to just lounge

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.460 
and prereq would be able to just lounge
and<00:05:30.570> relax<00:05:30.870> you<00:05:31.110> know<00:05:31.199> that<00:05:31.320> man

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
and relax you know that man

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:51.160 
and relax you know that man
