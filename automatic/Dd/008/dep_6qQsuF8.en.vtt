abstract understanding it thoroughly is

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.290 
abstract understanding it thoroughly is
important<00:00:21.740> since<00:00:22.340> it<00:00:22.550> is<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.759> basis<00:00:23.180> of

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
important since it is the basis of

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.749 
important since it is the basis of
solving<00:00:23.750> problems<00:00:23.779> in<00:00:24.349> algebra<00:00:24.830> we<00:00:25.640> will

properties<00:00:36.410> in<00:00:36.559> our<00:00:36.770> previous<00:00:37.130> lesson<00:00:37.640> but<00:00:38.239> we

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
properties in our previous lesson but we

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.880 
properties in our previous lesson but we
will<00:00:38.480> give<00:00:38.630> the<00:00:38.780> definition<00:00:38.930> of<00:00:39.440> each<00:00:39.590> of<00:00:39.770> them

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
will give the definition of each of them

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.490 
will give the definition of each of them
here<00:00:40.510> first<00:00:41.510> we<00:00:41.899> have<00:00:41.989> closure<00:00:42.260> under

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
here first we have closure under

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.770 
here first we have closure under
addition<00:00:42.649> and<00:00:43.129> multiplication<00:00:43.780> under

if x equals negative 2 for example the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.630 
if x equals negative 2 for example the
inverse<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:25.670> 2<00:01:26.290> for<00:01:27.290> multiplication<00:01:28.100> we<00:01:28.460> have

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
inverse is 2 for multiplication we have

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.820 
inverse is 2 for multiplication we have
that<00:01:28.820> for<00:01:29.000> any<00:01:29.090> real<00:01:29.330> number<00:01:29.630> X<00:01:29.840> there<00:01:30.320> exists

multiplicative inverse is the reciprocal
so<00:01:36.740> if<00:01:36.860> x<00:01:37.070> equals<00:01:37.220> 3/4<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.690> multiplicative

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
so if x equals 3/4 the multiplicative

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.610 
so if x equals 3/4 the multiplicative
inverse<00:01:39.500> is<00:01:40.010> 4/3<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.840> third<00:01:42.080> property<00:01:42.500> is

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
inverse is 4/3 the third property is

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.710 
inverse is 4/3 the third property is
identity<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.610> statement<00:01:44.030> of<00:01:44.120> this<00:01:44.240> property

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.249 
likewise for multiplication we say that
there<00:02:05.399> exists<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.880> real<00:02:06.060> number<00:02:06.359> X<00:02:06.570> such<00:02:07.229> that

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
there exists a real number X such that

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.580 
there exists a real number X such that
for<00:02:07.619> any<00:02:07.710> real<00:02:08.009> number<00:02:08.340> y<00:02:08.580> x<00:02:09.269> times<00:02:09.629> y<00:02:09.869> equals<00:02:10.349> y

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
for any real number y x times y equals y

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.400 
for any real number y x times y equals y
the<00:02:11.370> multiplicative<00:02:12.060> identity<00:02:12.150> element<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.140> 1

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the multiplicative identity element is 1

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.449 
the multiplicative identity element is 1
so<00:02:14.340> X<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.760> 1<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.269> if<00:02:15.540> Y<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.900> 8<00:02:16.260> we<00:02:16.800> have<00:02:16.950> 1<00:02:17.190> times

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
so X is 1 and if Y is 8 we have 1 times

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.900 
so X is 1 and if Y is 8 we have 1 times
8<00:02:17.700> equals<00:02:17.910> 8<00:02:19.069> next<00:02:20.069> we<00:02:20.220> have<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> associative

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
8 equals 8 next we have the associative

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.240 
8 equals 8 next we have the associative
property<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:22.049> addition<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:22.620> says<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.069> for

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
property for addition this says that for

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.539 
property for addition this says that for
any<00:02:23.340> real<00:02:23.610> numbers<00:02:23.970> x<00:02:24.180> y&amp;z<00:02:24.810> adding<00:02:25.680> X<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> Y<00:02:26.190> and

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
any real numbers x y&amp;z adding X to Y and

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.570 
any real numbers x y&amp;z adding X to Y and
then<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:27.090> Z<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.049> same<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.470> adding<00:02:28.739> Y<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.160> Z

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
then to Z is the same as adding Y to Z

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.150 
then to Z is the same as adding Y to Z
and<00:02:29.819> then<00:02:30.150> adding<00:02:30.510> X<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.049> sum<00:02:31.349> for

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
and then adding X to that sum for

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.710 
and then adding X to that sum for
example<00:02:32.610> if<00:02:32.849> X<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.360> 3<00:02:33.420> y<00:02:34.379> is<00:02:34.440> 2<00:02:34.829> and<00:02:35.130> Z<00:02:35.610> is<00:02:35.730> 8<00:02:35.970> we

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
example if X is 3 y is 2 and Z is 8 we

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.710 
example if X is 3 y is 2 and Z is 8 we
can<00:02:36.840> add<00:02:37.019> 3<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:37.380> 2<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.829> get<00:02:37.980> 5<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.640> add<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.510> to

real numbers x and y x plus y equals y
plus<00:03:29.190> X<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.750> if<00:03:30.870> x<00:03:31.079> equals<00:03:31.200> 2<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.889> y<00:03:32.099> equals<00:03:32.400> 3

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
plus X so if x equals 2 and y equals 3

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.589 
plus X so if x equals 2 and y equals 3
we<00:03:33.269> have<00:03:33.389> 2<00:03:33.569> plus<00:03:33.840> 3<00:03:34.109> equals<00:03:34.349> 5<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.090> 3<00:03:36.090> plus<00:03:36.329> 2

we have 2 plus 3 equals 5 and 3 plus 2

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.610 
we have 2 plus 3 equals 5 and 3 plus 2
is<00:03:36.810> also<00:03:37.319> 5<00:03:38.120> for<00:03:39.120> multiplication<00:03:39.540> we<00:03:40.200> say<00:03:40.440> that

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
is also 5 for multiplication we say that

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.979 
is also 5 for multiplication we say that

for real numbers x and y x times y

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.550 
for real numbers x and y x times y
equals<00:03:43.530> y<00:03:43.709> times<00:03:44.010> x<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:45.090> if<00:03:45.209> x<00:03:45.419> equals<00:03:45.540> 6<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.260> y

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
equals y times x so if x equals 6 and y

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.000 
equals y times x so if x equals 6 and y
equals<00:03:46.859> 7<00:03:47.250> we<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.910> 6<00:03:48.209> times<00:03:48.419> 7<00:03:48.720> equals<00:03:49.139> 42<00:03:49.530> on

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
equals 7 we have 6 times 7 equals 42 on

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.190

the<00:03:50.700> other<00:03:50.819> hand<00:03:51.090> 7<00:03:51.750> times<00:03:52.049> 6<00:03:52.290> is<00:03:52.560> also<00:03:53.040> 42

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
the other hand 7 times 6 is also 42

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.240 
the other hand 7 times 6 is also 42
