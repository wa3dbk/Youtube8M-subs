00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.519 

let's<00:00:03.540> start<00:00:03.719> out<00:00:03.840> by<00:00:03.960> taking<00:00:04.230> that<00:00:04.319> loop

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
let's start out by taking that loop

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.530 
let's start out by taking that loop
that's<00:00:04.740> at<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:04.980> end<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.279> wrap<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:06.420> we're

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
that's at the end of the wrap and we're

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.880 
that's at the end of the wrap and we're
gonna<00:00:06.630> loop<00:00:06.900> around<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.319> thumb<00:00:07.500> that's<00:00:07.740> your

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
gonna loop around the thumb that's your

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.039 
gonna loop around the thumb that's your
anchor<00:00:08.129> point<00:00:08.160> for<00:00:08.549> the<00:00:08.610> rest<00:00:08.930> we're<00:00:09.930> gonna

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:10.049 
anchor point for the rest we're gonna

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:11.510 
anchor point for the rest we're gonna
take<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.740> if<00:00:10.830> you<00:00:10.980> notice<00:00:11.250> I'm<00:00:11.369> working

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520 
take that and if you notice I'm working

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.189 
take that and if you notice I'm working
toward<00:00:11.879> the<00:00:11.969> outside<00:00:12.449> of<00:00:12.600> my<00:00:12.719> hand<00:00:12.990> here

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:13.199 
toward the outside of my hand here

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.160 
toward the outside of my hand here
always<00:00:13.559> work<00:00:13.920> toward<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.279> outside<00:00:15.170> we're

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
always work toward the outside we're

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.810 
always work toward the outside we're
going<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.379> go<00:00:16.500> around<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.920> wrist<00:00:17.100> two<00:00:17.550> times

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
going to go around the wrist two times

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.260 
going to go around the wrist two times
laying<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.690> nice<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:18.870> flat<00:00:19.970> working<00:00:20.970> toward

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
laying it nice and flat working toward

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.850 
laying it nice and flat working toward
the<00:00:21.360> outside<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:21.960> two<00:00:22.140> circles<00:00:22.530> around<00:00:22.620> the

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
the outside so two circles around the

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.790 
the outside so two circles around the
wrist<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.310> then<00:00:24.000> come<00:00:24.600> back<00:00:24.630> up<00:00:25.050> through<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
wrist and then come back up through the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.440 
wrist and then come back up through the
hands<00:00:26.250> -<00:00:26.400> I'm<00:00:26.520> coming<00:00:26.820> underneath<00:00:27.030> the<00:00:27.270> hand

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450
