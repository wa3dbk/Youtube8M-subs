00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
the benefit of adding a bit like this it

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.550 
the benefit of adding a bit like this it
only<00:02:20.189> has<00:02:20.519> about<00:02:21.299> this<00:02:21.689> bet<00:02:21.870> has<00:02:21.989> about<00:02:22.170> seven

only has about this bet has about seven

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.949 
only has about this bet has about seven
or<00:02:22.620> eight<00:02:22.769> greens<00:02:23.099> is<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.879> elasticity<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.840> the

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
or eight greens is the elasticity in the

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.559 
or eight greens is the elasticity in the
woods<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.439> the<00:02:26.010> grains<00:02:26.879> are<00:02:27.090> loose<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.420> little

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
woods so the grains are loose a little

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.550 
woods so the grains are loose a little
bit<00:02:27.689> wider<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.939> so<00:02:29.939> you've<00:02:30.180> gotten<00:02:30.629> more

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
bit wider and so you've gotten more

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.530 
bit wider and so you've gotten more
elasticity<00:02:32.549> in<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.909> willow<00:02:33.090> because<00:02:33.450> you

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
elasticity in the willow because you

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.240 
elasticity in the willow because you
have<00:02:33.659> more<00:02:33.810> Seth<00:02:34.079> with<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.439> separate<00:02:34.889> is<00:02:35.010> more

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
have more Seth with the separate is more

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.649 
have more Seth with the separate is more
subtle<00:02:36.150> or<00:02:37.129> than<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.400> grains<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.389> grounds

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
subtle or than the grains or the grounds

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.569 
subtle or than the grains or the grounds
a<00:02:39.719> little<00:02:39.780> bit<00:02:40.049> harder<00:02:40.409> and<00:02:40.590> dryer<00:02:40.859> so<00:02:41.430> in

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
a little bit harder and dryer so in

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.280
