00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.980
 hi swami vlad xing and this is boxing league 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.849
 monster truck and so today we 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.590
 open the box see what's inside and 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:26.180
 try to strive to take 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:30.779
 let's go hiding she here here 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.120
 need to pull up neatly somehow 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:44.370
 feeling watching how this can be done 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:46.050
 so as not to break it yet here 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.340
 probably we will not do ours 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.280
 I'm supposed to be everything neatly 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:59.399
 very very tight box 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.640
 It is therefore round to do here 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.640
 so here 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:33.980
 actually somehow so now we 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:34.580
 we open it hiding hard but 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.060
 possibly 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.310
 no better packaging solutions 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.350
 because she really 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.580
 really it is not very beautiful 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.580
 here are these things 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:02:01.810
 the main thing is that inside 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:02:17.959
 but still there may be more 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:21.530
 Is there an elegant way of opening ? 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:26.440
 so the whole thing is that you can only 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.440
 break that so that's it 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:44.459
 we opened the box and immediately sounds 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.660
 huge wheels 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:53.150
 actually for their sake all this purchase and 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.150
 So it was still in the box 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.290
 waste paper in which we can find both 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.290
 to collect 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:19.170
 how to assemble this truck 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:27.780
 in fact we do not postpone everything 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:33.230
 aside as well we will find all 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:37.260
 waste paper packages here we find 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.890
 you need another model some kind of a or 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:45.090
 this is not a site up now look well and 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.700
 Actually it does not matter gives probably 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.180
 two different models then look say 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.739
 black such and these 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:04:03.000
 huge wheels just they 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:05.040
 really just cool sizes here 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.500
 straight so here's a hand 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:14.910
 they are 8 centimeters 8 centimeters so 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.919
 Now how to say yes in principle 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.729
 very centimeters combine from here this 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.729
 edge well point to this 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.420
 so I collected this monster road builder 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.810
 and what I want to say in principle 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.570
 the constructor was a good collector somewhere. 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.580
 about four hours 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.730
 there really are two models 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:50.320
 follow the instructions on the graph itself 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:51.010
 the box says it is this model 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.400
 . 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.560
 here it is close up and here it is 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.220
 remember sixty two steps here in this 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:09.760
 model she's going to be seen 4 hours before 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:11.260
 60 two steps and here 50 all four steps on 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.960
 going accordingly bit over three with 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:22.210
 half an hour will be a little easier 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:26.650
 and what are the advantages of this car they have 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:33.730
 huge wheels 8 centimeters hydraulics 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:35.250
 great great baiting to great 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:42.030
 hydraulics 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:44.560
 for various caves here many 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.140
 real on gears that is 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.580
 let's say when we twist this one 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:54.420
 gear wheels turn 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.580
 Now I'll show you how it all works here 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.440
 the first gear when my turn it 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.920
 triggers these second ones 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.710
 who so two things 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.540
 there is a separation on the rear wheels and on 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.840
 front but i'll tell everyone on the front they 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:14.970
 equally absolutely equally absolutely 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.640
 work through this gear is transmitted 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:23.230
 rotation on this stick 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:26.410
 rotate on this stick fixed here 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:30.000
 this gear that drives the movement 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:33.270
 the wheels themselves with the help of such a black 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.550
 black stick is faceted not visible 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:43.020
 I see that it is not seen to be seen in the general 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:45.150
 now trying to show it like this 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:51.030
 and works that is pretty simple and 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:53.700
 mechanisms lags behind looks like this 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.980
 cell constructor is good especially if 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.350
 it is bought in addition to anything 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:03.270
 that is, if you buy it separately 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.720
 just one then there will be something not 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.370
 grab 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.990
 and if the buyer additions to something 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.110
 so that you can make up of this 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.390
 something common then it is very good 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.070
 option also comes in stock a few 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.770
 details in case you are 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:23.270
 lose them very little that is here it is 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:28.080
 black 2 blue red such 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:31.190
 very small gray detail which 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.190
 secures and 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:39.690
 From one simka in my opinion to attach 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:45.260
 here I will play still go still go 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:50.070
 Nakleechki let's box here such 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:52.530
 which can be pasted wherever you want so 

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.390
 that in principle the designer is good but 

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.300
 the address he bought to something in 

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.790
 addition with you was vlad alexin to 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.430
 Like bet you if the video was something 

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:05.180
 helpful and ask questions in 

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.180
 comments yet 

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:16.770
 Well, by the way looks very good 

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:16.770
 as decoration
