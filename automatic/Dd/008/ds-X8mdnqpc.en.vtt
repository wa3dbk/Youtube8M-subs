00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.050
 I know very well that many of you are already there 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.260
 but I do it for those few 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:29.410
 who do not yet know how to do it 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.430
 being in the recovery par excellence la 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.730
 tomato peel 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:39.850
 when you do when you make tomato sauce 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.500
 tomato pasta is normally used 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.110
 the whole tomato if we don't use for 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.480
 arts canned south to whole povolaro 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.739
 at most the seeds are removed and then yes 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.780
 cook with the peel and then go to 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.820
 move on to the whole thing and the skins 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.940
 remain in the whole pass then me 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.399
 instead I suggest you peel it first 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.329
 like then I'll show you why 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.379
 burning it in a system we get 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.149
 practically already the seal that 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.160
 could go on our axis 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.840
 spaghetti with tomato sauce 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:13.060
 look where you go with his stalk 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.090
 cut a washer like this 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.970
 it is instead of removing this 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.860
 washer this cap remove it no 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.740
 when it comes to an inch turn 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.140
 quickly at an angle like this and let's go 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.869
 practically producing what one 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.810
 sort of fettuccine sando practically 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.599
 between the peel and the pulp it is as it is done 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.190
 with apples I remember myself as mine 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:39.280
 brother was competing not 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.819
 he ate to peel apples without ever 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.800
 break without ever breaking the skin who 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.649
 it was clear that a fund was coming first 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.119
 without having broken the peel is 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.340
 practically at the usual system 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.660
 see you have to get almost to the bottom e 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.319
 It not with fund has become too 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.220
 long the canvas here but you come almost in 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:03.610
 then unplug the bottom here is the peel is 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.069
 made the tomato and without peel you can 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.739
 exploit it from the seeds and then cut with 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:11.170
 small crates means like beans 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.220
 of rice or peas and make your own sauce 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.959
 of tomato 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.650
 so this will go into the tomato sauce 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.220
 and the peel that you do now told me 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.220
 poor I say 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.490
 you made parades two hours 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.380
 then look you know this is a rose 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.330
 I know that many of you know it 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.480
 definitely already do however for i 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.760
 very few I repeat suggest this 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.310
 this subject is very nice 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.310
 we have the fettuccine peel it goes 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.650
 reported backwards practically varied 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.709
 Once back the skin, taking care to 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.110
 set aside the inner pulp 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.170
 hence the part that emerges that remains 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.680
 outside and the shiny part is fine so far 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.080
 here we are 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.750
 the lucia part see it go to 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.430
 wrap it you don't realize the 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.870
 difficulty with gloves to do something 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.170
 such 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.790
 but we are reckless and we succeed 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.500
 also to do this is you see let's go to 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.650
 rewind everything ours 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.620
 tape until you get to the shell 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.959
 final which will be the one that hosts us 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.480
 ours but you have understood ours 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.400
 rosellina attention when arrived at 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.709
 bottom you don't have to turn backwards 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.959
 because often when I go to 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.709
 make apple courses run the other less 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.140
 instead it came to me, this is what you owe it 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.239
 here you see you see how nice the 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.260
 wheel made with tomato then la 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:48.380
 I put there and maybe even if we can 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.160
 block it so we can also put it 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.040
 in vertical you see it 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.430
 here you see a little rose is made like this 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.489
 doing just rewind ours 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.440
 blame or better our peel from 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.230
 part of the pulp the part that remains 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.930
 internal will be the opaque part and the part 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.350
 that remains outside will be the part 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.350
 polished
