00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
I actually really like how it looks so

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.560 
I actually really like how it looks so
quite<00:04:41.100> quite<00:04:42.100> nice<00:04:42.340> very<00:04:42.880> robust<00:04:43.360> and

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
quite quite nice very robust and

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.980 
quite quite nice very robust and
apparently<00:04:44.110> it's<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:44.910> it's<00:04:45.910> weighted<00:04:46.420> and<00:04:46.690> I

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
apparently it's a it's weighted and I

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.840 
apparently it's a it's weighted and I
can't<00:04:47.320> really<00:04:47.500> tell<00:04:47.830> too<00:04:48.010> much<00:04:48.190> on<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.490> weight

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
can't really tell too much on the weight

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.330 
can't really tell too much on the weight
they<00:04:49.780> say<00:04:49.960> it's<00:04:50.140> about<00:04:50.290> a<00:04:50.320> hundred<00:04:50.620> grams<00:04:51.070> or

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
they say it's about a hundred grams or

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.130 
they say it's about a hundred grams or
