00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.830
 josef comes to black ops 2 leif i'm 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.629
 today with the m 27 with the silencer 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.029
 ring magazine and the magazine 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.930
 Extension as an effective lightweight 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.029
 hardliner toughness and stinker exactly 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.800
 we play here with six man so 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.490
 a really small lok with the german 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.990
 a few people after and yes one 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.440
 a pretty nice the class 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.300
 but again the first one now 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.489
 here fights that beautiful 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.589
 technician so it is in itself a nice 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.589
 class, however, I usually have 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:52.710
 I do not do this thing 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:54.799
 and why is he so licking the leg year 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.690
 insane glory he is with me oh 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.100
 fright let go 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.080
 yes mostly earlier because I 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.559
 mostly on slightly higher trickski and 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.190
 I just do not want that to me 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.140
 ammunition goes out 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.760
 and I do not always want to 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:17.790
 be dependent on other people that me 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:18.930
 with the weapons bavaria can so supplies 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.000
 already achieved that is also the beautiful 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.000
 technician I can now 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.660
 I really should not have gone in there 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.190
 but i hate this kemper 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.560
 That's why I really wanted to kill 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.180
 but you always have to be quite objective 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.000
 do not let emotions guide you 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.950
 that only bothers when well I already have 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.260
 So now that's going to be that nice one 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.400
 Technician that you can change something 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:48.030
 for example I would not now 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:50.159
 I would like that, and yes, that's what I like 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.400
 But I really want it too 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.040
 like never with technology so I'm on 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.770
 beginning of black ops 2 played with it 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.450
 namely not seen from car I have 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.760
 at the beginning of black ops twice for all 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.140
 now and then played with it because I the 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:11.629
 people we sold and then 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.629
 was it still so strong and 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.320
 So there they have a little bit more 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.240
 patched 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.310
 but at that time no one was with the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.690
 sound klauskommen baldi three times 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:30.240
 sounded very different sounded here 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.510
 is still one or e mails goes 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.510
 actually 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.040
 That's why it does not really work right now 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.330
 more with technicians though it actually is 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.890
 is quite funny but I think 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:47.940
 agility and tactics what yes 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:49.830
 actually a little better protected me 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:56.790
 hope that is directly is monster 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:58.740
 flipping gaming is so bad today 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.310
 I say every time but I can not 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.420
 to be better but I am currently 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.490
 actually hardly on the pc or 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.380
 altogether difficult hardly abo to the mobile phone 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.520
 or something like that is something completely different and 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.530
 yes that is but part is that the weather 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.010
 relatively nice intense stefan 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.230
 to press 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.400
 The weather is relatively nice and black 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.260
 ops 2 does not do that much for me either 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.420
 fun it is not there now me that you 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.310
 in flames I find it that bad, too 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.370
 do not expect to be away off away 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.500
 which simply does not make me so much fun 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.000
 and jo home the first and 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.010
 relationship problems and are now the 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.010
 Therefore, finally wear dead 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.100
 that's nice if you are short of the car 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:57.750
 100 points please not on me on the day 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:58.830
 however, and that is partly the case 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.260
 well actually the reason for why 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.200
 a loan free for everything costs like that 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.490
 is that important I always find that 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.490
 nice tuttlinger is really cool 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.240
 that's why my scores are still there 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.940
 relatively bad so are not now 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.790
 bad but went better we say 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.459
 so it's really because that 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.760
 I always so far except one 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.470
 exception always the first shot 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.480
 So take that first where 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.170
 I play with the class and 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.270
 accordingly, this looks natural 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.650
 not very good because most 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.110
 other youtubers do them so they 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:42.030
 that was kind of pretty 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.800
 confusing because they usually take 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:50.160
 her first on mostly her first 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:57.990
 did not record your first recording and 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:05:00.420
 have therefore to what the fuck is a that 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.430
 we are a huge age then I have 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.600
 he's done with the valley 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.690
 So determined is six so that as 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:14.700
 made a relatively funny challenge 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.380
 so stocks are running relatively well right now 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.430
 also achieved and unfortunately I can not 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.600
 yes I definitely have it 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.030
 somehow always left me open 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.310
 So do not think so free for me 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.500
 all score my livescores mostly 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.090
 not so perfect but we are now 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.560
 not too bad and that's why 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.420
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.680
 write a new class in the 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.150
 comments and so far forget about 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.910
 no case the mode is on many people 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.600
 forget the mode and that for 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.600
 today skin gets
