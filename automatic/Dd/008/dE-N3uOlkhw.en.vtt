 and articles to the penitentiary 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.509
 causing the families trouble 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.779
 who complain to the media 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.449
 communication of these exaggerated measures 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.480
 because they do not let us pass anything 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:38.370
 boys things of the most necessary thing that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.579

 transparent yet they do not leave it 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.179
 pass the soups 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.559
 it is very hard to review there 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.870
 inside of the boys there inside 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.940
 is struggling with everything and is to say 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.949
 of the relatives just a few days ago 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.109
 that started by prohibiting introduction 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.170
 of food from the basic basket as 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:09.960
 blanquillos tomatoes onion and chile no 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.970
 can tomato onion and potato nothing that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.399
 then the cheapest the cheapest 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.380
 for us but right now 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.869
 definitely nothing is happening to us 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.960
 they returned the bath soap the potatoes the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.659
 tomato chili 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.150
 4 eggs I have not let me through 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.409
 the other of the articles that either 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.479
 were allowed to enter the 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.780
 relatives of the inmates were those of 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.570
 personal hygiene and to wash your clothes 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.070
 We will see once a month when a lot and you 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.170
 we bring the basics for our 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.540
 family members and they do not allow us to enter 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.020

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.630
 bath paste deodorant are not us 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.430
 allowing none of that the pasta me 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.950
 led to the emptying because it does not get very 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.929
 well sealed and the toilet paper that 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.710
 they were also taking us away but yes 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.390

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.410
 have passed the bath soap 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.240
 relatives denounced that these new 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.399
 prohibitions seek to favor the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.860
 small grocery store that exists in the 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.200
 inside the prison is difficult because 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.000
 have one to support the resource of 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.000
 inside and for the family of the house 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.250
 an intern there 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.690
 before, it made us easier because 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.489

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.030

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.700

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.290
 trade do not have money to buy 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.390
 they will buy the relatives of the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.280
 interviewed interns did not want 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.690
 provide their names for fear of 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.489
 reprisals that the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.650
 soldiers against their interns 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.540
 due to these allegations but they point 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.030
 that there are many abuses that are committed 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.310
 and that many times they are silent so as not to 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.050
 affect your inmates none of the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.640
 military officers in charge of security and 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.660
 revisions of the prison wanted to give a 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.910
 interview 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.200
 they only pointed out of cameras that 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.390
 are the rules of the centers 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.700
 penitentiaries and that they have to 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.340
 fulfill them at the foot of the rule yet and 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.970
 when this bothers relatives of 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.060
