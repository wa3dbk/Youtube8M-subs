00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.440
 That's where I'm going now in that 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.170
 time to get more information about 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.390

 I'll get more details about the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.280
 The second fact happened here is due to 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.290

 but what actually ended up causing 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.690
 these other accidents here that ended 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.720
 causing the accident because 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.890
 while we were there went to see the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.810

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.220
 he made an hour or braking properly 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.020
 and only snow- fought theme in the 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.150
 colinho who was leading the 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.950
 red truck his name appeared 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.549

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.920
 that everything happened there look he turned 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.780
 made the turn I told him he assures me that 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.680
 We're going to hit because there was a way. 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.350
 wrong since a bitrem there for him never 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.150
 fall on the bluff and not go over 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.000
 of the car that was alive 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.940
 Then he went to the car in this car. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.010
 was stopped and took the road when a 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.770
 Green vehicle down there're gone 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.480
 There we tell the truck I said 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.300
 the lady who was with two 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.010
 children and we favalli stopped when the 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.200
 ice up 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.350
 come on we saw the truck to be one day 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.400
 time or lead he took over goal 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.380
 another truck is already active in the 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.570
 I think more things are worse here, right? 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.230
 some luck, just the people who look at it 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:13.230
 just have to have signage is true 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.840
 here to reduce these accidents is 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.650
 having here is with riches accident here 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.340
 on the track 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.470
 I think dnit has to put 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.690
 electronic signage of why otherwise 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.910
 staff makes curve here very fast 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.130
 almost 100 per hour a fault of that 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.020
 does not have the condition to make and 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.190
 of these accidents 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.150
 I quote here in the Sierra de San Vicente 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.280
