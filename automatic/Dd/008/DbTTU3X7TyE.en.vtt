 Hi there, this is a review on rimmel lipstick 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.340
 lasting finish I have 5 of them and all is not 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.440
 except for one bright colors of it 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.330
 the ship that I love bright lipstick and at 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.130
 rimmel good choice of shades for the benefit 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.439
 Boman me all sorts of every day 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.980
 Therefore, other do not want to buy and then 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.570
 these lipsticks are very inexpensive 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.099
 as far as the quality of these pogla is not 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.599
 very well pigmented and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.820
 overlap you but but can 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.520
 emphasize peeling and dry cube 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.410
 however they are very resistant to transference I 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.660
 would advise to scan cubes and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.840
 apply a balm then all of our minus 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.000
 at 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.989
 in general he was always advised 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 do before applying bright lipstick 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.160
 These two went in a set I bought them and for 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.680
 bright lipstick somehow does not pull me on 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.870
 they are boas and shades in rimmel and although in 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.860
 Basically, I think I blame them too 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.050
 very decent but 16 hard projector ta 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.050
 the brightest lipstick I bought for 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.840
 This shade kit is a very interesting color 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.510
 with white raspberry but rather muffled 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.549
 cool color is pretty calm but when 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.159
 This makes an excellent emphasis on the lips 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.720
 it turns out fresh for spring and summer 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.720
 just perfect 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.640
 005 smoke frame single neutral 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.040
 lipstick from rome this shade is very 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.200
 ambiguous or coral pink with 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.840
 an admixture of beige and there is only dark 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.130
 u well refreshes on lip looks to 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.860
 it is absolutely neutral 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.050
 but this lipstick like many unfortunately 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.659
 light shades emphasize possible 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.780
 lip imperfections but the color is very unusual and 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.780
 nice 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.930
 220 retro beautiful bright juicy tint 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.000
 times and certain classic red 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.820
 it will emit orange that gives you 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.770
 more ease and reliability that whether it 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.690
 you need to be easy to wear during the day and 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:25.270
 it will be very harmoniously sweet 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:27.520
 I adore over 20 cutting-edge dark bold 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.950
 the dining room by the ones I've been looking for 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.230
 and finally found time to trace of course 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.780
 amazingly beautiful evenly put 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:50.170
 lipstick is quite difficult if you donâ€™t 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:52.180
 scares take won't regret shade 02 of 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.240
 kate moss lipstick series 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.209
 this certain fuchsia is so berry 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.820
 shade bright juicy with character for 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.010
 me this is pure summer tomato over it i 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.050
 love and no less because at least she 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.050
 really very very beautiful 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:17.750
 and here is the case of all lipsticks from right to left 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.180
 it gets us number five hundred 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:26.570
 twenty to 16-20 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:28.910
 and by two and let's summarize 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.150
 we have not touched on beautiful 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.700
 colors and beautiful creamy texture but 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.190
 we have and cons little by little 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.440
 slide they can emphasize 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.570
 various temptations but unfortunately 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.520
 good ratios or qualities are very 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.900
 you rarely see those are probably the best 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.000
 what have I seen yet new items 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.230
 Thank you all for your attention, I hope you 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.230
 liked it and bye
