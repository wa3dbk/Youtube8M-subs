00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello and welcome to gt gts 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.890
 symbol and today we do a little 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.040
 video about the mount of rohde nt 1 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.679
 a 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.809
 I have the reindeer 1 a complete 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.820
 Mobile bundle bought in this change 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.369
 is the big bama microphone 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.720
 and an associated bracket you 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.160
 also easy for other big ones 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.769
 hammer by rhode can use 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.250
 like the nt 1a nt 2000 nt 2000 the kk 2 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.470
 etc 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.740
 and that's why we're looking at the bracket 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.630
 make something more accurate to the microphone itself 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.930
 we also have a video but that will be later 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.640
 the attitude appears we see exists 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.710
 the holder of a play and a 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.960
 built-in pop cellar around pop noises 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.520
 The first thing the spider does is to avoid 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.680
 a very good impression on me 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.870
 It is made of metal and looks very nice 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.300
 massively so I have compared times 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.460
 another player from the team osc 440 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.989
 are you seeing that the red spider is very 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.300
 much bigger and wider replaced the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.920
 other players is still a difference 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.629
 the fortification of the Migros at the t 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.160
 bone spider gets the micro through the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.710
 push in through the pressure 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.880
 attached to the red spider that becomes 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.920
 micro just by the screws 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.340
 Attaching one end of the boom attached 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.170
 which is better and what is not so good 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.500
 everyone must decide for themselves 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.570
 in principle, there are no big ones 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.280
 keep differences to each other 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.920
 It's pretty good and you can do it too 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.630
 headfirst hang to pop the cellar 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.890
 consist of two layers of tissue 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.000
 pop shot makes a good impression 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.009
 and does his job well 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.079
 In the middle is a big red logo 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.060
 imprinted the positioning of the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.549
 protection can be set well but 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.430
 in that the pop shop shelter 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.869
 not removable from the spider and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.369
 really still a 1 position stuck 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.040
 There are always certain things to sit on 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.680
 inscriptions how to pop 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.490
 shelter and where you can not 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.009
 can press 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.240
 to the comparison of my other kopilas where 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.040
 I already made a recommendation video 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.750
 did that a video description 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.219
 just link feature com or 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.649
 China continues to look very robust and 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.270
 definitely will not break so fast 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.799
 the conclusion of course you can the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.320
 bracket also buy separately under the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.140
 microphone 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.700
 then she would cost 55 euros alone in the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.610
 area I still find it very good 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.040
 order so I recommend the m6 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.180
 mounts because it offers everything 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.500
 So a spider has a good one 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.630
 functioning head protection 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.070
 yes that was it for today I hope you 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.140
 has liked the video and leaves so 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.140
 a rating there is your chance
