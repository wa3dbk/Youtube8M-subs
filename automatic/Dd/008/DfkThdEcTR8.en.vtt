 working in the area in the records of the 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.360
 of the system but let's give another other ofac and to top it off 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.399
 from kino is showing 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:11.420
 that she 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.379
 finished 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.220
 to this notification i that's why I'm still only four minutes 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.180
 this we can 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.629
 I tell you that there is 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.629
 now for 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:25.659
 one 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.239
 that's why a support some peoples all returns 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.289
 that's why we're going to solve both 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.029
 and we are not going to base this menu 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:38.449
 i wish we are weak in the rest 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.469
 and that's what Javier Orozco says 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:43.439
 individual backgrounds 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.409
 you may have already selected 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.019
 percent 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.209
 what happens 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.809
 what they will believe 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:54.199
 that is, here he is showing you 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.199
 i for example if we go down 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.869
 podolski to 12 ayuso euros 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:04.869
 and here the one that was a test but what is worth the models 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.049

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:13.339
 I must absolute but the stick to the back 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:17.199
 By the way, this is all of these you only select 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.159
 and there, despite being seen 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:25.199
 so then because the funds back I return because this one is 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.980
 important information 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.289
 It is suggested that every two days 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.330
 the doctor why 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.120
 Esther Estevez sure 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.090
 and here is another thing as well as a matter asun ruiz everything looted wave 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.699
 polar for information 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.090
 back to make sure you are working 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.409
 by how other people think, no, yes, yes, we are working 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:48.490
 but no 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.830
 no this 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.180
 is not working 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.860
 while this way you assure yourself that you made subsist in worse 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:01.439
 the bid formation that I strings that the opposite reaction track working 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:04.030
 well we are confident good we closed it 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.850
 and another one will do it here, here we are going to go to 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.379
 for 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.479
 where the flashlight to explore 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.919
 let's go there 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.229
 and let's go some places that is called 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.370
 obama 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.719
 peel 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:22.889
 dot com 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.779
 and there in watching that there is no one who takes him to this place 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:28.060
 Then show my sexuality 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.259
 the free to download 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.080
 and here I go service took escape 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.779
 at least load 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:39.739
 I think this is to save but here we are going to run the proposal by ap ron 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.489
 and then approve it run as soon as I finish 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:46.539
 so it is that 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.350
 coconut with this program is 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.830
 p gives you the information 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.210

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:29.619
 however, climbing 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.289
 what embarrassment updating the system with figurative 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:38.099
 from the pc 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.809
 and here he says he wants us to give him 

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:43.500
 permission to analyze percent 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.389
 the system we report 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:48.389
 we put you yes 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.889

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.659
 our looking for information 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:56.539
 of the system 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:01.629
 and already after finished this one appears on the page on this night 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:02.740
 fear him 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.539
 And if there can be certain is that apart above they tell you the truth of being the 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:09.639
 date when it does not exist and everything 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:13.210
