I<00:01:55.600> put<00:01:55.840> here<00:01:56.139> over<00:01:56.859> to<00:01:56.979> here<00:01:57.009> and<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.399> didn't

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:57.639 
I put here over to here and it didn't

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:59.190 
I put here over to here and it didn't
match<00:01:57.819> and<00:01:58.179> I<00:01:58.240> couldn't<00:01:58.479> figure<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.749> out<00:01:58.959> but

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
match and I couldn't figure it out but

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.550 
match and I couldn't figure it out but
that's<00:01:59.590> why<00:02:00.209> so<00:02:01.209> now<00:02:01.450> I'm<00:02:01.840> ready<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.170> sew<00:02:02.409> the

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
that's why so now I'm ready to sew the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.949 
that's why so now I'm ready to sew the
bottom<00:02:02.740> piece<00:02:03.100> on<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.880> I'm<00:02:03.999> gonna<00:02:04.240> lift<00:02:04.749> this

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
bottom piece on and I'm gonna lift this

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.130 
bottom piece on and I'm gonna lift this
up<00:02:05.020> now<00:02:05.999> what<00:02:06.999> I'm<00:02:07.090> going<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.299> need<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.569> do<00:02:07.779> is

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
up now what I'm going to need to do is

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.570 
up now what I'm going to need to do is
make<00:02:08.350> sure<00:02:08.380> that<00:02:08.649> I'm<00:02:08.950> matching

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
make sure that I'm matching

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.820 
make sure that I'm matching
because<00:02:09.700> I've<00:02:09.850> got<00:02:09.880> chalk<00:02:10.240> lines<00:02:10.509> here<00:02:10.960> but

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
because I've got chalk lines here but

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.400 
because I've got chalk lines here but
this<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.580> raw<00:02:12.850> straight<00:02:13.450> edge<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.140> just

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
this is a raw straight edge so I just

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.440 
this is a raw straight edge so I just
want<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.650> be<00:02:14.770> sure<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.070> match<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.550> all<00:02:15.730> so

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
want to be sure to match this all so

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.790 
want to be sure to match this all so
that<00:02:16.600> it's<00:02:16.750> sewn<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:16.990> quarter<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.470> an<00:02:17.530> inch<00:02:17.620> away

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
that it's sewn a quarter of an inch away

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.130 
that it's sewn a quarter of an inch away
from<00:02:17.920> here<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.270> still<00:02:19.510> matches<00:02:19.900> up<00:02:20.020> with

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
from here and it still matches up with

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.220 
from here and it still matches up with
the<00:02:20.260> chalk<00:02:20.470> lines<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:22.030> actually<00:02:22.780> what<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.930> ended

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
the chalk lines so actually what I ended

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.680 
the chalk lines so actually what I ended
up<00:02:23.320> doing<00:02:23.380> was<00:02:23.890> taking<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.430> piece<00:02:24.700> over<00:02:25.150> to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
up doing was taking this piece over to

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.050 
up doing was taking this piece over to
my<00:02:26.080> cutting<00:02:26.380> table<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:28.030> cut<00:02:29.070> this<00:02:30.070> out<00:02:30.610> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
my cutting table and I cut this out the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.210 
my cutting table and I cut this out the
outsides<00:02:31.540> here<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.350> they<00:02:32.500> were<00:02:32.560> trimmed

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
outsides here so that they were trimmed

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.620 
outsides here so that they were trimmed
a<00:02:33.370> quarter<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.790> an<00:02:33.880> inch<00:02:33.970> away<00:02:34.180> from<00:02:34.330> the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
a quarter of an inch away from the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.960 
a quarter of an inch away from the
inside<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.350> my<00:02:35.470> chalk<00:02:35.710> line<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.580> way<00:02:36.730> now<00:02:36.940> I

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
inside of my chalk line that way now I

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.810 
inside of my chalk line that way now I
can<00:02:37.390> line<00:02:38.110> up<00:02:38.140> these<00:02:38.440> raw<00:02:38.680> edges<00:02:38.890> as<00:02:39.460> I<00:02:39.640> saw

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
can line up these raw edges as I saw

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.550 
can line up these raw edges as I saw
these<00:02:39.970> other<00:02:40.180> patches<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.230> makes<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.530> a

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
these other patches on and it makes it a

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.530 
these other patches on and it makes it a
lot<00:02:41.710> easier<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.970> don't<00:02:43.120> have<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.360> worry

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
lot easier and I don't have to worry

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.150 
lot easier and I don't have to worry
about<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:44.230> chalk<00:02:44.440> lines<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.890> what<00:02:45.010> they're

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
about the chalk lines and what they're

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.610 
about the chalk lines and what they're
doing<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.540> now<00:02:46.690> I've<00:02:46.780> got<00:02:46.930> this<00:02:47.110> corner<00:02:47.440> patch

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
doing so now I've got this corner patch

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
doing so now I've got this corner patch
done<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.310> what<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.030> need<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.300> do<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.690> sew<00:02:49.900> these

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
done and what I need to do is sew these

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.380 
done and what I need to do is sew these
triangles<00:02:51.640> onto<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:53.050> other<00:02:53.230> corners<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.730> you

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
triangles onto the other corners and you

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.270 
triangles onto the other corners and you
could<00:02:55.570> see<00:02:55.810> what<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.110> did<00:02:56.380> was<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.709> cut<00:02:56.890> squares

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
could see what I did was I cut squares

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.370 
could see what I did was I cut squares
here<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:57.880> studying<00:02:58.390> cut<00:02:58.630> instead<00:02:59.020> of<00:02:59.200> cutting

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
here in studying cut instead of cutting

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.930 
here in studying cut instead of cutting
the<00:02:59.530> weird<00:02:59.709> shapes<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.250> are<00:03:00.310> in<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.760> pattern

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
the weird shapes that are in the pattern

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.320 
the weird shapes that are in the pattern
so<00:03:01.660> you<00:03:01.750> could<00:03:01.930> do<00:03:02.020> either<00:03:02.140> one<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.760> then<00:03:04.000> all

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
so you could do either one and then all

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.090 
so you could do either one and then all
I'm<00:03:04.540> gonna<00:03:04.660> do<00:03:04.900> is<00:03:05.050> line<00:03:05.290> up<00:03:05.470> these<00:03:05.590> corner

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
I'm gonna do is line up these corner

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.790 
I'm gonna do is line up these corner
pieces<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:07.090> triangles<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.990> I'm<00:03:08.560> going<00:03:08.740> to

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
pieces the triangles and I'm going to

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.620 
pieces the triangles and I'm going to
stitch<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.250> quarter<00:03:09.459> of<00:03:09.640> an<00:03:09.730> inch<00:03:10.030> away<00:03:10.420> from

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
stitch a quarter of an inch away from

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.750 
stitch a quarter of an inch away from
the<00:03:11.050> triangle<00:03:11.500> then<00:03:11.920> I'll<00:03:12.040> be<00:03:12.160> able<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.400> fold

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
the triangle then I'll be able to fold

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.330 
the triangle then I'll be able to fold
it<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.270> it's<00:03:13.390> right<00:03:13.600> sides<00:03:13.930> together<00:03:14.340> or

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
it so that it's right sides together or

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.970 
it so that it's right sides together or
not<00:03:15.459> right<00:03:15.760> sides<00:03:16.060> together<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:16.750> fold<00:03:17.380> this<00:03:17.739> so

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
not right sides together so fold this so

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.830 
not right sides together so fold this so
that<00:03:18.130> it's<00:03:18.250> right<00:03:18.430> side<00:03:18.700> out<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.209> I'm<00:03:19.720> gonna

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
that it's right side out and I'm gonna

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.449 
that it's right side out and I'm gonna
have<00:03:20.080> my<00:03:20.110> corners<00:03:20.650> on<00:03:20.860> each<00:03:20.890> one<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.340> these

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
have my corners on each one of these

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.940 
have my corners on each one of these
patches<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.810> I'll<00:03:22.930> go<00:03:23.080> ahead<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.380> do<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.530> for

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
patches so I'll go ahead and do that for

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.620 
patches so I'll go ahead and do that for
the<00:03:24.040> three<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.580> then<00:03:24.790> we'll<00:03:24.940> be<00:03:25.060> ready<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.330> sew

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
the three and then we'll be ready to sew

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.229 
the three and then we'll be ready to sew
this<00:03:25.750> together<00:03:26.610> now<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:27.670> can<00:03:27.880> see<00:03:28.060> all<00:03:28.209> my

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
this together now you can see all my

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.570 
this together now you can see all my
little<00:03:28.510> corner<00:03:29.050> triangles<00:03:29.590> are<00:03:29.739> sewn<00:03:30.010> on<00:03:30.310> and

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
little corner triangles are sewn on and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.910 
little corner triangles are sewn on and
all<00:03:31.570> of<00:03:31.720> these<00:03:31.810> patches<00:03:32.290> are<00:03:32.410> ready<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.739> sew

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
all of these patches are ready to sew

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.490 
all of these patches are ready to sew
together<00:03:32.980> as<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.459> block<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.510> just<00:03:35.110> one<00:03:35.290> last

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
together as a block so just one last
