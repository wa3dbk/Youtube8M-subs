that<00:01:11.490> was<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.700> best<00:01:12.000> chance<00:01:12.270> read<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.570> gaming

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that was the best chance read or gaming

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.620 
that was the best chance read or gaming
it<00:01:12.900> was<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.140> final<00:01:13.530> quarters<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.159> drew

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
it was in the final quarters and we drew

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
it was in the final quarters and we drew
obviously<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.750> can't<00:01:15.960> get<00:01:16.080> any<00:01:16.170> place<00:01:16.380> yet

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
obviously we can't get any place yet

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.440 
obviously we can't get any place yet
because<00:01:16.890> were<00:01:17.009> waiting<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.880> 10th<00:01:18.180> goal

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
because were waiting for that 10th goal

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.940 
because were waiting for that 10th goal
so<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.140> get<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.470> silvers<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.830> we

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
so we can then get the silvers and we

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.620 
so we can then get the silvers and we
complicates<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> pretty<00:01:20.700> poor<00:01:20.880> chemistry<00:01:21.360> team

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.899 
thinking this could be the game this
could<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.040> could<00:01:26.189> get<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> double<00:01:26.790> with
