here another problem with the third row

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.089 
here another problem with the third row
is<00:03:13.069> that<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.489> is<00:03:13.639> bolted<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.540> floor<00:03:14.739> so<00:03:15.739> it

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
is that it is bolted to the floor so it

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.959 
is that it is bolted to the floor so it
does<00:03:16.489> eat<00:03:16.879> into<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.540> boot<00:03:17.810> space<00:03:21.400> now<00:03:22.400> finally
