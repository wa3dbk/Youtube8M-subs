00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 Good evening, all of you from yours 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.360
 enrico capable then by now different 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.259
 time I often feel to address one 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.490
 sentence the following enrico you are wasted 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.529
 enrico you so 6 wasted by now will be 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.769
 ten years that I hear this thing 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.660
 since I was 17 18 years old so a lot 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.250
 time, however, there are two types of 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.760
 people telling you something about this 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.460
 guy 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.349
 on the one hand, certainly a lot of people 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.360
 superficial and banana trees that tell me the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.730
 wasted rigor because you are very much 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.680
 clever you would puddu graduate or 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.300
 you might get a nice find 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.660
 work that ensures a high 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.629
 salary then a high standard of living 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.100
 in that case you wouldn't be wasted but 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.920
 understand that misery 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.910
 this is a truly conception 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.370
 very sad and the apotheosis of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.879
 apotheosis superficiality of the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.370
 superficiality ie you are not wasted 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.660
 you are have the money so lets 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.039
 buy many items or you can 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.690
 let you go in who knows what 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.619
 place there in that case you are not 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.070
 wasted 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.630
 otherwise yes or you do n't know wasted 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.460
 because it reaches its mined state 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.310
 social so I would be wrong as 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.600
 winning if you are a condition instead 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.450
 which of the others is considered by 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.520
 loser you're wasted but guys but 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.860
 we want to get out of this demented logic 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.689
 from this empty and sad logic 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.500
 realize that so full of people 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.159
 wheels that frame the value of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.720
 person 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.020
 the fact that the person has been wasted 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.670
 us based on these fucking parameters but 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.210
 let's reason the speech to extremes if 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.000
 I if I worked one day I had one 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.920
 salary characterize 200 euros per 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.189
 month 200 euros canteen would then be 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.720
 fatigue and getting no fatigue shore 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.549
 at the end of the month I would have practical problems 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.110
 maybe ending up under a bridge 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.540
 let's put it this way it will end up under a bridge 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.880
 so I would say it will be inconvenience mica 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.290
 a beautiful thing is what will happen if the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.240
 big problems maybe problems with 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.020
 nutrition I would n't know how you do it from the point 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.270
 of practical view but based on those I 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.760
 I value feeling wasted no but who 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.050
 man, it has a real problem 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.660
 a practical problem 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.810
 I repeat is not insignificant but it's not about 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.100
 your person wasted or not on the other 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.190
 on the other hand we have people who maybe 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.870
 they tell me enrico you are explained this 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.130
 it's wasted but I don't tell myself in 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.350
 a view we say so exaggeratedly 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.880
 materialistic and consumerist or 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.770
 sorry materialist and consumerist 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.590
 melodic grammatical error and maybe 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.060
 because they simply care about 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.940
 affectionate way of my eventual 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.230
 future and I tell myself if I had a job 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.930
 even with a low salary, the millions 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.490
 you would have more peace of mind from the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.000
 practical point of view you would be more 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.560
 quiet so they say it 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.560
 simply for this concern 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.120
 so surely different though me 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.590
 I want to answer both in 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.770
 very clear and clear 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.990
 I can't feel wasted because 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.470
 Later I graduated I did not 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.710
 graduate I will not graduate or I will have a 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.020
 work that maybe doesn't reflect mine 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.340
 passions that I would never feel 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.000
 wasted on these things 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.910
 but why but why I don't feel myself 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.239
 wasted because I just didn't graduate 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.459
 I am wasted on life that is this 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.860
 life life too poor for one 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.630
 person like me the company this 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.790
 society is too poor for a person 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.640
 like me therefore both society and life in 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.300
 existential sense are too little for 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.870
 one like me 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:50.610
 so I will feel and always be 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:52.920
 wasted in this existence is a lot 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.250
 clear the speech when a person is 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.900
 at the same time intelligent and shiny 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.050
 at the same time also 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.940
 sensitive therefore when person is lucid 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:09.350
 and sensible he feels things hear things 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.940
 rationally and emotionally and I am 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.420
 many aspects within this thing 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.850
 will always be wasted in this world 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.010
 considers life always too little 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.169
 society always too little so I do 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.410
 I address speaking in the plural in the plural 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.570
 in order not to be self-centered, I turn to 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.940
 those who identify themselves 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.460
 to my words we will always be 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.920
 wasted for this company we will always be 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.270
 wasted that this life from this line 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.800
 that company 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.120
 and what it offers will never be 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.620
 enough for people like us will not be 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.780
 never enough 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:50.630
 and in this sense a beautiful phrase 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:53.690
 of fernando pessoa the world and of those who do not 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.450
 feels the essential condition for 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.270
 being a practical man is the lack of 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.750
 sensitivity this sentence if you understand it 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.690
 much or less partly in the direction of 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.320
 what I just told you 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.680
 so life, life will never be 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.880
 enough for us though if you can 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.020
 I console him to tell you this one day 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.840
 all this will end 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.960
 I truly tell you with my heart 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.500
 of course I point to the mind one day 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.690
 all this will end then maybe you don't 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.030
 you are me everyone is different then you 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.350
 interpret my words maybe 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.620
 consumer lives if not quite like 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.230
 I mean not a little how I feel about them 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.970
 these things, however, I say in part then 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.210
 puts are in tune with what 's 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:47.030
 korea so with the heart I tell you one day 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.670
 all this will end one day 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.920
 injustice the great injustice to the 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:56.360
 end of the just two life 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.850
 the existence that is unjust in itself 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.860
 historical context and social context 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:06.860
 the little theater that surrounds us and of which 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:08.540
 often we are forced to say with which 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.580
 we are forced to beat each and every one of them 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.580
 all this will end one day
