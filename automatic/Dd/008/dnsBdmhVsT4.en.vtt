Hillsborough County which i think is

Hillsborough County which i think is
fairly<00:00:45.750> typical<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.410> other<00:00:46.829> counties<00:00:47.280> here

there<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.850> go<00:00:57.800> we<00:00:58.800> say<00:00:59.010> emergency<00:00:59.280> management

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
there we go we say emergency management

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.869 
there we go we say emergency management
has<00:01:00.059> four<00:01:00.359> phases<00:01:00.980> they<00:01:01.980> don't<00:01:02.129> particularly

that a disaster didn't just occur
mitigation<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.250> things<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.790> building<00:01:27.570> codes

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
mitigation is things like building codes

mitigation is things like building codes
should<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:29.040> build<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.430> flood<00:01:29.700> zone<00:01:29.729> should

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.260 
and that's where that mitigation phase
comes<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> emergency<00:01:50.549> management<00:01:50.850> should

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
be more prepared then of course

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.190 
be more prepared then of course
somewhere<00:02:56.970> between<00:02:57.120> preparedness<00:02:58.019> and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
somewhere between preparedness and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.559 
somewhere between preparedness and
response<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.760> assumption<00:03:00.209> is<00:03:00.359> that<00:03:00.389> a

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
response the assumption is that a

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.990 
response the assumption is that a
disaster<00:03:01.170> occurred<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.430> response

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
disaster occurred and that response

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.849 
disaster occurred and that response
phase<00:03:03.359> is<00:03:03.690> what<00:03:03.870> most<00:03:04.049> people<00:03:04.409> think<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.799> when

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
phase is what most people think of when

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.490 
phase is what most people think of when
they<00:03:05.040> think<00:03:05.159> of<00:03:05.459> emergency<00:03:06.090> management<00:03:06.500> we

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
they think of emergency management we

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.930 
they think of emergency management we
get<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.680> lot<00:03:07.859> of<00:03:07.950> questions<00:03:08.340> well<00:03:08.519> what<00:03:08.819> do<00:03:08.879> you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
get a lot of questions well what do you

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.280 
get a lot of questions well what do you
guys<00:03:09.060> do<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.359> other<00:03:09.480> six<00:03:09.780> months<00:03:09.930> out<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.200> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
guys do the other six months out of the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.140 
guys do the other six months out of the
year<00:03:10.440> when<00:03:10.560> it's<00:03:10.680> not<00:03:10.829> hurricane<00:03:11.310> season<00:03:11.760> well

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
year when it's not hurricane season well

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.550 
year when it's not hurricane season well
the<00:03:12.239> answer<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.720> we're<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:12.959> that<00:03:13.079> mitigation

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
the answer is we're in that mitigation

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.140 
the answer is we're in that mitigation
and<00:03:13.859> preparedness<00:03:14.250> phase<00:03:14.639> we're<00:03:14.819> doing<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.030> lot

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
and preparedness phase we're doing a lot

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.699 
and preparedness phase we're doing a lot
of<00:03:15.239> public<00:03:15.540> speaking<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:16.019> lot<00:03:16.139> of<00:03:16.260> training

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
of public speaking a lot of training

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.009 
of public speaking a lot of training
exercises<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:18.150> name<00:03:18.329> it<00:03:18.480> we<00:03:18.599> stay<00:03:18.810> pretty

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
exercises you name it we stay pretty

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.740 
exercises you name it we stay pretty
busy<00:03:19.430> but<00:03:20.430> following<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.879> disaster<00:03:21.449> we<00:03:21.599> would

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
busy but following a disaster we would

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.569 
busy but following a disaster we would
move<00:03:21.900> into<00:03:22.109> that<00:03:22.349> response<00:03:22.919> phase<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.519> that's

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
move into that response phase and that's

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.039 
move into that response phase and that's
where<00:03:23.819> you<00:03:23.940> start<00:03:24.209> seeing<00:03:24.449> things<00:03:24.720> like<00:03:24.900> the

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
what we do is find where the need is and

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.490 
what we do is find where the need is and
then<00:03:59.879> we<00:03:59.970> find<00:04:00.239> out<00:04:00.359> who<00:04:00.510> has<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.750> resource

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
then we find out who has the resource

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.170 
then we find out who has the resource
that<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.829> need<00:04:02.010> then<00:04:02.609> we<00:04:02.639> go<00:04:02.819> talk<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.060> that

when we recover from a disaster

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.380 
when we recover from a disaster
want<00:04:23.100> to<00:04:23.160> make<00:04:23.280> sure<00:04:23.460> we're<00:04:23.640> more<00:04:23.790> resilient

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
want to make sure we're more resilient

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.870 
want to make sure we're more resilient
to<00:04:24.660> that<00:04:24.810> same<00:04:25.080> disaster<00:04:25.410> next<00:04:25.890> time<00:04:26.070> so<00:04:26.730> when

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
to that same disaster next time so when

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.490 
to that same disaster next time so when
we<00:04:27.000> rebuild<00:04:27.210> your<00:04:27.600> house<00:04:27.720> well<00:04:28.080> maybe<00:04:28.320> we

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
we rebuild your house well maybe we

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.840 
we rebuild your house well maybe we
should<00:04:28.680> improve<00:04:28.920> those<00:04:29.190> building<00:04:29.610> codes

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
should improve those building codes

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.400 
should improve those building codes
maybe<00:04:30.120> we<00:04:30.300> should<00:04:30.480> make<00:04:30.630> sure<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:30.990> your

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
maybe we should make sure that your

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.080 
maybe we should make sure that your
house<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:31.590> elevated<00:04:32.310> or<00:04:32.430> or<00:04:32.610> your<00:04:32.760> storm

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
house is elevated or or your storm

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.240 
house is elevated or or your storm
shutters<00:04:33.330> are<00:04:33.600> are<00:04:34.050> put<00:04:34.320> in<00:04:34.440> place<00:04:34.590> this<00:04:34.890> next

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
shutters are are put in place this next

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.670 
shutters are are put in place this next
time<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:35.820> that's<00:04:36.750> kind<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.080> just<00:04:37.140> a<00:04:37.410> brief

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
time so that's kind of just a brief

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.460 
time so that's kind of just a brief
rundown<00:04:37.950> of<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:39.330> emergency<00:04:39.930> management

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
rundown of the emergency management

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.740 
rundown of the emergency management
cycle<00:04:40.950> as<00:04:41.100> we<00:04:41.610> call<00:04:41.880> it<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.330> think<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.600> does

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
cycle as we call it and I think it does

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.570 
cycle as we call it and I think it does
a<00:04:42.780> real<00:04:43.020> good<00:04:43.050> job<00:04:43.200> of<00:04:43.380> visually<00:04:44.100> putting<00:04:44.490> it

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
a real good job of visually putting it

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.040 
a real good job of visually putting it
into<00:04:44.730> perspective<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:45.750> know<00:04:45.780> what

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
into perspective of you know what

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.230 
into perspective of you know what
emergency<00:04:46.590> managers<00:04:47.010> do<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.520> what<00:04:48.090> the
