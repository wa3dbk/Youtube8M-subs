00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello then as I promised you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.719
 this is the video I tried to make 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.790
 the first possible product review 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.120
 for lush hair care then 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.060
 Meanwhile I leave the link here of the video 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.240
 where the video in which I show you precisely 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.949
 the products I bought leaves 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.010
 when to take care of my hair 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.570
 almost a month has now passed 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.230
 month and a half since I made the order 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.130
 so I can give you a very specific opinion 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.829
 on these products 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.630
 the first product I show you is it 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.180
 shampoo the tree 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:45.750
 this is a 100 ml pack that I have 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:48.539
 paid 6 euros and 95 7 euros 95 anyway 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.420
 a city ​​of between 6 and 8 euros 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.579
 I paid it is a very much bottle 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:01.230
 small and this hair shampoo 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:03.120
 dry, undernourished, in short, these 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.470
 things here are for precisely hair they have 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.900
 I need nourishment then I promote 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.780
 this shampoo veil strà advice 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.760
 because it really feeds my parents so much 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.130
 hair is much much better from 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.570
 when I use it then I do n't use it to mine 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.210
 Once the hair is finished I leave the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.400
 link here of the video on my erker like that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.640
 I also explain how to use these 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.640
 products 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.350
 I said it feeds a lot the hair and the thing 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.110
 overt is that very little is needed 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.110
 rhymes I show you here if you can 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.270
 see how much I will have already used 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.939
 type five times and the quantity is still 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.909
 a lot considering that I am only 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.040
 100 ml and therefore this tear has moved 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.020
 the flaw is a little hole in the price but 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.950
 you must know that very little is needed e 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.450
 and it lasts a lot and above all 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.510
 above all it really counts I talk to you 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.450
 of the angel hair mask that it is 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.140
 this mask always restorative for 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.330
 dry and lifeless hair advised of 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.540
 apply it for about twenty minutes on 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.180
 hair before washing then it goes 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.820
 used before shampoo 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.560
 this is also a very good mask 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.400
 really nutritious when you go 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.640
 rinse the hair are overflowing of 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.390
 really soft though if you do 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.360
 I should advise I don't know I don't have 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.590
 the council for 12 euros costs and is 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.980
 a liquid mask yes but that that 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.100
 in fact it is hard to spread around 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.930
 hair however liquid and of 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.450
 consequently you need a lot of product no 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.910
 to do all the hair 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.300
 so I personally this mask 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.130
 them already used three times and it's inside is 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.390
 remained at sufficient quantity ad 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.410
 apply it only one more time 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.239
 then 12 euros for a mask that you 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.560
 lasts four times and from a jar 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.070
 big enough 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.560
 I am 225 g I think the price is 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.820
 how excessive because it is precisely on the 12 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.310
 13 euros 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.530
 so I'm sorry but I owe it 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.560
 I don't recommend just rejecting it 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.420
 because because it lasts too little 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.100
 especially for the price that you 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.790
 the going pay other product than you 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:34.530
 monster is the gin and tonic shampoo that it is 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.209
 this one is a solid shampoo that you 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.360
 presents in this way 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.220
 and it is specific for oily hair this 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.070
 product I loved it and I'm a nardò 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.900
 very much because it really degreases 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.370
 a lot of hair and helps him 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.080
 stay clean 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.090
 so I recommend it 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.830
 so much if you have the problem of 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.890
 fat hair 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:59.480
 I recommend this to you on the 78 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:04.050
 he too euro and it lasts so long because 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.210
 look great big with me as a waffle 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.630
 let's face it given the thickness many times 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.960
 it's still pretty consistent let's say 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.760
 so surely you do many washes 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.549
 on the site it says that even 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.799
 80 washings reached this do not know 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.810
 anyway this absolutely if you have i 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.070
 fat hair is for you 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:29.120
 latest product and soft shampoo a 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:35.510
 coconut that came to me a little 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.510
 chopped this robot out here anyway 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.910
 I know this thing here too 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.290
 say to do for dry hair and 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.450
 damaged brittle and anything else though 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:55.050
 I don't recommend this 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:57.390
 because I noticed that hair tends to 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.650
 getting dirty faster makes one 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:05.100
 consistency that is almost sticky if 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.870
 I don't know how to say it didn't really like the 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.970
 feeling that left me this 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.350
 shampoo on the hair 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.860
 so I don't even recommend it 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:18.390
 because they don't give you a soft one 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:20.570
 special softness let's say they are soft 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.890
 you go a little intrigued a little 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.330
 tangled I had also heard 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.070
 another girl who told me that 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.980
 she had not been happy with the morbidone 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.780
 so I do not recommend it I recommend 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:35.480
 only lazzaro shampoo 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.820
 the shampoo for oily hair in every 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.530
 chance I wanted to tell you now I'm using 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.169
 these products just a month ago 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.720
 month and a half together with other products 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:50.840
 however that you can see in the video on 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:52.730
 lerker and these products together me 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.230
 really gave results 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:59.930
 fantastic because you notice that the hair 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:02.030
 it's fine and soft because it's his 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.150
 natural softness not because it is full 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:08.210
 of silicones I have my own greasy hair though 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.340
 using these products you don't get greasy anymore 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.460
 as before and for me it is truly a thing 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.410
 fantastic and I think it is really 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.980
 merit of all these products that they are 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:22.190
 natural and do not have all the crap 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.290
 so I really advise you to give 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.580
 I told you my opinion 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.190
 regarding these four products 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.520
 tell me how you found yourself 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.510
 I hope these levers were useful for me 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.330
 I did it as quickly as possible 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:39.130
 just to know something, see you 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.130
 soon the next video bye
