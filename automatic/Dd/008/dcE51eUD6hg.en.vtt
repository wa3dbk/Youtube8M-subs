00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
time when I'm guiding so we can switch

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.440 
time when I'm guiding so we can switch
back<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.280> forth<00:02:11.520> between<00:02:11.940> different

techniques such as

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.100 
techniques such as
shame<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.250> rising<00:02:14.550> trout<00:02:15.000> with<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> dry<00:02:15.480> fly<00:02:15.690> or

shame for rising trout with a dry fly or

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.930 
shame for rising trout with a dry fly or
for<00:02:16.830> floating<00:02:17.190> through<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.400> section<00:02:17.670> where

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
for floating through a section where

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.030 
for floating through a section where
there<00:02:18.090> aren't<00:02:18.270> rising<00:02:18.540> trout<00:02:19.020> we<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.740> use<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
there aren't rising trout we can use the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.950 
there aren't rising trout we can use the
sinking<00:02:20.430> line<00:02:20.610> with<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:20.850> streamer<00:02:21.240> or<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.570> nymph

sinking line with a streamer or a nymph

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.050 
sinking line with a streamer or a nymph
or<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.170> wet<00:02:22.530> fly<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.580> really

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
or a wet fly so this is really

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.700 
or a wet fly so this is really
convenient<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:25.050> gives<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.410> great
