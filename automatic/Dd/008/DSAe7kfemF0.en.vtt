half you can see the ends here find the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.149 
half you can see the ends here find the
midpoint<00:01:05.270> kind<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.360> squeeze<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.159> you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
midpoint kind of squeeze it so you you

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.679 
midpoint kind of squeeze it so you you
know<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.790> there's<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:09.510> bend

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
know where it is there's a little bend

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.109 
know where it is there's a little bend
in<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:11.210> then<00:01:12.210> you're<00:01:12.720> gonna<00:01:12.840> flip<00:01:13.939> the<00:01:14.939> wire

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
in it then you're gonna flip the wire

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.170 
in it then you're gonna flip the wire
around<00:01:15.630> your<00:01:15.840> ring<00:01:16.430> hope<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.610> guys<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.970> see

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
around your ring hope you guys can see

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.289 
around your ring hope you guys can see
it<00:01:18.799> okay<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.280> my<00:01:20.430> last<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:20.939> but<00:01:21.180> this

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it okay so this is my last one but this

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.170 
it okay so this is my last one but this
would<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.750> your<00:01:21.900> first<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.790> it's<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
would be like your first one it's up to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
would be like your first one it's up to
you<00:01:24.330> how<00:01:24.509> many<00:01:24.570> times<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.049> wrap<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.320> around<00:01:25.530> I

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you how many times you wrap it around I

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.170 
you how many times you wrap it around I
think<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.310> did<00:01:26.490> about<00:01:26.670> fourteen<00:01:27.210> times<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:29.180> wrap

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
think I did about fourteen times so wrap

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.149 
think I did about fourteen times so wrap
it<00:01:30.210> around<00:01:30.509> where<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> midpoint<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.799> around

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
it around where the midpoint is around

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.890 
it around where the midpoint is around
your<00:01:32.340> metal<00:01:32.610> ring<00:01:33.619> multiple<00:01:34.619> times<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:36.780> gets

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
your metal ring multiple times it gets

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.690 
your metal ring multiple times it gets
kind<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.409> crazy<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:38.009> all<00:01:38.189> these<00:01:38.340> wires

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
kind of crazy with all these wires

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.910 
kind of crazy with all these wires
sticking<00:01:39.030> out<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.500> little<00:01:40.650> hard<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
sticking out but it's a little hard to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.609 
sticking out but it's a little hard to
manage<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.689> it's<00:01:42.689> pretty<00:01:42.869> cool<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.380> very

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
manage but it's pretty cool it's a very

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.460 
manage but it's pretty cool it's a very
different<00:01:44.070> form<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.460> weaving<00:01:45.229> than<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:46.380> you

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
different form of weaving than what you

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.440 
different form of weaving than what you
saw<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.890> instance<00:01:46.920> um<00:01:47.340> Ecuador<00:01:47.790> lesson<00:01:48.210> with

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
saw for instance um Ecuador lesson with

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.499 
saw for instance um Ecuador lesson with
the<00:01:49.430> backstrap<00:01:50.430> loom<00:01:50.490> weaving<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> wool

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the backstrap loom weaving with the wool

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.810 
the backstrap loom weaving with the wool
I<00:01:51.810> think<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.040> pretty<00:01:53.220> cool<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.640> so

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
I think this is pretty cool it's so

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.819 
I think this is pretty cool it's so
inventive

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
inventive

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.789 
inventive
there<00:01:55.829> were<00:01:55.950> people<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.310> South<00:01:56.549> Africa<00:01:57.000> they

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
there were people in South Africa they

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.859 
there were people in South Africa they
realizes<00:01:58.799> underutilized<00:01:59.670> resource<00:02:00.479> of

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
realizes underutilized resource of

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.550 
realizes underutilized resource of
telephone<00:02:01.560> ways<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:03.259> there<00:02:04.259> are<00:02:04.290> problems

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
telephone ways and so there are problems

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.580 
telephone ways and so there are problems
because<00:02:05.100> they<00:02:05.219> would<00:02:05.310> start<00:02:05.549> digging<00:02:05.939> up

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
because they would start digging up

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
because they would start digging up
telephone<00:02:07.590> wires<00:02:07.890> from<00:02:08.220> under<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.550> ground

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
telephone wires from under the ground

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.210 
telephone wires from under the ground
and<00:02:09.090> people<00:02:09.149> are<00:02:09.390> losing<00:02:09.539> its<00:02:09.869> own

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
and people are losing its own

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.210 
and people are losing its own
and<00:02:10.960> we've<00:02:11.960> done<00:02:12.140> some<00:02:12.200> issues<00:02:12.620> with<00:02:12.800> that<00:02:12.920> now

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
and we've done some issues with that now

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.520 
and we've done some issues with that now
most<00:02:13.550> people<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:14.270> lot<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:14.780> people<00:02:14.900> order<00:02:15.380> their

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
telephone wire from craft stores but

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.510 
telephone wire from craft stores but
kind<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.090> funny<00:02:20.270> straight<00:02:20.570> all<00:02:20.990> right<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:22.340> I've

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
kind of funny straight all right so I've

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.550 
kind of funny straight all right so I've
got<00:02:22.550> my<00:02:23.030> ring<00:02:23.330> my<00:02:23.870> mother<00:02:24.080> reindeer

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
got my ring my mother reindeer

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.590 
got my ring my mother reindeer
completely<00:02:25.190> covered<00:02:25.640> with<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:26.060> color

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
completely covered with this color

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.290 
completely covered with this color
telephone<00:02:27.320> wire<00:02:27.500> all<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.340> way<00:02:28.430> around<00:02:28.640> I'm

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
telephone wire all the way around I'm

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.470 
telephone wire all the way around I'm
not<00:02:29.360> sure<00:02:29.870> how<00:02:30.200> much<00:02:30.410> wire<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:31.010> will<00:02:31.130> have<00:02:31.480> in

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
not sure how much wire you will have in

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.970 
not sure how much wire you will have in
comparison<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:33.170> your<00:02:33.500> ring

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
comparison to your ring

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.960 
comparison to your ring
so<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.580> might<00:02:34.790> have<00:02:34.940> some<00:02:35.240> spaces<00:02:35.900> from<00:02:36.260> metal

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
so you might have some spaces from metal

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.790 
so you might have some spaces from metal
spaces<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.180> between<00:02:38.210> your<00:02:38.810> telephone<00:02:39.530> wires

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
spaces in between your telephone wires

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.040 
spaces in between your telephone wires
the<00:02:40.550> colored<00:02:40.880> wires<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.360> think<00:02:41.570> that's<00:02:41.750> okay

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
the colored wires I think that's okay

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.840 
the colored wires I think that's okay
it's<00:02:42.260> okay<00:02:42.410> if<00:02:42.680> your<00:02:42.860> weave<00:02:43.130> it's<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.610> little

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
it's okay if your weave it's a little

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.170 
it's okay if your weave it's a little
bit<00:02:44.000> looser<00:02:44.990> if<00:02:45.110> it's<00:02:45.290> not<00:02:45.470> super<00:02:45.860> tight<00:02:46.180> as

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
bit looser if it's not super tight as

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.050 
bit looser if it's not super tight as
you<00:02:47.330> can<00:02:47.480> see<00:02:48.100> for<00:02:49.100> instance<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.550> one<00:02:49.790> this

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
you can see for instance this one this

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.910 
you can see for instance this one this
is<00:02:50.120> much<00:02:50.540> looser<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.860> weave<00:02:52.690> than<00:02:53.920> the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
is much looser of a weave than the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.670 
is much looser of a weave than the
example<00:02:55.459> from<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.540> professionals<00:02:57.170> who<00:02:57.500> know

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
example from the professionals who know

example from the professionals who know
what<00:02:57.800> they're<00:02:57.890> doing<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.400> it's<00:02:59.090> okay<00:02:59.390> here's<00:02:59.660> a

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
what they're doing so it's okay here's a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.510 
what they're doing so it's okay here's a
looser<00:03:00.140> this<00:03:00.350> is<00:03:00.440> your<00:03:00.560> first<00:03:00.800> shot<00:03:01.070> at<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.310> I

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
looser this is your first shot at it I

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.670 
looser this is your first shot at it I
just<00:03:01.550> wanted<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.030> get<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.630> guys<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:03.170> try<00:03:03.650> this

you can take it further if you never

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.320 
you can take it further if you never
want<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.190> do<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.400> again<00:03:10.490> you'll<00:03:10.790> never<00:03:10.880> have<00:03:11.120> to

want to do it again you'll never have to
so<00:03:12.260> what<00:03:12.410> I'm<00:03:12.500> going<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.680> do<00:03:12.830> is<00:03:13.010> take<00:03:13.250> this

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
so what I'm going to do is take this

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.330 
so what I'm going to do is take this
ring<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.970> stick<00:03:14.300> it<00:03:14.450> into<00:03:14.750> together<00:03:15.530> good

get position okay you're gonna create a
little<00:03:30.800> space<00:03:32.769> you<00:03:33.769> have<00:03:34.010> silver<00:03:35.000> colored

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
little space you have silver colored

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.800 
little space you have silver colored
wires<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:36.440> kind<00:03:36.800> of<00:03:36.890> shorter<00:03:37.370> silver<00:03:38.209> flimsy

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
wires to kind of shorter silver flimsy

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.920 
wires to kind of shorter silver flimsy
wires<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.470> put<00:03:40.250> in<00:03:40.400> your<00:03:40.549> package<00:03:40.970> you're

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
wires that I put in your package you're

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.759 
wires that I put in your package you're
going<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.200> use<00:03:42.350> those<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:43.130> insert<00:03:44.290> around<00:03:45.290> your

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
going to use those to insert around your

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.940 
going to use those to insert around your
ring<00:03:46.040> through<00:03:46.580> the<00:03:46.730> ball<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.320> connects<00:03:48.680> the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
ring through the ball so it connects the

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.340 
ring through the ball so it connects the
ring<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.489> secures<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:50.299> to<00:03:50.600> your<00:03:50.780> plastic

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
ring and secures it to your plastic

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.380 
ring and secures it to your plastic
you'll<00:03:51.500> play<00:03:51.739> container<00:03:52.190> and<00:03:52.549> then<00:03:53.239> you'll

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
you'll play container and then you'll

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.090 
you'll play container and then you'll
have<00:03:53.480> your<00:03:53.660> form<00:03:53.989> set<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.620> go<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:54.920> then<00:03:55.010> you

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
have your form set to go and then you

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.360 
have your form set to go and then you
can<00:03:55.250> begin<00:03:55.400> weaving<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:57.560> seems<00:03:57.799> to<00:03:57.980> keep<00:03:58.100> track

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
can begin weaving it seems to keep track

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.830 
can begin weaving it seems to keep track
of<00:03:58.580> a<00:03:58.790> lot<00:03:59.000> of<00:03:59.090> wires<00:03:59.269> that<00:03:59.450> kind<00:03:59.690> of<00:03:59.720> get

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
of a lot of wires that kind of get

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.630 
of a lot of wires that kind of get
twisted<00:04:00.049> back<00:04:00.320> with<00:04:00.470> each<00:04:00.590> other<00:04:00.799> but<00:04:01.010> other

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
twisted back with each other but other

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.830 
twisted back with each other but other
than<00:04:01.820> that<00:04:01.910> it's<00:04:02.269> pretty<00:04:02.450> straightforward

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
than that it's pretty straightforward
