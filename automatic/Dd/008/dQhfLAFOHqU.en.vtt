00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
 hello everyone I'm santiago sanz and in 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.360
 this video tutorial we are going 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.510
 to continue with the theme of the curves 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.670
 bÃ©ziers in blender because I missed one 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.550
 little thing in the previous tutorial then 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.590
 I'm going to make it as short as possible 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.010
 let's eliminate the cube that I have for 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.810
 default I'm going to press x on the keyboard 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.240
 I'm going to put myself in the top view with 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.880
 7 then I'm going to take away the perspective 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.919
 with 5 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.289
 and we're going to add a fault sometimes I'll 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.840
 press chief 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.820
 how to give you your pension 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 and I'm going to show you very interesting 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.950
 let's give it to us edith mode 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.140
 tabular then I'm going to put the curve in 2d 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.660
 remember that we go to properties 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.829
 then of data and we're going to press 2 d 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.020
 suppose I want to do 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.330
 a letter will make so 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.120
 let's select the whole curve 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.330
 with and then we're going to give it to be spline 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.520
 type that we are going to select poly 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.439
 and we are going to form 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.450
 with the control points selecting 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.619
 those with right click 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.619
 the shape of our letter 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.350
 we are missing here we are going to press for 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.300
 exclude again 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.460
 and remember and here we close with 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.460
 touch the click that we are going to select it 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.750
 all 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.750
 this button still 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.070
 we already have our letter we are missing the 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.140
 little hole here that happens to make 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.140
 this hole simply in the same 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.159
 edit curve mold with 3d course 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.810
 elsewhere he pressured 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.810
 and added again I 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.040
 let's select this 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.540
 controller here and we're going to 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.640
 select 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.490
 with right click and chief pressed this 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.430
 driver that cost we will give them 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.409
 spline and let's put it poly too 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.299
 and we just need a triangle so 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.030
 we need three control points to 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.490
 delete this 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.490
 this 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.660
 this 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.660
 and we are going to form 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.230
 the triangle that goes inside the 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.760
 now we select 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.409
 with right click to this fact is 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.409
 depressed we select all we give 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.550
 of the click site 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.450
 if we put this curve that I have here 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.450
 inside this other one creates us 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.760
 it's very interesting because with this 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.930
 you can do a lot of things 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.790
 enough figures 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.359
 I already have my letter, let's move on to 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:13.620
 tabular and already here I can put lexus 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:17.510
 0.2 this we saw in the last tutorial 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.510
 and let's give it a little bit of live here 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.510
 0.05 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.140
 0.0 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.570
 and we have our letter now 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.350
 basically what I wanted to show with the 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.950
 tutorial was 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.330
 how to make a curve have and I 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.430
 I can put all the curves I want 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.950
 here said for example I select these 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.810
 let's say we're going to select these 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.810
 and let's give it exists to duplicate it 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.090
 what's left 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.970
 with two holes 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.040
 I'll delete this again 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.010
 and that was the continuation or piece of 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.230
 curves say that I was missing 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.230
 I hope you find it useful
