 and how do I let it be done well 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.429
 bulky false eyelashes or paw 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.190
 spider or you want to call it just comes 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.199

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.189
 three masks and I 'll talk one 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.199

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.329
 that everyone uses 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.940
 this is the big secret for 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.239
 because it looks very voluminous. 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.730
 she inside it looks like it has a texture 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.190
 she's very thick and I really like her 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.039
 because his brush is my favorite 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.600

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.940
 the so overcome flood the element 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.590
 birthday of a friend of mine and me 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.930
 I was in love with him, he looks at the model 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.450
 of the brush is the master of this style of brush 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.010
 also the mask of the texture of the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.939
 brand is very good 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.880
 I use the one that also loves the south a lot 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.020
 Good people, his brush is more 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.479
 thin 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.280
 Okay, I use it to get here on the line. 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.590
 of water which is perfect which is very good 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.020
 does not make good people down here 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.590
 I want to show you who have not 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.680
 very secret wise to the great yes one 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.259
 big fan, I 'm going to go and I'll talk 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.610
 the great Czech I applied several 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:49.229
 layers and I always have a little mirror 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:51.930
 here in front of me and also because the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.240
 What happens? I'm going to look him down. 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.759
 It's okay when I get here. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.969
 I can look here and from below 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.340
 I can pick up aa him with the brush okay 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.759
 so I'll go through the first layer 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.209
 from below and I spend a lot of time 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.660
 Calm down because I think it 's up to an hour 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.470
 to relax because I love to pass 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.500
 I then the ideal is also always the people 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.830
 When the policeman leaves the net, he is 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.810
 the mask tube to it comes can 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.700
 that they accumulate 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.250
 mask here in front 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.070
 so I quite use the front part 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.050
 to be able to deposit the mask're 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.920
 and here in the front is perfect because everything 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:45.210
 take all the tiny little things 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:49.760
 small and we will apply good 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.760
 first layer already had no 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.460
 It's cool, people, this first layer. 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.590
 that my son is already very big because 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.840
 I already have big kids so this 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.760
 It also makes it easier, I think it's beautiful who has 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.770
 many Syrians happen when the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.390
 people have the children long it stays long 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.540
 but if you do not have eyelashes he will 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.210
 stay last month as it is long and 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.150
 full bulky we are very handsome 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.250
 much less for the second 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:23.220
 layer hope to stay light business and 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:25.730
 dry it all because it gets hard nÃ© oo 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.730
 mascara 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.570
 I got it and I'll spend my second 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.570
 layer 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.260
 so I always pull the mirror to tip 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:48.670
 it's mirror down here pulls the queen 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:52.000
 eyelash up on borrelidin the root 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.730
 people going get going pulling he uses the 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.750
 mascara tip because it's where the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.659
 rhyme gets more concentrated and pulls well 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.060
 another curve well the light is 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.819
 pulling curve it up and curve it 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.799
 Good back, the second layer is already 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.489
 We'll check it out as it is. 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.109
 different if and up powerful wait 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.459
 dry a little bit now I'll use this 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:20.739
 that gave the super flood I think it is 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.250
 These people, I'm wonderful to talk to. 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.139
 English the perfect pronunciation is the 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.660
 His brush is cowardice. 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.020
 wonderful to leave our children well 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.000
 Bent then have used the other children 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.300
 mask to give our volume to 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.220
 raise him now I could foresee 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.830
 to bend then I'll use it 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.320
 the following way I'm going to download that my 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.270
 children and I will also be following 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.690
 children because when we closed 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.570
 usually we do not go here for 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.990
 inside and it is only at the front 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.430
 with mask then I come he passes it goes 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.370
 stay like this, normal 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.460
 I'll go to bed and I'll go 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.080
 go all over the back 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.550
 look at the difference when you get them 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:15.510
 lying up is loud and I'm going 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.510

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.750

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.520
 That's where my show comes in. It says 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.669

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.150
 I call him from there we look at them and 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:35.680

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:37.510
 cute okay I do not spend more layer 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.270
 also because I feel that from there 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.550
 begins to fly you can imagine 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.810
 How much does it come out black when I'm going to take it? 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:50.710
 Bath when I'm going to take off the makeup 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.639

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.530
 the same on the bottom that already catches a 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.780
 little because I have my children 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:03.300
 very large pa 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:06.729
 I 've been very big and then I go 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:09.520
 doing the following manner using the 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:13.330
 where police station is 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:18.789
 concentration of our mask 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:23.289
 in the brush and then just get the brush 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:25.389
 deitadinho and arranges the hairs of 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.550
 The way you are good people are with the 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:31.300
 result look I love this effect so 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.250
 well, the spider's foot knows why 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.629
 people did not want a child so then 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:40.240
 of striking so the one or the people 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:42.699
 I would meet in post office so I 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.319
 I like people so much, it's one of the 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:47.199
 The ways that I use the most is sometimes only 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:49.270
 puts an eyeliner and passes like this is 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:51.159
 because I do not much like eyelashes 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.529
 false but I like it when I leave 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:57.909

 concentrated on the tip in time to take 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:33.189
