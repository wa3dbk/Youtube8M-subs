the<00:00:39.719> turret<00:00:40.260> area<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.750> once<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.710> get<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.920> this

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the turret area and once you get to this

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.830 
the turret area and once you get to this
middle<00:00:44.700> part<00:00:44.850> right<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:45.090> you're<00:00:45.719> gonna

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
middle part right here you're gonna

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.639 
middle part right here you're gonna
bounce<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:47.750> hit<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.780> barrel<00:00:49.230> over<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
bounce up hit the barrel over to the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.580 
bounce up hit the barrel over to the
left<00:00:51.320> while<00:00:52.320> hitting<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.829> switch

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
left while hitting that switch

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.050 
left while hitting that switch
and<00:00:55.070> I'll<00:00:55.700> let<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:55.940> continue<00:00:56.240> across

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.480 

hit<00:01:01.990> the<00:01:02.170> black<00:01:02.380> barrel<00:01:02.770> before<00:01:02.980> you<00:01:03.310> hit<00:01:03.430> the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
hit the black barrel before you hit the

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.160 
hit the black barrel before you hit the
green<00:01:03.730> barrel<00:01:04.090> so<00:01:04.239> you<00:01:04.300> can<00:01:04.540> get<00:01:04.750> rid<00:01:04.930> of<00:01:04.960> the

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
green barrel so you can get rid of the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.650 
green barrel so you can get rid of the
little<00:01:05.350> barrier<00:01:06.220> blocking<00:01:07.120> your<00:01:07.300> way<00:01:07.330> these

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
little barrier blocking your way these

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:24.750 
little barrier blocking your way these
two<00:01:07.870> parts

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.130 

once<00:01:25.760> you<00:01:25.880> work<00:01:26.090> your<00:01:26.210> way<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.570> top<00:01:26.660> over

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
once you work your way to the top over

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.510 
once you work your way to the top over
here<00:01:27.350> you're<00:01:27.530> going<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:27.770> hit<00:01:27.920> that<00:01:28.070> barrel

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
here you're going to hit that barrel

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.330 
here you're going to hit that barrel
over<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.090> right<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:29.690> when<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:29.990> drop<00:01:30.230> down

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
over to the right and when you drop down

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.800 
over to the right and when you drop down
you'll<00:01:31.340> land<00:01:31.610> on<00:01:31.790> that<00:01:31.970> switch<00:01:32.330> which<00:01:32.600> will

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
you'll land on that switch which will

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.630 
you'll land on that switch which will
get<00:01:32.990> rid<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.350> lightning<00:01:33.710> that's<00:01:33.920> blocking

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
get rid of the lightning that's blocking

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.120 
get rid of the lightning that's blocking
the<00:01:34.760> way<00:01:35.920> just<00:01:36.920> like<00:01:37.040> that<00:01:41.770> for<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:42.890> next

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
the way just like that for this next

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.290 
the way just like that for this next
part<00:01:43.400> you're<00:01:43.490> going<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.700> need<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:43.940> splode<00:01:44.240> a

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
part you're going to need to splode a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.810 
part you're going to need to splode a
barrel<00:01:44.750> over<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.350> right<00:01:45.530> that's<00:01:46.490> going<00:01:46.730> to

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
barrel over to the right that's going to

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.360 
barrel over to the right that's going to
essentially<00:01:47.420> meet<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:47.960> after<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:48.800> bounces<00:01:49.250> on

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
essentially meet you after it bounces on

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.550 
essentially meet you after it bounces on
that<00:01:49.580> trampoline<00:01:49.790> I<00:01:50.450> need<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.050> be<00:01:51.140> careful

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
that trampoline I need to be careful

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.980 
that trampoline I need to be careful
about<00:01:51.680> using<00:01:52.430> your<00:01:52.640> splits<00:01:53.000> here<00:01:53.180> because<00:01:53.630> if

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
about using your splits here because if

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.360 
about using your splits here because if
you<00:01:54.110> use<00:01:54.290> all<00:01:54.590> three<00:01:54.830> of<00:01:54.950> them<00:01:55.130> you're<00:01:55.280> going

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
you use all three of them you're going

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.040 
you use all three of them you're going
to<00:01:55.460> fall<00:01:55.640> right<00:01:55.670> into<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.180> lightning<00:01:56.630> so

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
to fall right into that lightning so

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.140 
to fall right into that lightning so
just<00:01:57.229> remember<00:01:57.350> not<00:01:57.620> to<00:01:57.800> spam<00:01:58.160> too<00:01:58.610> much<00:01:58.820> when

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
just remember not to spam too much when

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:14.949 
just remember not to spam too much when
you're<00:01:59.240> on<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.420> pink<00:01:59.930> wall

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.570 

great

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
this next part is going to involve a lot

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.539 
this next part is going to involve a lot
of<00:02:23.170> really<00:02:24.239> tightly<00:02:25.239> times<00:02:26.249> explosions<00:02:27.249> on

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
of really tightly times explosions on

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.539 
of really tightly times explosions on
barrels<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.019> see<00:02:29.290> right<00:02:29.469> there<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:29.980> really

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
barrels so you see right there I really

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.250 
barrels so you see right there I really
the<00:02:30.670> best<00:02:30.849> advice<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.510> give<00:02:31.599> you<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:31.900> keep

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.720 
the best advice I can give you is keep
your<00:02:32.439> eyes<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:33.010> right<00:02:33.280> side<00:02:33.549> of<00:02:33.579> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
your eyes on the right side of the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.309 
your eyes on the right side of the
screen<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.209> can<00:02:34.299> be<00:02:34.480> better<00:02:34.719> prepared<00:02:34.930> for

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
screen so you can be better prepared for

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:51.160 
screen so you can be better prepared for
them<00:02:35.439> to<00:02:35.620> show<00:02:35.859> up

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.870 

so<00:02:51.770> now<00:02:51.860> we're<00:02:52.069> going<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.250> be<00:02:52.370> doing<00:02:52.520> is

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
so now we're going to be doing is

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.660 
so now we're going to be doing is
hitting<00:02:53.480> these<00:02:53.599> switches<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.500> get<00:02:55.459> rid<00:02:55.640> of

hitting these switches to get rid of
those<00:02:55.819> pot<00:02:56.260> walls<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.709> guess<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.160> would<00:02:58.280> call
