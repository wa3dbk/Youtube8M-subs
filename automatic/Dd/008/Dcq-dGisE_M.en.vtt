 the age and the firefighters who are well the 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.610
 So that's why, because in fact 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.140
 when you do your shampoo shows 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.029

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.400
 maybe as well change of air 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.610
 Arthur the deeds and I left 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.520

 product called idrac nothing at 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:40.010
 paribas b that costs 18 euros it 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.930
 had this product I told myself 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.430
 frankly gesture did it well past 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.900
 experiences and especially for the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.580
 following people 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.970
 I like this experience of which you will 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.800
 dark side and frankly I have no 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.600
 this show he knew he had some 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.380
 champions your to cachan betrayed your mac 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.380
 here aims overlapping once they 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.540
 are in three bottles that are still 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:11.270
 a little limit all but not just for 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.800
 me to apply myself to the ego and I you 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.520
 swear that you will get the same 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.310
 behaviours 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.050
 this is simply the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.640
 produces small products 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.130
 paris dab and so I found it 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.710
 at abc lands after now 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.890
 to you to search where could with 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.229
 all notices and ip services must 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.940
 to vomit to flirt but I think that 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.710
 on Paris it must not say if he accessed 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.320
 with the head among the liberals we do not know 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:43.490
 never here are byproducts I you 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:46.310
 strongly advise to me so I 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.380
 know a hair brand we are talking about 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.420
 hair products 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.500
 frankly for me it's the indics 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.210
 after you tell me it was you in 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.920
 French but for me I find that 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.360
 deserves so I bought for making that 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.090
 the cream under intense violin 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.159
 without rinse from ultra garnier 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.890
 standing up the cldjp sensitive rct is 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.180
 for very dry and curly hair 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.930
 but is the hair very dry and 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.710
 prison read even more dry 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.420
 I do not like 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.430
 I do not like at all I find in more that 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.370
 it is 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.829
 it's a bit serious I do not like it at all 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.500
 product it's true that I 'm not going to 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.230
 sheikh does not leave them so bought I do not 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.370
 they will never buy brachotte 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.760
 frankly advice my scary smell 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.549
 the smell it's super good and all but 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.840
 I do not recommend buying this product 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.609
 here I bought them and I tell them 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.609
 would not buy because I'm very 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.609
 very very disappointed in this way there 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.750
 I bought l'oréal loop also bring 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.380
 him so it's a detangling trait he's 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.020
 so in addition to those without good sannikov 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.990
 past we 're here you 're just feeling 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.490
 the smell of hair smells like tox 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.000
 emails for real and it's not 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.800
 serious 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.870
 so I strongly advise you to 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.920
 your little one so it's very sublime 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.060
 did not realize it was here I advise you 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.060
 it's tough waste
