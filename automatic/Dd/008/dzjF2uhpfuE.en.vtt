00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.290
 let's see together the secret to an excellent tartar then the tartar 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.359
 a dish that comes with the meat then normally stylized beef tenderloin 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.380
 but more and more often I use and love fish such as salmon tuna la 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.489
 the most important thing is to never ever mix meat or olives in a blender 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.900
 fish we want to do we will get a dough on the grinder otherwise we lose 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.089
 liquids and therefore taste the only system and then that of cutting it knife 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.440
 from before we make quite thin strips 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.579
 the important 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.199
 I recommend always using a knife that has a sharp blade and that is 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.540
 a carver so that he has a clean cut 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.870
 it is also important to cut the meat and not always go fishing for it 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.550
 not losing body therefore cutting liquids must be read 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.650
 I specify the grain to a turtle and be similar 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.680
 to caviar 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.630
 here is our tarta 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.310
 when the cut is the size 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.440
 just to hear it on t20 when we go to chew it is ready 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.049
 we can transfer aside we will go then ah season it 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.440
 let's see now 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.010
 with salmon like 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.250
 also cut him finely with the knife keeping in mind that salmon 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.509
 it is more fat like fish then the creamier papier-mâché with effect 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.150
 the important thing to do it before the skin lights 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.000
 after which also in this case we proceed to cut it into strips 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.300
 very fine 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.130
 and it is still our salmon tartare as you can see it is much creamier if 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.180
 eat almost with your own 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.140
 the oily part of the salmon that makes it 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.060
 suitable for this preparation 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.659
 so here is our tuna and salmon tartar cut 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.260
 ready to go to be convinced it's served
