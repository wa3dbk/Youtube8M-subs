angola FIBA should do something about

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
similar situation to the champions

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.960 
similar situation to the champions
league<00:02:14.560> where<00:02:14.920> after<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.280> group<00:02:15.459> stage<00:02:15.700> they

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
league where after the group stage they

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.250 
league where after the group stage they
do<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.120> draw

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
do a draw

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.530 
do a draw
it's<00:02:17.500> all<00:02:17.709> random<00:02:17.980> people<00:02:18.670> are<00:02:18.819> seated<00:02:19.360> and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
it's all random people are seated and

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.280 
it's all random people are seated and
then<00:02:20.379> picked<00:02:21.099> out<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.459> hat<00:02:21.780> they<00:02:22.780> could<00:02:23.049> then

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
then picked out of a hat they could then

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.080 
then picked out of a hat they could then
eliminate<00:02:24.099> something<00:02:24.459> like<00:02:24.610> this<00:02:24.730> happening

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
eliminate something like this happening

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.970 
eliminate something like this happening
but<00:02:25.629> then<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.900> probably<00:02:26.140> have<00:02:26.319> scheduling

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
but then you probably have scheduling

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.309 
but then you probably have scheduling
issues<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.610> things<00:02:27.760> seeing<00:02:28.299> it's<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.750> tight

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
issues and things seeing it's a tight

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.850 
issues and things seeing it's a tight
tournament<00:02:29.890> but<00:02:30.849> something<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.840> consider<00:02:32.230> now

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
tournament but something to consider now
