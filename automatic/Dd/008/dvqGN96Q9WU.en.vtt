old I handed diet raster had an article
about<00:01:26.100> making<00:01:26.580> your<00:01:26.850> own<00:01:26.909> dye<00:01:27.270> transfer

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
about making your own dye transfer

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.730 
about making your own dye transfer
equipment<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:30.049> that<00:01:31.049> put<00:01:31.380> me<00:01:31.530> over<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
equipment and so that put me over the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.190 
equipment and so that put me over the
edge<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.340> decided<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.909> start<00:01:33.659> making<00:01:33.840> some

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
edge and I decided to start making some

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.550 
edge and I decided to start making some
dyes<00:01:35.210> basically<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.360> disassemble<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
dyes basically you disassemble the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.980 
dyes basically you disassemble the
colors<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.420> reassemble<00:01:39.420> them<00:01:39.450> these<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
colors and reassemble them these are the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.810 
colors and reassemble them these are the
sheets<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> film<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.680> need<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.490> do<00:01:41.640> this

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
sheets of film you need to to do this

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.789 
sheets of film you need to to do this
here's<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> original<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.470> finished

here's the original and the finished
print<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:45.390> separation<00:01:45.930> happens<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.439> is

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
print and the separation happens this is

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.600 
print and the separation happens this is
a<00:01:46.649> red<00:01:46.979> filter<00:01:47.310> exposure<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.420> these<00:01:48.840> films

if you wall them roll them out one at a
time<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.490> course<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.850> roll

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
them out all of the same piece of paper

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.490 
them out all of the same piece of paper
and<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.640> get<00:02:08.789> an<00:02:08.940> actual

now<00:03:34.010> we're<00:03:34.340> starting<00:03:34.519> to<00:03:34.700> finally<00:03:35.180> get<00:03:35.840> some

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
now we're starting to finally get some

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.479 
now we're starting to finally get some
color<00:03:36.440> here<00:03:37.419> at<00:03:38.419> the<00:03:38.660> yellow<00:03:38.989> printer<00:03:39.470> roll<00:03:40.310> it

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
color here at the yellow printer roll it

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.309 
color here at the yellow printer roll it
out<00:03:41.109> and<00:03:43.000> are<00:03:44.000> we're<00:03:44.329> almost<00:03:44.480> done<00:03:44.870> we<00:03:45.079> pull

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
out and are we're almost done we pull

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.789 
out and are we're almost done we pull
off<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.650> last<00:03:45.799> matrix<00:03:46.099> there's<00:03:46.970> our<00:03:47.329> image

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
off the last matrix there's our image

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.250 
off the last matrix there's our image
it's<00:03:48.799> so<00:03:49.130> exciting<00:03:49.579> to<00:03:50.000> see<00:03:50.540> this<00:03:50.870> for<00:03:51.169> the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
it's so exciting to see this for the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.170 
it's so exciting to see this for the
first<00:03:51.500> time<00:03:51.769> because<00:03:52.340> all<00:03:52.700> those<00:03:52.880> steps

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
first time because all those steps

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.780 
first time because all those steps
before<00:03:53.690> they're<00:03:54.290> all<00:03:54.530> black<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.160> white<00:03:55.220> steps

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
before they're all black and white steps

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.059 
before they're all black and white steps
this<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.599> the<00:03:56.750> first<00:03:56.989> time<00:03:57.260> you<00:03:57.470> actually<00:03:57.680> see

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
this is the first time you actually see

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.470 
this is the first time you actually see
a<00:03:58.099> color<00:03:58.430> image<00:03:59.530> so<00:04:00.530> dye<00:04:00.799> transfer<00:04:00.859> was<00:04:01.790> quite

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
a color image so dye transfer was quite

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.949 
a color image so dye transfer was quite
a<00:04:02.510> process<00:04:02.900> but<00:04:03.859> very<00:04:04.160> involved<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.299> I<00:04:05.750> used

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
a process but very involved and I used

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.740 
a process but very involved and I used
to<00:04:06.079> joke<00:04:06.260> to<00:04:06.440> people<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:08.150> know<00:04:08.269> if<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.569> want

to joke to people you know if you want

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.539 
to joke to people you know if you want
to<00:04:08.810> learn<00:04:08.959> dye<00:04:09.169> transfer<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:10.160> should<00:04:10.340> have

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
to learn dye transfer you should have

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.479 
to learn dye transfer you should have
your<00:04:10.669> head<00:04:10.880> examined<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:12.500> only<00:04:13.220> if<00:04:13.340> you're

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
your head examined and only if you're

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.199 
your head examined and only if you're
nuts

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
nuts

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.599 
nuts
should<00:04:15.139> you<00:04:15.349> attempt<00:04:16.010> it

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
should you attempt it

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.289
