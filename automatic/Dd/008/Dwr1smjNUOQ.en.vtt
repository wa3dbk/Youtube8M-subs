00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello girls how are you hoping super 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.790
 well and today I bring you how 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.340
 make this vest worn 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.309
 I loved the result in addition to 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.710
 which is super easy to do in addition to 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.380
 that are trending and let's leave this 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.060
 boring jacket and what are we going to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.939
 to occupy is chlorine water scissors thread hemp 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.149
 or galas disposable cup to take the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.189
 measures a cotonete and finally is 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:36.420
 where are we going to put everything to 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.399
 discolor and start the first thing I go 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.969
 to be doing is going to be trimming the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.969
 sleeves 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.190
 I'm going to be cutting them very pegadito 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.390
 until sewing 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.230
 so that later he is not doing 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.230
 hem 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.050
 and you have some pieces of 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.060
 denim trims them very well so that 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.260
 do not notice that previously it is a 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.260
 jacket hehe 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.240
 i 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:47.640
 and the same thing we're going to do with the other 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.640
 manga so that we stay like this 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.530
 and they bring that way it was already like a vest and 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.120
 if you want so you can use it but 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.640
 right now it 's very much in trend 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.370
 use it worn then we're going to 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.709
 start with the button this I will be 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.050
 applying a little chlorine to see what 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.410
 jean as quickly discolor or 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.750
 what color is left 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.250
 sometimes denim is 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.720
 it's yellow 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.180
 but I like it to be done 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.990
 of this color and well after doing it 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.090
 a very small test to my denim 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.170
 let's occupy the leagues 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.840
 tying some parts of the jacket 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.690
 this has to be randomly between more 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.530
 leagues put more you will see the effect as 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.530
 of colorados 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.950
 but I 'm going to be rolling it with 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.950
 hemp thread 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.560
 you have to start making your garment 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.230
 as a ball so that the effect is 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.180
 but not so marked with this is going to give you 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.180
 a more worn appearance 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.040
 and roll the yarn very well by squeezing it 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.040
 perfectly 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.380
 yes 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.380
 yes 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.720
 and now I'm going to be adding a bit of 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.450
 water about a quarter more or less 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.480
 the tub and later I'll be 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.640
 adding half the chlorine in the glass 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.650
 amounts are not exact since it goes to 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.990
 depend on your garment that so big 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.420
 be or you who are discolored what 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.420
 you want then that's how you're going to go 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.790
 basing to apply chlorine and 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.330
 mix you have to stir very well 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.270
 then leave it like 15 minutes or 20 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.040
 and again it's going to be how discolored 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.690
 you just want to be the time that what 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.790
 you are going to be leaving you are going to be there 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.280
 to the slope checking how the 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.470
 procedure is also to be 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.670
 turning to make them fade from all 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.770
 sides and remember that also the garment 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.280
 it's wet and so it's going to look a little 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.740
 darker in color we're really going to 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:43.460
 be removing all these entanglements if 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:45.830
 we are going to separate it very well and finally 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.900
 this is how we have left but this garment 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:54.470
 It's still wet and that's how it is 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.660
 we got the james vest 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.230
 I remain as if it had been a pledge 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.580
