00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.470 
got in a trade and just let you hear it
and<00:00:18.779> see<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.100> when<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.130> shake<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:21.270> blade

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
and see it when I shake it the blade

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:29.210 
and see it when I shake it the blade
rattles<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:24.920> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.070> see<00:00:26.340> why<00:00:27.800> when<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.830> pull

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
rattles and you can see why when I pull

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.070 
rattles and you can see why when I pull
on<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> blade<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:30.269> goes<00:00:30.510> back<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.810> forth

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
on the blade just goes back and forth

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.729 
on the blade just goes back and forth
like<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.250> then<00:00:33.170> it's<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.320> when<00:00:34.620> it

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
like that and then it's like when it

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.840 
like that and then it's like when it
gets<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.579> detent<00:00:37.219> see<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> normal<00:00:38.670> knife

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
gets to the detent see a normal knife

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.569 
gets to the detent see a normal knife
when<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.210> press<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:41.040> detent<00:00:41.489> ball

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
when you press it in the detent ball

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.299 
when you press it in the detent ball
sucks<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.989> should<00:00:43.200> stop<00:00:43.559> there<00:00:43.980> but

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
sucks it in and it should stop there but

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.720 
sucks it in and it should stop there but
it<00:00:44.579> goes<00:00:44.940> past<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.219> therefore<00:00:47.219> it's

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
it goes past that and therefore it's

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.270 
it goes past that and therefore it's
doing<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.510> right<00:00:48.780> there<00:00:49.079> I'm<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:49.649> sure<00:00:49.950> why

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
doing that right there I'm not sure why

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.350 
doing that right there I'm not sure why
I<00:00:51.050> was<00:00:52.050> looking<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.280> all<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.489> other<00:00:53.850> hinders

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
I was looking at all my other hinders

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.889 
I was looking at all my other hinders
and<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.620> none<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.100> them<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.000> they

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
and you know none of them do that they

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.240 
and you know none of them do that they
all<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.559> there<00:00:59.340> solidly<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:01.250> does

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
all are in there solidly this one does

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.799 
all are in there solidly this one does
that<00:01:02.489> right<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> was<00:01:03.300> thinking<00:01:03.359> maybe

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
that right there I was thinking maybe

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.410 
that right there I was thinking maybe
the<00:01:04.049> detent<00:01:04.530> hole<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> blade<00:01:05.729> was<00:01:06.000> drilled

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the detent hole on the blade was drilled

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.789 
the detent hole on the blade was drilled
off<00:01:06.750> slightly<00:01:08.930> but<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.260> wouldn't<00:01:10.560> explain

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
off slightly but that wouldn't explain

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.969 
off slightly but that wouldn't explain
why<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.400> blade<00:01:12.060> sits<00:01:12.990> higher<00:01:13.229> than<00:01:13.500> usual

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
why the blade sits higher than usual

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.780 
why the blade sits higher than usual
because<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.610> actually<00:01:14.790> take<00:01:15.270> my<00:01:15.479> thumb<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
because I can actually take my thumb and

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.310 
because I can actually take my thumb and
touch<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.000> tip<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.390> knife<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.900> pull<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
touch the tip of the knife and pull the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.249 
touch the tip of the knife and pull the
plate<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:20.180> guess<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.689> show<00:01:22.200> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
plate out I guess I can do that show you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.670 
plate out I guess I can do that show you
I<00:01:23.270> guess<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.570> cut<00:01:24.720> myself<00:01:24.900> while<00:01:25.290> I'm<00:01:25.409> doing

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
I guess I can cut myself while I'm doing

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.710 
I guess I can cut myself while I'm doing
it<00:01:26.630> but<00:01:27.680> on<00:01:28.680> any<00:01:28.979> other<00:01:29.159> hinder<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.759> can't<00:01:30.030> get

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it but on any other hinder you can't get

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.270 
it but on any other hinder you can't get
your<00:01:30.840> finger<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.229> there<00:01:31.320> deep<00:01:31.650> enough<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.100> pull

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
your finger in there deep enough to pull

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.240 
your finger in there deep enough to pull
the<00:01:32.430> blade<00:01:32.610> out<00:01:33.079> but<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.829> just

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the blade out but on this one it's just

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.249 
the blade out but on this one it's just
right<00:01:35.460> there<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.000> touch<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.079> can

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
right there you can touch it so you can

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.080 
right there you can touch it so you can
see<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.829> blade<00:01:38.100> doesn't<00:01:38.430> sit<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
see that the blade doesn't sit all the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.390 
see that the blade doesn't sit all the
way<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.110> look<00:01:40.320> at<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> jimping<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
way in if you look at the jimping you

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.580 
way in if you look at the jimping you
can<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.960> Halfmoon

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
can see the Halfmoon

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.520 
can see the Halfmoon
there<00:01:44.280> there<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.299> then<00:01:45.689> part<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.500> so

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
there there and then part of that one so

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.960 
there there and then part of that one so
1<00:01:46.979> 2<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.720> then<00:01:48.890> partially<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.729> on

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
1 2 and then partially that one and on

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.850 
1 2 and then partially that one and on
this<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:53.210> bad<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.680> only

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
this one the one that's bad you can only

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.050 
this one the one that's bad you can only
see<00:01:56.450> one<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.100> then<00:01:59.100> there's<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.579> blade<00:01:59.820> right

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
see one and then there's the blade right

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.100 
see one and then there's the blade right
there<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:01.369> north<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> normal<00:02:02.939> XM<00:02:03.600> 18<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
there so on north on a normal XM 18 the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.899 
there so on north on a normal XM 18 the
blade<00:02:04.350> should<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:04.619> sitting<00:02:04.979> deeper<00:02:05.610> so

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
blade should be sitting deeper so

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.880 
blade should be sitting deeper so
something<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.750> off<00:02:06.990> somewhere<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.680> blade

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
something is off somewhere the blade

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.199 
something is off somewhere the blade
doesn't<00:02:08.129> sit<00:02:08.459> as<00:02:08.610> deep<00:02:08.849> as

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
doesn't sit as deep as

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.270 
doesn't sit as deep as
normal<00:02:10.689> span<00:02:11.170> tow<00:02:11.519> and<00:02:12.519> it<00:02:13.650> does<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.859> here

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
normal span tow and it does that here

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.149 
normal span tow and it does that here
what<00:02:15.969> a<00:02:16.180> normal<00:02:16.450> hinder<00:02:17.290> does<00:02:17.530> when<00:02:17.799> you<00:02:17.920> close

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
what a normal hinder does when you close

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.709 
what a normal hinder does when you close
it<00:02:18.310> or<00:02:18.459> any<00:02:18.640> knife<00:02:18.909> for<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.239> matter

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 
it or any knife for that matter

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:25.699 
it or any knife for that matter
close<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.890> detent<00:02:21.370> sucks<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.819> in<00:02:24.060> no<00:02:25.060> movement

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
close it detent sucks it in no movement

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.559 
close it detent sucks it in no movement
and<00:02:26.709> on<00:02:27.189> this<00:02:27.400> one<00:02:27.670> when<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.090> close<00:02:28.389> it<00:02:30.569> makes

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
and on this one when you close it makes

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.899 
and on this one when you close it makes
a<00:02:31.780> weird<00:02:32.709> click<00:02:33.099> that<00:02:33.370> I've<00:02:33.489> never<00:02:33.639> heard

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
a weird click that I've never heard

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:50.150 
a weird click that I've never heard
before

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.470 

you<00:02:51.160> know<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.280> was<00:02:51.459> comparing<00:02:52.030> these<00:02:52.209> two

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
you know I was comparing these two

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.510 
you know I was comparing these two
knives<00:02:52.720> which<00:02:53.110> is<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.380> same<00:02:53.620> model<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.310> I

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
knives which is the same model and I

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.970 
knives which is the same model and I
cannot<00:02:54.880> find<00:02:55.240> anything<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:56.230> was<00:02:56.350> different

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
cannot find anything that was different

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.559 
cannot find anything that was different
that<00:02:57.040> would<00:02:58.470> make<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.650> be<00:02:59.800> like<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:00.670> that

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
that would make it be like that so that

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.380 
that would make it be like that so that
tells<00:03:01.810> me<00:03:02.050> that<00:03:02.080> there's<00:03:02.740> a<00:03:02.800> high<00:03:03.640> level<00:03:04.000> of

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
tells me that there's a high level of

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.330 
tells me that there's a high level of
machining<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.290> tolerance<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:06.100> these

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
machining and tolerance that these

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.310 
machining and tolerance that these
knives<00:03:06.520> had<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.060> be<00:03:07.209> made<00:03:07.420> too<00:03:07.690> if<00:03:07.990> they're

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
knives had to be made too if they're

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.530 
knives had to be made too if they're
going<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.500> be<00:03:08.650> perfect<00:03:09.130> because<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.760> was

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
going to be perfect because I was

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.090 
going to be perfect because I was
looking<00:03:10.690> at<00:03:11.020> where<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> detent<00:03:11.709> ball<00:03:11.800> is

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
looking at where the detent ball is

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.800 
looking at where the detent ball is
drilled<00:03:12.370> on<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.730> lock<00:03:12.910> bar<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.510> looks<00:03:13.690> the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
drilled on the lock bar and it looks the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.470 
drilled on the lock bar and it looks the
same<00:03:14.080> looking<00:03:14.860> where<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.190> pivots<00:03:15.880> drill<00:03:16.239> in

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
same looking where the pivots drill in

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.660 
same looking where the pivots drill in
there<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:17.850> where<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.050> stop<00:03:20.050> 10<00:03:20.380> is<00:03:20.620> at<00:03:20.830> I<00:03:21.160> was

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
there and where the stop 10 is at I was

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.170 
there and where the stop 10 is at I was
looking<00:03:21.940> at<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.540> looks<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.900> same

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
looking at that and that looks the same

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.070 
looking at that and that looks the same
so<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:27.090> don't<00:03:28.090> know<00:03:28.209> what<00:03:28.450> would<00:03:28.600> cause<00:03:28.810> the

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
so I don't know what would cause the

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.330 
so I don't know what would cause the
blade<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.620> be<00:03:30.090> sitting<00:03:31.090> higher<00:03:31.390> than<00:03:32.340> normal

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
blade to be sitting higher than normal

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.170 
blade to be sitting higher than normal
or<00:03:34.030> why<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.709> detent<00:03:36.280> isn't<00:03:36.820> working

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
or why the detent isn't working

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.610 
or why the detent isn't working
correctly<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.519> knife<00:03:39.700> does<00:03:40.030> function

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
correctly but the knife does function

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.600 
correctly but the knife does function
properly<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:42.700> does<00:03:42.880> still<00:03:43.150> flick<00:03:43.480> open<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:45.400> has

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
properly it does still flick open it has

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.080 
properly it does still flick open it has
a<00:03:45.640> strong<00:03:46.030> detent<00:03:47.130> but<00:03:50.790> still<00:03:51.790> in<00:03:51.940> there

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
a strong detent but still in there

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.110 
a strong detent but still in there
pretty<00:03:52.329> good<00:03:52.450> but<00:03:53.320> none<00:03:53.709> of<00:03:53.739> my<00:03:54.070> exams<00:03:54.579> do<00:03:54.910> that

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
pretty good but none of my exams do that

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.870 
pretty good but none of my exams do that
