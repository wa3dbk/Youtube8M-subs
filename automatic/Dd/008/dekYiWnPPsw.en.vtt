 elite gaming today on destiny 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.340
 we're going to analyze peace together 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.110
 released January 12 or yesterday evening 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.940
 before starting to talk about this 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.559
 known fish I remind you that the assault falls 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.509
 the night came out this week will be 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.680
 that of sexies I already talked about 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.660
 a few months ago 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.010
 if interested in any advice 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.109
 to a guide to be able to do it 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.580
 complete as easily as possible 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.109
 Click on the screen image and there you are 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.730
 will open in another tab to that video 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.199
 that said let's go back to talking about the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.269
 patch slots regarding i 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.520
 changes related to rewards e 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.680
 a bug has been fixed for which withdrawing 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.600
 the reward for completing a 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.399
 public event was not there 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.440
 possibility of being able to receive materials 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.760
 ascendants also in regards to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.350
 the cannes assaults at night 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.230
 now there is also the possibility of being able to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.719
 receive in addition to the usual reward 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.250
 novio stranger you want for how much 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.750
 instead it concerns the pvp or the crucible 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.000
 what is relevant is what it was 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.860
 reintroduced the iron banner event 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.899
 ie with the multiplayer mode where i 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.250
 level balances are zeroed e 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.230
 yours from in your weapon 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.030
 will actually tell between 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.650
 armor that you can buy thanks 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.930
 at the reputation level of the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.689
 There is a pair of gloves on the iron banner 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.210
 level 32 therefore with 36 of light is a 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.159
 chest level 31 both with 33 of light 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.840
 quite unusual choice if I have to 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.119
 to be honest I don't understand why 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.890
 unfortunately we all know details 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.290
 the winnings interact in many ways 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.790
 mysterious talking about weapons instead 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.400
 the only one to have been touched by 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.110
 this patch will be at least pounding that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.390
 you will see it temporarily disabled 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.100
 a skill that is the one that increased i 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.689
 damage to the major of the hive and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.670
 let's say this ability went into 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.200
 contrast to the one you did 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.820
 reset the charger by setting a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.770
 sign three critical shots in a row in one 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.840
 short period of time then for the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.939
 moment this ability will be disabled 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.950
 and finally for this patch is most 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.990
 part of the changes will concern the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.850
 raids regarding the vault 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.920
 all the exotic weapons too much 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 will be taken to level 32 then a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.189
 maximum damage 331 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.930
 as regards instead the end of 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.490
 first of all they will have been 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.140
 all ten corrected like that of 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.880
 bridge so now you have to be for 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.770
 force in six and you will have to cross a 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.570
 normally the bc of was corrected 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.220
 carrot so you can't leave it anymore 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.110
 permanently kneeling 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.340
 disconnects from the connection 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.080
 all the gleeks have been corrected 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.700
 they were about radiance so you won't be able to 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.740
 more to use it to take off 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.420
 certain of the bars have been corrected 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.470
 all bugs such as that 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.720
 of the super soul than to some 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.760
 players were destroyed when 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.980
 instead it was not was corrected on 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.960
 double handle sword bugs have been 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.670
 modify the lanterns thus excluding 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.930
 now they won't throw you have more 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.090
 on the other side of the map but 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.160
 they will simply cause you damage and 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.900
 finally they have been slightly modified 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.580
 also the raids of this raid 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.500
 in fact the initial cash the one in 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.090
 maze will not give you more exotic weapons 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.250
 or class armor but only 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.810
 radiant materials the drop that before and 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.220
 represents in this house now will be 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.260
 moved or rather added 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.270
 to the death card that will finally have one 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.370
 purpose is in fact now can equip 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.989
 radiant materials can drop the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.850
 Class II armor will have the small 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.040
 likelihood of finding weapons as well 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.770
 exotic so guys for this patch 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.270

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.360
 that some by certain 10 have been 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.380
 correct if you would have preferred to exploit them 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.780
 al with a little something that I personally 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.370
