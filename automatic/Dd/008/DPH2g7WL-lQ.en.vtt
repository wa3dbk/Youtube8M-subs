00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.480
 Ricardo I see 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.149
 to me 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.079
 our our dads have made a 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.149
 incredibly absurd effort to 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.379
 educate ourselves in the best way they 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.659
 always like they taught us to 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.140
 behave well in certain situations 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.670
 depending on the place where 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.980
 we were 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.239
 although we made a tantrum that 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.009
 we all remember at some opportunity 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.530
 of the parents especially remember the 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.630
 first tantrum that your son made to that 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.250
 tender age of 45 years or so in a 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.800
 mall one did not get something 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.450
 that one wanted 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.370
 or they did not let him keep playing more 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.380
 then one threw himself to the ground and shouted and 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.970
 He wept until he could not while the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.320
 dads were red with grief and not 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.550
 they knew what to do because they can not 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.370
 hit a child in front of others what 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.050
 that if my mom just said that 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.850
 that many moms said in the house of 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.050
 we fix and I do not have to not 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.420
 I have to explain what happened in the 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.040
 home not because we all have brands yet 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.240
 I in fact that with a slight tick of the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.460
 last fight that hit me 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.049
 when I was a child and even though I 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.880
 they made that incredible effort 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.990
 to educate ourselves well there are many tricks that 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.119
 they do not know that we have 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.130
 because there are many tricks we had 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.420
 there are many Mayan hidden that 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.830
 many people as you ashamed 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.079
 recognize then I 'm here to 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.149
 to say them, I am like the 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.070
 kamikaze that is going to say there are people 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.289
 who eats the nails for example that's 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.460
 horrible it seems to me half there are no people 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.280
 that he even eats them and makes a 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.140
 little pile with the nails that ate 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.890
 so filthy of you are the ones that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.720
 they eat them 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.880
 I do not do not like my nails, I do not 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.430
 like the nails so that I eat the 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.739
 little things that are around 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.329
 that's what happened to him and he does not have a 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.030
 appetite raised and you know you're going to 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.980
 hurt higher but equal one of the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.719
 removes and until blood comes out in the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.340
 finger and there come in person who gives 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.069
 laziness to get up to wash duty 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.840
 is to leave little body there again 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.840
 nothing of those mornings would have happened 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.629
 these ugly manias of those mornings 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.920
 when one goes to a restaurant for 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.870
 example people love to paste the 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.760
 chewing gum under the table because I mean 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.950
 because the laziness of an audience to 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.269
 bounce the chewing gum even one grope to 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.579
 see and other chewing gum there is not to be the 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.880
 first to be the first and one says and 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:01.190
 this one was given garau and this one 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.810
 to a side as your brand not as as 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.100
 the challenge of not getting caught 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.230
 he's even looking for the waiter to be 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.370
 on his back and all the bullshit even 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.510
 there are people who stick it behind the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.510
 ear to be more to the side 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.520
 if they have not found I really never 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.380
 I was and when eating there are many 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.940
 mornings I imagine I'm going to I'm from 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.440
 those who soak the father in the coffee to me 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.790
 They forgive me but I love me 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.770

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.959
 Delicious that and drain the bread in 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.750
 the cup if it is delicious is delicious 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.690
 delicious to look with the bread the yolk of the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.890

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.569

 What I like most about pasta in my house 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.370
 we have heated everything a salt 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.060
 we showed pizza and it was for the 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.440
 night 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.580

 delicious 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.600
 we have many tricks and when eating there 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.370
 many tricks that we have in the 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.630
 restaurants I do not like to almost go to 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.790
 elegant restaurants sometimes you touch 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.170
 one go but I do not like me I do not 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.370
 like to go to elegant restaurants 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.600
 also because almost nowhere do they sell 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.300
 heated 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.530
 he does not know what to ask is desperate one 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.270
 it behaves differently I do not know if I 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.070
 it happens that I do not arrive restaurant towards 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.980
 another face and a whole gentleman 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.630
 complement one while gentleman if 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.350
 he knew to hit the snot and the 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.320
 railing the camera 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.060
 does not tell you gentleman or the risk that 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.340
 they behave a gentleman does not behave 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.230
 Gentleman, look if it's all worth eating 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.940
 an elegant restaurant with a friend 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.569
 an Italian restaurant she said that she 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.369
 I loved had the donkey 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.839
 I'm not going to call her let's say 

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:36.020
 clearly I was not going to fulfill his 

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.020
 expectations 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.039
 If I scarcely have criminal Ricardo kg 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:46.809
 It is a penis that leaves one satisfied and 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.809
 It did not fill us completely but 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.250
 after about two weeks because I 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.690
 I will find out what penalties he wrote with 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.710
 double n so for what is donkey 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.710
 then it's time to start tomorrow 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.840
 I do not like to go to elegant restaurants 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.130
 you are waiting for a lunch with some 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.169
 friends to an elegant restaurant a 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.940
 lunch of those work and I do not 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.770
 I knew that I asked not I got there and I 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.060
 I did not know what to do, I said no minimum 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.970
 paste the chewing gum I had it because I 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.290
 it was sad to say that they gave me my 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.729
 Grandpa told me not to chew gum 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.320
 because that sticks to your guts 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.550
 I do not know where the guts are but not 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.080
 I want no one to hit me happen to me 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.330
 the wine list of great precision and 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.550
 that I do not have the remotest idea 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.139
 It was a wine that is not made to depend 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.999
 initially you when you recommend 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.620
 the same country depends on what they go to 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:40.060
 ask us to ask for red meats 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.310
 I recommend a game cabernet sells 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.870
 products with very strong tannins the 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.699
 sir is familiar with tannins 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.919
 and the me then I when I was young 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.180
 let's say that it did have strong tannins 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.370
 but I neglected a lot this is more 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.880
 plus 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.880
 bring a box 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.150
 and that as a shoe rather than as a 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.150
 shoe 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.330
 finally I did not pass the letter of the 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.070
 meals and all this was watching me 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.720
 rare I saw that as in Chinese I do not 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.730
 I knew I was going to ask then or another 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.250
 friend that were souls that I the man 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.240
 it's also the same too much then 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.530
 I did not know what to ask for the man is so 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.840
 emptying that live and in my block of 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.370
 magnet as we were there the others like 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.020
 eating sent me myopia text message 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.490
 a switch and ask your girl with rolls 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.850
 little ones and then we eat a 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.850
 hamburger 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:34.589
 new ones that we have with friends one is 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:38.669
 get drunk before arriving at the place to avoid 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:40.379
 have to buy their and I did not do 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.809
 case I ordered a plate of sushi that 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:44.639
 called flame tempura roll in chronic 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:46.049
 Arabs who had no idea of ​​the waiter we 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.059
 brought salt sticks the other hand that 

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:49.499
 complicate eating with him is ready yo yo 

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:51.269
 I've never been able to one can last now 

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:52.709
 choosing the last one to pink and one does not 

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:54.860
 they will win you can not cover this 

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:56.689
 brook the country 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.280
 and I took the sticks to the house 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:00.159
 rehearse and eat heated with the 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.419
 sticks 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:04.729
 eating pizza with the sticks that's a 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:06.940
 despair to one does not give 90 with a 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:06.940
 fork 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.479
 and after performing we will use sticks 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.199
 then I used it to be able to all the 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:15.199
 world to apply them 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.780
 my sister took it off and now but the 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.430
 sticks that you give us but in the case that 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.629
 I was there at the table and he brings me 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.860
 That dish of flame tempura roll will be 8 

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:33.810
 switch rolls and as asia 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.430
 I was not going to be full with 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.319
 that of course and the worst is that I do not 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.939
 knew that being a flamed dish then 

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:40.349
 it came with fire was and it is not 

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:41.550
 literally the sushi rolls are 

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:43.500
 they are burning there they were 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.879
 burning and the waiter leaves me this 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.460
 pod and everyone started eating and I 

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:49.410
 caught with good how I turn this off 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.669
 not trying to do it like that with a 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.880
 napkin 

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:56.280
 but I tried to pour water and all the 

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.480
 shame not subsided I told my dad 

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.850
 take me 

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.290
 that one because one likes to pretend in 

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.120
 the restaurants one has to be one 

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.950
 same of hands I prefer that if thousand 

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.810
 Sometimes I have heated myself or eaten 

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.520
 a pie with enough so if it is 

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.560
 my fault but not from others 

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.000
 one has to be oneself wherever 

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.000
 thank you very much again
