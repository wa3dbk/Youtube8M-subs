00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
theories out there for it but this one I

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.540 
theories out there for it but this one I
find<00:00:27.839> to<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.019> one<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> most<00:00:28.920> interesting

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
find to be one of the most interesting

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.640 
find to be one of the most interesting
for<00:00:30.060> sure<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.630> one<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> most<00:00:31.410> realistic

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650

this<00:00:32.550> theory<00:00:32.850> actually<00:00:33.090> only<00:00:33.450> came<00:00:33.720> out<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
this theory actually only came out a

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.540 
this theory actually only came out a
couple<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.350> days<00:00:34.560> ago<00:00:34.740> so<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.250> brand

5 years old because Andy would think
that'd<00:03:13.799> be<00:03:13.919> the<00:03:14.040> coolest<00:03:14.069> thing<00:03:14.609> when<00:03:14.790> he<00:03:14.879> was

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
that'd be the coolest thing when he was

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.000 
that'd be the coolest thing when he was

5 especially if it was just after your
year<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.549> maybe<00:03:17.729> his<00:03:17.940> father<00:03:18.150> passed<00:03:18.479> away

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.330 
year that maybe his father passed away
it<00:03:19.169> says<00:03:19.379> here<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.620> if<00:03:19.829> woody<00:03:20.010> had<00:03:20.159> been<00:03:20.310> a

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340

it says here that if woody had been a
new<00:03:20.609> toy<00:03:20.909> when<00:03:21.180> Miss<00:03:21.359> Davis<00:03:21.750> gave<00:03:21.900> him<00:03:22.049> to<00:03:22.169> Andy

that<00:03:23.010> he<00:03:23.099> probably<00:03:23.400> would<00:03:23.609> have<00:03:23.699> known

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
that he probably would have known

exactly who he is

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.839 
exactly who he is
just<00:03:25.500> like<00:03:25.650> Buzz<00:03:25.889> Lightyear<00:03:26.370> knew<00:03:26.519> exactly

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
just like Buzz Lightyear knew exactly

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.539 
just like Buzz Lightyear knew exactly
who<00:03:27.180> he<00:03:27.449> was<00:03:27.479> when<00:03:28.199> he<00:03:28.409> was<00:03:28.560> given<00:03:28.859> a<00:03:28.919> handy<00:03:29.280> now

little<00:05:06.889> bit<00:05:07.009> darker<00:05:07.190> which<00:05:07.849> makes<00:05:08.090> sense

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
little bit darker which makes sense

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.180 
little bit darker which makes sense
