00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:07.390
 hello guys and they do not come out and we're 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:09.080
 seeing these adidas terrex just one year 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.900
 more or one color 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.660
 and this is the second we've seen 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.340
 after this previous 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.720
 it's very interesting you play this 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.550
 author adventure model yes and we are going to 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.470
 see a little and briefly what is this 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.730
 footwear and what things make up 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.550
 materials make up the same good we go 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.820
 to begin with this for this border 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.760
 that is a model lake like rubber that 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.850
 cover in bastad 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.540
 it shows the proportion is covered 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.640
 bumper 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.610
 because we want an exit for the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.260
 sports and adventure 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.610
 and that prevents the tip from being destroyed is 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.610
 pretty clean smooth 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.430
 well the one that has this student 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.430
 stallone is strong it shows 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.890
 on both sides of the tortilla 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.090
 is with the blue pins that 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.789
 is interwoven in this kind of nylon 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:21.250
 that also binds to that part of 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:22.600
 panel yes and also composes this kind of 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:28.140
 materials that is a kind of fiber 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.140
 synthetic as a new impression 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.370
 the three bands of this future is not 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.610
 as well 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.330
 that part of the island of those three 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.330
 last airs 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.440
 to almost an internet job this 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.990
 this 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.990
 like textiles this 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.689
 It is a type of internal fiber 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.240
 let's take out the templates and 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.240
 quickly 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.460
 also remember your location 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.420
 basic 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:18.630
 the inmate guys look at him it's like this is not 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.630
 cooked but if in the background 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.190
 It has some cuts 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.190
 for him 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.510
 to react to see if we are going to do 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.060
 the fight in this 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.730
 It has cuts in soil to be able 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.079
 flex easily but normal 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.409
 I'm afraid because the template is pretty 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:47.110
 flat how it shows does not have cuts but 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.939
 in the intern allows those cuts that 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.720
 this is a super flexible operation 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:56.319
 In addition to very good design and beautiful the 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.819
 part of the tongue this is 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.600
 a tongue as food one let's say 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.450
 have a 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.930
 an ergonomic design true so you do not 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.300
 drag does not bother in the part 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.660
 upper of the instep which is this one goes 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.700
 that is joining the rest of the part 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.090
 of the tongue and here I do not know if we notice 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.069
 this is this bra so that you 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.470
 mooring good if it will be samarra in everything 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.400
 case that the pin is not moving 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.610
 as we notice here 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.159
 it's a pin holder and this one has 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.280
 one between solÃ¡ de eva also carries 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.439

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.120
