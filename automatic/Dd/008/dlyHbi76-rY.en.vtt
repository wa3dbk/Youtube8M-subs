00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.290
 All the best of the day and good mood 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.779
 with you bono and a series of supporters 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.990
 bones for dancers and teachers 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.050

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.500

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.660
 spring and now every day we will 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.410
 it's easier and more fun to deal with 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.710
 difficulties and go towards your goals a 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.290
 today I want to talk to you about 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.500
 frogs yes yes yes and such green sometimes 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.940
 we are nasty at the wrong time cemetery and 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.250
 sometimes up to us 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.310
 frog you ask what is the relationship between 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.500
 frogs and dancing and I am you now 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.690
 I will explain 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.900
 There is she very remarkable phrase 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.780
 owned by twain's brand and it sounds 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.130
 so if costs have a frog 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.030
 the rest of the day promises to be wonderful 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.219
 since the worst for today is over 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.039
 whether you are a dancer or a teacher 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:23.659
 the rule of eating in the morning some 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:26.939
 your frog should be for you 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.429
 paramount but usually we dream 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.679
 we want to spend our time on things 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.899
 which are given to us easily and with 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:37.460
 pleasure and at the same time receive 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:40.259
 quick and stunning results 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.369
 so that the splits could stretch 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.429
 in one week 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.389
 so that the dance itself set back the night 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.149
 before the concert 

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:52.350
 so that the technique itself and cope 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.590
 with a load of 2 lessons per week and so 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.139
 further and the like 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.740
 wake up people how old are you what are you up to 

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:03.829
 still believe in a fairy tale there is no success 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.749
 without eating frogs 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:10.110
 daily eating of frogs 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:13.590
 want to sit on the splits get ready to eat 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.850
 frogs price for pain every day 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.860
 or every other day 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.290
 wrap in a bunch of clothes 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.890
 warm up and stretch 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.739
 through pain over and over again you want to improve 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.319
 forget the technique as quickly as possible 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.030
 free time 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.299
 attendance two or three times 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.439
 a week it's only for lovers for 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:40.019
 those who simply for themselves and engaged 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:42.329
 you will have to eat less frogs 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.329
 time to surf the internet and hang out 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.189
 with friends less buy yourself upgrades 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.579
 save money for personal 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:53.489
 classes and spend more time in 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.939
 dance class each of us 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.169
 have our personal frogs which 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.919
 we have to eat 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:06.030
 first of all it means all the most 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:10.139
 heavy and maybe the most unpleasant we 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.480
 should do the very beginning when you 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.939
 come a valid ballet class 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.090
 do you immediately start dancing 1 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:21.359
 burnt middle and jump allegro nothing 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.319
 like a teacher will torment you for a long time 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.569
 positions and correctly when asked for a long time 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.629
 and tedious you will learn correctly 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.549
 output avtandil again time after time 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.459
 semi finger finger 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.199
 semi finger watch your heel 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.569
 to close pension was this going to be your 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:45.120
 personal frogs which will be necessary 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.659
 eat in huge amounts while you 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.209
 start moving on you 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:54.479
 Surely, like me, I met a huge 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.989
 number of nice interesting dancers 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:04:01.379
 who like and dancer or bad like and 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.349
 equipment decently but from year to year 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:07.409
 same results third fourth 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.879
 place in the competition and do not move on and 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.060
 all 1st floor 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.819
 I 'm sure they just don't eat 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.759
 their frogs are not taken in the first 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.079
 all for something that does not come easy not 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.659
 it turns out right away 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.090
 that is to say roughly go the way 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:26.880
 least resistance 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.510
 what is the most offensive these people usually 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:34.230
 very talented that's why 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.630
 they don't eat their frogs don't take in 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.420
 first of all for not coming easy 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.670
 it does not work quickly that is rude 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.350
 saying go the path of the smallest 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:49.350
 resistance what is the most offensive these people 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.640
 usually very talented and precisely 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.590
 so they don't eat their frogs 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.520
 go to the fact that the easiest 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.880
 that is actually on their talents but 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.080
 it is not enough is not easy 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.540
 ways to success 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.360
 even if it seems to you that he is wearing lipstick 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.570
 it was easy to believe it just 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.340
 no one seems to see what time it is 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.460
 people spend dancing class 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.700
 how much time and effort does it take to fight 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.830
 myself laziness my uncertainty i 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.060
 I know a lot of famous 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:30.030
 dance teachers and all of them 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:33.510
 they inject by the day they are between 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.660
 a pleasant affair and a frog is chosen in 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.660
 first of all eating this 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.120
 frogs you have to take a cue from them 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.790
 if you want to achieve the result of your 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.880
 Professions perceive it as 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:51.120
 test as challenged and personal 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.880
 don't be tempted to start over 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.510
 easy tasks just remind yourself 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.410
 what is the most important decision is what 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.630
 eat a frog also remember that the secret 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.360

 take on the main job you have to 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.060
 life rules set for yourself 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.260
