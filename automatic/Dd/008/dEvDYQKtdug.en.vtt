00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
does not cover fully so it leaves a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960 
does not cover fully so it leaves a
headphone<00:01:28.259> jack<00:01:28.500> exposed<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.700> still

use it and then it has a nice contoured
shape<00:01:32.729> around<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.750> micro<00:01:34.049> USB<00:01:34.439> charger<00:01:35.210> at

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
shape around the micro USB charger at

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.850 
shape around the micro USB charger at
the<00:01:36.479> top<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.840> have<00:01:36.990> three<00:01:37.350> different

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.230 
one for the volume rockers and covering
some<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.920> chrome<00:01:47.130> up<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.060> was

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
some of the chrome up here and this was

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.460 
some of the chrome up here and this was
a<00:01:48.270> little<00:01:48.450> bit<00:01:48.570> harder<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.869> install<00:01:49.259> just

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
a little bit harder to install just

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.690 
a little bit harder to install just
because<00:01:49.710> these<00:01:49.860> pieces<00:01:50.130> are<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.399> little<00:01:50.460> bit

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
because these pieces are a little bit

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.880 
because these pieces are a little bit
thin<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.240> overall<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.350> installation<00:01:52.799> was

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
thin but overall the installation was

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.950 
thin but overall the installation was
really<00:01:53.220> easy<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.460> do<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.540> reason<00:01:54.659> like

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
really easy to do and the reason like

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.749 
really easy to do and the reason like
these<00:01:55.140> skins<00:01:55.470> are<00:01:55.649> because<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> back<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.640> this

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
these skins are because the back of this

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.940 
these skins are because the back of this
model<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.210> very<00:01:57.270> glossy<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.590> will<00:01:58.770> give<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
model is very glossy so this will give a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.620 
model is very glossy so this will give a
little<00:01:59.159> bit<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.340> texture<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.360> at<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> same

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
little bit of texture but at the same

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.700 
little bit of texture but at the same
time<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.079> doesn't<00:02:01.350> pick<00:02:01.469> up<00:02:01.530> any

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
time what it doesn't pick up any

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.260 
time what it doesn't pick up any
fingerprints<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.369> off<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.060> see

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
fingerprints it off so if you can see

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.240 
fingerprints it off so if you can see
the<00:02:03.420> camera<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.500> how<00:02:04.560> glossy<00:02:04.890> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the camera you can see how glossy that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.210 
the camera you can see how glossy that
is<00:02:05.430> right<00:02:05.939> around<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.299> blue<00:02:06.509> area<00:02:07.220> and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
is right around that blue area and

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.619 
is right around that blue area and
