pretty<00:01:01.500> simple<00:01:01.680> I'm<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.969> start<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:03.809> by

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
pretty simple I'm going to start here by

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.929 
pretty simple I'm going to start here by
tapping<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.880> back<00:01:06.210> tread<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:07.790> pull<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
tapping the back tread here pull that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.190 
tapping the back tread here pull that
out<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.200> other<00:01:10.350> side<00:01:12.049> you<00:01:13.049> can

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
out do that with the other side you can

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.399 
out do that with the other side you can
see<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:14.369> then<00:01:14.460> pull<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> treads<00:01:15.180> down<00:01:18.409> then

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
see and then pull the treads down then

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.780 
see and then pull the treads down then
we<00:01:19.530> won't<00:01:19.680> pull<00:01:19.860> his<00:01:19.950> whole<00:01:20.130> legs<00:01:20.310> down<00:01:20.549> like

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
we won't pull his whole legs down like

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.880 
we won't pull his whole legs down like
that<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.420> gives<00:01:21.570> some<00:01:21.810> clearance<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.770> this

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that so it gives some clearance for this

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.740 
that so it gives some clearance for this
it<00:01:23.070> makes<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.520> easier<00:01:23.880> go<00:01:24.600> ahead

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
it makes a little bit easier go ahead

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.030 
it makes a little bit easier go ahead
and<00:01:24.840> split<00:01:24.960> skin<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.590> half<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:27.270> go<00:01:28.259> ahead<00:01:28.470> flip

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and split skin in half I go ahead flip

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.890 
and split skin in half I go ahead flip
up<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.430> kitten<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.060> flip<00:01:30.299> up<00:01:30.450> his<00:01:30.600> little
