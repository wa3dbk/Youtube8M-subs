00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.379
 All my name is Dominik and I'll show you today, we're one of ten line one 

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:08.320
 The program at a certain desk can assign that went 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.940
 previously under mac-os 10 Snow Leopard comedies and 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.649
 system settings 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:18.029
 On which the program does not assign a specific Espace 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.710
 the chicken CDU is no longer in the team setting shows how the under 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.259
 First of all, the stalking has been going on for three desks 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.759
 Desk 3 and would like, for example, now this describes 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.190
 I'm too old for that I'm right here in the block with the right mouse button 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.730
 Icon say options 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.580
 and say to bite 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.830
 this desk 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.900
 then it goes back to my bet and that you demonstrate 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.980
 strong winds ready 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.030
 and he immediately jumps on my desk loyalty 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.810
 you started here 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.200
 for example, if I have a role now 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 would like to do another program now, too 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.210
 Desk 1 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.330
 after looking more often on the desk two cards what he sees 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.850
 I am now on the two here and now wants Aksel on this 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.850
 States, I also let them roll this desk 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.310
 you are now also driving my desk 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.840
 instead of a witch 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.950
 then he jumps me on the desk and starts with her oath AXA and if 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.510
 I now WÃ¶rth state then jump on the other desk and start me 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.100
 here once there 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.020
 you see, you could associate your program with certain desks 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.570
 and if I look into the survey now, her desk will be 3 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.100
 started and in the state desk 2 as assigned AXA 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.270
 Becker then undo this by using the right one 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.440
 Mouse-click options and just says without 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 Right mouse button options 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.070
 Finally, go and finally get ready for a change 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.310
 my desk 1 will start again 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.489
 There it starts on the desk I am currently on 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.479
 yes, I'll tell you 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:15.509
 neither watch it and see you next time
