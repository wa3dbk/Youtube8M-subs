00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello love mining friends show today 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.179
 I tell you how often you special 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.790
 environmental destructive way the whole 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.360
 gets junk out of the ground and that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.789
 the best course with which I quali 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.350
 show you a small kombi builds 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.750
 and how to build a large corrie to 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:31.080
 we need a little bit of everything 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.669
 pack up quickly so there is 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.710
 different ways to copy 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.450
 that works with engines but that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.910
 also works with energy 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.850
 I think with energy units it is on 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.719
 easiest a good setup for this is 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:51.090
 the mv solar cell cable on it 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.899
 there we hang a light one 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:59.190
 transformer between why balance 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.300
 equal then a red box off the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.399
 energy link to it 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.229
 we need it for the energy units 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:10.619
 to transform the corrida 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.950
 can work so you can see that is the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.380
 theory 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.380
 here is also the whole thing around it 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.460
 and the part will be the same now 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.950
 starting to work 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.720
 as soon as I get the output of the bet box 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.259
 I just did that correctly 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:34.009
 but quickly because I need the ranch to 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:38.610
 do not mined well 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:44.729
 you have to stop so well you see the cory 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.470
 build yourself up now and start 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.590
 also directly to work 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.840
 so it is the following why is he like that 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.329
 Firstly we have built with the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.610
 black box a bit of electricity as 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.409
 cache thus always that one 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.570
 Solar power remains the corrie too 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.390
 to walk at night 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.960
 another reason is that of energy 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.190
 link 80 energy units consumes but 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.660
 the choreo with 35 units wonderful 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.230
 is supplied and therefore just the red 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.970
 and then it fits pretty well 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.830
 so 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.580
 now the items are actually coming out 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.700
 but I still have a drop outside 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.480
 and so and you see here come the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.220
 items flown out 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.590
 I'll show you the fast one too 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:41.780
 kisten packs that's fast made 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.780
 placed so easy and crate 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.340
 on top of that and in the whole 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.970
 turn in the box 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.730
 you see things running through here and 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.800
 then they are the same 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.209
 working speed of the core i hangs 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.730
 from how effective the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.060
 Energy is so here is very 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.069
 Well 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.470
 So now I'm showing you just now 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.450
 building a big coal 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:21.209
 just do the same now 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:26.220
 says if just class but the battery 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.129
 Grabmale times I want to show so around 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.209
 we need a big map to build 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:36.209
 landmarks these are these blue torches 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.340
 I do not have one with me 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.120
 I'll get some redstone facts 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.700
 I can show you with redstone 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.019
 signal to control then give me 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.330
 Here's a direction that is very 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:54.540
 helpful to determine the size of the 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:00.620
 core i can be set to 62 x 62 blocks 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.420
 build up like that 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.830
 that can be said to be very good 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:12.549
 use freezing calculate 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:12.549
 I would say that's big enough 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.080
 so now we have the area here 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.080
 set 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.560
 Now I just put the corrida here 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:45.160
 and you see now we have a lot 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:53.210
 created a great device 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:56.360
 Again, it's that fast 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.090
 if you thing that builds everything here 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.510
 between is is removed automatically 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.460
 that takes a while and that 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.770
 everything is gone begins here at the 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.770
 drill to get all the stuff out 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.430
 So the thing is working now 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.139
 nothing out 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.139
 There are just great there 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.930
 everything has gone away or once through me 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.820
 Do not know it happens sometimes good 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.220
 its also worth mentioning 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.289
 the more big kories you can do that 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.690
 be very stressful for the server before 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.930
 especially if you take the items for a long time 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.970
 through cancer continues to catch up 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.030
 is still helpful if you the cory 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.840
 Floods has the following reason if you 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.750
 First of all, that comes out of it 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.820
 then the coriolan stops working up 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.470
 Here comes the dirt is out and if 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.660
 you keep water from above 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.400
 then you have the larvae directly 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.830
 too obsidian and easily dismantled 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:03.349
 that's almost the ideal effect 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.210
 these are the tories fischpass to 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.810
 try have fun while environmentally 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.000
 destroy 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.500
 if you have any suggestions otherwise 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.570
 Something tell me 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.780
 thanks for watching and see you next 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.780
 times
