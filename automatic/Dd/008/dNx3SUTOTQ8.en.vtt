 half or so he told me about the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.940
 boat and good and we went to look for 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.880
 two 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.070
 as it was and how was the process 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.530
 restoration and the process of 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.570
 restoration was complete was made 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.340
 totally new the launch was very 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.180
 structurally good but good was 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.840
 bad paint and parts of the 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.659
 floor was painted full full boot 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.130
 upholstery watchmaking good engine everything 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.960
 that makes the width itself we're not going to 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.759
 review the one bit to stop 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.319
 refresh the general characteristics 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.740
 that has the boat as for example its 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.770
 in length the length of 540 is sometimes 54 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.149
 the good says the model is 5 meters 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.220
 40 by 2 meters 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.200
 good is a totally sporty helmet 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.480
 although it is a boat that came out as 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.700
 for rides have all the 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.140
 benefits of a racing boat was 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.150
 a speedboat but in the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.050
 restoration in such a way that I do not 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.440
 would be fast is a speedboat 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.440
 Quick 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.510
 and let's detail I do not know the most 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.450
 important that is the engine in this case 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.600
 the engine is a 2.5 200 horsepower mercury 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.250
 is the engine that I remove from the boat 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.890
 of formula 1 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.990
 and well we settled here to talk now 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.240
 that you got an engine from a formula 1 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.130
 we talk about speed what speed 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.530
 reaches and this boat is around 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.530
 the 124 125 kilometers 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.019
 because it's so fashionable that everyone 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.630
 they want the recipe 54 because it's the best 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.130
 boat is in the water that is 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.480
 in these brothers with my brother but 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.590
 Well the page you have is a boat 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.950
 amazing still having an aspect 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.050
 sports is a very comfortable boat for 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.030
 to navigate is a boat of some high 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.390
 speed and it's still comfortable and 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.090
 obviously it has all the dangers and 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.440
 the cons of a race boat but 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.060
 that's when you reach the limit the boat 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.470
 meanwhile alone as 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.570
 speed boat number and gives you the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.070
 same benefits but very many 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.640

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.580
