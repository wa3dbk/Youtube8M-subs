00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.920 
anyway I highly recommend this book five
stars<00:04:06.600> being<00:04:07.230> amazing<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.640> would<00:04:09.300> say<00:04:09.480> about

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
stars being amazing I would say about

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.250 
stars being amazing I would say about
four<00:04:10.260> stars<00:04:10.590> as<00:04:10.830> far<00:04:10.860> as<00:04:11.750> everything<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:13.080> the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
four stars as far as everything and the

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.240 
four stars as far as everything and the
only<00:04:13.380> reason<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.680> wouldn't<00:04:13.830> give<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.040> five

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
only reason I wouldn't give it five

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.580 
only reason I wouldn't give it five
stars<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.730> because<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.209> not<00:04:15.360> one<00:04:16.260> of<00:04:16.290> my

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
stars is because it's not one of my

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.380 
stars is because it's not one of my
all-time<00:04:16.950> favourite<00:04:17.609> books<00:04:17.790> but<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.060> was<00:04:18.150> very
