00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.490
 welcome 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.410
 We present you an overview of the telephone and new 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.420
 g3 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.830
 which we unpacked a month ago in 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.520
 operation for a month and my can 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.960
 tell you something about him 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.180
 we will not watch the complete set 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.030
 there is in unpacking for unpacking here 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.850
 can click here see 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.090
 so well look we start look on 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.370
 the front part is a screen with three 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.790
 touch buttons mechanical buttons 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.740
 on the front there is no further on the left 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.040
 faces the power button on top of us 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.040
 headphone jack and micro jack 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.840
 usb cable 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:04.650
 on the right the volume rocker below two 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.780
 holes for the speakers and the microphone on 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.530
 in fact here is one speaker and not very 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.920
 good quality and on the back side 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.270
 us under the second microphone flash and camera 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.980
 and present an opening for the speaker so that 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.130
 there is not a false panel, let's say 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:30.810
 Here are the characteristics of the size of her to 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.170
 142 by 70 and its thickness is 8 millimeters 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.290
 Until on many sites write, that he 6 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.420
 millimeters there 6 4 but that's not true what 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.520
 us under the hood 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.210
 I'll show you two slots under the hood 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.070
 under this 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:56.120
 by the flash card is not a battery battery 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.120
 per thousand eight hundred fifty milliamps 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.330
 and here we have an nfc antenna 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:08.440
 this phone can do all the support 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.250
 performance up the processor here mtk 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.790
 6582 1 and 3 gigahertz 4 cores 16 gigabytes 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.790
 internal memory 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:26.810
 display 5 inches to 1280 by 720 and sand 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.040
 from itself the screen is very juicy bright 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.640
 cool 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.090
 operation like there is a small 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.340
 color inversion 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.850
 where are we without this budget telephones? 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:48.040
 This is very small in operation 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:52.430
 it does not interfere let's see what else 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:59.180
 tests works generally by itself 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:00.310
 Smart phone is smart very well 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.519
 let's say 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:09.970
 antutu where antutu 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:13.880
 there he scored antutu 515 version 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.519
 typed us 1607 standard result 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:22.190
 principle can be a little better at 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:25.670
 582 processor performance to 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.950
 What we see in the video processor 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.950
 mali 400 m adapter 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.110
 worth antutu writes 18 actually 13 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.390
 megapixels 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:46.610
 sony vsky sensor mx 135 aperture 22 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:48.260
 camera good recording quality yes to 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.430
 the end of the video can see yes that is 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.099
 Photo and video 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.209
 even the camera will repeat as well as unpacking 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:59.069
 standing on samsung galaxy s4 of course it can 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.140
 being here she is not so good with AvtoVAZ 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:09.900
 Exactly but how hard is hard to hard 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:13.950
 good test gps works well for 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.910
 five minutes he found satellites at 1100 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:21.780
 can see a screenshot of recorded problems 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:28.280
 no catches well nfc module mt 66 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:32.400
 0 5 also he has about m r compass there 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.550
 gyro accelerometer and up sensor 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.250
 illumination and proximity and fm radio and 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.460
 magnetic sensor which allows 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.190
 work like a court flip case flip 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.199
 a small case zayuzal here we call 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.090
 month of operation but generally works 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.789
 its function performing up everything works 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.389
 well for the month of operation of the phone 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.039
 turned off once and periodically in the afternoon 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:04.680
 he wakes up from what he wakes up 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:08.820
 I can not yet understand but there are suspicions 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:14.550
 on the fact that the problem is software water and 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:18.479
 the problem of flashing batteries aa batteries 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.539
 enough for one day is no longer enough 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.729
 a little battery in vain 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:28.590
 see the version before the model in three versions 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:30.320
 4 on what is bundled there on a piece of paper 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.460
 goes on 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.460
 will say where it is written 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.510
 vian specified my paper so here we are 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.940
 here you can see version 4 she 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:51.660
 different in that the battery is not here 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:53.670
 1850 1850 milliamps and some other 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.090
 visual improvements are possible 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:59.010
 firmware here 10 13 in principle 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.110
 last but glitches I say more 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:06.060
 no phone works very much 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:08.520
 good steadily beautifully clear that is 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.330
 there are no complaints and I will say for my 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.300
 money is a great device without glitches 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.510
 yes that is to say a little say principle 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.970
 nothing yes you liked the phone itself 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:25.850
 I'll be honest 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:30.750
 expected the worst but see the camera test 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:34.910
 see other reviews other unpacking 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.910
 all the while subscribe to the channel 

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.450
 and 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.050
 and
