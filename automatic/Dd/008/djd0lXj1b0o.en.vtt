that much detail into something like

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.139 
that much detail into something like
this<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.219> got<00:02:02.340> little<00:02:02.460> spots<00:02:02.909> where<00:02:03.090> they

put the green it's just awesome now if
you<00:02:06.600> actually<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.829> own<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> rocket

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
you actually if you own a rocket

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.710 
you actually if you own a rocket
launcher<00:02:08.789> yourself<00:02:09.179> you'll<00:02:09.390> probably<00:02:09.539> notice

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
launcher yourself you'll probably notice

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.020 
launcher yourself you'll probably notice
the<00:02:09.929> mine<00:02:10.080> looks<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.319> little<00:02:10.440> different<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
the mine looks a little different and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.740 
the mine looks a little different and
the<00:02:12.030> way<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.390> made<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.660> little

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
the way that I made it a little

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.580 
the way that I made it a little
different

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
different

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.930 
different
right<00:02:13.830> here<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.400> where<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.849> would

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
right here this is where you would

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.190 
right here this is where you would
actually<00:02:15.000> have<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.480> trigger<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.930> everything

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
actually have the trigger and everything

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.180 
actually have the trigger and everything
so<00:02:16.349> this<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.560> where<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.800> would<00:02:16.890> hold<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.099> with

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
so this is where you would hold it with

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.320 
so this is where you would hold it with
your<00:02:17.220> right<00:02:17.430> hand<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.730> left<00:02:17.819> hand<00:02:18.090> goes<00:02:18.180> here

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
your right hand the left hand goes here

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.080 
your right hand the left hand goes here
in<00:02:18.420> your<00:02:18.510> father<00:02:18.660> rocket<00:02:19.550> there<00:02:20.550> was<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> little

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
in your father rocket there was a little

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.790 
in your father rocket there was a little
arm<00:02:21.330> guard<00:02:21.629> thing<00:02:21.870> or<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> hand<00:02:22.410> guard<00:02:22.620> thing

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
arm guard thing or a hand guard thing

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.960 
arm guard thing or a hand guard thing
right<00:02:22.920> here<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.370> clipped<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.730> off

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
right here and I clipped that off

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.160 
right here and I clipped that off
because<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.330> could<00:02:24.569> not<00:02:24.690> get<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:24.989> into<00:02:25.080> my

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
because I could not get it into my

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.930 
because I could not get it into my
hayabusa<00:02:25.739> hand<00:02:25.980> i<00:02:26.069> use<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> hobby<00:02:26.489> knife<00:02:26.700> i

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
hayabusa hand i use the hobby knife i

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.050 
hayabusa hand i use the hobby knife i
hated<00:02:27.569> i<00:02:27.780> used<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.709> blow<00:02:28.860> dryer<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.970> know

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
hated i used the blow dryer and you know

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.869 
hated i used the blow dryer and you know
he<00:02:30.720> did<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.110> handle<00:02:31.799> up<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.040> bit<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:32.640> used<00:02:32.819> the

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
he did the handle up a bit then used the

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.630 
he did the handle up a bit then used the
hobby<00:02:33.060> knife<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.420> cut<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.629> off<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.610> because<00:02:35.610> i

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
hobby knife and cut it off and because i

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.039 
hobby knife and cut it off and because i
could<00:02:35.879> not<00:02:35.910> get<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.269> fit<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.540> his<00:02:36.599> hand<00:02:36.870> now

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
could not get it to fit in his hand now

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.479 
could not get it to fit in his hand now
something<00:02:37.260> i<00:02:37.379> did<00:02:37.560> notice<00:02:37.709> about<00:02:37.860> his<00:02:38.099> hands

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
something i did notice about his hands

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.039 
something i did notice about his hands
because<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.239> reason<00:02:39.360> i<00:02:39.569> don't<00:02:39.750> want<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.930> break

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
because the reason i don't want to break

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.300 
because the reason i don't want to break
his<00:02:40.260> hand<00:02:40.440> i<00:02:40.530> don't<00:02:40.680> want<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.860> break<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.129> gun

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
his hand i don't want to break the gun

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.059 
his hand i don't want to break the gun
so<00:02:41.580> i<00:02:41.610> figured<00:02:42.030> i<00:02:42.269> would<00:02:42.989> rather<00:02:43.170> cut<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.950> off

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
so i figured i would rather cut it off

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.890 
so i figured i would rather cut it off
make<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.730> look<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.120> little<00:02:45.390> bit<00:02:45.569> different<00:02:45.840> but

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
make it look a little bit different but

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.300 
make it look a little bit different but
make<00:02:46.049> it<00:02:46.170> easier<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.650> other<00:02:46.799> for<00:02:47.040> years<00:02:47.130> be

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
make it easier for other for years be

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.470 
make it easier for other for years be
able<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.489> hold<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.670> rocket<00:02:47.940> launcher<00:02:48.180> as<00:02:48.299> well

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
able to hold the rocket launcher as well

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.520 
able to hold the rocket launcher as well
and<00:02:49.819> so<00:02:50.819> but<00:02:51.660> i<00:02:51.690> did<00:02:51.900> notice<00:02:52.019> something<00:02:52.319> with

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
and so but i did notice something with

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.199 
and so but i did notice something with
the<00:02:52.590> hayabusa<00:02:52.950> hand<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.610> his<00:02:53.670> hands

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
the hayabusa hand is that his hands

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.660 
the hayabusa hand is that his hands
actually<00:02:54.750> kind<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.049> stretch<00:02:55.410> now<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.890> that

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
actually kind of stretch now and that

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.100 
actually kind of stretch now and that
was<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.819> problem<00:02:57.060> with<00:02:57.299> previous<00:02:57.690> sets<00:02:57.930> was

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
was a problem with previous sets was

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.420 
was a problem with previous sets was
that<00:02:58.260> they<00:02:58.349> didn't<00:02:58.680> do<00:02:58.799> that<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.099> when<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.310> try

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
that they didn't do that so when you try

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
that they didn't do that so when you try
to<00:02:59.459> put<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.730> weapon<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.150> one<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.299> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450

figures hands there wasn't there was a
decent<00:03:04.410> chance<00:03:04.590> if<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.010> didn't<00:03:05.310> do<00:03:05.819> something

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
decent chance if you didn't do something

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.000 
decent chance if you didn't do something
to<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.420> hand<00:03:06.660> or<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.170> know<00:03:07.290> apply<00:03:07.980> pressure

to the hand or you know apply pressure

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.559 
to the hand or you know apply pressure
in<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.459> right<00:03:08.579> places<00:03:08.849> you<00:03:09.060> could<00:03:09.239> break<00:03:09.420> the

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
in the right places you could break the

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.270 
in the right places you could break the
gun<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.989> I'm<00:03:10.470> pretty<00:03:10.680> sure<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.010> could<00:03:11.129> easily

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
gun and I'm pretty sure you could easily

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.800 
gun and I'm pretty sure you could easily
break<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:11.760> hands<00:03:11.940> because<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.299> hands<00:03:12.510> didn't

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
break the hands because the hands didn't

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.960 
break the hands because the hands didn't
give<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.079> any<00:03:13.290> leeway<00:03:13.590> there<00:03:14.519> was<00:03:14.640> no<00:03:14.760> leeway

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
give you any leeway there was no leeway

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.670 
give you any leeway there was no leeway
in<00:03:15.209> between<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.629> weapon<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.230> hand<00:03:16.470> it

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
in between the weapon and the hand it

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.309 
in between the weapon and the hand it
was<00:03:16.769> just<00:03:16.980> like<00:03:17.129> you're<00:03:17.310> just<00:03:18.230> smashing<00:03:19.230> these

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
was just like you're just smashing these

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.539 
was just like you're just smashing these
two<00:03:19.500> things<00:03:19.650> together<00:03:19.829> trying<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.280> get<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.459> to

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
two things together trying to get it to

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.039 
two things together trying to get it to
look<00:03:20.730> cool<00:03:20.940> once<00:03:21.209> you're<00:03:21.329> done<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.900> would

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
look cool once you're done and it would

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.680 
look cool once you're done and it would
probably<00:03:22.500> break<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.030> but<00:03:24.030> their<00:03:24.209> hands<00:03:24.450> seem

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
probably break and but their hands seem

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.940 
probably break and but their hands seem
to<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.930> little<00:03:25.139> bit<00:03:25.290> different<00:03:25.560> plastic

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
to be a little bit different plastic

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.660 
to be a little bit different plastic
that<00:03:26.069> they're<00:03:26.190> actually<00:03:26.430> kind<00:03:26.549> of

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
that they're actually kind of

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.569 
that they're actually kind of
stretchable<00:03:27.359> this<00:03:27.569> time<00:03:27.810> not<00:03:28.380> much<00:03:28.769> but<00:03:29.459> it

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
stretchable this time not much but it

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.460 
stretchable this time not much but it
gives<00:03:29.639> you<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.849> little<00:03:30.090> bit<00:03:30.299> more<00:03:30.540> leeway<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.290> be

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
gives you a little bit more leeway to be

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.960 
gives you a little bit more leeway to be
able<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.739> get<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.040> weapon<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.430> their<00:03:32.519> hand<00:03:32.760> and

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
able to get the weapon in their hand and

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.009 
able to get the weapon in their hand and
I<00:03:33.239> know<00:03:33.359> a<00:03:33.389> lot<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.569> people<00:03:33.660> would<00:03:33.930> probably

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
I know a lot of people would probably

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.360 
I know a lot of people would probably
just<00:03:34.260> pose<00:03:34.500> their<00:03:34.709> figure<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.069> that's<00:03:35.220> good

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
just pose their figure so that's good

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.379 
just pose their figure so that's good
for<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.639> guys<00:03:36.049> I<00:03:37.160> did<00:03:38.160> notice<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.489> pretty

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
for you guys I did notice that pretty

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.000 
for you guys I did notice that pretty
much<00:03:39.599> like<00:03:40.019> all<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.319> other<00:03:40.440> serious<00:03:40.799> seven

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
much like all the other serious seven

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.009 
much like all the other serious seven
figures<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:42.030> figure<00:03:42.359> when<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.569> opened<00:03:42.959> him

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
figures this figure when I opened him

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.680 
figures this figure when I opened him
pretty<00:03:43.470> much<00:03:43.530> every<00:03:44.370> single<00:03:44.549> joint<00:03:45.000> works

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
pretty much every single joint works

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.479 
pretty much every single joint works
just<00:03:46.349> like<00:03:46.530> it's<00:03:46.709> supposed<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:47.130> there's<00:03:47.280> no

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
just like it's supposed to there's no

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.789 
just like it's supposed to there's no
problems<00:03:47.970> with<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.150> there<00:03:48.900> was<00:03:49.019> only<00:03:49.109> one<00:03:49.470> spot

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
problems with it there was only one spot

of<00:04:22.200> pressure<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.680> then<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:22.890> twist<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.370> now

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
of pressure and then you twist it now

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.459 
of pressure and then you twist it now
what<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.360> problem<00:04:24.630> was<00:04:24.719> I<00:04:24.990> couldn't<00:04:25.020> get<00:04:25.380> the

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:25.469 
what the problem was I couldn't get the

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:27.440 
what the problem was I couldn't get the
foot<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.919> twist<00:04:26.190> right<00:04:26.460> so<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:26.789> was<00:04:26.880> kind<00:04:27.090> of

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
foot to twist right so it was kind of

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.990 
foot to twist right so it was kind of
not<00:04:28.290> angled<00:04:28.710> properly<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.340> that's<00:04:29.850> what<00:04:29.970> I

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
not angled properly and that's what I

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.420 
not angled properly and that's what I
want<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.270> fix<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:30.780> just<00:04:31.110> like<00:04:31.230> that<00:04:31.260> BAM<00:04:32.010> done

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
want to fix and just like that BAM done

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.520 
want to fix and just like that BAM done
fixed<00:04:32.880> it<00:04:33.000> I<00:04:33.150> was<00:04:33.990> having<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.230> problem<00:04:34.380> with

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
fixed it I was having a problem with

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.650 
fixed it I was having a problem with
getting<00:04:34.680> him<00:04:34.890> to<00:04:35.010> stand<00:04:35.250> easier<00:04:35.670> so<00:04:36.030> now<00:04:36.540> he's

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
getting him to stand easier so now he's

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.060 
getting him to stand easier so now he's
going<00:04:36.750> to<00:04:36.840> be<00:04:36.930> easier<00:04:37.140> to<00:04:37.200> pose<00:04:37.470> which<00:04:37.770> is<00:04:37.920> good

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
going to be easier to pose which is good

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.520 
going to be easier to pose which is good
because<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:38.900> wanted<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:39.990> be<00:04:40.080> able<00:04:40.140> to<00:04:40.260> put<00:04:40.410> him

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
because I wanted to be able to put him

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.260 
because I wanted to be able to put him
in<00:04:40.680> cool<00:04:40.860> poses<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.400> stuff<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:41.970> couldn't

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
in cool poses and stuff and I couldn't

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.360 
in cool poses and stuff and I couldn't
because<00:04:42.810> he<00:04:42.930> didn't<00:04:43.110> want<00:04:43.140> to<00:04:43.290> stand<00:04:43.470> so<00:04:43.770> good

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
because he didn't want to stand so good

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.610 
because he didn't want to stand so good
all<00:04:44.520> just<00:04:45.510> like<00:04:45.630> that<00:04:45.840> that's<00:04:46.050> how<00:04:46.170> easy<00:04:46.200> it

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
all just like that that's how easy it

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.200 
all just like that that's how easy it
can<00:04:46.650> be<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:46.860> fix<00:04:47.100> your<00:04:47.310> figures<00:04:47.670> it's<00:04:47.880> not<00:04:48.030> that

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
can be to fix your figures it's not that

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.410 
can be to fix your figures it's not that
hard<00:04:48.560> so<00:04:49.560> yeah<00:04:49.950> now<00:04:50.100> he's<00:04:50.370> standing<00:04:51.120> in<00:04:51.330> all

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
hard so yeah now he's standing in all

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.930 
hard so yeah now he's standing in all
different<00:04:51.630> kinds<00:04:51.810> of<00:04:51.990> poses<00:04:52.730> overall<00:04:53.730> I<00:04:53.760> would

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
different kinds of poses overall I would

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.640 
different kinds of poses overall I would
give<00:04:54.180> this<00:04:54.210> figure<00:04:54.600> a<00:04:54.630> 5<00:04:54.900> out<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.110> 5<00:04:55.200> he<00:04:55.620> is

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
give this figure a 5 out of 5 he is

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.110 
give this figure a 5 out of 5 he is
probably<00:04:56.010> one<00:04:56.250> of<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.460> coolest<00:04:56.610> figures<00:04:57.000> like

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
probably one of the coolest figures like

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.140 
probably one of the coolest figures like
I<00:04:57.210> said<00:04:57.420> that<00:04:57.570> I<00:04:57.930> currently<00:04:58.230> own<00:04:58.470> I<00:04:58.950> am<00:04:59.670> so

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
I said that I currently own I am so

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.230 
I said that I currently own I am so
stoked<00:05:00.720> about<00:05:00.900> him<00:05:01.170> on<00:05:01.290> he's<00:05:02.070> just<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:02.730> amazing

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
stoked about him on he's just so amazing

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.870 
stoked about him on he's just so amazing
and<00:05:03.390> if<00:05:04.140> you<00:05:04.290> don't<00:05:04.470> own<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.620> hayabusa<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.460> will

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
and if you don't own a hayabusa I will

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.270 
and if you don't own a hayabusa I will
go<00:05:05.970> ahead<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.180> show<00:05:06.240> you<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:07.350> head<00:05:07.530> movement

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
go ahead and show you the head movement

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.890 
go ahead and show you the head movement
because<00:05:08.670> you<00:05:08.880> know<00:05:08.970> all<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.540> different<00:05:09.660> heads

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
because you know all the different heads

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.640 
because you know all the different heads
are<00:05:10.440> different<00:05:11.810> since<00:05:12.810> he<00:05:12.900> has<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.020> spartan<00:05:13.500> he

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
are different since he has a spartan he

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.680 
are different since he has a spartan he
has<00:05:13.830> articulation<00:05:14.670> all<00:05:14.850> over<00:05:15.150> his<00:05:15.240> body<00:05:15.510> I

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
has articulation all over his body I

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.690 
has articulation all over his body I
mean<00:05:15.870> they're<00:05:16.140> incredibly<00:05:16.860> articulated<00:05:17.520> the

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
mean they're incredibly articulated the

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.640 
mean they're incredibly articulated the
armor<00:05:18.240> pieces<00:05:18.420> are<00:05:18.780> interchangeable<00:05:19.380> which

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
armor pieces are interchangeable which

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.160 
armor pieces are interchangeable which
are<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:19.980> shoulder<00:05:20.370> pads<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:21.480> chest<00:05:21.960> plate

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
are the shoulder pads the chest plate

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.370 
are the shoulder pads the chest plate
and<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.530> helmet<00:05:22.830> now<00:05:23.630> this<00:05:24.630> Spartan<00:05:25.140> does

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
and the helmet now this Spartan does

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.140 
and the helmet now this Spartan does
have<00:05:25.650> pretty<00:05:25.830> much<00:05:25.950> all<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.430> updates<00:05:26.880> and

new like they're like kinda like gear
gear<00:05:35.690> joints<00:05:36.690> so<00:05:37.080> you<00:05:37.170> see<00:05:37.320> he<00:05:37.530> has<00:05:37.650> like<00:05:37.920> those

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
gear joints so you see he has like those

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.130 
gear joints so you see he has like those
little<00:05:38.340> slits<00:05:38.670> their<00:05:38.820> helps<00:05:39.780> when<00:05:39.930> they're

little slits their helps when they're
posing<00:05:41.010> and<00:05:41.310> stuff<00:05:41.550> so<00:05:41.670> they<00:05:41.760> don't<00:05:41.940> just<00:05:42.150> like

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
posing and stuff so they don't just like

I prefer the new hinge hands but you
know<00:05:50.610> it's<00:05:51.090> not<00:05:51.240> that<00:05:51.300> big<00:05:51.660> of<00:05:51.720> a<00:05:51.900> deal<00:05:52.050> because

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
know it's not that big of a deal because

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.080 
know it's not that big of a deal because
they<00:05:52.380> still<00:05:52.620> do<00:05:52.770> work<00:05:53.010> because<00:05:53.820> I've<00:05:53.910> had<00:05:54.060> a

they still do work because I've had a
problem<00:05:54.360> with<00:05:54.870> several<00:05:55.200> of<00:05:55.260> my<00:05:55.350> multiplayer

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800

anything<00:05:57.450> and<00:05:57.540> then<00:05:57.660> you<00:05:57.750> could<00:05:57.870> like<00:05:57.960> break

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
anything and then you could like break
