00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:09.030
 so everyone here forum is cat 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.280
 meanwhile the gba 36 vfl him plus the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.330
 new battery hammer drill 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.570
 There is now also an airbox 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:21.779
 variant out in this case is the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:26.189
 v.li Wechselburg fodder device is on top 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.680
 in a 238 airbox top pub insert 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.830
 Cover pub insert with conscience 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.600
 point out various pointers 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.399
 I would probably talk about borac here 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.620
 Parents make the whole thing out 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.719
 As it looks like he has already grabbed the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.100
 cap may not break through 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.629
 quite as nice when something like the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.309
 customer on but the device is not very 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:52.219
 high comes later to now times the device 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:58.949
 you can see out there in the bottom 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:02.090
 36 18 v the new fits also because in 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.090
 Some countries still sell it 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.090
 36 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.160
 Now I'll take the vfl 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.310
 ii 1 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:22.120
 Here is here under no place has more 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.440
 Therefore, not the device is just so insert 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.900
 Personally, I really like it very much 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.460
 set up device is still space 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.460
 ten that is a bit work can 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:41.560
 Platz is also ahead here 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.479
 for a third battery in contrast to the 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.610
 Handyman suitcase is here really 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:57.369
 space for the front for all 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:02:00.060
 including ora et cetera well the fed tube 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.060
 I would grab somewhere else 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.220
 maybe here so small fold 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:12.430
 one that is the only disadvantage in the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.410
 transport would be there but we are talking now 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.420
 yes for years about that 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.380
 wall thicknesses of these deep layers 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.950
 little increase 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.750
 Here it is really good, you realize that 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.989
 you can see it too is extremely thick 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.810
 down here it's so thin that from now on 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.980
 the deposit is spoken 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.980
 probably at some point during the transport 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:52.959
 not everything is good under charger 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:57.000
 you can see the vfl ii here 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.230
 for example, one more room fits 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.890
 are not equal to the transport 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.360
 fall out 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.799
 Steve is the change drill chuck on it 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.799
 next test is interesting again 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:20.950
 That 's the way it goes, but you have to 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:25.150
 That's just the length of the device 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:29.360
 but you have to switch back if you are 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.159
 The vfb boss has one can say about it 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.760
 argue whether this is good or bad 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.370
 is 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.010
 otherwise you would have put him more obliquely 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.620
 have to be around like that would be up here 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.400
 less space for mohr 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.810
 Here you get well something 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.790
 longer I hope it will come again 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.900
 at some point such a casket 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.940
 a little bit longer and a bit 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.250
 high is where you can even so simple 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.319
 At least I hope that my first 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.409
 impression of this variant as I said 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.599
 I think this distribution is good 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.670
 is still missing really such a business 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.709
 what you put in can probably all 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.480
 drills are in or up here as one 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:11.599
 drills age and janneke just one 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.489
 small bag or just where the fat 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.169
 is housed because if that first 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.099
 there are drills in there 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:20.570
 is very fast by that was how it is 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.930
 the short introduction of the l boxx 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.930
 vary
