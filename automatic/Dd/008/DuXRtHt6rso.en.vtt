00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.750 
treated with certain effects and the end
result<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.500> know<00:03:13.620> end<00:03:13.890> result<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.460> was<00:03:14.700> a

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
result you know end result that was a

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.600 
result you know end result that was a
bit<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.570> guess<00:03:15.990> sugar-coated<00:03:16.920> in<00:03:17.130> some<00:03:17.370> places

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
bit I guess sugar-coated in some places

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.270 
bit I guess sugar-coated in some places
to<00:03:17.910> make<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.300> either<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:19.620> know<00:03:19.740> more<00:03:19.950> smooth

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
to make it either you know more smooth

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.100 
to make it either you know more smooth
or<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.670> make<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.850> very<00:03:21.180> special<00:03:21.390> effect<00:03:21.930> that

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
or to make a very special effect that

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.990 
or to make a very special effect that
they<00:03:22.230> needed<00:03:22.440> totally<00:03:23.370> custom<00:03:23.790> made

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
they needed totally custom made

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.720 
they needed totally custom made
instrument<00:03:24.690> but<00:03:24.960> in<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.530> style<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.370> micro

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
instrument but in the style of the micro

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.820 
instrument but in the style of the micro
fred<00:03:26.940> company<00:03:27.480> which<00:03:28.200> is<00:03:28.440> very<00:03:29.330> unknown<00:03:30.330> and

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
fred company which is very unknown and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.820 
fred company which is very unknown and
so<00:03:31.830> it<00:03:32.550> makes<00:03:32.760> very<00:03:33.000> very<00:03:33.330> very<00:03:33.830> specific

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
so it makes very very very specific

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.140 
so it makes very very very specific
sound<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.400> very<00:03:35.720> again<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:37.050> very<00:03:38.150> musical

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
sound and a very again a very musical

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.630 
sound and a very again a very musical
tone<00:03:39.750> for<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.290> bass<00:03:40.530> as<00:03:40.830> it's<00:03:41.160> not<00:03:41.340> really<00:03:41.610> a

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
tone for the bass as it's not really a

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.030 
tone for the bass as it's not really a
bass<00:03:41.910> but<00:03:42.300> really<00:03:42.690> more<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.020> guitar<00:03:43.470> an

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
bass but really more like a guitar an

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.640 
bass but really more like a guitar an
octave<00:03:44.610> lower
