00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.819
 then this is the asparagus leg 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.649
 as you can see all these 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.510
 peduncles that is the green asparagus 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.250
 white asparagus 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.320
 the green asparagus of the white asparagus la 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.509
 their difference is that they are collected 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.570
 at different times as well as the paw 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:25.859
 different are buried in a trench 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.519
 as we can see here and below is 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.910
 then organic fertilizer was placed 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.020
 basically of the skin-treated manure 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.120
 and of the core in india the manure is used for 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.969
 give strength to the roots just 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.250
 transplanted and to make them root and 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.170
 the nail horn is better in the ground 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.239
 instead it is a slow release fertilizer e 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.050
 will help the asparagus for the whole 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.930
 his life 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.969
 grace the horns and nails the animals with 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.629
 average are exactly with horns and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:06.150
 anoint the animals of the beasts 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:10.470
 above all call and take the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:16.140
 paw the paw and relax it was dg 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:23.369
 roots and is covered by a little of 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:26.400
 earth so as to be at the wet to be able to 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.280
 care well but it's like minimum of 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.710
 that very slowly that means in three or 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.189
 four phases is covered comes 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.060
 covered with earth until up to 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.060
 ground level 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.720
 this is because they try to make them go 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.930
 down the roots and not towards 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.360
 up then if they in the other 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.030
 feel the heat then go towards the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.870
 low look for water and this comes 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.150
 made for 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.220
 during the entire month of April so 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.370
 in four times it is covered by a 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.090
 once a week a little bit more 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:09.720
 after which once covered all 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.570
 the field is left clean 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.990
 marked in the heads of the prose e 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.700
 it is only said that it is milled 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.820
 thanks to milling we have a weed control 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.620
 mechanic for the first year will come 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.120
 out the first asparagus that will go into 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.760
 plant and then the first harvested after 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.300
 three years in bloom the first harvest will be 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.780
 in three years the paw must be rooted 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.830
 well and will therefore have all the time and 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.480
 the possibility of going to create new ones 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.250
 shoots once they are removed 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.890
 asparagus period the prize 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:58.440
 asparagus is mid-April to the end 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:02.550
 May and AC the vigil is said to be san 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:07.230
 bernardino 22 eat and May 22nd 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:10.380
 actually then you know until the end of 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.510
 May mainly because they are years in 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.890
 where the season starts late so yes 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.660
 can collect a little more then 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.489
 the white asparagus from Cilavegna is not 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.050
 white because it is a white species but 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.800
 because it is collected that still 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.380
 underground 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:29.060
 the words in the harvest years then 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.910
 from the third year until the tenth year 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.640
 these asparagus come info on one 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.440
 once they are at ground level yes 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.540
 goes with a box machine 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.170
 tritsch and that does just a prose 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.350
 up a hill but hills 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.690
 it is called prose this prose serves 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.030
 just to keep the tower that 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.430
 is coming out of the 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.720
 which is doing from the paw the most to 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.670
 long as possible covered by the rays of the 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.140
 rays of the sun because it was already now that 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.459
 they are the ones that turn green 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.770
 woody asparagus and many other things e 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:12.810
 and so we go to pick it up 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:15.239
 as soon as the tip appears this morning 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.100
 the tip turns purple because it starts 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:24.600
 they take photosynthesis very slowly 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:27.990
 chlorophyll and this 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.780
 basically how much thank you peter 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.770
 farm holding Molino taverna 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.770
 there is the vineyard
