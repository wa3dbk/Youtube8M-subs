00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.719
 always show them this technique that the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.519
 release on paper 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.280
 with which we are going to make a good 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.890
 design that will prepare you for today and good 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.140
 I wanted to tell imperiled paper is 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.600
 a technique that is also known by 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.359
 its name in English as care or paper 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.640
 willing then good many people the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.590
 know with that name and that consists 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.439
 as I always tell you in performing the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.660
 design from paper strips 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.000
 rolled up that seems impossible but for 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.980
 if it makes it very simple if in fact 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.989
 It is a simple technique that is performed 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.050
 with few materials as always 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.780
 I tell you and good always starting from 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.030
 circles or paper rolled in the shape of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.449
 circles to which we give shapes 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.690
 basic to form the different 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.210
 designs that we want to make in this 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.000
 case what we are going to do is this design 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.340
 to prepare with two-color flowers and with a 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.489
 foliage for which we are going to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.950
 I'm going to teach you how to make the curlers 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.890
 well here we are going to use two forms 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.530
 basic that one is the crescent and the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.230
 another is the eye shape or marquis that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.550
 Now I will explain first 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.730
 well we take the paper 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.740
 in this case use live shades we have 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:32.500
 a color chart with 34 shades 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.659
 among which we generate bright colors 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.109
 pastel shades 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.960
 in the design varies according to the combination 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:43.329
 of colors that we choose in this case by 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.020
 example here use an ivory frame with 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.980
 a red 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.320
 in a similar design 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.320
 but what is left different financing 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.470
 exactly then well let's do 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.870
 one 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.030
 a circle first in this case I worked 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.170
 with circles all of the same size 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.750
 more or less than a centimeter in diameter 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.710
 always using the template so that 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.310
 achieve that all then what I do is 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.910
 place according to the size of the template 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.489
 that the son gives him soft taps and 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.000
 then I carefully removed to avoid 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.000
 open 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.870
 and he put the glue on her as always 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.980
 I tell you very little amount 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.110
 and I paste and paste very easily because it's 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.790
 really very noble 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.299
 then I already have the circle starting 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.090
 of which I perform the basic form that 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.599
 I choose in this case I will do for the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.459
 I'm going to make two croissants 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.510
 the half moon made it this way 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.510
 pressing like this 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.980
 making a curve less than 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.670
 the other 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.040
 and well here I already have another made with 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.349
 which we are going to form what bar the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.349
 purpose and let's do then in the 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.379
 center an exact form that is called of 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:19.220
 eye or marquis and that simply pressed 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.780
 from both sides in an equidistant way or 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.640
 whether the process is always the same the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.680
 circle hit and then I give it shape 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.560
 exactly then once I have 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.440
 I give the circle the shape I want in 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:35.630
 this good case took the dan 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:39.230
 the half moon placed the glue 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.140
 placed in the center the eye shape or 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.200
 marquis 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.200
 again glue very little 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.840
 and I put the other the other part to 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.099
 form what would be the same 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.099
 I leave it well 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.560
 one made here 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.150
 and then I'm going to cover it, I'm going to 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.970
 wrap 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.159
 with another tone strip in this case I 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.510
 I chose orange you can make it from just one 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:15.299
 color if it can be 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.630
 but much much to create is open 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:21.690
 with the corderada of papelÃ³n but they 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:26.190
 we count that graciela is going to be in the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.320
 expo decoupage scrapbook and papers show 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.699
 to be held in the palace of San Miguel del 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.009
 August 11 to 13 with its own stand as well 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:38.910
 that you can visit and see the 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:41.759
 wonder that he makes with the papers and 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.190
 all your line of light to an entire line 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:47.639
 to work all the papers the 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.280
 tapes and even everything they can 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:54.229
 work what we now call deco 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.120
 scrap we can accessories for 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:03.330
 scrapbooking die-cut designs 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.330
 and decorative accessories also for 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:10.660
 the scratch albums 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:14.720
 the squares and everything they need 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:18.080
 to do good wonders all that 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.200
 it's exact and good paper and the subject of the 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.520
 foliage from the design that I brought them is 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.969
 very simple simply consists of doing 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.749
 curls we're going 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:33.209
 arriving and giving him the forms that 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:35.889
 we want to put together the structure 

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:39.600
 exactly like a small tree in the case 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.590
 as a branch and good 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.590
 the screams 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.520
 perform in the same way that you made 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.940
 the time that if I am not simply 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.130
 roll and paste adjust not in this case 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.370
 they are not stuck but then we have it 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.560
 to support on the basis then on the 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.320
 base to it simply gives the liner 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.810
 so we formed this way it 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.990
 we apply later with the length that 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.780
 we want and in the direction we left 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.570
 it also serves as we train and good and 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.310
 here I also applied a few leaves in 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.530
 tone of green made of it 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.530
 way that the other
