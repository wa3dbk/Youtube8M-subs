00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
sure about this one either because it's

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.930

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
actually I wasn't expecting this one at

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.060 
actually I wasn't expecting this one at
all<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.880> VV<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.689> her<00:01:07.350> outfit<00:01:07.830> like

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
all but it is VV in her outfit like

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.120 
all but it is VV in her outfit like
after<00:01:08.640> alabasta<00:01:09.570> which<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.229> was<00:01:10.560> personally

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
after alabasta which I was personally

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.100 
after alabasta which I was personally
not<00:01:11.250> expected<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:11.729> all<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.119> she<00:01:12.330> looks<00:01:13.020> really

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
not expected at all but she looks really

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.100 
not expected at all but she looks really
nice<00:01:13.500> especially<00:01:14.070> since<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.850> neo<00:01:15.540> v<00:01:15.900> V<00:01:16.049> is

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
nice especially since the neo v V is

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.859 
nice especially since the neo v V is
ridiculously<00:01:16.650> expensive<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.659> next<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
ridiculously expensive and next on the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
ridiculously expensive and next on the
list<00:01:21.049> sengoku<00:01:22.049> finally<00:01:22.950> comes<00:01:23.159> into<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
list sengoku finally comes into the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.149 
list sengoku finally comes into the
picture<00:01:23.490> which<00:01:24.740> they<00:01:25.740> were<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.040> make

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
picture which they were going to make

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.530 
picture which they were going to make
eventually<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> was<00:01:27.119> only<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.330> matter<00:01:27.420> of

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
eventually but it was only a matter of

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
eventually but it was only a matter of
time<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.710> looks<00:01:28.860> pretty<00:01:28.979> good<00:01:29.189> his<00:01:29.369> face

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
time but it looks pretty good his face

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.480 
time but it looks pretty good his face
looks<00:01:29.850> kind<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.150> weird<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.400> don't<00:01:32.400> know

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
looks kind of weird but I don't know

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.310 
looks kind of weird but I don't know
maybe<00:01:32.700> again<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.750> none<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:33.990> these<00:01:34.170> are

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
maybe again like none of these are

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.999 
maybe again like none of these are
painted<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.570> it'll<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.750> little<00:01:37.079> bit<00:01:37.860> before

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
painted so it'll be a little bit before

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.800 
painted so it'll be a little bit before
I<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.310> actually<00:01:38.549> decide<00:01:38.850> if<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.119> really<00:01:39.150> want

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
I can actually decide if I really want

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.420 
I can actually decide if I really want
to<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:39.990> him<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.520> next<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:43.130> really<00:01:44.130> really

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
to get him and next up is really really

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.050 
to get him and next up is really really
took<00:01:44.759> me<00:01:44.820> by<00:01:45.119> surprise<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:47.000> portrait<00:01:48.000> of

pirates neo DX rob lucci in a hybrid
leper<00:01:51.360> form<00:01:51.720> which<00:01:52.430> looks<00:01:53.750> absolutely

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
leper form which looks absolutely

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.060 
leper form which looks absolutely
amazing<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.329> I<00:01:57.329> was<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:58.110> expecting<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.799> in

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
amazing and I was not expecting this in

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.679 
amazing and I was not expecting this in
the<00:01:59.159> least<00:01:59.399> bit<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.119> weird<00:02:00.329> how<00:02:00.540> his

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the least bit and it's weird how his

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.469 
the least bit and it's weird how his
prototype<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.590> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.920> like<00:02:02.070> copper<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.759> think

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
prototype is kind of like copper I think

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.649 
prototype is kind of like copper I think
I<00:02:03.750> don't<00:02:03.869> know<00:02:03.930> that's<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.229> weird<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:04.890> I

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
I don't know that's really weird but I
