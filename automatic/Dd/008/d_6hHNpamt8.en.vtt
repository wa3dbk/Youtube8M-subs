of the potion the duration and the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.880 
of the potion the duration and the
strength<00:00:28.170> which<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.580> 13<00:00:30.240> w<00:00:30.599> 09<00:00:31.019> see<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.679> can

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
strength which as of 13 w 09 see you can

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.709 
strength which as of 13 w 09 see you can
have<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.250> much<00:00:32.430> strength<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.420> want<00:00:33.600> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
have as much strength as you want to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.900 
have as much strength as you want to
even<00:00:33.870> up<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.079> jumpies<00:00:34.410> 10<00:00:34.739> whereas<00:00:35.610> before<00:00:35.760> I

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
even up like jumpies 10 whereas before I

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.040 
even up like jumpies 10 whereas before I
think<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.149> go<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.390> they<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.630> jumpy's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
think you go and they have like jumpy's

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.979 
think you go and they have like jumpy's
too<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:38.300> I'm<00:00:39.300> gonna<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.690> show<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.960> guys

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
too so I'm gonna get to show you guys

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.290 
too so I'm gonna get to show you guys
this<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.530> first<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:40.980> Louise<00:00:41.879> machine

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
this this first one is Louise machine

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
this this first one is Louise machine
and<00:00:42.660> I'm<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.559> survival<00:00:43.710> mode<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.160> i<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.399> show

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and I'm in survival mode so i can show

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.810 
and I'm in survival mode so i can show
you<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.300> involves<00:00:45.690> poison

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
you this because it involves poison

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.920 
you this because it involves poison
basically<00:00:47.820> you'll<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.149> keep<00:00:48.329> shaking<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
basically you'll just keep shaking and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.729 
basically you'll just keep shaking and
regenerating<00:00:50.329> noise<00:00:51.329> machine<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.680> you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
regenerating noise machine and if you

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.020 
regenerating noise machine and if you
hit<00:00:52.890> f1<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> sort<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.579> looks<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:53.820> you're

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
hit f1 it sort of looks like you're

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:05.660 
hit f1 it sort of looks like you're
having<00:00:54.090> an<00:00:54.300> earthquake<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:04.189> comes<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
having an earthquake that comes here so

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.109 
having an earthquake that comes here so
to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.320> now<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.909> called

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
to do that now this is a what I called

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.179 
to do that now this is a what I called
jump<00:01:09.390> mod<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.780> gives<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.110> speed<00:01:10.590> jump<00:01:10.950> boost

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
jump mod it gives you speed jump boost

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.520 
jump mod it gives you speed jump boost
and<00:01:11.310> resistance<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.780> jump<00:01:13.020> boost<00:01:13.260> is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
and resistance and the jump boost is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.130 
and resistance and the jump boost is
jumping<00:01:14.130> 10<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.850> your<00:01:15.090> line<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.900> fall

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
jumping 10 so your line is this the fall

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.570 
jumping 10 so your line is this the fall
a<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:18.479> try<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.990> kill<00:01:19.140> yourself

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.010 

it's<00:01:23.090> really<00:01:23.300> fun<00:01:25.090> all<00:01:26.090> right<00:01:26.240> on<00:01:26.480> to<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.750> next

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
it's really fun all right on to the next

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.010 
it's really fun all right on to the next
one<00:01:27.550> ultimate<00:01:28.550> blindness<00:01:29.150> I<00:01:29.390> better<00:01:29.630> get<00:01:29.870> this

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
one ultimate blindness I better get this

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.280 
one ultimate blindness I better get this
ready<00:01:30.580> this<00:01:31.580> will<00:01:31.940> basically<00:01:32.210> give<00:01:32.870> you<00:01:33.020> night

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
ready this will basically give you night

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.950 
ready this will basically give you night
vision<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:33.980> blindness<00:01:34.610> at<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.910> same<00:01:35.090> time<00:01:35.300> so

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
vision and blindness at the same time so

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.150 
vision and blindness at the same time so
can't<00:01:36.170> see<00:01:36.320> anything<00:01:36.680> but<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.100> Sun<00:01:39.070> what<00:01:40.070> you

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
can't see anything but the Sun what you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.500 
can't see anything but the Sun what you
would<00:01:40.310> use<00:01:40.460> that<00:01:40.640> for<00:01:40.850> except<00:01:41.150> for<00:01:41.300> being

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
would use that for except for being

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.170 
would use that for except for being
legally<00:01:41.960> but<00:01:42.110> light<00:01:42.350> yeah<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:43.220> just<00:01:43.880> figured

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
legally but light yeah I just figured

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.980 
legally but light yeah I just figured
that<00:01:44.240> out<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:46.550> last<00:01:46.790> one<00:01:47.060> we<00:01:47.240> have<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:47.570> hyper

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
that out the last one we have is hyper

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.460 
that out the last one we have is hyper
mode<00:01:48.200> which<00:01:48.440> gives<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.950> paste<00:01:49.640> three<00:01:50.180> speed<00:01:51.050> 1

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
mode which gives you paste three speed 1

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.760 
mode which gives you paste three speed 1
and<00:01:51.800> jump<00:01:52.010> boost<00:01:52.220> eight<00:01:53.050> no<00:01:54.050> I'm<00:01:54.350> sorry<00:01:54.470> jump

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
and jump boost eight no I'm sorry jump

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.200 
and jump boost eight no I'm sorry jump
this<00:01:54.860> three<00:01:55.250> misread<00:01:56.120> that<00:01:57.880> it's<00:01:58.880> basically

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
this three misread that it's basically

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.370 
this three misread that it's basically
run<00:01:59.540> really<00:01:59.780> fast<00:01:59.810> you<00:02:00.290> can<00:02:00.440> even<00:02:00.729> mine<00:02:01.729> this

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
run really fast you can even mine this
