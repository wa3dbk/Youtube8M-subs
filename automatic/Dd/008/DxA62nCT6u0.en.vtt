00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.090
 many times already march and we have so many 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.610
 expenses with the boys' school 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.260
 useful license plates books that the latest 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.270
 what we think is in the backpack but in 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.850
 actually we think about cause 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.649
 every day for a long time 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.300
 weekends also had to do 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.820
 sport salgado good to friends house 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.059
 Then you have to invest a good 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.890
 backpack today I visited kipling which is a 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.440
 store that has characteristics 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.629
 backpacks that are good for the back 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.339
 and at the same time they are very fun for 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.960
 guys then they mix two things very 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.479
 important for others and two dads 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.359
 It is important that the size be of 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.480
 According to the child and the child is too big 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.489
 is going to put a lot of things 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.440
 when doing a lot of weight and that can damage 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.860
 the shoulders in the back 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.620
 then it is 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.220
 we recommend something else we 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.720
 We recommend it is the handles of the handles 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.030
 they must be very thin and they should be 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.730
 Padded as you touch here are pots 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.560
 padded things that are comfortable not if 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.479
 you feel like they are getting inside 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.910
 of the skin that normally and on the 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.440
 background of the school if the marks that 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.270
 you had the right night now 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.060
 if we can already find many backpacks 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.160
 do much with much more padding 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.570
 much more comfortable many times is worth the 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.030
 worth investing in something that maybe a 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.550
 slightly more expensive than the average for 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.619
 that lasts more than a year and really 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.780
 If you take good care of your backpack, 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.610
 it can last a lot more than a year two 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.310
 or three years per ruler also from 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.250
 take good care of the idea of ​​suitcases 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.860
 with wheels is that the partner is adjustable 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.860
 of adjustable so you can regulate the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.620
 size of the child put for what 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.360
 I did not buy it in children under 6 years 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.820
 We recommend that you be over 6 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.770
 years yes because younger children because 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.090
 often put many things in the backpack 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.490
 of wheels because you think that as no 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.679
 you are carrying many things and 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.070
 Children 6 years old can be harmed 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.290
 time of the wrist posture and apart 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.190
 of that you have to climb the square with 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.930
 civility 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:26.700
 so the idea is that you do not abuse and 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:28.950
 put a lot of weight in the afternoon 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.440
 let's be honest and frank the boy 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.060
 he also wants to have fun wants to feel 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.890
 what is chili smoke that all things 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.209
 they are unique that no one else has them I do not know 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.910
 How to customize how you can 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.890
 customize the backpack good we to 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.620
 all children who buy a backpack 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.570
 in a day they can come and customize their 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.070
 backpack then we give them the 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.489
 option to put different types of 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:54.620
 pins not of different cartoons 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.620
 really of light keyrings 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.390
 and goodbye good pompoms pencils for 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.390
 that are worn in different colors and 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.390
 others 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.890
 gets into the washing machine and is not going to 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.180
 fade then all the accessories are 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.310
 resistant to water so you can not 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.590
 put in the washing machine excesses very successful 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.140
 well in the primary game and I 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.390
 I recommend this because it is great you 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.180
 can enter all the books have two 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.570
 closures to be able to differentiate their 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.480
 courses until another close does not pull out 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.240
 differences books and notebooks well and 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.630
 here they can suddenly be good 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.630
 mobile 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.320
 but they can take for example some 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.280
 They do not like to carry lunch then 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.990
 can be worn many times 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.960
 we see our children leave school 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.460
 loading by dragging the backpacks and 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.580
 when you help them to charge you 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.650
 put it in the car discounts how heavy 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.900
 which are then really only 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.050
 should be charged 15 percent 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.930
 of the weight of the child in the backpack a child 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.720
 of 50 kilos to load maximum 7 kilos and 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.730
 half 8 kilos then actually a 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.380
 called the teachers obviously to 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.600
 Do not send them so many tasks or what 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.980
 necessary to load both the books and 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.960
 also feeds all the books 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.430
 simply by wearing what I wear what 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.430
 indispensable to do your homework
