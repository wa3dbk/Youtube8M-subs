00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 te star is monique sluyter to the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 his first live show was not exactly the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.000
 darling of the jury and so was his very 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.349
 surprised that the same jury had during 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.360
 the second live show 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.719
 save glass from skating or none 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.640
 stains varieties pointed door but the call 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.640
 she still there and everything 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.900
 monique sluyter is a real fighter 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.410
 first they dare not go on ice because of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.150
 a recent accident torn in one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.560
 wheelchair and three months again 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.750
 have to learn to walk 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.640
 last week would overcome fear and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.160
 she even walked around on her partners 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.500
 back but that is not enough for the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.559
 jury and she is flogged with low 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.059
 figures are the started i thought we are 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.739
 ended up at a Kate Bush concert 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.770
 because nothing was created at all 6 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.210
 and 6 5 and the viewer will not let me 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.100
 Falling them into skating or 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.140
 I end up not having effect on your 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.840
 delicious but she's okay 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.059
 just extra power but there she is 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.510
 everything on everything and that is rewarded 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.229
 that the very tough field is the doors that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.540
 show you 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.260
 the enthusiasm and especially the ambition 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.730
 a job goes on to next week 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.710
 monique and jan ii it is indeed 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.370
 monique's enthusiasm for which the jury stands 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.990
 choose 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.810
 and that means they are rock hard this week 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.370
 must train for even better lift throughout 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.380
 often you can finish low 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.450
 the higher but light becomes and the more 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.920
 I am going to train and the more clazzi monique 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.760
 the fighters 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.160
 yes i am really keeping you alcohol monique 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.530
 is ambitious but because of that ambition 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.180
 she has gone too far for herself and has 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.610
 her ribs bruised 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.380
 I knew yes with the last skating or 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.280
 wanted a little bit against it 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.380
 to 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.700
 so you tend not to leak me 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.700
 his knee we have behind us 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.740
 with a bruised river 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.740
 sees her started now 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.290
 yes they sometimes say there is better in the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.700
 ran break if you have a choice because they 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.830
 it dies with each other people left 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.750
 but i can tell you and also with easy 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.060
 smoking can be good beauty 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.430
 always a little pain and you are going to wash 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.680
 the optical curator estimated that 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.680
 racer blue jerry can slightly lower 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.330
 other 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.330
 baby clay continent with such things 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.300
 all right 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.590
 but 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.280
 butcher and stuff 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.280
 ron flan 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.590
 the 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.590
 also 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.800
 and 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.709
 contest 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.709
 popular 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.989
 small shrimp 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.040
 show 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.360
 on and after 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.420
 well then you see 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.420
 a 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.740
 you can order completely blue 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:17.160
 spots zico around that arm even her knee 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.390
 then place that is that normally to leave 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.740
 work today 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.780
 had to make real liszt today 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.330
 practice because I was always in the corset 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.860
 from the physical therapist 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.150
 yes but I thought it was very good though 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.790
 an audience also enjoyed it very much 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.650
 saw it so i have it last weeks 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.510
 not easy with the jury 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.100
 he certainly not with the next lady and 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.350
 that's martine but martine i do 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.970
 so for route sense of in between may 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.270
 so say martini you can do it now 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.490
 say yes monique I'll see you a bit 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.890
 stronger cure and with those steps you stand 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.260
 firmer on the damage that then have 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.790
 we also talked about last week 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.460
 I see that of course you are in the elevator 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.710
 also let you spin quickly but I miss 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.250
 I still miss some of your own 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.250
 always 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.800
 yes well yes i am standing for the third time 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.930
 binbin still overhang it rose 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.910
 Bipper is also a bit gone and the 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.390
 yes now they really fully but me 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.390
 I feel 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.600
 I feel you because I feel the fear in you 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.360
 when i am sitting here and oh i am doing fine 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.870
 goes well but keep going and stay 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.870
 just skates really myself to not 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.270
 lizzie what fly child snapping but yourself 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.470
 skating then we will certainly do it but me 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.150
 I still have martinus for a moment 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.590
 the weather ribs bruised and I have too 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.150
 another bet validated so I think 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.530
 she is pretty nation state 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.310
 and I know you are definitely on my 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.310
 mother say 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.419
 and what I also think is very clever 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.310
 has remained in place when 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.630
 double sided tape double sided as well 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.550
 I think you will stay at home for the viewers 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.490
 just get rid of the linen closet 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.500
 then it's just double sided tape 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.820
 maurice yes i am no longer martine 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.990
 once 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.930
 I think that you are the last 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.120
 weeks you were really scared and you saw you 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.530
 think oh what comes from now what 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.210
 I have to do now 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.280
 the moment you were lifted on the 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.259
 boys' shoulders 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.669
 I saw the showgirl for the first time 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.800
 that you have in you 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.449
 okay intestines are your best friend your 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.710
 skates are not always there yet 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.690
 I do see improvement or that 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.250
 improvement is enough if you do it 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.810
 compares with your competitors that we 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.650
 have just seen that dare to 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.290
 to doubt 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.419
 it is not the wrong fourth you come 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.520
 positive was also positive 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:33.300
 collectively the first to be the points marlies 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.300
 sufficient 6 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.130
 skinny dear patricia own the point 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.139
 did take it into account because it does 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.789
 Doing with others also I think they are 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:45.900
 it has done that fear very well 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:45.900
 must go but still a 7 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.320
 dear martine yes it really is almost 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.949
 sufficient but can no longer pretend 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.949
 he out of it 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.580
 I like him the same way 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.310
 martinus to the canteen 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.810
 neo no we are a bit faint 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.400
 against here am also hard string but that 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.110
 is good because you watch so many others 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.280
 things but the jury doesn't pay attention but finishes 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.170
 and every now and then I have to bully a bit 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.090
 without having these sweet candidates 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.600
 of course you don't like green either 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.320
 bullying 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.810
 your who your grade i wanted sufficient 6 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.480
 well we have bad water go 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.520
 guess average that is then a set 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.680
 higher than the last time so one 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.810
 positive attitude and that means 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.700
 third place for you 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.880
 but well the fight is not yet 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.990
 Monique can still compete from June 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.780
 always help 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.400
 was a job 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.380
 muscles are over the ice and like you 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.860
 this price no less see 

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:51.010
 shine and give your voice for now 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:59.470

00:07:51.010 --> 00:08:03.000
