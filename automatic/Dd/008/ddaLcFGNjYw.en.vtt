00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.689
 nothing 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.879
 hello how are friends are welcome 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.010
 to this new video tutorial of his 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.770
 server, Carlos, well, today we are going to 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.200
 see how we can download the version of 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.849
 ubuntu the last one we're talking about 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:29.300
 from 14.04 lts, ​​so we are going to 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.970
 download it and we will prepare it in 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.760
 our usb to use it directly 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.460
 from the usb without having to install it in 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.660
 our computer ok then what 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.570
 we will do practically 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.450
 go to download the operating system 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.700
 from the official ubuntu page that 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.650
 as you can see is 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.780
 for the platform type of 32 and 70 and 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.430
 64 bits the link to your download is 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.130
 here in the information of this video ok 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.010
 then I'm going to select the type of 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.070
 suitable platform for my pc that would be 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.950
 32 bits and I'm going to click on the button 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.340
 folded to is here if you want to donate something 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.300
 for the website, obviously you leave it 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.150
 well and then you donate something of 20 or 10 thousand 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.390
 dollars or if you want to increase you can 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.690
 increase your donation ok I'm going to move 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.830
 all tabs to the left 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.930
 because I'm not going to donate anything then 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.780
 let's go to click directly on the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.790
 button that says more work download and 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.830
 takes us to a new page for your 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.050
 download there is already going to start 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.420
 thanks for downloading the system 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.830
 operative there already we started to download 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.810
 the operating system as you can see 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:50.290
 as you can see it started and it weighs 987 mb ok 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.190
 I'm going to cancel it because I already have it 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.230
 discharge 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.500
 then simply what we will do will be 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:59.620
 go to use a simple program to 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.890
 can mount our operating system 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.800
 in the usb and so we can run it 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.680
 directly from there we will use the 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.960
 program called universal usb 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.770
 install and we will execute it as 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.290
 administrator if we are in 32 bits 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.300
 we hit the green and here we go 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.770
 select the operating system of 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.620
 ubuntu 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.600
 the version that we are going to install in this 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.570
 case let's directly select the 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.180
 first to say ubuntu already below 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.910
 opens us this is enabled us this 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.640
 option in which bruce tells us to 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.350
 look for the operating system not the one that 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.620
 we will install in this case I 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.570
 I have on an external disk you already 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.750
 they will know the route in which they have the 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.480
 operating system to mount on the usb 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.170
 here I have it here is the version of 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.150
 ubuntu 14 of stock and I give it to open ok 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.130
 as you can see and warn in the little letters 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.470
 in green means that the system 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.480
 operative is ready to be 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:07.000
 mounted on the usb 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.409
 Now what we will do is choose the 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.720
 device in which we are going to mount 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.870
 our operating system in this case 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.750
 I have a 14 gigabyte usb 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.610
 then with the letter assigned g so that it does not 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.060
 comets mistakes I recommend you go 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.629
 to the windows explorer team and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.480
 While he controls 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.650
 the assigned letter of your devices 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.599
 so you're not wrong and you're 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.920
 riding in the operating system in 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.319
 other discs if you have several 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.090
 partitions on your computer in this 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.459
 case as you can see I have a disk 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.099
 removable that is with the letter assigned 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.349
 that and they already detect it 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.900
 automatically then we give it what 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.310
 we select here we are going to activate this 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.209
 box that is to give us the 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:57.410
 format suitable to our usb that would be 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:00.799
 in fat32 and this is the important thing we are going to 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.280
 select this little tool that 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:06.890
 it is what will give us memory for 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.379
 that the data is saved when 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.799
 we are already running the system 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.510
 operative in the usb directly we are going to 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.120
 make changes in the we are not going to save 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.820
 files or work that we do then 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.280
 if we want those files or jobs 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.500
 stay in the usb with the system 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.360
 saved operative we will have to 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.729
 select all this to the right 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:34.110
 ok that would be 4 link 89 m 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:37.289
 4 gb then we click create and this 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.509
 will send us a message that we are going to 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.360
 click on where it says if then it 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.969
 will begin practically our system 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.279
 operative to be mounted on the usb ok we're going 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:49.469
 to wait as you can see just 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:52.800
 finish system preparation 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:54.960
 operating directly on the usb and 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.960
 it means that it is ready to be 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.029
 started directly from the usb we're going 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.930
 to be able to use the operating system 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:06.270
 ubuntu 14.04 directly from the usb 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.659
 without having to install it in our 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.389
 computer if we go to the browser 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:14.639
 of windows let's team let's see from 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.639
 that the icon has just changed and we 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.770
 It gives in the logo, sorry, the logo 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.689
 ubuntu not now what we 're going to do 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.960
 it is simply to restart our 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:26.909
 computer and modify the various for 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.700
 that we can boot the system 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:32.040
 operative ubuntu 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.740
 well then once in the several in 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.010
 our computer we get to the 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.780
 section of edu that is here with the 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.410
 arrow keys is from our 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.780
 keyboard that and we're going to go to later in the 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.750
 extension book we are going to go to the 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.770
 option where it says but the beat 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.280
 very clear 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.220
 ok there we will select the option 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.490
 hard drive and green that is in the 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.370
 position 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.370
 the second option would be to go to where 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.160
 it says hard disk drives we're going to go to 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.130
 look for the usb in this case that we have 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.289
 on our computer and we're going to 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.930
 select it as you can see it is in the 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:17.990
 third place and then we select 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.630
 Blandon whole we open this other 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.030
 mentality now we go with always 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.780
 with the arrow keys we're going 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.699
 up like this and we're going to give it again 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.550
 between a green living that will change 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:34.220
 put the priority of the usb and base 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.840
 in first there is 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.819
 that means that now when 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.419
 restart the computer will boot 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:44.810
 directly from the usb f10 we are going to 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:49.120
 press so that the data is saved in 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.120
 the system and we give it ok 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.090
 as you can see the operating system 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:16.020
 is running directly from the 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:19.620
 usb and then what data the good thing that 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.930
 well when we put in the usb for 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.570
 can store data in it 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.250
 data or the modifications 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.410
 let's make the operating system stay 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.510
 stored in the usb practically not 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:33.480
 this but it entails going to go 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:35.690
 reducing the space in the usb and then 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.770
 it means that later you may have to 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.230
 eliminate some program or some 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.340
 application that you have installed not good 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.950
 that's all friends I hope the 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.260
 tutorial has already served you and remember 

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.150
 then visit my website for more 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.090
 information about this operating system 

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:54.390
 or another version of this operating system 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:56.600
 which is 1.1 that's all and even the 

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.600
 next
