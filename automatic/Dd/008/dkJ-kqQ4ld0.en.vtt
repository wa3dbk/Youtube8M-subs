have<00:02:02.850> understood<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.420> fact<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.780> you

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
have understood for the fact that you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.420 
have understood for the fact that you
know<00:02:04.380> they<00:02:04.500> haven't<00:02:04.680> mentioned<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.219> she's

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
know they haven't mentioned that she's

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.580 
know they haven't mentioned that she's
half<00:02:05.579> something<00:02:05.880> else<00:02:06.030> they<00:02:06.439> explicitly<00:02:07.439> told

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
half something else they explicitly told

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.290 
half something else they explicitly told
her<00:02:07.740> she's<00:02:07.950> full<00:02:08.220> Filipino

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
her she's full Filipino

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.780 
her she's full Filipino
confuses<00:02:09.750> me<00:02:09.870> so<00:02:10.200> she<00:02:10.260> has<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.650> very<00:02:10.979> pale

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
confuses me so she has this very pale

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.580 
confuses me so she has this very pale
skin<00:02:11.820> I<00:02:12.270> mean<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.570> looks<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.930> bit<00:02:12.960> more<00:02:13.110> tanned

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
skin I mean it looks a bit more tanned

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.640 
skin I mean it looks a bit more tanned
in<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.950> gameplay<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.780> very<00:02:16.080> kind<00:02:16.590> of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
in the gameplay but it's very kind of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.890 
in the gameplay but it's very kind of
you<00:02:17.640> know<00:02:17.730> it's<00:02:17.880> more<00:02:18.030> pale<00:02:18.360> than<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.600> thought

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
you know it's more pale than I thought

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.360 
you know it's more pale than I thought
it<00:02:19.050> would<00:02:19.200> be<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.620> then<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.070> should<00:02:20.340> be

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
it would be and then it should be

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.510 
it would be and then it should be
because<00:02:21.210> if<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.750> take<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.290> normal<00:02:22.890> Filipino

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
because if you take a normal Filipino

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.250 
because if you take a normal Filipino
person<00:02:23.970> they<00:02:24.330> are<00:02:24.360> very<00:02:24.690> Brown<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.140> that's

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
person they are very Brown and that's

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.630 
person they are very Brown and that's
because<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.650> know<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.890> Sun<00:02:26.220> all<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.460> time

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
because you know the Sun all the time

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.420 
because you know the Sun all the time
and<00:02:27.030> they<00:02:27.150> they<00:02:27.480> get<00:02:27.720> very<00:02:28.080> very<00:02:28.470> very<00:02:28.980> round

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
and they they get very very very round

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.620 
and they they get very very very round
and<00:02:29.730> even<00:02:29.820> my<00:02:30.210> mum<00:02:30.360> was<00:02:30.510> saying<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:31.560> when<00:02:32.010> she

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
and even my mum was saying that when she

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.910 
and even my mum was saying that when she
used<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.720> live<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.020> Philippines<00:02:34.470> she<00:02:34.770> was

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
used to live in the Philippines she was

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.490 
used to live in the Philippines she was
called<00:02:35.280> Black<00:02:36.030> Beauty<00:02:36.570> because<00:02:36.930> she<00:02:37.110> was<00:02:37.260> so

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
called Black Beauty because she was so

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.010 
called Black Beauty because she was so
dark<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.190> had<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.940> beautiful<00:02:39.390> town<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.930> had

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
dark and had a beautiful town and had

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.060 
dark and had a beautiful town and had
long<00:02:40.260> flowing<00:02:40.650> black<00:02:41.100> hair<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:42.410> yes<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.710> mean

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
long flowing black hair and yes I mean

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.320 
long flowing black hair and yes I mean
obviously<00:02:44.190> there<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:44.820> kind<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.030> stigma

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
obviously there is this kind of stigma

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.410 
obviously there is this kind of stigma
in<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.810> Filipino<00:02:46.790> mainstream<00:02:47.790> media<00:02:48.150> about

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
in the Filipino mainstream media about

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.440 
in the Filipino mainstream media about
celebrities<00:02:49.220> have<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.490> be<00:02:50.580> pale<00:02:50.820> may<00:02:51.090> have<00:02:51.300> to

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
celebrities have to be pale may have to

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.920 
celebrities have to be pale may have to
be<00:02:51.570> white<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.260> don't<00:02:52.320> understand<00:02:53.540> why<00:02:54.540> but

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
be white and I don't understand why but

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.720 
be white and I don't understand why but
I<00:02:55.080> guess<00:02:55.350> Filipino<00:02:55.800> people<00:02:55.980> like<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.550> have

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
I guess Filipino people like to have

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.170 
I guess Filipino people like to have
this<00:02:56.940> whiter<00:02:57.480> skin<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:59.280> they<00:02:59.370> aspire<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.970> look

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
this whiter skin and they aspire to look

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.100 
this whiter skin and they aspire to look
like<00:03:01.040> American<00:03:02.040> people<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.730> guess<00:03:02.910> um<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:03.750> I

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
like American people I guess um and I

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.820 
like American people I guess um and I
think<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:05.130> can<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:05.550> picked<00:03:05.940> up<00:03:06.150> on<00:03:06.300> that

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
think that can have picked up on that

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.050 
think that can have picked up on that
because<00:03:07.830> if<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:07.980> look<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.340> lot<00:03:08.550> Filipino

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
because if you look a lot Filipino

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.740 
because if you look a lot Filipino
celebrities<00:03:09.540> they<00:03:09.660> are<00:03:10.220> paler<00:03:11.750> complexion

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
celebrities they are paler complexion

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.740 
celebrities they are paler complexion
but<00:03:13.290> that's<00:03:13.500> because<00:03:13.680> they<00:03:13.950> have<00:03:14.070> access<00:03:14.280> to

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
but that's because they have access to

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.630 
but that's because they have access to
that<00:03:15.750> kind<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.170> high-end<00:03:16.920> whitening

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that kind of high-end whitening

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.780 
that kind of high-end whitening
treatments<00:03:18.500> which<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.650> unnatural<00:03:20.010> they<00:03:20.640> are

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
treatments which is unnatural they are

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.880 
treatments which is unnatural they are
changing<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.930> skin<00:03:22.170> tone<00:03:22.410> it's<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.680> non

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
changing the skin tone it's a non

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.970 
changing the skin tone it's a non
mandrel<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.230> think<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.680> Tekken

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
mandrel so I so I think that Tekken

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.350 
mandrel so I so I think that Tekken
should<00:03:26.190> have<00:03:26.280> played<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.600> know

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
should have played the you know

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.990 
should have played the you know
dark-skinned<00:03:30.500> thing<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.860> when<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.760> watched

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
dark-skinned thing and when I watched

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.510 
dark-skinned thing and when I watched
the<00:03:33.209> trailer<00:03:33.360> when<00:03:34.200> she<00:03:34.410> spoke<00:03:34.830> she<00:03:35.160> was

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
the trailer when she spoke she was

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.810 
the trailer when she spoke she was
saying<00:03:35.730> well<00:03:35.910> oh<00:03:36.090> um<00:03:36.980> get<00:03:37.980> ready<00:03:38.190> for<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.520> I

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
can't believe I won her she has the most

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.670 
can't believe I won her she has the most
Americanized<00:03:42.150> accent<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.870> could<00:03:43.470> have<00:03:43.560> ever

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
imagined and it horrified me she
