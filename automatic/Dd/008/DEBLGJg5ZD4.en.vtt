are you telling me that you can tell how

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.400 
are you telling me that you can tell how
big<00:00:22.529> someone<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.130> based<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:24.119> their<00:00:24.600> voice<00:00:24.840> yeah

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
big someone is based on their voice yeah

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
really a big win and honestly like what

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.120 
really a big win and honestly like what
are<00:00:29.849> they<00:00:29.970> basing<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.510> 6<00:00:31.289> foot<00:00:31.500> 3<00:00:31.560> hello

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
are they basing that on 6 foot 3 hello

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.620 
are they basing that on 6 foot 3 hello
you<00:00:32.820> know<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.180> an<00:00:33.270> excellent<00:00:33.450> question

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
you know that is an excellent question

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.420 
you know that is an excellent question
you<00:00:34.200> know<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.500> see<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> lot<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.070> these<00:00:35.160> studies

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
you know we see a lot of these studies

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.790 
you know we see a lot of these studies
about<00:00:35.880> men<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.270> women<00:00:36.540> supposedly<00:00:37.230> being

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
about men and women supposedly being

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.130 
about men and women supposedly being
wired<00:00:38.309> differently<00:00:38.910> right<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.930> hear

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
wired differently right like you hear

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.049 
wired differently right like you hear
men<00:00:40.500> are<00:00:40.620> better<00:00:40.770> at<00:00:40.890> math<00:00:41.160> than<00:00:41.579> spatial

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
men are better at math than spatial

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.209 
men are better at math than spatial
relationships<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.230> women<00:00:43.800> are<00:00:43.890> better<00:00:43.980> with

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
relationships and women are better with

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.190 
relationships and women are better with
language<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.000> they're<00:00:45.180> better<00:00:45.570> worriers

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
language and they're better worriers

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.160 
language and they're better worriers
than<00:00:46.500> men<00:00:46.739> yeah<00:00:47.280> my<00:00:47.550> brain<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.329> better<00:00:48.660> at

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
than men yeah my brain is better at

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.529 
than men yeah my brain is better at
worrying<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.489> does<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.670> even<00:00:50.969> mean<00:00:51.329> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
worrying like what does that even mean I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.119 
worrying like what does that even mean I
wouldn't<00:00:51.809> worry<00:00:51.989> about<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.230> we're<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.530> wired

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
wouldn't worry about it we're just wired

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.639 
wouldn't worry about it we're just wired
differently<00:00:53.940> Lacey<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:55.050> are<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> different

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
differently Lacey we are a different

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.279 
differently Lacey we are a different
species<00:00:55.949> where<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.120> are<00:00:57.300> different<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.230> some

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
species where we are different in some

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.349 
species where we are different in some
ways<00:00:58.710> especially<00:00:58.890> physically<00:00:59.789> just<00:01:00.180> like

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
ways especially physically just like

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.580 
ways especially physically just like
there<00:01:00.510> are<00:01:00.539> physical<00:01:00.870> differences<00:01:01.379> between

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
there are physical differences between

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.039 
there are physical differences between
races<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.579> physical<00:01:03.210> differences<00:01:03.690> don't

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
races but physical differences don't

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.050 
races but physical differences don't
mean<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.530> our<00:01:04.650> brains<00:01:04.920> are<00:01:05.250> wired

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
mean that our brains are wired

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.600 
mean that our brains are wired
differently<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:07.229> love<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.770> good<00:01:07.979> study<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.580> much

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
differently I love a good study as much

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.399 
differently I love a good study as much
as<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> next<00:01:09.119> guy<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.750> sometimes<00:01:10.049> forget

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
as the next guy but we sometimes forget

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.800 
as the next guy but we sometimes forget
that<00:01:10.710> there<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:11.150> regular<00:01:12.150> people<00:01:12.180> behind

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that there are regular people behind

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.359 
that there are regular people behind
these<00:01:13.049> studies<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.130> think<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
these studies we like to think that

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.789 
these studies we like to think that
science<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.850> always<00:01:15.060> objective<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.229> social

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
science is always objective that social

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.980 
science is always objective that social
and<00:01:17.070> cultural<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.880> personal<00:01:18.030> biases<00:01:18.750> will

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and cultural and personal biases will

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.080 
and cultural and personal biases will
never<00:01:19.229> affect<00:01:19.439> research<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.400> experiments

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
never affect research or experiments

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.060 
never affect research or experiments
true<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.479> think<00:01:21.810> there's<00:01:21.990> great<00:01:22.439> examples

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
true I think there's great examples

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.740 
true I think there's great examples
throughout<00:01:23.580> history<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.210> different<00:01:24.330> types<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
throughout history of different types of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.300 
throughout history of different types of
studies<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.020> look<00:01:25.290> at<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> person's<00:01:25.770> race<00:01:25.950> or

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
studies that look at a person's race or

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.039 
studies that look at a person's race or
their<00:01:26.759> sexual<00:01:27.000> orientation<00:01:27.540> or<00:01:27.720> their<00:01:27.810> sex

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
their sexual orientation or their sex

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.690 
their sexual orientation or their sex
and<00:01:28.259> are<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.770> group<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.159> people<00:01:29.280> is

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and are like this group of people is

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.380 
and are like this group of people is
this<00:01:30.329> way<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.930> here's<00:01:31.650> why<00:01:32.009> yeah<00:01:32.640> like<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
this way and here's why yeah like the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.109 
this way and here's why yeah like the
psychology<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.380> negro<00:01:34.770> study<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.250> 1916

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
psychology of the negro study in 1916

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.880 
psychology of the negro study in 1916
where<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> researcher<00:01:36.840> concluded<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
where the researcher concluded that the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.969 
where the researcher concluded that the
color<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.520> skin<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.780> crookedness<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
color of skin and the crookedness of the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.030 
color of skin and the crookedness of the
hair<00:01:41.360> prove<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.600> black<00:01:42.930> slaves<00:01:43.380> were<00:01:43.770> less

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
hair prove that black slaves were less

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.620 
hair prove that black slaves were less
moral<00:01:44.610> than<00:01:44.759> white<00:01:45.000> people<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
moral than white people this is a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.109 
moral than white people this is a
scientist<00:01:46.259> yeah<00:01:46.649> they're<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.310> busy<00:01:47.610> proving

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
scientist yeah they're like busy proving

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.850 
scientist yeah they're like busy proving
how<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> morally<00:01:48.810> superior<00:01:49.200> they<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:49.619> with

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
how a morally superior they are with

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.710 
how a morally superior they are with
science<00:01:50.250> meanwhile<00:01:50.729> these<00:01:51.000> dudes<00:01:51.299> think<00:01:51.570> it's

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
science meanwhile these dudes think it's

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.649 
science meanwhile these dudes think it's
totes<00:01:52.049> cool<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:53.189> own<00:01:53.430> people<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:54.570> was

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
totes cool to own people there was

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.600 
totes cool to own people there was
another<00:01:54.840> study<00:01:55.079> -<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.500> 1906<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.250> was<00:01:56.369> even

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
another study - in 1906 it was even

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.639 
another study - in 1906 it was even
published<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> American<00:01:58.290> Journal<00:01:58.320> of

published in the American Journal of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.260 
published in the American Journal of
Anatomy<00:01:59.070> they<00:01:59.189> let<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.490> thing<00:01:59.729> through<00:02:00.030> it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
Anatomy they let this thing through it

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.230 
Anatomy they let this thing through it
claimed<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.500> Negro<00:02:02.009> brain<00:02:02.369> was<00:02:02.850> smaller

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
claimed that the Negro brain was smaller

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.929 
claimed that the Negro brain was smaller
than<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.899> Caucasian<00:02:04.140> brain<00:02:04.799> debunked<00:02:05.759> a

than the Caucasian brain debunked a
million<00:02:06.479> times<00:02:06.689> over<00:02:06.869> that's<00:02:07.229> not<00:02:07.439> good

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
million times over that's not good

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.620 
million times over that's not good
science<00:02:08.009> -<00:02:08.129> yeah

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
science - yeah

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.550 
science - yeah
not<00:02:08.750> in<00:02:08.870> that<00:02:08.960> study<00:02:09.230> was<00:02:09.380> actually

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
not in that study was actually

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.610 
not in that study was actually
generalized<00:02:10.430> to<00:02:10.790> include<00:02:11.120> women<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.900> poor

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
generalized to include women and poor

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.290 
generalized to include women and poor
people<00:02:12.980> too<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.550> researcher<00:02:13.910> basically

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
people too so the researcher basically

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.270 
people too so the researcher basically
claimed<00:02:14.540> every<00:02:15.440> group<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.770> people<00:02:16.100> was

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
claimed every group of people was

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.540 
claimed every group of people was
biologically<00:02:17.120> inferior<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.810> rich<00:02:18.050> white<00:02:18.550> men

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
biologically inferior to rich white men

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.460 
biologically inferior to rich white men
we<00:02:19.970> also<00:02:20.090> saw<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.420> with<00:02:20.570> homosexuality<00:02:21.080> it

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
we also saw this with homosexuality it

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.220 
we also saw this with homosexuality it
wasn't<00:02:21.740> until<00:02:21.950> 1973<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:23.480> homosexuality<00:02:24.050> was

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
wasn't until 1973 that homosexuality was

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.990 
wasn't until 1973 that homosexuality was
no<00:02:24.470> longer<00:02:24.800> considered<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.340> serious<00:02:25.580> mental

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
no longer considered a serious mental

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.810 
no longer considered a serious mental
illness<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:26.750> not<00:02:26.930> long<00:02:27.710> enough<00:02:27.740> ago<00:02:28.160> it

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
illness that is not long enough ago it

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.150 
illness that is not long enough ago it
really<00:02:29.450> isn't<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:29.960> I<00:02:30.050> mean<00:02:30.260> those<00:02:30.500> homophobic

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
really isn't and I mean those homophobic

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.950 
really isn't and I mean those homophobic
mentalities<00:02:31.760> are<00:02:32.000> still<00:02:32.270> with<00:02:32.390> us<00:02:32.420> today<00:02:32.660> just

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
mentalities are still with us today just

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.510 
mentalities are still with us today just
look<00:02:33.050> at<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.230> scientifically<00:02:33.830> bunc<00:02:34.130> gay

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
look at the scientifically bunc gay

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.000 
look at the scientifically bunc gay
rehab<00:02:34.880> therapy<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:36.110> are<00:02:36.230> based<00:02:36.410> on<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.710> idea

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
rehab therapy that are based on the idea

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.890 
rehab therapy that are based on the idea
that<00:02:37.130> gay<00:02:37.640> kids<00:02:37.940> are<00:02:38.120> psychologically

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
that gay kids are psychologically

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.990 
that gay kids are psychologically
disturbed<00:02:39.320> yeah<00:02:39.710> so<00:02:40.190> coming<00:02:40.550> back<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
disturbed yeah so coming back to the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.970 
disturbed yeah so coming back to the
hardwired<00:02:41.660> sex<00:02:42.050> differences<00:02:42.500> many<00:02:42.770> of<00:02:42.890> these

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
hardwired sex differences many of these

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.040 
hardwired sex differences many of these
differences<00:02:43.340> are<00:02:43.790> learned<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:44.690> from<00:02:44.870> day<00:02:45.020> one

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
differences are learned so from day one

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.050 
differences are learned so from day one
you<00:02:45.740> know<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:45.920> have<00:02:46.040> boys<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.640> are<00:02:46.730> given<00:02:46.940> to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
you know you have boys that are given to

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.120 
you know you have boys that are given to
his<00:02:47.210> life<00:02:47.360> in<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:47.630> science<00:02:47.990> lab<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.890> video

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
his life in that science lab and video

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.800 
his life in that science lab and video
games<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.640> sports<00:02:49.880> which<00:02:50.090> all<00:02:50.270> improve

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
games and sports which all improve

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.870 
games and sports which all improve
spatial<00:02:51.350> reasoning<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.860> as<00:02:52.340> he's<00:02:52.520> growing<00:02:52.730> up

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
spatial reasoning and as he's growing up

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.430 
spatial reasoning and as he's growing up
all<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.210> famous<00:02:53.390> scientists<00:02:53.870> on<00:02:53.930> TV<00:02:54.230> look

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
all the famous scientists on TV look

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.530 
all the famous scientists on TV look
just<00:02:54.680> like<00:02:54.860> him<00:02:55.070> because<00:02:55.490> they're<00:02:55.790> male<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.210> a

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
just like him because they're male and a

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.030 
just like him because they're male and a
school<00:02:56.780> teachers<00:02:57.050> believe<00:02:57.380> that<00:02:57.710> boys<00:02:57.830> are

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
school teachers believe that boys are

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.440 
school teachers believe that boys are
better<00:02:58.130> at<00:02:58.370> girls<00:02:58.610> in<00:02:58.790> science<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.360> he's

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
better at girls in science and he's

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.970 
better at girls in science and he's
given<00:02:59.690> extra<00:02:59.960> support<00:03:00.350> while<00:03:00.470> girls<00:03:00.770> are

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
given extra support while girls are

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.800 
given extra support while girls are
steered<00:03:01.310> instead<00:03:02.030> toward<00:03:02.300> things<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.690> are

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
steered instead toward things that are

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.530 
steered instead toward things that are
like<00:03:02.930> language<00:03:03.350> II<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.860> spoken<00:03:04.430> word<00:03:04.730> yeah<00:03:05.330> we

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
like language II and spoken word yeah we

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.820 
like language II and spoken word yeah we
actually<00:03:05.900> saw<00:03:06.050> a<00:03:06.080> study<00:03:06.410> about<00:03:06.620> how

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
actually saw a study about how

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.250 
actually saw a study about how
subconscious<00:03:07.550> biases<00:03:08.120> affect<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:09.080> success

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
subconscious biases affect the success

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.040 
subconscious biases affect the success
of<00:03:09.650> girls<00:03:10.130> versus<00:03:10.490> boys<00:03:10.520> in<00:03:11.030> science<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.900> few

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
of girls versus boys in science a few

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.080 
of girls versus boys in science a few
months<00:03:12.260> ago<00:03:12.350> yeah<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.860> did<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.040> dnews<00:03:13.640> on<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.940> so

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
months ago yeah it did a dnews on it so

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.670 
months ago yeah it did a dnews on it so
these<00:03:14.240> are<00:03:14.390> just<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.720> few<00:03:14.930> example<00:03:15.500> of<00:03:15.620> the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
these are just a few example of the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.070 
these are just a few example of the
things<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.220> absolutely<00:03:16.910> have<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.270> power<00:03:17.480> to

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
things that absolutely have the power to

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.420 
things that absolutely have the power to
make<00:03:18.200> gender<00:03:18.560> stereotypes<00:03:19.130> a

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
make gender stereotypes a

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.950 
make gender stereotypes a
self-fulfilling<00:03:19.880> prophecy<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:20.690> doesn't

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
self-fulfilling prophecy and it doesn't

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.080 
self-fulfilling prophecy and it doesn't
mean<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:21.350> we<00:03:21.470> have<00:03:22.040> like<00:03:22.310> these<00:03:22.460> rigid

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
mean that we have like these rigid

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.300 
mean that we have like these rigid
hardwired<00:03:23.660> different<00:03:24.080> brains<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:24.890> means<00:03:25.100> that

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
hardwired different brains it means that

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.550 
hardwired different brains it means that
we<00:03:25.460> also<00:03:25.790> have<00:03:26.090> different<00:03:26.270> socialization<00:03:27.230> yes

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
we also have different socialization yes

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.040 
we also have different socialization yes
and<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.040> socialization<00:03:28.790> could<00:03:29.480> actually<00:03:29.720> be

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
and that socialization could actually be

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.930 
and that socialization could actually be
the<00:03:30.170> reason<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.530> we<00:03:30.710> are<00:03:30.740> seeing<00:03:31.220> what

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
the reason that we are seeing what

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.520 
the reason that we are seeing what
looked<00:03:32.180> like<00:03:32.240> physical<00:03:32.810> differences<00:03:33.230> and

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
looked like physical differences and

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.900 
looked like physical differences and
brains<00:03:33.800> of<00:03:33.950> men<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.160> women<00:03:34.250> because<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:34.760> all

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
brains of men and women because it's all

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.270 
brains of men and women because it's all
about<00:03:35.030> neuroplasticity<00:03:35.960> your<00:03:36.620> brain<00:03:36.980> is

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
about neuroplasticity your brain is

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.310 
about neuroplasticity your brain is
always<00:03:37.730> growing<00:03:38.060> it's<00:03:38.390> always<00:03:38.630> changing<00:03:39.170> it's

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
always growing it's always changing it's

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.260 
always growing it's always changing it's
drawing<00:03:39.590> new<00:03:39.860> pathways<00:03:40.370> it's<00:03:40.610> responding<00:03:41.180> to

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
drawing new pathways it's responding to

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.970 
drawing new pathways it's responding to
new<00:03:41.390> information<00:03:41.540> if<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.440> keep<00:03:42.740> repeating

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
new information if you keep repeating

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.580 
new information if you keep repeating
the<00:03:43.340> same<00:03:43.580> tasks<00:03:44.240> or<00:03:44.600> practicing<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.410> same

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
the same tasks or practicing the same

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.940 
the same tasks or practicing the same
thing<00:03:45.950> your<00:03:46.610> brain<00:03:46.970> physically<00:03:47.900> changes<00:03:48.709> in

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
thing your brain physically changes in

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.760 
thing your brain physically changes in
response<00:03:49.730> it's<00:03:50.000> extremely<00:03:50.990> malleable<00:03:51.230> early

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
response it's extremely malleable early

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.050 
response it's extremely malleable early
on<00:03:51.860> in<00:03:51.980> life<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:52.340> you're<00:03:52.490> learning<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.790> speak

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
on in life so you're learning to speak

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.000 
on in life so you're learning to speak
and<00:03:53.300> move<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:53.630> interact<00:03:53.990> and<00:03:54.140> stay<00:03:54.410> alive<00:03:54.709> and

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
and move and interact and stay alive and

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.730 
and move and interact and stay alive and
your<00:03:55.370> brain<00:03:55.640> just<00:03:55.670> rapidly<00:03:56.660> custom<00:03:57.260> builds

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
your brain just rapidly custom builds

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.430 
your brain just rapidly custom builds
itself<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.790> make<00:03:59.000> you<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.360> optimal<00:03:59.959> person

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
itself to make you the optimal person

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.590 
itself to make you the optimal person
for<00:04:00.770> your<00:04:00.980> day-to-day<00:04:01.250> existence<00:04:01.700> yeah<00:04:02.330> and

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
for your day-to-day existence yeah and

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.480 
for your day-to-day existence yeah and
then<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:02.990> growth<00:04:03.260> slows<00:04:03.530> down<00:04:03.830> as<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.370> get

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
then that growth slows down as you get

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.250 
then that growth slows down as you get
older<00:04:04.820> and<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:05.270> becomes<00:04:05.480> harder<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:05.930> harder

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
older and it becomes harder and harder

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.140 
older and it becomes harder and harder
for<00:04:06.290> your<00:04:06.470> brain<00:04:06.740> to<00:04:07.070> make<00:04:07.490> changes<00:04:07.880> in<00:04:08.030> this

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
for your brain to make changes in this

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.750 
for your brain to make changes in this
way<00:04:08.300> so<00:04:08.540> it's<00:04:08.870> complicated<00:04:09.680> okay<00:04:10.160> but<00:04:10.610> I<00:04:10.640> think

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
way so it's complicated okay but I think

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.890 
way so it's complicated okay but I think
these<00:04:10.970> are<00:04:11.150> things<00:04:11.330> that<00:04:11.390> we<00:04:11.600> should<00:04:11.780> be

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
these are things that we should be

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.170 
these are things that we should be
thinking<00:04:12.140> about<00:04:12.350> especially<00:04:13.100> when<00:04:13.459> we're

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
thinking about especially when we're

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.150 
thinking about especially when we're
hearing<00:04:14.390> claims<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:14.959> sound<00:04:15.230> sneekly<00:04:15.680> like

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
hearing claims that sound sneekly like

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.280 
hearing claims that sound sneekly like
things<00:04:16.459> that<00:04:16.669> are<00:04:16.790> used<00:04:17.060> to<00:04:17.270> generalize<00:04:17.810> about

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
things that are used to generalize about

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.710 
things that are used to generalize about
a<00:04:18.890> group<00:04:19.100> of<00:04:19.190> people<00:04:19.310> right<00:04:19.669> so<00:04:19.729> are<00:04:20.479> the

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
a group of people right so are the

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.030 
a group of people right so are the
studies<00:04:21.080> wrong<00:04:21.320> Oh

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
studies wrong Oh

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.620 
studies wrong Oh
or<00:04:22.130> are<00:04:22.400> we<00:04:22.430> studying<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:23.030> wrong<00:04:23.180> things<00:04:23.450> are

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
or are we studying the wrong things are

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.360 
or are we studying the wrong things are
we<00:04:23.720> looking<00:04:23.960> at<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.140> cause<00:04:24.350> of<00:04:24.650> things<00:04:24.830> or<00:04:25.250> are

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
we looking at the cause of things or are

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.040 
we looking at the cause of things or are
we<00:04:25.490> just<00:04:25.520> looking<00:04:26.030> at<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.360> facts<00:04:26.750> so<00:04:26.990> you

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
we just looking at the facts so you

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.570 
we just looking at the facts so you
should<00:04:27.500> let<00:04:27.620> us<00:04:27.740> know<00:04:27.770> what<00:04:28.160> you<00:04:28.340> think<00:04:28.550> down

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
should let us know what you think down

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.700
