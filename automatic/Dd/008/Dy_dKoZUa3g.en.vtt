00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 you talk guys youtube marshal rambo 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.620
 Back with destinee to go talk 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.219
 a little more about the expansion the king of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.269
 tekken is coming on the 15th of 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.429
 September 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.039
 less than one month for the launch of the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.289
 next expansion and people have enough 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.449
 people asking me the group here that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.039
 people play we are too 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.340
 questioning several things I wanted 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.849
 putting a question here is for you 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.969
 of the three classes is I do not know if you 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.180
 they have all three classes but we one 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.170
 little bit addicted we have the three 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.280
 classes is the titan the hunter and the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.329
 Arcane my question is who do you 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.700
 go first father in titan not you go 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.579
 to have the demolisher alone, which is the title 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.629
 with sun damage with the sledgehammer good the owner 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.809
 Hunter 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.090
 he will have a network and an arrow is a cow that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.309
 it is a more support class, and also 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.150
 we have the driver of the storm and 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.820
 kanu with arc damage he invokes the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.630
 Ball lightning 'pains is looking for 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.960
 hayden house was what i marshal i 'm 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.030
 I'll go sticks 3 clear but you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.610
 nelcy this everybody this is all 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.850
 world will occupy your character 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.890
 preferred that in my case it is titan I 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.040
 I'm going to everyone but I'll start first. 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.420
 to make history with a titan was like this 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.409
 Since when did I start in the game? 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.220
 I really like ranter vai-vai paulo 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.950
 previous 1st and the arcane there was not much 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.680
 and I'll tell you what I think 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.290
 also on to raise classes the new the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.590
 titan starting with titan demolisher lep 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.710
 I think this one is too good for it is so 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.960
 it will look good on both sides 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.500
 both for the pv is for us to play the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.409
 history plus one a class of attack and 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.569
 also on pv pp he will get 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.869
 give a melee attack and also the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.230
 income 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.629
 only his hammer is I do not need the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.209
 enemy is so close to you if you 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:21.690
 think about the other classes of titan 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:27.030
 He's got the defense, it's no good. 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.400
 nothing on pv pp and also has oo 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.220
 attacker is the fighter with bow damage 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.110
 that his power is simply to hit 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.989
 such a place if the enemies are there 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.489
 You're going to kill them now, how's it going to be? 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.500
 if it is close that you have a 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.160
 little further you can kill 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.099
 So I think this is going to be the 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.560
 new subclass titan new class 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:53.819
 title but serves both as PV 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.359
 for pvp already the nocturnal predator the hunter 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.239
 It's the best for me, the subclass for me. 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.120
 to use in pv is a subclass of support 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.549
 that we are going to suppress the powers of 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.810
 our enemies will be very good 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:14.160
 a hunter is in the pv efe already in the pvp galera 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.870
 It's not so good, it 's because the guys who 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.910
 play that's killing you do not want to stay 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.810
 providing assistance to its 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.889
 friends, right? 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.290
 for some videos I saw on pv pp 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.480
 the run make sure the flash mobilizes the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.489
 her enemies come here the arcane and 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.790
 someone will demand everyone there give 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.459
 Another power I believe this sub 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.480
 hunter classic 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.849
 the staff will play a little in pvp right 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.549
 To test in these new things, then they will. 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.949
 test then you will end up coming back so much 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.639
 to dance and how much for the 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:52.769
 gunslinger and we also have the 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.799
 storm is that the bed with a large 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.290
 This bow is the best for me. 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.379
 subclass that appeared for us to 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.620
 people play on pv pp in the crucible because 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:07.709
 power of his lasts even more 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.790
 also if the enemies have suppressed 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.230
 by the Hunter's Class 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.000
 You will be able to kill several enemies. 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.180
 with this 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.459
 with this new subclass already on pv p i 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.610
 I do not think it's going to be good for you. 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:27.630
 killing enemies is several more enemies 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.520
 weak is in PV does not predict between 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.000
 arcane and the titan 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.400
 I prefer the class I found stronger in 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.680
 titans class of 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.190
 but kanu is also going to be very good 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.790
 I believe in the crucible people pay attention 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.430
 It's what I think we are too. 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.150
 discussing here who will do raid 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.780
 how are you going to make raid 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:58.830
 pac and I'll tell you guys 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.290
 if you have only one clear character the 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.410
 pines you have two characters 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.590
 ppi is what you think is the best 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:12.330
 Do you like it but if you are thinking of 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.669
 make ogx galera nova raid a 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.510
 People who are crazy to make this new 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:21.960
 radio galera if you have your group that 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.600
 will make radio combine from at least 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.370
 one o pa 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.220
 the arcane gal that's talking about here 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.140
 the walt catch the hunter go 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.320
 attorney goes to the titan and no one is 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:37.620
 talking about the arcane galley will need 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:42.030
 band already said it to you complete 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:45.570
 Anger you will need the 23 on 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:49.290
 new classes then for the love of God 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.990
 will make raid at least one taco trick 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.680
 with the new subclass at least the 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.360
 Arcanum, she says nothing, I'm going to bed. 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.740
 more bones and not if you are thinking 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.820
 in making oops raid someone of you 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.979
 poet 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.720
 We 're in a rut to see who 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:11.850
 is that it will save the arcane galley that 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.340
 Who are you going to the first one? 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.380
 Leave your comment below too 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.100
