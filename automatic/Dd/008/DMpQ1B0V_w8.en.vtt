00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
to let us pick media move it further

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.160 
to let us pick media move it further
minotaurs<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.510> have<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.660> lot<00:01:40.810> of<00:01:40.840> people

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
minotaurs when you have a lot of people

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.690 
minotaurs when you have a lot of people
picking<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.590> minute<00:01:41.800> ours<00:01:41.980> is<00:01:42.250> really<00:01:42.580> easy

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
picking the minute ours is really easy

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.790 
picking the minute ours is really easy
because<00:01:43.480> if<00:01:43.690> you<00:01:43.780> stand<00:01:44.020> together<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.590> group

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
because if you stand together and group

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.370 
because if you stand together and group
up<00:01:44.980> you<00:01:45.640> can<00:01:45.820> destroy<00:01:46.180> them<00:01:46.420> very<00:01:46.840> quickly<00:01:47.020> and
