is Studio Fix fluid in NW 46 I love this

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.190 
is Studio Fix fluid in NW 46 I love this
because<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> sits<00:00:33.059> well<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.690> natural

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
because it sits well with my natural

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.170 
because it sits well with my natural
skin<00:00:34.469> tone<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.010> kind<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.399> warms<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:35.940> face

skin tone and kind of just warms my face

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.619 
skin tone and kind of just warms my face
off<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.050> tend<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.380> find<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.219> some

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
off so I tend to find that some

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.819 
off so I tend to find that some
foundations<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:39.660> asking<00:00:40.200> either<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.680> to

towards<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.280> orange<00:00:41.610> side<00:00:41.850> or<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> red<00:00:42.450> side

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
towards the orange side or the red side

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.049 
towards the orange side or the red side
and<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.140> sits<00:00:43.440> very<00:00:43.620> well<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:44.670> you're<00:00:44.879> my
