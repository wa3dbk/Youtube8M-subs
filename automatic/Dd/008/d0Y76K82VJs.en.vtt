saying well wait

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.430

Zerg<00:00:14.219> doesn't<00:00:15.030> wall<00:00:15.269> off<00:00:15.570> that's<00:00:15.809> one<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
Zerg doesn't wall off that's one of the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.830 
Zerg doesn't wall off that's one of the
problems<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.920> Zerg<00:00:17.220> has<00:00:17.630> that<00:00:18.630> their

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
problems that Zerg has that their

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.480 
problems that Zerg has that their
earliest<00:00:19.050> they<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.560> wall<00:00:19.740> off<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.130> middle

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
earliest they can wall off is middle

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.269 
earliest they can wall off is middle
game<00:00:20.670> where<00:00:21.300> their<00:00:21.630> queen<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.710> spread<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
game where their queen is you spread the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.470 
game where their queen is you spread the
creep<00:00:23.460> out<00:00:23.640> far<00:00:23.939> enough<00:00:24.060> where<00:00:24.300> they<00:00:24.359> can

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
creep out far enough where they can

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.380 
creep out far enough where they can
finally<00:00:24.779> put<00:00:25.199> some<00:00:25.230> spine<00:00:25.619> crawlers<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
finally put some spine crawlers on the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.250 
finally put some spine crawlers on the
ramp<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.519> teams<00:00:29.519> love<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.449> take<00:00:30.630> advantage<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
ramp and teams love to take advantage of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.319 
ramp and teams love to take advantage of
it<00:00:31.410> played<00:00:31.800> three<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.189> three<00:00:32.399> four<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:32.969> four

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
it played three on three four on four

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.950 
it played three on three four on four
and<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:34.559> consistently<00:00:35.309> happens<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.120> that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
and what consistently happens is that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.080 
and what consistently happens is that
the<00:00:37.050> teams<00:00:37.260> will<00:00:37.469> scout<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:37.980> find<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> Zerg

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the teams will scout out find the Zerg

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.490 
the teams will scout out find the Zerg
and<00:00:39.270> then<00:00:39.540> they'll<00:00:39.690> send<00:00:39.930> their<00:00:40.079> three<00:00:40.350> or

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
and then they'll send their three or

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.680 
and then they'll send their three or
four<00:00:40.680> armies<00:00:41.040> into<00:00:41.280> your<00:00:41.489> base<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.090> because

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
four armies into your base and because

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.560 
four armies into your base and because
you<00:00:42.960> don't<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> wall<00:00:43.910> you<00:00:44.910> can't<00:00:45.210> hold

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
you don't have the wall you can't hold

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.479 
you don't have the wall you can't hold
them<00:00:45.719> off<00:00:45.899> long<00:00:46.200> enough<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.950> your<00:00:47.070> allies<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
them off long enough for your allies to

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.549 
them off long enough for your allies to
get<00:00:47.789> there<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.690> lose<00:00:49.020> your<00:00:49.320> whole

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
get there and so you lose your whole

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.500 
get there and so you lose your whole
base<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.280> usually<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.059> lose<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.480> game

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
base and usually you lose the game

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.330 
base and usually you lose the game
because<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.739> very<00:00:52.949> effective

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
because of it it's a very effective

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.540 
because of it it's a very effective
strategy<00:00:53.989> especially<00:00:54.989> lower<00:00:55.890> level<00:00:56.340> team

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
strategy especially lower level team

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.150 
strategy especially lower level team
games<00:00:56.870> but<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.379> want<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.710> show<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.949> that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
games but here I want to show you that

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.270 
games but here I want to show you that
actually<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.239> build<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.170> wall<00:01:01.379> early<00:01:02.129> on

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
actually you can build a wall early on

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.200 
actually you can build a wall early on
without<00:01:03.229> sacrificing<00:01:04.229> very<00:01:04.470> much<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.210> what

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
without sacrificing very much and what

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.390 
without sacrificing very much and what
you<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.510> sacrifice<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.320> actually<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.100> becomes

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
you do sacrifice you actually it becomes

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.140 
you do sacrifice you actually it becomes
a<00:01:08.580> trade-off

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
a trade-off

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.850 
a trade-off
rather<00:01:09.450> than<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.750> sacrifice<00:01:10.290> where<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> get

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
rather than a sacrifice where you get

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.280 
rather than a sacrifice where you get
some<00:01:11.040> more<00:01:11.220> things<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.909> what<00:01:12.540> you've<00:01:12.689> lost

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
some more things or what you've lost

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.120 
some more things or what you've lost
now<00:01:14.450> specific<00:01:15.450> build<00:01:15.689> order<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.140> not<00:01:16.530> that

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
now specific build order is not that

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.090 
now specific build order is not that
important<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.659> case<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.259> decided<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.950> go

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.580 
purpose is extra larva
and<00:01:57.640> it's<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.119> very<00:01:58.390> common<00:01:58.719> tactic<00:01:59.259> that<00:01:59.289> need

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
and it's a very common tactic that need

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.200 
and it's a very common tactic that need
the<00:01:59.710> larvae<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:00.249> they<00:02:00.369> can<00:02:00.520> start<00:02:00.700> pumping<00:02:01.090> out

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
the larvae so they can start pumping out

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.330 
the larvae so they can start pumping out
offense<00:02:01.689> while<00:02:02.079> also<00:02:02.319> pumping<00:02:02.770> drones<00:02:03.130> at<00:02:03.219> the

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
same time however when it's there'd only

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.430 
same time however when it's there'd only

again<00:02:11.950> just<00:02:12.220> pumping<00:02:12.580> out<00:02:12.700> larvae<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:14.049> second

again just pumping out larvae the second

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
again just pumping out larvae the second
is<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:14.890> start<00:02:15.340> your<00:02:15.640> wall<00:02:15.879> and<00:02:16.180> third<00:02:17.610> this

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
is you start your wall and third this

is you start your wall and third this
whole<00:02:18.970> area<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.569> going<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.930> get<00:02:20.049> covered<00:02:20.440> in

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480

for you almost your whole base to be
covered<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.700> creep<00:02:25.319> so<00:02:26.319> then<00:02:26.739> I<00:02:26.769> at<00:02:27.010> 15<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.610> put

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
covered in creep so then I at 15 I put

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.949 
covered in creep so then I at 15 I put
down<00:02:28.629> my<00:02:28.690> extractor<00:02:29.730> when<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.760> went<00:02:31.239> back<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.420> 14

I<00:02:32.140> goes<00:02:32.650> up<00:02:32.769> to<00:02:32.829> 200<00:02:33.160> minerals<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.819> put<00:02:34.060> down

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
I goes up to 200 minerals and put down

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.880

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
to do at this point is I want to build

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.740 
to do at this point is I want to build
my<00:02:59.200> queen<00:02:59.500> at<00:02:59.739> this<00:03:00.069> auxilary<00:03:00.489> hatch<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.660> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
my queen at this auxilary hatch and the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.240 
my queen at this auxilary hatch and the
reason<00:03:02.019> why<00:03:02.109> I<00:03:02.139> build<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.530> at<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.769> auxilary

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
reason why I build it at the auxilary

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.809 
reason why I build it at the auxilary
hatch<00:03:03.870> because<00:03:04.870> he's<00:03:05.139> going<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.319> be<00:03:05.440> able<00:03:05.560> to

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
hatch because he's going to be able to

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.539 
hatch because he's going to be able to
vomit<00:03:06.819> his<00:03:06.940> larva<00:03:07.420> on<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:08.230> hatch<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:08.829> then

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
vomit his larva on this hatch and then

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.330 
vomit his larva on this hatch and then
he's<00:03:09.670> gonna<00:03:09.790> become<00:03:10.000> part<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.989> wall<00:03:11.340> so

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
he's gonna become part of the wall so

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.270 
he's gonna become part of the wall so
the<00:03:13.269> other<00:03:13.450> part<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.870> wall<00:03:14.069> I'm<00:03:15.069> gonna

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
the other part of the wall I'm gonna

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.030 
the other part of the wall I'm gonna
take<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.549> drone<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.540> I'm<00:03:17.260> gonna<00:03:17.380> move<00:03:17.680> him<00:03:17.859> over

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
take a drone and I'm gonna move him over

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.520 
take a drone and I'm gonna move him over
here<00:03:18.609> and<00:03:18.730> he's<00:03:19.209> going<00:03:19.389> to<00:03:19.450> become<00:03:19.569> a<00:03:20.079> spine

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
here and he's going to become a spine

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.470 
jungle basin is an easy one you'll have
to<00:03:46.959> experiment<00:03:47.530> with<00:03:47.709> other<00:03:47.950> maps<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.209> figure

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
to experiment with other maps to figure

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.830 
to experiment with other maps to figure
out<00:03:49.750> which<00:03:49.989> ones<00:03:50.200> do<00:03:50.440> do<00:03:50.769> which<00:03:51.540> but<00:03:52.540> for<00:03:52.569> this

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
out which ones do do which but for this

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.930 
out which ones do do which but for this
now<00:03:53.230> we<00:03:53.290> actually<00:03:53.620> have<00:03:53.859> quite<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.519> few<00:03:54.609> options

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
now we actually have quite a few options

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.140 
now we actually have quite a few options
where<00:03:55.359> we<00:03:55.480> can<00:03:55.629> branch<00:03:55.840> off<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:56.879> so<00:03:57.879> one<00:03:58.120> of

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
where we can branch off to so one of

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.879 
where we can branch off to so one of
course<00:03:58.510> we<00:03:58.629> can<00:03:58.750> always<00:03:58.900> just<00:03:59.260> start<00:03:59.680> pumping

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
course we can always just start pumping

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.729 
course we can always just start pumping
out<00:04:00.129> zerglings<00:04:00.730> we<00:04:01.150> can<00:04:01.269> use<00:04:01.480> our<00:04:01.660> hundred<00:04:02.500> gas

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
out zerglings we can use our hundred gas

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.500 
out zerglings we can use our hundred gas
to<00:04:03.190> get<00:04:03.340> our<00:04:03.549> metabolic<00:04:03.790> boost<00:04:04.209> and<00:04:04.419> get

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
to get our metabolic boost and get

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.749 
to get our metabolic boost and get
speedlings<00:04:05.049> out<00:04:05.229> got<00:04:05.590> two<00:04:06.009> hatches<00:04:06.400> pumping

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:06.759 
speedlings out got two hatches pumping

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.270 
speedlings out got two hatches pumping
speedlings<00:04:07.299> it's<00:04:07.900> actually<00:04:08.590> pretty<00:04:08.919> deadly

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
speedlings it's actually pretty deadly

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.740 
speedlings it's actually pretty deadly
early<00:04:09.789> on<00:04:09.940> in<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.150> game

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
I have a solid wall that's pretty hard

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.800 
I have a solid wall that's pretty hard
to<00:04:52.610> break<00:04:52.880> you're<00:04:53.060> not<00:04:53.210> gonna<00:04:53.360> break<00:04:53.540> it<00:04:53.600> with

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
to break you're not gonna break it with

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.140 
to break you're not gonna break it with
the<00:04:53.900> zealot<00:04:54.200> stalker<00:04:54.470> combo<00:04:55.010> to<00:04:55.400> easily

you<00:04:56.420> know<00:04:56.510> same<00:04:56.720> with<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:56.990> rotation<00:04:57.290> circling

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
you know same with the rotation circling

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.580 
you know same with the rotation circling
Hellion<00:04:58.940> Tsar<00:04:59.210> just<00:04:59.750> dead<00:04:59.960> in<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.170> water<00:05:00.380> on

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
Hellion Tsar just dead in the water on

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.210 
Hellion Tsar just dead in the water on
gets<00:05:00.920> this<00:05:01.070> thing<00:05:01.930> marine<00:05:02.930> water<00:05:03.530> again<00:05:03.920> you

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
gets this thing marine water again you

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.220 
gets this thing marine water again you
know<00:05:04.340> they're<00:05:05.240> really<00:05:05.330> gonna<00:05:05.540> lose<00:05:05.750> a<00:05:05.780> lot<00:05:06.110> of

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
know they're really gonna lose a lot of

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.600 
know they're really gonna lose a lot of
units<00:05:06.530> trying<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:06.860> break<00:05:07.010> through<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:07.460> in<00:05:07.520> the

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
units trying to break through and in the

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.740 
units trying to break through and in the
meantime<00:05:07.760> you<00:05:08.090> can<00:05:08.120> pump<00:05:08.420> out<00:05:08.540> enough

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
meantime you can pump out enough

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.400 
meantime you can pump out enough
zerglings<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.500> save<00:05:09.710> yourself<00:05:10.130> if<00:05:10.370> necessary

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
zerglings to save yourself if necessary

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.690 
zerglings to save yourself if necessary
so<00:05:12.410> you<00:05:12.470> really<00:05:12.770> have<00:05:12.860> a<00:05:12.890> good<00:05:13.160> defensive

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
so you really have a good defensive

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.390 
so you really have a good defensive
position<00:05:14.180> here<00:05:14.510> if<00:05:15.350> you<00:05:15.500> want<00:05:15.740> of<00:05:15.950> course<00:05:16.010> you

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
position here if you want of course you

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.460 
position here if you want of course you
can<00:05:16.550> start<00:05:17.510> saving<00:05:17.720> up<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.080> take<00:05:18.170> your<00:05:18.290> next

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
expansion you can start teching up hard

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.370 
expansion you can start teching up hard

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
the one big trade-off you've made is

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.330 
the one big trade-off you've made is
that<00:05:34.970> you<00:05:35.060> don't<00:05:35.330> have<00:05:35.600> your<00:05:36.260> extra<00:05:37.040> of

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
that you don't have your extra of

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.050 
that you don't have your extra of
hatchery<00:05:38.020> at<00:05:39.020> your<00:05:39.320> expansion<00:05:39.980> on<00:05:40.310> most<00:05:40.520> maps

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
hatchery at your expansion on most maps

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.400 
hatchery at your expansion on most maps
the<00:05:41.330> expansion<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:41.900> somewhere<00:05:42.200> out<00:05:42.260> here

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
the expansion and somewhere out here

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.060 
the expansion and somewhere out here
that's<00:05:42.890> pretty<00:05:43.430> difficult<00:05:44.180> to<00:05:44.690> defend<00:05:45.070> this

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
that's pretty difficult to defend this

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.260 
that's pretty difficult to defend this
map<00:05:46.310> actually<00:05:46.700> has<00:05:46.790> a<00:05:46.820> little<00:05:46.940> bit<00:05:47.120> of<00:05:47.180> an

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
map actually has a little bit of an

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.720 
map actually has a little bit of an
easier<00:05:47.630> expansion<00:05:48.320> to<00:05:48.440> defend<00:05:48.800> so<00:05:49.160> this<00:05:49.490> map

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
easier expansion to defend so this map

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.890 
easier expansion to defend so this map
you<00:05:50.000> may<00:05:50.570> consider<00:05:51.050> not<00:05:51.440> doing<00:05:51.470> this<00:05:52.390> but<00:05:53.390> most

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
you may consider not doing this but most

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.260 
you may consider not doing this but most
maps<00:05:54.140> when<00:05:54.380> it's<00:05:54.530> out<00:05:54.830> here<00:05:55.340> it's<00:05:55.850> very<00:05:56.090> hard

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
maps when it's out here it's very hard

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.380 
maps when it's out here it's very hard
to<00:05:56.300> defend<00:05:56.600> this<00:05:56.840> this<00:05:57.440> place<00:05:57.680> and<00:05:58.390> really

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
to defend this this place and really

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.310 
to defend this this place and really
when<00:05:59.540> you<00:05:59.570> think<00:05:59.660> about<00:05:59.960> it<00:06:00.260> even<00:06:00.860> now<00:06:01.130> I'm

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
when you think about it even now I'm

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.230 
when you think about it even now I'm
just<00:06:03.320> barely<00:06:03.890> starting<00:06:04.430> to<00:06:04.520> saturate<00:06:05.030> these

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
just barely starting to saturate these

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.750 
just barely starting to saturate these
minerals<00:06:05.720> most<00:06:06.560> of<00:06:06.710> these<00:06:06.830> drones<00:06:07.040> if<00:06:07.340> not<00:06:07.520> all

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
minerals most of these drones if not all

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.980 
minerals most of these drones if not all
of<00:06:07.940> them<00:06:08.090> are<00:06:08.180> working<00:06:08.480> at<00:06:08.570> a<00:06:08.600> hundred<00:06:08.810> percent

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
of them are working at a hundred percent

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.650 
of them are working at a hundred percent
efficiency<00:06:09.620> right<00:06:09.950> now<00:06:10.160> and<00:06:10.490> so<00:06:11.270> even<00:06:11.540> if<00:06:11.600> I

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
efficiency right now and so even if I

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.240 
efficiency right now and so even if I
was<00:06:11.750> pumping<00:06:12.020> out<00:06:12.169> two<00:06:12.410> hatches<00:06:12.800> on<00:06:12.950> two

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
was pumping out two hatches on two

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.830 
was pumping out two hatches on two
mineral<00:06:13.580> fields<00:06:13.880> I<00:06:13.970> wouldn't<00:06:14.419> be<00:06:14.510> getting<00:06:14.630> any

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
mineral fields I wouldn't be getting any

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.129 
mineral fields I wouldn't be getting any
more<00:06:14.990> mineral

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
more mineral

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.550 
more mineral
yet<00:06:16.590> so<00:06:17.490> really<00:06:18.090> the<00:06:18.629> sacrifice<00:06:19.199> is<00:06:19.379> gonna

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
yet so really the sacrifice is gonna

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.439 
yet so really the sacrifice is gonna
come<00:06:19.800> soon<00:06:20.870> if<00:06:21.870> you<00:06:22.020> don't<00:06:22.289> get<00:06:22.439> your<00:06:22.949> next

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
come soon if you don't get your next

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.300 
come soon if you don't get your next
expansion<00:06:24.449> up<00:06:24.779> but<00:06:25.349> really<00:06:25.710> this<00:06:25.919> is<00:06:25.979> a<00:06:26.099> much

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
expansion up but really this is a much

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.580 
expansion up but really this is a much
more<00:06:26.490> defensive<00:06:27.060> position<00:06:27.659> so<00:06:28.259> you<00:06:28.349> don't<00:06:28.499> get

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
more defensive position so you don't get

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.830 
more defensive position so you don't get
rushed<00:06:28.860> out<00:06:29.039> of<00:06:29.069> game<00:06:29.340> so<00:06:29.610> easily<00:06:29.840> especially

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
rushed out of game so easily especially

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.809 
rushed out of game so easily especially
in<00:06:30.930> team<00:06:31.139> games<00:06:31.439> so<00:06:32.159> I<00:06:32.189> hope<00:06:32.340> this<00:06:32.460> helps<00:06:32.759> you

in team games so I hope this helps you

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.700 
in team games so I hope this helps you
