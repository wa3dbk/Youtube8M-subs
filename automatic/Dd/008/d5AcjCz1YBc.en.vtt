docking<00:00:31.550> station<00:00:32.029> if<00:00:32.989> we<00:00:33.440> had<00:00:34.010> photos<00:00:34.400> in<00:00:34.850> this

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
docking station if we had photos in this

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.830 
docking station if we had photos in this
sample<00:00:35.239> let's<00:00:35.930> just<00:00:36.080> pop<00:00:36.260> it<00:00:36.440> in<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:38.570> sea<00:00:38.750> it

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
sample let's just pop it in the sea it

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.410 
sample let's just pop it in the sea it
pulls<00:00:38.989> up<00:00:39.080> a<00:00:39.170> home<00:00:39.350> screen<00:00:39.830> and<00:00:40.120> if<00:00:41.120> we<00:00:41.300> had

proceeded to live around the system it's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.560 
proceeded to live around the system it's
not<00:01:09.620> that<00:01:10.220> thin<00:01:10.550> but<00:01:10.729> it<00:01:10.820> is<00:01:11.060> kind<00:01:11.479> of

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
not that thin but it is kind of

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.719 
not that thin but it is kind of
streamlined<00:01:12.020> in<00:01:12.140> design<00:01:12.470> at<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.250> bottom<00:01:13.280> we

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
streamlined in design at the bottom we

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.080 
streamlined in design at the bottom we
have<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:13.909> micro<00:01:14.300> USB<00:01:15.130> my<00:01:16.130> end<00:01:16.310> day<00:01:16.520> I<00:01:17.000> think

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
have a micro USB my end day I think

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.950 
have a micro USB my end day I think
that's<00:01:17.299> one<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.570> microphone<00:01:18.049> ports

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
that's one of the microphone ports

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.680 
that's one of the microphone ports

camera see how good it is let's see if

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.950 
camera see how good it is let's see if
we<00:01:35.450> can<00:01:35.600> find<00:01:35.840> it

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
we can find it

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.330

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
think if I had my legend out I wouldn't

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.120 
think if I had my legend out I wouldn't
have<00:02:06.390> taken<00:02:06.509> such<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.810> great<00:02:07.049> photo<00:02:07.290> especially

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
have taken such a great photo especially

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.410 
have taken such a great photo especially
because<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.369> was<00:02:08.399> wiggling<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:09.090> around<00:02:09.149> a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
because I was wiggling it around a

because I was wiggling it around a
little<00:02:09.509> bit<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.640> far<00:02:11.819> with<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.030> camera

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
little bit so so far with the camera

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.370 
little bit so so far with the camera
test<00:02:12.450> doesn't<00:02:12.690> look<00:02:12.780> tragic<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:16.110> if<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.230> take

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
test doesn't look tragic but if you take

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.570 
test doesn't look tragic but if you take
a<00:02:16.410> look<00:02:16.530> at<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.739> graphics<00:02:17.160> let's<00:02:17.310> just<00:02:17.459> pump

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
a look at the graphics let's just pump

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:28.230 
a look at the graphics let's just pump
it<00:02:17.670> back<00:02:17.730> into<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.120> dark

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.089 

the<00:02:29.240> graphics<00:02:29.630> aren't<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:31.580> great

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
the graphics aren't that great

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:46.289

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
you can see the touchscreen you need to

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.849 
you can see the touchscreen you need to
be<00:02:47.980> quite<00:02:48.670> firm<00:02:48.999> and<00:02:49.030> deliberate<00:02:49.620> with<00:02:50.620> your

so<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.120> definitely<00:03:20.390> didn't<00:03:20.690> work<00:03:20.780> out<00:03:20.959> as<00:03:21.260> it

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300
