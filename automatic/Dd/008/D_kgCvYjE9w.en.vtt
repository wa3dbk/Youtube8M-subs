 you work with people like that professional 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.400
 The truth is that what else can you 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.410
 ask 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.900

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.670
 followed the head with the script or some 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.010
 moment a little more tension some 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.260
 gossip of roda not the truth that has 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.230
 been incredible is more we have made a 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.730
 telenovela after what we are 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.160

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.230
 also that we have played with the roll 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.250

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.930
 truth is that it was an ambitious project 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.840
