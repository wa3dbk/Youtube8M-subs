00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.260
 The underground Kurumagoto buildings are integrated 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.940
 Is it to say 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.940
 I think that the benefits are very high 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:26.060
 First from the top of the road 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:32.989
 Usually on the stairs 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:36.579
 For example, there is an entrance at 3 meters with a meter and then through the room on the second floor 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.950
 I think it is common to go to the third floor in three times 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.160
 But what we think is 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:47.329
 Create a door at the same height as the road 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.500
 There is a garage there, in the back of the basement lid 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:57.760
 I can go back and forth through the inside and still 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.760
 Even if the person on the third floor and go to the first floor, not to go outside 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:05.000
 I think that it is important to say that trains are connected 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.409
 If it was normal by that 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.190
 Put your car in the garage 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:15.620
 Then go outside 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.200
 I think it's tough to think that there are cases where you can carry the luggage and shake it while getting wet in the rain 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.299
 is not it 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.810
 However , if it is in the form I just mentioned, the entrance is at the bottom, so of course 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:31.600
 It is to put the elevator by the case or use the stairs in 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.780
 If there is an a beta, well, for example , will it be 10 years or 20 years from now even if it is not attached now ? 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.369
 I do not know 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:42.070
 I do not know the hall near soon, such a space that also put the beta at such time 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.330
 I think that it is important to secure from the beginning properly 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.870
 Yes even if not usually used 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.100
 I used it as a storeroom until the elevator came 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.300
 To get 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.350
 I think there is something to do 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.820
 Such a device 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.650
 How to make 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.850
 1 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.850
 If you are planning 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.810
 I think that there is something in the basement that's generally better than the upper ones 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:18.090
 Just 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:22.600
 Considering the case of building a building on top of the work to make it work 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.060
 You'll know if you do it the same or easy to reverse 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.610
 That's good 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.530
 Eh 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:34.319
 Construction work was generally competed by the construction company and civil engineering company 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.530
 For that purpose 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.460
 It also costs money to get empathy 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.670
 At that time 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:48.209
 I 'm mad at what the creation is 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:55.560
 Is not quite dig the land in order to make the time it's fee drama that made the trouble retaining wall 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:56.760
 The soil that I dug in is a specification that I have to flatten the inside out I say backfilling and say that the soil is out again 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.660
 Or from 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.270
 I mean Tsu do to be filled with a certain house there is a wind instructors we 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.110
 That 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.860
 The Tsu city that I took 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.980
 Really you I do not want to fill 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.450
 Sometimes referred to sell the car to the room 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.599
 It remained fairly or can such seats can be or their own room 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.360
 However, in the case of construction work, it is natural 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:28.070
 If you dig it will fill the soil and make a lot 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:34.010
 When it came to be able to build a good thing in the place where it was finished 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:38.310
 It is the case that dug to great pains 3 meter than four meters the sea 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:42.840
 It is very expensive for him to have to return that soil 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:47.819
 I think there is a big difference The land called Yokohama is pretty 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.569
 Because there is a difference in height, it's not just creating it in vain 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:56.500
 And the building 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:58.650
 It is better to make the underground part as a united building, and I think the benefits are very high 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.750
 By all means 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:06.380
 First of all 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:08.800
 I think it would be nice if you could consider an integrated building as a building before doing construction work 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.800
 I will
