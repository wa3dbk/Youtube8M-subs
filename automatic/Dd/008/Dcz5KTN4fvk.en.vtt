00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
so in game this is what it actually

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.880 
so in game this is what it actually
looks<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.210> I'm<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.690> white<00:00:48.960> out<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.440> snowing

that's<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.370> make<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.640> fitting<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.180> it

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
that's to kind of make it fitting and it

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.600 
that's to kind of make it fitting and it
still<00:00:52.170> sounds<00:00:52.649> exactly<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> same<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:53.430> Riley

enemy<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.830> exactly<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> same<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.880> only

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
enemy it's exactly the same the only

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.420 
enemy it's exactly the same the only
thing<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.750> now<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.229> looks<00:01:10.530> more<00:01:10.770> cool<00:01:10.979> so

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
thing is that now it looks more cool so

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.620 
thing is that now it looks more cool so
hopefully<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.060> video<00:01:12.180> will<00:01:12.390> help<00:01:12.510> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
hopefully this video will help you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.300 
hopefully this video will help you
decide<00:01:12.990> whether<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.350> want<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> buy<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.890> or<00:01:14.130> not

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
decide whether you want to buy it or not

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.160 
decide whether you want to buy it or not
if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.850> don't<00:01:14.970> usually<00:01:15.240> run<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.750> guard<00:01:15.960> dog

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
if you don't usually run the guard dog

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.450 
if you don't usually run the guard dog
then<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.350> probably<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.920> bit<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.220> waste<00:01:17.369> of

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
then it's probably a bit of a waste of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
then it's probably a bit of a waste of
money<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.330> actually<00:01:18.689> run

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
money for you but if you actually run

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.929 
money for you but if you actually run
the<00:01:19.439> guard<00:01:19.619> dog<00:01:19.830> quite<00:01:20.040> often<00:01:20.220> I'll<00:01:20.759> probably

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the guard dog quite often I'll probably

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.460 
the guard dog quite often I'll probably
recommend<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.450> cuz<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.689> freshens<00:01:22.049> things<00:01:22.290> up

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
recommend it cuz it freshens things up

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
recommend it cuz it freshens things up
and<00:01:22.619> makes<00:01:22.799> things<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.159> bit<00:01:23.189> new<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.729> there's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and makes things a bit new and there's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.910 
and makes things a bit new and there's
something<00:01:24.600> more<00:01:24.840> interesting<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.439> use<00:01:25.710> you

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
something more interesting to use you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.950 
something more interesting to use you
know<00:01:26.070> why<00:01:26.310> not<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.119> really<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.780> this

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
know why not but I really like this

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.210 
know why not but I really like this
because<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.200> opens<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> door<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.100> then

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
because it opens the door so then

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.950 
because it opens the door so then
