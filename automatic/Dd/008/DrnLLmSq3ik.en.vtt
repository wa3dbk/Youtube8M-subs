00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
we're just monsters 5.9 liter I've got a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.299 
we're just monsters 5.9 liter I've got a
list<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> saber<00:00:58.739> I'm<00:00:58.890> pretty<00:00:59.070> sure<00:00:59.219> it's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
list on the saber I'm pretty sure it's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.020 
list on the saber I'm pretty sure it's
5.9<00:00:59.969> liter<00:01:00.860> now<00:01:01.860> if<00:01:01.980> those<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> lift<00:01:02.820> kit

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
5.9 liter now if those have the lift kit

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.810 
5.9 liter now if those have the lift kit
on<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.269> as<00:01:03.390> well<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.659> you<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.839> see<00:01:04.580> which<00:01:05.580> gives

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
on it as well as you can see which gives

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.570 
on it as well as you can see which gives
this<00:01:06.000> truck<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.690> really<00:01:07.110> nice<00:01:07.290> stance<00:01:10.190> and<00:01:11.190> I

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
this truck a really nice stance and I

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.310 
this truck a really nice stance and I
think<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> only<00:01:12.149> reason<00:01:12.390> why<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.690> truck<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
think the only reason why this truck is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.730 
think the only reason why this truck is
still<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.600> because<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:16.259> beautiful

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
still here is because that beautiful

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.560 
still here is because that beautiful
engine<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.460> does<00:01:17.670> consume<00:01:18.030> some<00:01:18.240> fuel<00:01:18.479> I

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
engine really does consume some fuel I

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.840 
engine really does consume some fuel I
think<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.110> rated<00:01:19.470> 18<00:01:19.830> miles<00:01:20.100> per<00:01:20.250> gallon<00:01:20.759> on

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
think it is rated 18 miles per gallon on

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.840 
think it is rated 18 miles per gallon on
the<00:01:20.970> highway<00:01:22.130> but<00:01:23.130> along<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.520> fuel

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the highway but along with that fuel

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.580 
the highway but along with that fuel
consumption<00:01:24.390> gives<00:01:24.539> you<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.690> 7,000<00:01:25.409> pound

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
consumption gives you a 7,000 pound

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.609 
consumption gives you a 7,000 pound
towing<00:01:25.830> capacity<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.500> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
towing capacity and you can see that it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.760 
towing capacity and you can see that it
has<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:29.810> towing<00:01:30.810> package<00:01:30.990> right<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> back

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
has the towing package right on the back

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.410 
has the towing package right on the back
there<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.990> does<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.409> bed<00:01:35.179> oops

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
