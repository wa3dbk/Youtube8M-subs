00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
what will make this possible is a

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.510 
what will make this possible is a
complex<00:00:55.060> set<00:00:55.600> of<00:00:55.840> systems<00:00:56.410> inside<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.220> robot

all<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.480> motors<00:00:58.840> for<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.649> hand<00:00:59.860> are<00:00:59.980> actually

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
all the motors for the hand are actually

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.170 
all the motors for the hand are actually
back<00:01:00.820> here<00:01:00.850> in<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.300> forearm<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:03.180> they

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
back here in the forearm and they

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.940 
back here in the forearm and they
actually<00:01:04.540> pull<00:01:04.720> and<00:01:04.869> push<00:01:05.079> on<00:01:05.229> content<00:01:05.799> ins

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
actually pull and push on content ins

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.410 
actually pull and push on content ins
and<00:01:06.189> tight<00:01:06.369> mystically<00:01:06.790> to<00:01:06.939> be<00:01:07.030> able<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.210> move

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
and tight mystically to be able to move

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.569 
and tight mystically to be able to move
each<00:01:07.960> of<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.170> finger<00:01:08.409> joint<00:01:08.649> Wow<00:01:08.979> so<00:01:09.369> that's

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
each of the finger joint Wow so that's

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:10.830 
each of the finger joint Wow so that's
how<00:01:09.729> this<00:01:09.999> motion<00:01:10.329> is<00:01:10.420> actually<00:01:10.509> being

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
how this motion is actually being

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.109 
how this motion is actually being
created<00:01:11.259> so<00:01:11.499> that<00:01:11.829> works<00:01:12.069> basically<00:01:12.639> just

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
created so that works basically just

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.819 
created so that works basically just
like<00:01:13.329> the<00:01:13.479> muscle<00:01:13.780> systems<00:01:14.079> above<00:01:14.350> it's<00:01:14.590> been

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
like the muscle systems above it's been

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.429 
like the muscle systems above it's been
yeah<00:01:15.039> it's<00:01:15.340> very<00:01:15.579> similar<00:01:15.819> yeah<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:17.139> we've

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
yeah it's very similar yeah and we've

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.050 
yeah it's very similar yeah and we've
got<00:01:17.469> four<00:01:18.130> sensors<00:01:18.460> also<00:01:18.759> on<00:01:18.819> all<00:01:18.939> those

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
got four sensors also on all those

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.489 
got four sensors also on all those
tenants<00:01:19.329> so<00:01:19.450> they<00:01:19.539> can<00:01:19.659> detect<00:01:19.899> how<00:01:20.350> much

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
tenants so they can detect how much

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:22.260 
tenants so they can detect how much
force<00:01:20.799> were<00:01:20.950> pulling<00:01:21.700> on<00:01:21.789> with<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:21.969> fingers

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
force were pulling on with the fingers

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.239 
force were pulling on with the fingers
we<00:01:22.420> could<00:01:22.539> control<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.929> grip<00:01:23.109> strength<00:01:23.259> here

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:24.249 
we could control the grip strength here

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:27.749 
we could control the grip strength here

eventually going to give I feel like if

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.400 
eventually going to give I feel like if
I<00:03:27.579> jumped<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.420> would<00:03:28.660> leap<00:03:29.049> out<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.230> this

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
I jumped I would leap out of this

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.199 
I jumped I would leap out of this
building<00:03:29.799> right<00:03:29.950> now<00:03:30.130> it's<00:03:30.790> an<00:03:30.850> incredible

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
building right now it's an incredible

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.270 
building right now it's an incredible
feeling<00:03:31.390> yeah<00:03:31.900> when<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.410> motors<00:03:32.680> are<00:03:32.920> powered

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
feeling yeah when the motors are powered

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.190 
feeling yeah when the motors are powered
when<00:03:33.430> they<00:03:33.549> are<00:03:33.670> turned<00:03:33.910> on<00:03:34.120> it

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
when they are turned on it

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.810 
when they are turned on it
augmented<00:03:35.860> our<00:03:35.950> strength<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.549> augments

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
augmented our strength and it augments

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.120 
augmented our strength and it augments
their<00:03:37.150> ability<00:03:37.600> so<00:03:38.049> right<00:03:38.709> now<00:03:38.860> there<00:03:39.040> are

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
their ability so right now there are

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.650 
their ability so right now there are
four<00:03:39.370> degrees<00:03:39.549> of<00:03:39.730> freedom<00:03:40.150> four<00:03:40.390> active

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
degrees of freedom at the hips and the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.740 
degrees of freedom at the hips and the
knees<00:03:41.980> so<00:03:42.579> that<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:42.820> can<00:03:42.940> feel<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.180> gear<00:03:43.570> in

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
knees so that you can feel that gear in

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.140 
knees so that you can feel that gear in
here<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.260> your<00:03:45.190> other<00:03:45.340> degrees<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.790> freedom

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
here and your other degrees of freedom

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.229 
here and your other degrees of freedom
right<00:03:48.150> what<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.049> all<00:03:49.200> this<00:03:49.319> stuff<00:03:49.939> so<00:03:50.939> what<00:03:51.090> you

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
right what is all this stuff so what you

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.780 
right what is all this stuff so what you
have<00:03:51.420> here<00:03:51.659> in<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> backpack<00:03:52.290> is<00:03:52.500> your<00:03:53.459> main

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
have here in the backpack is your main

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.699 
have here in the backpack is your main
brain<00:03:54.060> stem<00:03:54.299> computer<00:03:54.780> okay<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:55.409> if<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.560> think

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
brain stem computer okay so if you think

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.710 
brain stem computer okay so if you think
about<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.099> you<00:03:56.159> have<00:03:56.310> one<00:03:56.340> main<00:03:56.700> computer<00:03:57.209> that

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
about it you have one main computer that

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.119 
about it you have one main computer that
then<00:03:57.989> does<00:03:58.260> distributing<00:03:58.950> computing

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
then does distributing computing

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.429 
then does distributing computing
throughout<00:03:59.970> each<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.480> joints<00:04:00.900> well<00:04:01.349> you

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
throughout each of the joints well you

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.670 
throughout each of the joints well you
could<00:04:01.590> imagine<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:02.150> replacing<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.450> need<00:04:03.599> for

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
could imagine it replacing the need for

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.289 
could imagine it replacing the need for
forklifts<00:04:04.680> or<00:04:04.860> you<00:04:05.370> know<00:04:05.459> just<00:04:05.700> doing<00:04:05.849> sort<00:04:06.209> of

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
forklifts or you know just doing sort of

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.119 
forklifts or you know just doing sort of
mundane<00:04:06.510> tasks<00:04:07.349> where<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.560> could<00:04:07.739> lift<00:04:07.920> and

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
mundane tasks where you could lift and

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.619 
mundane tasks where you could lift and
move<00:04:08.310> things<00:04:08.519> than<00:04:08.790> normal<00:04:09.030> humans<00:04:09.329> could<00:04:09.540> be

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
move things than normal humans could be

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.600 
move things than normal humans could be
you<00:04:10.110> know<00:04:10.140> people<00:04:10.530> talk<00:04:10.799> about<00:04:10.860> this<00:04:11.310> is<00:04:11.519> the

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
you know people talk about this is the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.449 
you know people talk about this is the
decade<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.090> exoskeleton<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:13.250> it's<00:04:14.250> just

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
decade of the exoskeleton and it's just

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.979 
decade of the exoskeleton and it's just
gonna<00:04:14.549> get<00:04:14.760> lighter<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.209> smaller<00:04:15.329> from<00:04:15.750> here

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
gonna get lighter and smaller from here

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:16.610 
gonna get lighter and smaller from here
Wow

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
Wow

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.620 
Wow
so<00:04:16.949> you're<00:04:17.669> saying<00:04:17.880> this<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.150> decade<00:04:18.539> of

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
so you're saying this is the decade of

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.969 
so you're saying this is the decade of
the<00:04:18.660> exoskeleton<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.470> by<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.650> end<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.889> this

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
the exoskeleton so by the end of this

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:20.870 
the exoskeleton so by the end of this
decade

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
decade

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.370 
decade
I'm<00:04:21.090> gonna<00:04:21.269> have<00:04:21.479> one<00:04:21.600> of<00:04:21.630> these<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:22.169> what

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
I'm gonna have one of these is what

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.080 
I'm gonna have one of these is what
you're<00:04:22.500> promising<00:04:22.800> me<00:04:22.860> III<00:04:23.340> think<00:04:23.639> that<00:04:23.910> is

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
you're promising me III think that is

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.159 
you're promising me III think that is
very<00:04:24.150> pop<00:04:25.940> of<00:04:26.940> course<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.479> can<00:04:27.660> see<00:04:27.840> where<00:04:28.050> all

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
very pop of course you can see where all

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.070 
very pop of course you can see where all
this<00:04:28.289> research<00:04:28.650> is<00:04:28.830> headed<00:04:29.160> first<00:04:29.789> NASA<00:04:30.120> then

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
this research is headed first NASA then

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.439 
this research is headed first NASA then
someday<00:04:31.620> who<00:04:32.039> knows<00:04:32.310> maybe<00:04:32.820> we'll<00:04:33.090> all<00:04:33.240> be

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
someday who knows maybe we'll all be

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.710 
someday who knows maybe we'll all be
wearing<00:04:33.690> robotic<00:04:34.380> suits<00:04:34.910> can<00:04:35.910> you<00:04:36.090> say<00:04:36.300> Iron

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
wearing robotic suits can you say Iron

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.990 
wearing robotic suits can you say Iron
Man
