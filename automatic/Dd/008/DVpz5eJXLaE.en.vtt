00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.679
 hello to all elson kids we are in 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:05.840
 plate and extract new complete 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.240
 tutorial of battlefield 3 was of 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.299
 the houses that I dismiss as much 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.360
 control tutorial I told you that 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:17.240
 please you have payments boxes and so on 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.800
 and good I took advantage of that a month ago and 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.960
 medium not very good training on the 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.210
 f-35 There are many people who do not know that 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.160
 will have to have said long ago is 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.570
 that many people ask the son of 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.430
 a 10 that can really be sustained 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.730
 in the air when we accelerate what 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.730
 pass 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.920
 let's go ahead valentine 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.239
 very common 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.059
 but of course people say it slows down and 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.920
 it is a little in the air but the people 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.579
 he does not know exactly how to stay 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.789
 air fully worth 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.940
 Well then the technique that you have to 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.559
 do to stay totally in the 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.190
 air 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.859
 is to leave spectators brakes if 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.989
 it's nonsense that a lot of people do not know 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.820
 that many people are interested in is that 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.110
 we have to leave only the brake 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.640
 maintained I am an example worth here are they 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.030
 the houses that tighter tightened 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.030
 tight 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.240
 mentioning 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.540
 so 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.270
 It 's easy to leave the brake tight 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.270
 we could perfectly 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.920
 shoot down 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.200
 it is totally thank you tight 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.400
 just stable as you see and then 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.600
 to slow down we go down 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.360
 see you here we give the lt 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.950
 which l2 in penance a tight 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.649
 irkut is not up 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.640
 but it will not be like this we can go as a 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.580
 helicopter against the map 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.260
 I recommend always if we use this 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.790
 technique that is very good for 75 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.790
 use the guided missiles 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.510
 because when there is a vehicle 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.200
 when it is not quite stable 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.290
 pointing to a tank at a car by 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.290
 example 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.769
 and good to shoot while you 're very 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.220
 well because for example when you know 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:40.080
 there are many campers here 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.080
 we went up straight 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.560
 shit 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.560
 now 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.590
 the one that is pretty driving from this 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.440
 way 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.180
 lucy 9 palante because it is very difficult 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.180
 correct achievements like a helicopter 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.939
 Well, this technique that I wanted to tell you 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.379
 that a lot of people did not know if you can 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.329
 keep stable what to use as a 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.970
 helicopter I'm just using now the 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.280
 brake rotor ether which 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.450
 we squeeze 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.980
 the rt 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.940
 the palla palante palante palante 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.860
 palante palante 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.160
 and it is already 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.260
 it's very easy to use it this has been the 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.870
 full tutorial that wants to be more 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.560
 clear on the f-35 will know how to drive 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.239
 a hunting exactly 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.959
 that you give him in the description of 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.470
 video and please like us 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.470
 Classroom 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.720
 it also jumps 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.909
 favorites and favorites if you want because 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.480
 it does not help much month I have stayed are the 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.300
 2 am 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.980
 and that this tutorial and many people who 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.269
 Many people ask me that they do not know that 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.660
 I had to know it because there are many 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.910
 people who come playing not tailor 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.400
 technique I do not use it much and I think it's 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.410
 fundamental when capturing a 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.410
 flag or charge the second enemy 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.529
 and if it's really fun what happens in this 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.599
 way we are tight low 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.089
 to keep it totally in a 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.719
 stable and rectal position we are a 

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:40.719
 little tight 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.150
