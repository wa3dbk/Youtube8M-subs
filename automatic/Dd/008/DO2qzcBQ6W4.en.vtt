00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.130
 the one that youtube people like are 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.510
 I hope you are very good the day 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.490
 today I'm going to teach you how to play this 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.139
 roll of the band more that I am well 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.450
 asking quite after the cover that 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.460
 we went up a few days ago then 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.440
 then go for your guitars then for the 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.610
 mine and let's start 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.010
 ok then let's start with this song 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.080
 that is very simple really the most 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.120
 difficult is to learn the order in which 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.650
 the chords go, so we're going with 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.810
 the first part we started in a fa 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.640
 higher 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.290
 although you already know that the forms agreed 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.690
 they are here in the video in some 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.220
 corner in case you do not know them, put him 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.830
 pause and check well where the fingers go 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.360
 but really the popular chords 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.360
 ok then it starts in F major 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.309
 with pieces we go to a C major 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.309
 assistance 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.590
 we go to a minor sun I do not know 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.890
 re minor 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.530
 I do greater than after older silk we 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.659
 let's go a B flat 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.659
 biggest businessman 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.979
 for more 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.270
 fa sharp diminished this really 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.700
 it will be weirder chord than there is in this 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.979
 song is very simple they explained 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.570
 this if we are going to put finger two in the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.660
 medium in the second two of the sixth 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.070
 rope and then the third string the 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.420
 fourth string we're going to step on the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.799
 Fret one with this little finger here 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.799
 for iu 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.549
 and the third string we're going to step on it 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.549
 the fret 2 with the finger 3 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.500
 then you convince friends 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:05.370
 to greater 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.370
 have had decreased are less 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.830
 the same re minor ' 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.830
 be with you 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.010
 and there comes the cordoba 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.050
 then recapitulating is very simple 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.690
 verse him back to play for him 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.690
 Check would be that way against 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.780
 proceed 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.580
 convince 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.640
 I want 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.239
 yes 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.849
 and we go to the choir that is also very 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.090
 simple afterwards since the major let's 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.980
 make this little arrangement in the fifth 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.530
 rope to a being and what is already 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.140
 put third fret of the fifth and 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.799
 then I went in front of the room to 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.799
 go to the minor re 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.530
 the biggest 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.110
 at least 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.819
 higher 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.470
 If I die again 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.959
 higher 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.750
 let's say a new chord 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.600
 at 7 o'clock is very simple it's like a 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.220
 but we remove the middle finger 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.550
 that is the third string has to go 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.550
 in the air 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.310
 and this gives us the way to solve a problem 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.310
 less' 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.739
 and from there it repeats 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.739
 i 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.880
 older and the same people 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.549
 the younger 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.389
 major and then to finalize B flat 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.660
 higher 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.660
 and we repeat if flat you are older 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.530
 ok then here is where is a 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.060
 little bit more tangled to the chords and 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.770
 I suggest you write them down because if there is a 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.570
 little difficult to learn the at least 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.340
 that have very good memory then 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.350
 I'm going to play the choir again 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.350
 to check it will be this way 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.520
 A) Yes 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.520
 nothing more maybe 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.520
 3 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.880
 Yes all 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.880
 dt 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.490
 and repeat 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.030
 here 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.370
 and it repeats exactly what 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.050
 same 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.570
 really they are only two parties in the 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.460
 song then they really are what 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.560
 only they need to touch it the 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.960
 strumming really there is not a strum 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.180
 the song since it's band and there's 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.470
 guitar in this kind of genre but 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.870
 good teaches them the one I'm using 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.090
 but I recommend that you put the 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.580
 song since you learn the chords and 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.169
 you tear the envelope and dell the fill 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.250
 that you need or that you 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.139
 believe that it is correct 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:24.300
 so the one that I use is this way 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:28.120
 2 down and two up towards 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:33.490
 down and then down up 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:38.370
 again 2 down up 2 2 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.370
 down and then down up 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.440
 ok then it really is the trait that I 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.300
 most commonly use when I play this 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.270
 song but you do not just like a 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.280
 guide as I told you to put the track more 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.780
 well above you too so that 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.250
 let go of his right hand a little 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.750
 who check the complete already know them 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.870
 I come here the cover we made 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.400
 a few days and then it would be all ok because that 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.350
 it's all because of the tutorial today you know 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.030
 give him a video if it served them and for 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.710
 know it to all the friends that touch the 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.760
 guitar and like this kind of waves 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.770
 and there are all social networks 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.840
 so that they follow us everywhere until 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.790
 facebook to twitter and even gout the 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.979
 I'm not going to say anything about bowling 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.380
 because if we are not going to close the channel and 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:30.740
 nobody wants that but use it could 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.910
 use everyone uses it ok 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.410
 see you next bye 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.410
 it rains from the sky 

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.940
 today I want because I want you to love me 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.770
 because like you there is no one more beautiful 

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.770
 in this land that makes me dream
