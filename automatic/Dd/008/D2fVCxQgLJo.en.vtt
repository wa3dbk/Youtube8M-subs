character<00:00:12.960> modeling<00:00:13.349> part<00:00:13.860> 6<00:00:14.309> I'm<00:00:14.730> Matthew

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
character modeling part 6 I'm Matthew

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.779 
character modeling part 6 I'm Matthew
Doyle<00:00:15.480> we're<00:00:16.230> almost<00:00:16.379> finished<00:00:16.890> here<00:00:17.100> but<00:00:17.609> we

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
Doyle we're almost finished here but we

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.120 
Doyle we're almost finished here but we
need<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.000> first<00:00:18.240> combine<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.990> head<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
need to first combine the head to the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.099 
need to first combine the head to the
torso<00:00:20.400> before<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.150> move<00:00:21.300> further<00:00:21.660> so

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
torso before we can move further so

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.320 
torso before we can move further so
we've<00:00:22.230> used<00:00:22.380> mesh<00:00:22.740> combined<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.310> do<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.640> now

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
we've used mesh combined to do that now

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.210 
we've used mesh combined to do that now
we<00:00:24.390> just<00:00:24.630> need<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.960> connect<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> polygons<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
we just need to connect the polygons and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.950 
we just need to connect the polygons and
get<00:00:26.310> rid<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.550> gap<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.300> problem<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.750> there

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
get rid of the gap the problem is there

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140 
get rid of the gap the problem is there
are<00:00:28.080> more<00:00:28.260> polygons<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> face<00:00:29.369> than<00:00:30.000> there

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
are more polygons on the face than there

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.870 
are more polygons on the face than there
are<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.599> neck<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.619> torso<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.730> we'll

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
are on the neck of the torso so we'll

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.979 
are on the neck of the torso so we'll
have<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.120> do<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> little<00:00:33.480> bit<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.750> tweaking

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
have to do a little bit of tweaking

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.950 
have to do a little bit of tweaking
there<00:00:34.550> but<00:00:35.550> before<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.120> do<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.809> need

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
there but before we can do that we need

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.110 
there but before we can do that we need
to<00:00:37.020> actually<00:00:37.200> fill<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.620> gap<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:38.910> that

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
to actually fill this gap to do that

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.660 
to actually fill this gap to do that
we'll<00:00:39.840> use<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> append<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.860> polygon<00:00:41.280> tool

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
we'll use the append to polygon tool

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.850 
we'll use the append to polygon tool
you'll<00:00:42.570> find<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.960> tool<00:00:43.170> right<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> top

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you'll find that tool right at the top

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.029 
you'll find that tool right at the top
of<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.340> mesh<00:00:44.550> tools<00:00:44.910> menu<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:46.320> using<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.739> pin<00:00:46.950> to

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
of the mesh tools menu so using a pin to

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.010 
of the mesh tools menu so using a pin to
polygon<00:00:47.430> tool<00:00:47.610> first<00:00:48.030> we're<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.570> click

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
polygon tool first we're going to click

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.979 
polygon tool first we're going to click
on<00:00:49.250> one<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> edges<00:00:50.640> around<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.539> neck<00:00:51.750> or

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
on one of the edges around the neck or

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.100 
on one of the edges around the neck or
the<00:00:52.230> head<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:53.039> begin<00:00:53.129> using<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> tool<00:00:54.110> we'll

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the head to begin using the tool we'll

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.010 
the head to begin using the tool we'll
start<00:00:55.410> by<00:00:55.590> clicking<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.820> neck<00:00:57.360> edge<00:00:57.629> here

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
start by clicking on the neck edge here

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.889 
start by clicking on the neck edge here
and<00:00:58.140> then<00:00:58.590> click<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.579> head<00:01:00.120> edge<00:01:00.359> above<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and then click on the head edge above it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.170 
and then click on the head edge above it
and<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.469> will<00:01:01.620> complete<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.250> polygon<00:01:02.940> tool

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and that will complete the polygon tool

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.170 
and that will complete the polygon tool
now<00:01:04.049> we'll<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.470> go<00:01:04.710> around<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.339> neck<00:01:05.549> doing

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
now we'll just go around the neck doing

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.789 
now we'll just go around the neck doing
the<00:01:06.360> same<00:01:06.570> thing<00:01:06.810> connecting<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> edges

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the same thing connecting the edges

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.980 
the same thing connecting the edges
where<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.369> clicking<00:01:09.240> first<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> neck

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
where we can clicking first on the neck

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.469 
where we can clicking first on the neck
edge<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> head<00:01:11.520> edge<00:01:11.700> or<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
edge and then on the head edge or in the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.030 
edge and then on the head edge or in the
reverse<00:01:12.750> order<00:01:12.960> would<00:01:13.290> work<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:13.650> well

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
reverse order would work as well

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.920 
reverse order would work as well
I'm<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.030> both<00:01:15.240> sides<00:01:15.299> here

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
I'm going to do it on both sides here

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.749 
I'm going to do it on both sides here
since<00:01:16.170> we're<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.500> using<00:01:16.860> symmetry<00:01:17.340> at<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
since we're not using symmetry at the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.260 
since we're not using symmetry at the
time<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.880> we're<00:01:21.030> starting

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
time and you can see that we're starting

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.810 
time and you can see that we're starting
to<00:01:21.420> connect<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> head<00:01:22.200> here<00:01:22.580> but<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.790> are

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
to connect the head here but we are

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.310 
to connect the head here but we are
going<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.330> obviously<00:01:24.780> run<00:01:24.960> into<00:01:25.170> some

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
going to obviously run into some

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.350 
going to obviously run into some
problems<00:01:25.680> as<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.920> said<00:01:26.189> there<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.580> more<00:01:26.850> edges

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
problems as I said there are more edges

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.660 
problems as I said there are more edges
on<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.900> head<00:01:28.140> there<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:28.979> more<00:01:29.250> subdivisions

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
on the head there are more subdivisions

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.590 
on the head there are more subdivisions
than<00:01:30.570> there<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.500> neck<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.479> before<00:01:33.479> we

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
than there are on the neck so before we

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.969 
than there are on the neck so before we
finish<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> back<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.799> neck

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
finish up with the back of the neck

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.550 
finish up with the back of the neck
let's<00:01:35.490> begin<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.000> connect<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.659> jawline<00:01:37.229> to

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
let's begin to connect the jawline to

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.039 
let's begin to connect the jawline to
the<00:01:38.130> neck<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.780> we're<00:01:39.960> going

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the neck here and to do that we're going

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.350 
the neck here and to do that we're going
to<00:01:40.110> start<00:01:40.530> off<00:01:40.680> with<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.100> merge<00:01:41.460> vertex<00:01:42.000> tool

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
to start off with the merge vertex tool

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.969 
to start off with the merge vertex tool
and<00:01:42.630> we're<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.140> gonna<00:01:43.259> start<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.649> merge

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
and we're just gonna start to merge

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.830 
and we're just gonna start to merge
these<00:01:44.310> verts<00:01:44.579> together<00:01:44.939> you've<00:01:45.360> already<00:01:45.509> seen

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
these verts together you've already seen

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.719 
these verts together you've already seen
how<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.049> tool<00:01:46.409> works<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.040> simply<00:01:47.369> click<00:01:47.579> on

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
how that tool works you simply click on

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:58.719 
how that tool works you simply click on
the<00:01:47.880> first<00:01:48.060> vertex<00:01:53.750> vertices<00:01:55.130> on<00:01:56.130> both<00:01:56.399> sides

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
the first vertex vertices on both sides

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.889 
the first vertex vertices on both sides
obviously<00:01:59.729> we<00:01:59.850> have<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> triangle<00:02:00.329> gap<00:02:00.630> there

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
obviously we have a triangle gap there

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.200 
obviously we have a triangle gap there
that<00:02:00.930> we're<00:02:01.140> gonna<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> deal<00:02:01.710> with<00:02:02.210> now

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
that we're gonna have to deal with now

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.300 
that we're gonna have to deal with now
we're<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.170> fill<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.829> hole<00:02:05.100> in

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
we're going to have to fill this hole in

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.910 
we're going to have to fill this hole in
here<00:02:05.700> underneath<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.869> chin<00:02:07.140> once<00:02:07.680> again

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
here underneath the chin once again

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.559 
here underneath the chin once again
we'll<00:02:08.039> go<00:02:08.160> into<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> append<00:02:08.819> polygon<00:02:09.000> tool

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
we'll go into the append polygon tool

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.680 
we'll go into the append polygon tool
and<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.800> begin<00:02:11.099> creating<00:02:11.700> polygons<00:02:12.270> here<00:02:12.540> by

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
and just begin creating polygons here by

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.550 
and just begin creating polygons here by
clicking<00:02:13.080> first

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
clicking first

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.220 
clicking first
on<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.920> edge<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.150> chin<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.660> down<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
on the edge of the chin and down to the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.250 
on the edge of the chin and down to the
neck<00:02:17.150> alright<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.300> we'll<00:02:18.450> finish<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.900> chin<00:02:19.110> up

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
neck alright so we'll finish the chin up

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.600 
neck alright so we'll finish the chin up
in<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.500> little<00:02:19.680> bit<00:02:19.800> but<00:02:19.980> let's<00:02:20.130> jump<00:02:20.310> back<00:02:20.490> to

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
in a little bit but let's jump back to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.550 
in a little bit but let's jump back to
the<00:02:20.910> back<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.390> neck<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.900> continue<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.410> use

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
the back of the neck and continue to use

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.260 
the back of the neck and continue to use
the<00:02:22.680> append<00:02:22.980> polygon<00:02:23.190> tool<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.730> fill<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
the append polygon tool to fill in the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.510 
the append polygon tool to fill in the
holes<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.860> don't<00:02:26.040> worry<00:02:26.220> I'm<00:02:26.340> going<00:02:26.459> to

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
holes there and don't worry I'm going to

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.309 
holes there and don't worry I'm going to
show<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.790> shortly<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.300> little<00:02:27.569> trick<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:28.050> solve

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
show you shortly a little trick to solve

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.870 
show you shortly a little trick to solve
the<00:02:28.530> fact<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:28.950> we<00:02:29.160> have<00:02:29.280> more<00:02:29.430> subdivisions

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
the fact that we have more subdivisions

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.710 
the fact that we have more subdivisions
on<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.959> head<00:02:31.170> than<00:02:31.830> we<00:02:32.010> do<00:02:32.220> on<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.970> neck<00:02:33.180> but

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
on the head than we do on the neck but

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.300 
on the head than we do on the neck but
for<00:02:33.870> now<00:02:33.989> let's<00:02:34.319> just<00:02:34.590> fill<00:02:34.800> them<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.130> best

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
for now let's just fill them in the best

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.400 
for now let's just fill them in the best
we<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.670> leaving<00:02:36.270> these<00:02:36.480> triangle<00:02:36.959> holes<00:02:37.140> for

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
we can leaving these triangle holes for

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.040 
we can leaving these triangle holes for
later<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.610> continuing<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.270> use<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.660> append<00:02:39.900> to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
later so continuing to use the append to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.979 
later so continuing to use the append to
polygon<00:02:40.440> tool<00:02:40.709> here<00:02:41.239> doing<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.450> both<00:02:42.630> sides

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
polygon tool here doing it on both sides

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.580 
polygon tool here doing it on both sides
is<00:02:43.950> not<00:02:44.310> really<00:02:44.580> necessary<00:02:45.060> at<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:45.300> point

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
is not really necessary at this point

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.680 
is not really necessary at this point
because<00:02:46.590> we<00:02:46.709> could<00:02:46.860> always<00:02:47.040> cut<00:02:47.640> one<00:02:48.269> side<00:02:48.510> of

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
because we could always cut one side of

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.050 
because we could always cut one side of
the<00:02:48.780> mesh<00:02:48.959> off<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.590> then<00:02:50.250> mirror<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.030> other

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
the mesh off and then mirror the other

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.570 
the mesh off and then mirror the other
side<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:52.350> I'm<00:02:52.560> gonna<00:02:52.680> go<00:02:52.860> ahead<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.100> just

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
side but I'm gonna go ahead and just

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.729 
side but I'm gonna go ahead and just
continue<00:02:54.030> around<00:02:54.360> just<00:02:55.320> for<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.530> sake<00:02:55.709> of

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
continue around just for the sake of

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.360 
continue around just for the sake of
completeness<00:02:56.280> filling<00:02:57.060> in<00:02:57.180> these<00:02:57.360> holes

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
completeness filling in these holes

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.050 
completeness filling in these holes
almost<00:02:59.370> done<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:02.160> good<00:03:02.310> thing<00:03:02.489> is<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:02.850> both

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
almost done the good thing is is both

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.580 
almost done the good thing is is both
sides<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.600> mesh<00:03:03.750> have<00:03:04.019> an<00:03:04.170> equal<00:03:04.560> number

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
sides of the mesh have an equal number

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.009 
sides of the mesh have an equal number
of<00:03:04.980> subdivisions<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:06.510> we<00:03:06.630> can<00:03:06.780> use<00:03:06.989> that

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
of subdivisions and we can use that

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.830 
of subdivisions and we can use that
equalness<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.950> our<00:03:08.100> advantage<00:03:08.430> here<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.690> let's

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
equalness to our advantage here so let's

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.370 
equalness to our advantage here so let's
go<00:03:09.959> ahead<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.200> select<00:03:10.380> these<00:03:10.709> edges<00:03:11.130> here<00:03:11.160> in

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
go ahead and select these edges here in

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.809 
go ahead and select these edges here in
this<00:03:13.380> hole<00:03:13.620> at<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.830> center<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.370> neck<00:03:14.550> and

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
this hole at the center of the neck and

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.090 
this hole at the center of the neck and
we'll<00:03:15.150> just<00:03:15.300> use<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.750> fill<00:03:16.110> hole<00:03:16.500> tool<00:03:16.800> to

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
we'll just use the fill hole tool to

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.039 
we'll just use the fill hole tool to
fill<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.760> we'll<00:03:18.420> do<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.630> same<00:03:18.660> thing

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
fill that in and we'll do the same thing

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.680 
fill that in and we'll do the same thing
for<00:03:19.230> these<00:03:19.380> triangles<00:03:19.860> here<00:03:20.390> just<00:03:21.390> go<00:03:21.480> ahead

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
for these triangles here just go ahead

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.630 
for these triangles here just go ahead
and<00:03:21.840> select<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.290> edges<00:03:22.590> holding<00:03:23.160> down<00:03:23.280> shift

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
and select the edges holding down shift

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.770 
and select the edges holding down shift
and<00:03:24.110> once<00:03:25.110> again<00:03:25.350> use<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.829> fill<00:03:26.040> hole<00:03:26.280> tool<00:03:26.780> to

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
and once again use the fill hole tool to

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.550 
and once again use the fill hole tool to
fill<00:03:27.989> that<00:03:28.110> in<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.610> just<00:03:29.610> repeat<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.120> process

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
fill that in and just repeat the process

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.810 
fill that in and just repeat the process
until<00:03:31.560> we've<00:03:31.709> got<00:03:31.860> all<00:03:32.070> of<00:03:32.100> these<00:03:32.250> empty

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
until we've got all of these empty

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.880 
until we've got all of these empty
triangle<00:03:33.120> holes<00:03:33.450> filled<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:35.840> all<00:03:36.840> right<00:03:37.049> next

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
triangle holes filled in all right next

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.479 
triangle holes filled in all right next
one<00:03:39.290> almost<00:03:40.290> finished<00:03:40.650> here

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:52.190 

and<00:03:44.700> one<00:03:45.569> more<00:03:45.780> here<00:03:50.120> once<00:03:51.120> again<00:03:51.420> fill<00:03:51.959> hole

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
and one more here once again fill hole

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.929 
and one more here once again fill hole
now<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.010> notice<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.489> didn't<00:03:53.670> go<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.819> the

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
now you notice that I didn't go to the

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.509 
now you notice that I didn't go to the
menu<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.420> actually<00:03:54.870> just<00:03:55.319> used<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.769> G<00:03:56.010> key<00:03:56.219> to

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
menu I actually just used the G key to

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.300 
menu I actually just used the G key to
repeat<00:03:56.849> the<00:03:57.000> command<00:03:57.829> so<00:03:58.829> it's<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.010> bit<00:03:59.159> of<00:03:59.250> a

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
repeat the command so it's a bit of a

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.729 
repeat the command so it's a bit of a
shortcut<00:03:59.790> you<00:04:00.750> don't<00:04:00.930> always<00:04:01.200> have<00:04:01.439> to<00:04:01.500> go<00:04:01.620> to

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
shortcut you don't always have to go to

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.379 
shortcut you don't always have to go to
the<00:04:01.859> menu<00:04:02.159> you<00:04:02.310> can<00:04:02.430> always<00:04:02.639> just<00:04:02.909> hit<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.180> G

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
the menu you can always just hit the G

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.649 
the menu you can always just hit the G
key<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:03.750> repeat<00:04:04.049> the<00:04:04.260> last<00:04:04.439> command<00:04:05.510> so<00:04:06.510> here

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
key to repeat the last command so here

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.420 
key to repeat the last command so here
I'm<00:04:06.780> just<00:04:06.810> basically<00:04:07.530> repeating<00:04:07.980> fill<00:04:08.189> hole

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
I'm just basically repeating fill hole

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.449 
I'm just basically repeating fill hole
fill<00:04:08.819> hole<00:04:09.030> every<00:04:09.420> time<00:04:09.659> when<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.620> select<00:04:11.340> the

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
fill hole every time when I select the

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.770 
fill hole every time when I select the
fate<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.879> edges<00:04:12.269> of<00:04:12.420> that<00:04:13.109> hole<00:04:13.349> so<00:04:14.629> now<00:04:15.629> we'll

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
fate the edges of that hole so now we'll

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.300 
fate the edges of that hole so now we'll
jump<00:04:15.959> back<00:04:16.049> underneath<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.709> chin<00:04:16.949> here<00:04:17.190> we

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
jump back underneath the chin here we

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.800 
jump back underneath the chin here we
have<00:04:17.459> one<00:04:17.669> last<00:04:17.820> hole<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.209> needs<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.419> be<00:04:18.539> filled

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
have one last hole it needs to be filled

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.969 
have one last hole it needs to be filled
we'll<00:04:19.079> just<00:04:19.259> go<00:04:19.410> ahead<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.680> do<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.829> same

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
we'll just go ahead and do the same

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:20.629 
we'll just go ahead and do the same
thing<00:04:20.250> here

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
thing here

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.820 
thing here
select<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.419> edges<00:04:21.840> around<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.289> hole<00:04:22.530> and

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
select the edges around the hole and

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.710 
select the edges around the hole and
then<00:04:23.460> use<00:04:23.759> the<00:04:23.970> fill<00:04:24.150> hole<00:04:24.360> tool<00:04:28.130> all<00:04:29.130> right

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
then use the fill hole tool all right

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.850 
then use the fill hole tool all right
and<00:04:30.720> we<00:04:30.930> just<00:04:31.110> need<00:04:31.199> to<00:04:31.289> cut<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.500> centerline

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
and we just need to cut a centerline

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.379 
and we just need to cut a centerline
here<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:32.400> looks<00:04:32.580> like<00:04:32.639> and<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.090> will<00:04:33.180> have

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
here it looks like and it will have

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.950 
here it looks like and it will have
quads<00:04:33.840> on<00:04:34.080> both<00:04:34.229> sides<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:35.430> we'll<00:04:35.550> use<00:04:35.699> the

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
quads on both sides so we'll use the

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.749 
quads on both sides so we'll use the
multi-cut<00:04:36.960> tool<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.380> just<00:04:37.830> click<00:04:38.550> on<00:04:38.729> one

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
multi-cut tool and just click on one

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.810 
multi-cut tool and just click on one
vert<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.630> other<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.930> create<00:04:40.050> our<00:04:40.259> cut<00:04:40.470> and

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
vert and the other to create our cut and

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.189 
vert and the other to create our cut and
there<00:04:41.820> we<00:04:41.910> go<00:04:42.090> we've<00:04:42.270> completed<00:04:42.690> under<00:04:43.080> the

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
there we go we've completed under the

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.120 
there we go we've completed under the
chin<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:44.250> looks<00:04:44.460> like<00:04:44.610> it's<00:04:44.789> all<00:04:44.940> quads

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
chin and it looks like it's all quads

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.210 
chin and it looks like it's all quads
just<00:04:47.130> adjust<00:04:47.550> these<00:04:47.729> verts<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.210> little<00:04:48.449> bit<00:04:48.599> and

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
just adjust these verts a little bit and

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.409 
just adjust these verts a little bit and
it<00:04:50.220> will<00:04:50.340> just<00:04:50.460> make<00:04:50.669> a<00:04:50.699> few<00:04:50.940> tweaks<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.330> the

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
it will just make a few tweaks to the

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.510 
it will just make a few tweaks to the
verts<00:04:51.690> here<00:04:51.990> just<00:04:52.650> manually<00:04:53.039> moving<00:04:53.340> them

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
verts here just manually moving them

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.219 
verts here just manually moving them
around<00:04:53.639> so<00:04:54.150> we<00:04:54.300> get<00:04:54.449> more<00:04:54.659> of<00:04:54.720> an<00:04:54.840> even

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
around so we get more of an even

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.050 
around so we get more of an even
distribution<00:04:55.830> of<00:04:56.520> our<00:04:56.729> verts<00:04:57.000> under<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.720> chin

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
distribution of our verts under the chin

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.129 
distribution of our verts under the chin
so<00:05:00.060> we<00:05:00.150> have<00:05:00.240> our<00:05:00.330> first<00:05:00.510> challenge<00:05:00.960> here

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
so we have our first challenge here

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.659 
so we have our first challenge here
getting<00:05:01.349> rid<00:05:01.470> of<00:05:01.590> this<00:05:01.770> triangle<00:05:02.190> on<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.460> side

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
getting rid of this triangle on the side

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.850 
getting rid of this triangle on the side
of<00:05:02.789> the<00:05:02.880> head<00:05:03.060> or<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.810> neck<00:05:03.840> I'm<00:05:04.620> just<00:05:04.770> gonna

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
of the head or the neck I'm just gonna

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.500 
of the head or the neck I'm just gonna
basically<00:05:05.070> use<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.520> multi<00:05:05.820> cut<00:05:06.030> tool<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.389> do

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
basically use the multi cut tool to do

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.710 
basically use the multi cut tool to do
that

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
that

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.430 
that
first<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.229> all<00:05:07.289> I'm<00:05:07.409> gonna<00:05:07.530> draw<00:05:07.889> a<00:05:08.310> quad<00:05:08.880> a

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
first of all I'm gonna draw a quad a

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.589 
first of all I'm gonna draw a quad a
four-sided<00:05:10.440> polygon<00:05:10.860> here<00:05:11.220> that<00:05:11.940> redirects

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
four-sided polygon here that redirects

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.420 
four-sided polygon here that redirects
the<00:05:12.750> edge<00:05:12.870> flow<00:05:13.199> from<00:05:13.680> the<00:05:13.860> base<00:05:14.039> of<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.280> neck

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
the edge flow from the base of the neck

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.550 
the edge flow from the base of the neck
being<00:05:14.639> horizontal<00:05:14.970> down<00:05:15.750> to<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.139> neck<00:05:16.320> being

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
being horizontal down to the neck being

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.350 
being horizontal down to the neck being
vertical<00:05:17.099> and<00:05:17.310> then<00:05:17.820> we'll<00:05:17.940> delete<00:05:18.150> that

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
vertical and then we'll delete that

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.300 
vertical and then we'll delete that
Center<00:05:18.690> vert<00:05:18.870> using<00:05:19.199> ctrl<00:05:19.650> Delete<00:05:20.009> on<00:05:20.220> the

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
Center vert using ctrl Delete on the

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.969 
Center vert using ctrl Delete on the
keyboard<00:05:20.659> it<00:05:21.659> does<00:05:21.900> create<00:05:22.199> a<00:05:22.259> pole<00:05:22.500> there<00:05:22.770> at

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
keyboard it does create a pole there at

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.620 
keyboard it does create a pole there at
the<00:05:23.099> jaw<00:05:23.310> line<00:05:23.550> where<00:05:23.820> it<00:05:23.909> meets<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.240> back<00:05:24.479> of

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
the jaw line where it meets the back of

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.899 
the jaw line where it meets the back of
the<00:05:24.690> neck<00:05:24.870> but<00:05:25.110> that<00:05:25.259> should<00:05:25.560> be<00:05:25.680> okay<00:05:26.070> now<00:05:26.849> to

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
the neck but that should be okay now to

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.730 
the neck but that should be okay now to
get<00:05:27.180> rid<00:05:27.300> of<00:05:27.330> this<00:05:27.479> five<00:05:27.750> sided<00:05:28.050> polygon<00:05:28.530> I'll

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
get rid of this five sided polygon I'll

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.460 
get rid of this five sided polygon I'll
just<00:05:29.070> draw<00:05:29.430> a<00:05:29.610> new<00:05:29.880> edge<00:05:30.150> ring<00:05:30.780> running<00:05:31.199> all

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
just draw a new edge ring running all

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.719 
just draw a new edge ring running all
the<00:05:31.770> way<00:05:31.889> around<00:05:32.849> the<00:05:33.030> back<00:05:33.180> of<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.479> neck

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
the way around the back of the neck

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.690 
the way around the back of the neck
using<00:05:35.729> the<00:05:35.849> multi<00:05:36.120> cut<00:05:36.300> tool<00:05:37.099> hit<00:05:38.099> Enter<00:05:38.460> to

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
using the multi cut tool hit Enter to

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.550 
using the multi cut tool hit Enter to
complete<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:39.060> tool<00:05:39.270> I'm<00:05:40.050> not<00:05:40.230> gonna<00:05:40.350> worry

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
complete the tool I'm not gonna worry

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.990 
complete the tool I'm not gonna worry
about<00:05:40.590> the<00:05:40.740> other<00:05:40.950> side<00:05:41.220> at<00:05:41.370> this<00:05:41.490> point<00:05:41.760> and

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
about the other side at this point and

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.880 
about the other side at this point and
there<00:05:42.630> we<00:05:42.720> go<00:05:42.870> we've<00:05:43.110> solved<00:05:43.470> that<00:05:43.560> first

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
there we go we've solved that first

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.520 
there we go we've solved that first
triangle<00:05:44.280> problem<00:05:44.790> just<00:05:45.600> massage<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.350> verts

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
triangle problem just massage the verts

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.030 
triangle problem just massage the verts
a<00:05:46.680> little<00:05:46.920> bit<00:05:48.170> so<00:05:49.170> our<00:05:49.260> next<00:05:49.500> challenge

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
a little bit so our next challenge

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.440 
a little bit so our next challenge
once<00:05:50.250> we've<00:05:50.430> positioned<00:05:50.640> these<00:05:51.030> verts<00:05:51.240> into

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
once we've positioned these verts into

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.410 
once we've positioned these verts into
place<00:05:51.660> will<00:05:52.110> be<00:05:52.290> basically<00:05:53.100> to<00:05:53.310> eliminate<00:05:53.730> the

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
place will be basically to eliminate the

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.900 
place will be basically to eliminate the
triangles<00:05:55.290> on<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.470> back<00:05:55.620> of<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:55.860> head<00:05:56.040> the

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
triangles on the back of the head the

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.520 
triangles on the back of the head the
first<00:05:57.090> step<00:05:57.390> is<00:05:57.600> to<00:05:57.750> delete<00:05:57.840> some<00:05:58.320> of<00:05:58.410> those

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
first step is to delete some of those

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.800 
first step is to delete some of those
edges<00:05:58.950> there<00:05:59.190> and<00:05:59.400> we've<00:05:59.880> got<00:05:59.910> now<00:06:00.210> five<00:06:00.510> sided

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
edges there and we've got now five sided

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.280 
edges there and we've got now five sided
polygons<00:06:01.350> and<00:06:01.880> what<00:06:02.880> I'm<00:06:02.970> gonna<00:06:03.060> do<00:06:03.330> is<00:06:03.570> once

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
polygons and what I'm gonna do is once

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.370 
polygons and what I'm gonna do is once
again<00:06:04.380> use<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.770> multi-cut<00:06:05.220> tool<00:06:05.250> to<00:06:06.210> cut<00:06:06.630> some

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
again use the multi-cut tool to cut some

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.030 
again use the multi-cut tool to cut some
new<00:06:07.590> polygons<00:06:08.220> here<00:06:08.580> and<00:06:09.260> this<00:06:10.260> will<00:06:10.470> allow<00:06:10.740> me

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
new polygons here and this will allow me

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.200 
new polygons here and this will allow me
to<00:06:11.760> basically<00:06:12.110> turn<00:06:13.110> the<00:06:13.770> edges<00:06:14.090> from<00:06:15.090> the

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
to basically turn the edges from the

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.170 
to basically turn the edges from the
head<00:06:15.720> in<00:06:15.990> a<00:06:16.770> 90-degree<00:06:17.370> direction<00:06:17.880> you<00:06:18.060> can

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
head in a 90-degree direction you can

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.910 
head in a 90-degree direction you can
see<00:06:18.360> there<00:06:18.570> and<00:06:18.720> then<00:06:19.050> route<00:06:19.320> them<00:06:19.530> right<00:06:19.740> back

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
see there and then route them right back

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.850 
see there and then route them right back
up<00:06:20.160> to<00:06:20.190> the<00:06:20.370> head<00:06:21.080> kind<00:06:22.080> of<00:06:22.140> circumventing<00:06:22.830> the

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
up to the head kind of circumventing the

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.670 
up to the head kind of circumventing the
problem<00:06:23.370> of<00:06:23.520> not<00:06:23.700> having<00:06:23.760> enough

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
problem of not having enough

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.940 
problem of not having enough
subdivisions<00:06:25.680> on<00:06:25.890> the<00:06:26.040> neck<00:06:27.470> all<00:06:28.470> while

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
subdivisions on the neck all while

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.170 
subdivisions on the neck all while
maintaining<00:06:29.460> all<00:06:30.090> four-sided<00:06:30.900> polygons<00:06:32.180> so

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
maintaining all four-sided polygons so

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.310 
maintaining all four-sided polygons so
we<00:06:33.240> can<00:06:33.360> see<00:06:33.450> that<00:06:33.570> we're<00:06:33.720> basically<00:06:33.930> creating

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
we can see that we're basically creating

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.760 
we can see that we're basically creating
a<00:06:34.380> u-shape<00:06:34.940> where<00:06:35.940> we<00:06:36.060> take<00:06:36.470> basically<00:06:37.470> two

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
a u-shape where we take basically two

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.760 
a u-shape where we take basically two
sets<00:06:38.730> of<00:06:38.940> Poly's<00:06:39.330> that<00:06:39.960> meet<00:06:40.260> up<00:06:40.410> with<00:06:40.560> one

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
sets of Poly's that meet up with one

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.970 
sets of Poly's that meet up with one
poly<00:06:42.590> all<00:06:43.590> right

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:43.980 
poly all right

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.890 
poly all right
so<00:06:44.670> now<00:06:44.790> we're<00:06:44.880> just<00:06:44.910> gonna<00:06:45.060> delete<00:06:45.330> one<00:06:45.660> side

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
so now we're just gonna delete one side

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.830 
so now we're just gonna delete one side
of<00:06:46.020> the<00:06:46.080> mesh<00:06:46.260> again<00:06:46.440> and<00:06:46.880> then<00:06:47.880> mirror<00:06:48.690> that

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
of the mesh again and then mirror that

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.390 
of the mesh again and then mirror that
geometry<00:06:49.410> over<00:06:49.650> to<00:06:49.800> get<00:06:49.920> back<00:06:50.100> to<00:06:50.370> a

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
geometry over to get back to a

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:56.090 
geometry over to get back to a
symmetrical<00:06:51.150> mesh<00:06:53.870> okay<00:06:54.870> so<00:06:54.930> the<00:06:55.650> main<00:06:55.830> body

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 
symmetrical mesh okay so the main body

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.440 
symmetrical mesh okay so the main body
of<00:06:56.190> our<00:06:56.280> character<00:06:56.760> is<00:06:56.850> now<00:06:56.970> complete<00:06:57.420> and

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
of our character is now complete and

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.840 
of our character is now complete and
fully<00:06:57.930> attached<00:06:58.320> to<00:06:58.500> the<00:06:58.680> head<00:06:58.890> you'll<00:06:59.610> notice

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
fully attached to the head you'll notice

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.580 
fully attached to the head you'll notice
however<00:07:00.000> that<00:07:00.240> we<00:07:00.330> have<00:07:00.540> a<00:07:00.570> hard<00:07:00.900> center<00:07:01.320> line

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
however that we have a hard center line

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.170 
however that we have a hard center line
here<00:07:01.920> now<00:07:01.950> that<00:07:02.190> we've<00:07:02.310> duplicated<00:07:02.490> the<00:07:03.000> mesh

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
here now that we've duplicated the mesh

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.880 
here now that we've duplicated the mesh
over<00:07:03.420> to<00:07:03.930> the<00:07:04.020> other<00:07:04.110> side<00:07:04.410> we're<00:07:04.650> just<00:07:04.770> gonna

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:04.890 
over to the other side we're just gonna

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.220 
over to the other side we're just gonna
go<00:07:05.130> into<00:07:05.370> normals<00:07:05.730> and<00:07:05.970> soften<00:07:06.630> the<00:07:06.720> edge<00:07:06.870> on

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230 
go into normals and soften the edge on

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.560 
go into normals and soften the edge on
all<00:07:07.620> of<00:07:07.800> the<00:07:07.890> edges<00:07:08.190> of<00:07:08.220> our<00:07:08.430> character<00:07:08.880> so

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570 
all of the edges of our character so

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.520 
all of the edges of our character so
that<00:07:09.690> we<00:07:09.750> don't<00:07:09.870> have<00:07:10.080> any<00:07:10.230> hard<00:07:10.500> lines

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
that we don't have any hard lines

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.580 
that we don't have any hard lines
anywhere<00:07:11.190> and<00:07:11.460> there<00:07:12.360> you<00:07:12.510> go<00:07:12.690> so<00:07:13.320> let's<00:07:13.500> go

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
anywhere and there you go so let's go

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.410 
anywhere and there you go so let's go
ahead<00:07:13.680> and<00:07:13.830> add<00:07:13.950> the<00:07:14.130> scruff<00:07:14.490> now<00:07:14.760> under<00:07:15.270> his

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.420 
ahead and add the scruff now under his

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.910 
ahead and add the scruff now under his
neck<00:07:15.600> we'll<00:07:15.960> just<00:07:16.110> do<00:07:16.230> that<00:07:16.260> with<00:07:16.590> a<00:07:16.620> plane

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:16.920 
neck we'll just do that with a plane

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.610 
neck we'll just do that with a plane
just<00:07:16.950> as<00:07:17.400> we<00:07:17.520> did<00:07:17.670> the<00:07:17.790> ear<00:07:18.090> before<00:07:18.720> and<00:07:19.080> we'll

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
just as we did the ear before and we'll

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.980 
just as we did the ear before and we'll
give<00:07:19.740> the<00:07:19.890> plane<00:07:20.130> a<00:07:20.160> subdivision<00:07:20.700> of<00:07:21.210> four<00:07:21.660> or

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990 
give the plane a subdivision of four or

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.050 
give the plane a subdivision of four or
maybe<00:07:22.200> six<00:07:22.620> and<00:07:22.950> then<00:07:23.610> we'll<00:07:23.700> just<00:07:23.820> go<00:07:23.940> into

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
maybe six and then we'll just go into

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.450 
maybe six and then we'll just go into
vert<00:07:24.270> mode<00:07:24.450> and<00:07:24.630> begin<00:07:24.870> to<00:07:25.110> move<00:07:25.950> those<00:07:26.160> verts

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 
vert mode and begin to move those verts

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.390 
vert mode and begin to move those verts
around<00:07:26.580> so<00:07:27.000> it<00:07:27.090> matches<00:07:27.300> the<00:07:27.510> model<00:07:27.840> sheet<00:07:28.400> so

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 
around so it matches the model sheet so

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.800 
around so it matches the model sheet so
again<00:07:29.640> nothing<00:07:29.820> new<00:07:30.030> here<00:07:30.330> we're<00:07:30.510> just

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810 
again nothing new here we're just

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.960 
again nothing new here we're just
working<00:07:31.200> just<00:07:31.620> the<00:07:31.710> way<00:07:31.830> we<00:07:31.980> did<00:07:32.190> with<00:07:32.400> the<00:07:32.670> ear

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:32.970 
working just the way we did with the ear

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.110 
working just the way we did with the ear
just<00:07:33.810> moving<00:07:34.440> the<00:07:34.530> verts<00:07:34.770> manually<00:07:35.400> we<00:07:36.000> can

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 
just moving the verts manually we can

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.710
