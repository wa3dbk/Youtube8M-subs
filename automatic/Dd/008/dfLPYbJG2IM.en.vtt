00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
think corridors of dog left dark

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.840 
think corridors of dog left dark
salvation<00:02:15.060> that's<00:02:15.270> just<00:02:15.450> such<00:02:15.600> company<00:02:16.850> but

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
salvation that's just such company but

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.620 
salvation that's just such company but
uh<00:02:18.350> living<00:02:19.350> towers<00:02:19.770> been<00:02:19.950> much<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.220> same

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
uh living towers been much the same

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.440 
uh living towers been much the same
between<00:02:21.630> everything<00:02:22.640> as<00:02:23.640> usual<00:02:23.700> just<00:02:24.270> keep

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
between everything as usual just keep

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.120 
between everything as usual just keep
ending<00:02:24.720> up<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.080> decided<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.530> skip<00:02:25.710> those<00:02:25.860> guys

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
ending up I decided to skip those guys

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.280 
ending up I decided to skip those guys
because<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.850> don't<00:02:27.300> know<00:02:27.330> sometimes<00:02:28.020> it's<00:02:28.260> just

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
because I don't know sometimes it's just

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.620 
because I don't know sometimes it's just
not<00:02:28.500> worth<00:02:28.710> killing<00:02:28.950> them<00:02:29.310> because<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:30.480> just

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
not worth killing them because it just

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.120 
not worth killing them because it just
doesn't<00:02:30.840> work<00:02:31.020> that<00:02:31.080> if<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.590> want<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.920> stay

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
doesn't work that if you want to stay

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.360 
doesn't work that if you want to stay
there<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.580> actually<00:02:33.230> kill<00:02:34.230> them<00:02:34.380> all<00:02:34.560> then<00:02:34.800> go

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
there and actually kill them all then go

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.960 
there and actually kill them all then go
ahead<00:02:35.520> but<00:02:36.890> I'd<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.100> just<00:02:38.460> don't<00:02:38.640> think<00:02:38.820> it's

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
ahead but I'd I just don't think it's

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.280 
ahead but I'd I just don't think it's
worth<00:02:39.120> killing<00:02:39.480> them<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.660> lot<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.080> times

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
worth killing them a lot of the times

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.290 
worth killing them a lot of the times
and<00:02:40.530> they'll<00:02:40.710> usually<00:02:40.860> follow<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.490> which<00:02:41.670> so

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
and they'll usually follow you which so

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.420 
and they'll usually follow you which so
it<00:02:42.600> probably<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.410> worth<00:02:43.740> killing<00:02:44.130> them<00:02:44.280> right

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
it probably is worth killing them right

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.330 
it probably is worth killing them right
away<00:02:44.550> because<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:45.120> will<00:02:45.330> follow<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.340> you

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
away because I will follow you but you

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.520 
away because I will follow you but you
know<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:48.420> anyway<00:02:48.690> these<00:02:48.810> two<00:02:48.960> more<00:02:49.110> people

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
know so anyway these two more people

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.140 
know so anyway these two more people
would<00:02:49.680> keep<00:02:49.920> following<00:02:50.310> me<00:02:50.370> my<00:02:50.640> help<00:02:50.940> it's

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
would keep following me my help it's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.760 
would keep following me my help it's
really<00:02:51.630> low<00:02:51.780> here<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:52.500> keep<00:02:52.650> getting

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
really low here and I just keep getting

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.950 
really low here and I just keep getting
potions<00:02:53.340> drink<00:02:53.820> emotions<00:02:54.240> i<00:02:54.360> guess<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:56.960> it's

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
potions drink emotions i guess and it's

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.750 
potions drink emotions i guess and it's
games<00:02:58.170> actually<00:02:58.380> pretty<00:02:58.710> hard<00:02:59.010> about<00:02:59.190> potions

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
like i don't know i really have no idea

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.950 
like i don't know i really have no idea
how<00:03:02.340> you'd<00:03:02.520> be<00:03:02.640> able<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.910> survive<00:03:03.630> if<00:03:03.870> you

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
how you'd be able to survive if you

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.680 
how you'd be able to survive if you
didn't<00:03:04.170> have<00:03:04.380> potions<00:03:04.680> guys<00:03:05.570> unless<00:03:06.570> you

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
didn't have potions guys unless you

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.900 
didn't have potions guys unless you
played<00:03:06.900> on<00:03:07.020> easy<00:03:07.050> or<00:03:07.440> something<00:03:07.860> or<00:03:08.040> kill<00:03:08.760> them

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
played on easy or something or kill them

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.650 
played on easy or something or kill them
one<00:03:09.030> at<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.270> time<00:03:09.770> it's<00:03:10.770> just<00:03:11.330> there's<00:03:12.330> no<00:03:12.510> way

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
one at a time it's just there's no way

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.510 
one at a time it's just there's no way
you<00:03:12.720> could<00:03:12.990> do<00:03:13.110> this<00:03:13.260> about<00:03:13.410> potions<00:03:13.920> just<00:03:14.250> no

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
way at all so anyway oh that's somewhat

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.880 
way at all so anyway oh that's somewhat
nearing<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.570> end<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:18.840> video<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.590> i<00:03:19.620> guess

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
nearing the end of this video so i guess

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.230 
nearing the end of this video so i guess
