complete<00:01:58.500> weapons<00:01:58.860> analysis<00:01:59.430> which<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.850> will

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
complete weapons analysis which I will

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270 
complete weapons analysis which I will
do<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.409> zombies<00:02:01.770> weapons

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
bullet spread that sort of thing so it's

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.699 
bullet spread that sort of thing so it's
not<00:02:08.250> clear<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.849> there<00:02:09.149> are<00:02:09.390> other<00:02:09.810> unseen

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
rate may impact the reload so we want to

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.699 
rate may impact the reload so we want to
look<00:02:27.580> at<00:02:27.730> all<00:02:27.879> of<00:02:27.909> those<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.659> just<00:02:29.230> see<00:02:29.440> if

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
look at all of those and just see if

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.160 
look at all of those and just see if
there<00:02:30.280> are<00:02:30.310> things<00:02:30.670> outside<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.810> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
there are things outside of the the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.780 
there are things outside of the the
actual<00:02:33.989> scope<00:02:34.989> or<00:02:35.319> sight<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.250> it's<00:02:36.459> adding

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
actual scope or sight that it's adding

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.119 
actual scope or sight that it's adding
on<00:02:36.910> here<00:02:37.209> if<00:02:38.170> those<00:02:38.410> other<00:02:38.650> things<00:02:38.860> are<00:02:39.099> being

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
on here if those other things are being

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.559 
on here if those other things are being
added<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:39.790> we're<00:02:39.910> packed<00:02:40.090> punching<00:02:40.480> it

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
added to so we're packed punching it

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.319 
added to so we're packed punching it
again<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.110> this<00:02:41.980> time<00:02:42.040> we<00:02:42.640> got<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.849> millimeter

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
again and this time we got a millimeter

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.020 
again and this time we got a millimeter
scanner<00:02:43.659> and<00:02:44.079> that's<00:02:44.230> pretty<00:02:44.500> cool<00:02:45.030> although

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
scanner and that's pretty cool although

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.910 
scanner and that's pretty cool although
in<00:02:46.959> zombies<00:02:47.769> it's<00:02:48.190> really<00:02:48.670> not<00:02:48.819> very<00:02:48.879> useful

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
in zombies it's really not very useful

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.559 
in zombies it's really not very useful
I'll<00:02:50.920> tell<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.340> right<00:02:51.489> now<00:02:51.730> it's<00:02:52.329> not

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
I'll tell you that right now it's not

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.650 
I'll tell you that right now it's not
useful<00:02:52.840> at<00:02:53.109> all<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:54.640> zombies<00:02:55.299> with<00:02:55.599> the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
useful at all in zombies with the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.089 
useful at all in zombies with the
millimeter<00:02:56.019> skin<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.319> prefer<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.739> target<00:02:57.040> the

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
millimeter skin I prefer the target the

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.800 
millimeter skin I prefer the target the
target<00:02:57.250> finder<00:02:57.549> is<00:02:57.760> awesome

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
target finder is awesome

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.869 
target finder is awesome
target<00:02:59.410> finders<00:02:59.739> by<00:02:59.920> far<00:03:00.160> my<00:03:00.310> favorites<00:03:00.760> so

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
target finders by far my favorites so

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.670 
target finders by far my favorites so
we'll<00:03:01.720> see<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.109> action<00:03:02.230> when<00:03:02.560> we

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
we'll see that in action when we

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.470 
we'll see that in action when we
actually<00:03:03.129> look<00:03:03.430> at<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.609> mtar<00:03:03.910> as<00:03:04.120> well<00:03:04.329> as

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
actually look at the mtar as well as

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.330 
actually look at the mtar as well as
some<00:03:04.660> other<00:03:04.780> weapons<00:03:05.079> so<00:03:05.560> I'm<00:03:05.650> going<00:03:05.859> to<00:03:05.980> and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
some other weapons so I'm going to and

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.740 
some other weapons so I'm going to and
it<00:03:06.459> just<00:03:06.640> seems<00:03:06.849> to<00:03:07.000> be<00:03:07.120> cycling<00:03:07.540> through

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
it just seems to be cycling through

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.309 
it just seems to be cycling through
those<00:03:08.140> sights<00:03:09.099> and<00:03:09.430> scopes<00:03:09.989> there<00:03:10.989> are<00:03:11.109> no

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
those sights and scopes there are no

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.170 
those sights and scopes there are no
other<00:03:11.500> ones<00:03:11.739> that<00:03:11.950> I've<00:03:12.099> seen<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.549> pack<00:03:12.879> punch

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
other ones that I've seen I pack punch

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.300 
other ones that I've seen I pack punch
at<00:03:13.359> least<00:03:13.569> ten<00:03:13.810> times<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.920> only<00:03:15.099> ever

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
at least ten times and it only ever

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.490 
at least ten times and it only ever
cycled<00:03:15.910> amongst<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.750> ones<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.230> we<00:03:17.319> have<00:03:17.470> now

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
cycled amongst the ones that we have now

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.750 
cycled amongst the ones that we have now
seen<00:03:17.919> on<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.370> video<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:20.470> that's<00:03:20.829> hey<00:03:21.579> the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
seen on this video so and that's hey the

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.890 
seen on this video so and that's hey the
reason<00:03:22.090> why<00:03:22.209> it's<00:03:22.359> not<00:03:22.510> showing<00:03:22.840> the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
reason why it's not showing the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.860 
reason why it's not showing the
crosshairs<00:03:23.410> on<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.950> target<00:03:24.310> finder<00:03:24.519> is

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
crosshairs on the target finder is

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.089 
crosshairs on the target finder is
because<00:03:26.280> hyper<00:03:27.280> impede<00:03:28.269> me<00:03:28.450> so<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.650> handpiece

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
because hyper impede me so the handpiece

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.420 
because hyper impede me so the handpiece

only costs you 2,000 double package but
key<00:03:45.579> point<00:03:45.819> here<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.180> don't<00:03:46.450> get<00:03:46.660> additional

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
key point here you don't get additional

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.839 
key point here you don't get additional
ammo<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.500> don't<00:03:47.769> get<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:48.010> refill<00:03:48.400> enamel<00:03:48.730> which

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
ammo you don't get a refill enamel which

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.159 
ammo you don't get a refill enamel which
makes<00:03:49.090> sense<00:03:49.359> they're<00:03:49.540> not<00:03:49.690> gonna<00:03:49.810> give<00:03:50.019> you
