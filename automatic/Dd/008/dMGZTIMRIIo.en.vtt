00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.520
 I started with climbing because my sister ... 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.970
 ... needed someone to back up. 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.300
 At first I had no desire to go with her to a climbing gym, 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.140
 but from day one, when I did the beginner's course, 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.600
 and have gained the first climbing experience, 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.050
 I was so motivated that I was the next 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.480
 Months no longer wanted to go out of the climbing gym 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.300
 and spent every day there. 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.820
 To stay motivated, it was always very important for me to have small goals 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.980
 which I could work on and train. 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.760
 No matter if it was difficult routes on the rocks or the next competition. 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.160
 The most motivating thing about training is that 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.010
 to see after a few sessions or weeks 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.420
 how to improve on his weaknesses 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.430
 and then go back to a project, 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.000
 and to realize how much better all trains feel. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.860
 This is perhaps the best feeling you will have when climbing. 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.580
 Since I climbed people from the hall 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.270
 raved by Fontainebleau. 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.840
 In her opinion, the best bouldering area in the world. 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.970
 By now Fontainebleau is mine too 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.539
 favorite climbing area, 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.749
 from the texture of the rock, over the 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:15.819
 incredible structures of the handles, up to the athletic boulder problems, 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.689
 which are at the same time very powerful and also technical. 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:24.400
 It's just the best I've ever had. 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.629
 It's hard to say what lines motivate me. 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.509
 It is mainly about the first moment, if you 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:18.219
 standing under a boulder or a route and just can not imagine 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:26.939
 to leave this area without having climbed this route. 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.209
 The best thing about climbing is that you never really know what's going on. 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.149
 Some days you go out, climb everything directly and 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:16.389
 just feels super strong. And on other days you can not get anything up 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.770
 and must learn to deal with defeats. 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.439
 Finally a good try. It barely did not work. 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.199
 Jour de Chasse is by far my heaviest first ascent. 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.000
 It's a very logical line for me, 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.500
 the me from the first day 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.860
 impressed by the athleticism and dynamics of the trains. 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.949
 The heaviest train is by far the first one to jump into a sloping hole 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.979
 in which both feet, as well as the left hand come and one 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.169
 everything has to catch only with the right arm. 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.879
 With this intensity, I will certainly not continue climbing, 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.370
 at least not all my life. 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.449
 But I'm sure climbing is always part of my life, 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.100
 my everyday life will be. 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.210
 I still can not believe what just happened. 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.490
 Yesterday was still the qualification. 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.349
 I was not sure if it was me 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.460
 into the semi-finals or even the final. 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.089
 Today I just wanted to enjoy it 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:17.949
 to climb in front of this great audience. 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.879
 I was very lucky with the boulder problems. 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:24.200
 We have a very long night today!
