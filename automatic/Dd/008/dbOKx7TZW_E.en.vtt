00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:10.130
 My name is Kevin, my name is Will 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.270
 I am teak dj and the name of the group is 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.270
 black by all in 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.200
 I all viola acoustic and kevin touches 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.200
 the electric violin 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.140
 we met at school and we ended up 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.140
 being good friends since then 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.500
 At 14 I started playing the viola mi 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.960
 mother forced me to play the violin when 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.400
 I was 9 but after touching it a 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.400
 very time started to like me 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:58.519
 we incorporated hip hop and classic and what 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:01:01.239
 we mix is one of the first 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.920
 songs that a violinist learns 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.590
 we took that song we kept the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.020
 original principle and we decided to change it 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.190
 adding a tone to have a 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.190
 hip hop feeling 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.520
 basically on the record he went ahead and 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.350
 returned in certain parts of the song 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.039
 to have different rhythms of the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.039
 instruments 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.370
 there is not even 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.760
 I like the violin I love being able to 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.760
 touch what I feel 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.270
 we also understand that he knows 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.939
 when it's a pause to let me touch 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.739
 just one and vice versa I like to play with 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.530
 will because he has a musical ability 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:16.080
 natural so I learn from that all the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.080
 days and so we create beautiful music
