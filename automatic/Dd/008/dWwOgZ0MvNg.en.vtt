well a lot of people have been looking
at<00:00:21.420> gold<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:22.410> what<00:00:22.680> about<00:00:22.830> silver<00:00:23.160> what

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
at gold but what about silver what

at gold but what about silver what
silver<00:00:23.789> done<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.359> past<00:00:24.510> couple<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.990> days

silver done in the past couple of days

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.429 
silver done in the past couple of days
since<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.859> whole<00:00:26.930> discussion<00:00:27.930> about<00:00:28.199> whether

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
since the whole discussion about whether

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.470 
since the whole discussion about whether
or<00:00:28.619> not<00:00:28.710> they<00:00:28.920> would<00:00:29.039> begin<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> tax<00:00:29.880> deposits

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
or not they would begin to tax deposits

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.810 
or not they would begin to tax deposits
in<00:00:30.660> banks<00:00:30.689> there<00:00:31.320> well<00:00:31.890> silver<00:00:32.309> sold<00:00:32.579> off<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
in banks there well silver sold off a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.510 
in banks there well silver sold off a
little<00:00:33.090> bit<00:00:33.329> because<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.860> that's

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
little bit because of it and that's

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.319 
little bit because of it and that's
mainly<00:00:35.880> because<00:00:36.200> in<00:00:37.200> times<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.950> stress<00:00:38.329> we

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
mainly because in times of stress we

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.780 
mainly because in times of stress we
tend<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.140> silver<00:00:40.680> acting<00:00:41.190> more<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:41.460> an

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
tend to see silver acting more like an

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.360 
tend to see silver acting more like an
industrial<00:00:42.120> metal<00:00:42.809> rather<00:00:43.110> than<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.559> safe

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
industrial metal rather than a safe

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.470 
industrial metal rather than a safe
haven<00:00:44.640> store<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.390> value<00:00:45.420> such<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.350> gold<00:00:46.590> and

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
haven store of value such as gold and

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.420 
haven store of value such as gold and
silver<00:00:48.480> does<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> high<00:00:49.559> correlation<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
silver does have a high correlation to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.119 
silver does have a high correlation to
gold<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:51.629> when<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.140> see<00:00:52.379> these<00:00:52.620> stressed

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
gold but when we see these stressed

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.380 
gold but when we see these stressed
occasions<00:00:53.910> than<00:00:54.120> market<00:00:54.690> risk<00:00:55.410> off<00:00:55.649> type

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
occasions than market risk off type

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.060 
occasions than market risk off type
environments<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.930> tend<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.620> silver

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
environments we tend to see silver

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.610 
environments we tend to see silver
trading<00:00:59.489> more<00:00:59.730> as<00:00:59.850> an<00:00:59.940> industrial<00:01:00.239> metal<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
trading more as an industrial metal and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.490 
trading more as an industrial metal and
therefore<00:01:02.100> selling<00:01:02.520> off<00:01:02.670> visa<00:01:03.180> V<00:01:03.420> gold<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.320> why

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
therefore selling off visa V gold so why

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.899 
therefore selling off visa V gold so why
was<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> trading<00:01:05.129> more<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.489> an<00:01:05.640> industrial

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
was it trading more like an industrial

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.060 
was it trading more like an industrial
metal<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.570> opposed<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> precious<00:01:07.650> metal

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
metal as opposed to a precious metal

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.980 
metal as opposed to a precious metal
well<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.060> main<00:01:09.210> reason<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.600> because<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
well the main reason is because the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.399 
well the main reason is because the
majority<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.590> demand<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.850> silver<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.659> from

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
majority of demand for silver is from

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.850 
majority of demand for silver is from
industry<00:01:14.100> its<00:01:14.700> principal<00:01:15.299> application<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.290> in

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
industry its principal application is in

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.399 
industry its principal application is in
industry<00:01:17.490> unlike<00:01:18.420> gold<00:01:18.840> where<00:01:19.200> there's

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
industry unlike gold where there's

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.350 
industry unlike gold where there's
actually<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> very<00:01:19.890> small<00:01:20.280> component<00:01:21.090> which<00:01:21.330> is

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
actually a very small component which is

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.950 
actually a very small component which is
actually<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.350> industrial<00:01:23.040> demand<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.210> gold

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
actually just industrial demand so gold

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.859 
actually just industrial demand so gold
is<00:01:25.490> quite<00:01:26.490> unique<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> sense<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.689> it

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
is quite unique in the sense that it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.679 
is quite unique in the sense that it
sits<00:01:28.200> alone<00:01:28.619> as<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.549> metal<00:01:30.150> which<00:01:30.329> doesn't

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
sits alone as a metal which doesn't

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.539 
sits alone as a metal which doesn't
really<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.320> any<00:01:31.590> industrial<00:01:32.100> properties

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
really have any industrial properties

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.660 
really have any industrial properties
whereas<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.420> other<00:01:33.470> white<00:01:34.470> metals<00:01:34.920> silver

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
whereas the other white metals silver

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.539 
whereas the other white metals silver
and<00:01:36.150> platinum<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.079> palladium<00:01:37.280> they're<00:01:38.280> all

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and platinum and palladium they're all

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.120 
and platinum and palladium they're all
much<00:01:38.820> more<00:01:38.850> industrial<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> therefore<00:01:40.530> your

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
much more industrial and therefore your

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.520 
much more industrial and therefore your
trade<00:01:41.549> as<00:01:41.790> such<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.079> think<00:01:43.259> we'll<00:01:43.380> see

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
trade as such and do we think we'll see

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.670 
trade as such and do we think we'll see
more<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.950> same<00:01:44.130> from<00:01:44.399> from<00:01:44.880> silver

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
more of the same from from silver

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.530 
more of the same from from silver
yesterday<00:01:46.680> Tuesday<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.850> course<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.210> saw<00:01:48.390> that

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
yesterday Tuesday of course we saw that

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.690 
yesterday Tuesday of course we saw that
the<00:01:48.659> Cypriot<00:01:49.020> Parliament<00:01:49.200> voted<00:01:50.100> down<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the Cypriot Parliament voted down the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.450 
the Cypriot Parliament voted down the
idea<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.180> haircut<00:01:52.280> what<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.369> think

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
idea of the haircut what do you think

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.910 
idea of the haircut what do you think
this<00:01:53.790> means<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:54.060> silver<00:01:54.540> well<00:01:55.049> silver<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.649> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
this means for silver well silver is a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.859 
this means for silver well silver is a
hybrid<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:57.000> between<00:01:57.270> an<00:01:57.360> industrial

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
hybrid really between an industrial

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.910 
hybrid really between an industrial
metal<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.939> store<00:01:59.939> of<00:01:59.969> value<00:02:00.469> such<00:02:01.469> as<00:02:01.500> gold

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
metal and a store of value such as gold

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.280 
metal and a store of value such as gold
so<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.250> think<00:02:02.520> while<00:02:03.090> initial<00:02:03.540> reaction<00:02:04.110> would

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
so I think while initial reaction would

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.920 
so I think while initial reaction would
be<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:05.310> sell<00:02:05.549> off<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.719> longer

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
be to to sell off I think the longer

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.380 
be to to sell off I think the longer
term<00:02:07.140> if<00:02:07.350> gold<00:02:07.619> prices<00:02:07.920> are<00:02:08.250> increasing<00:02:08.390> then

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
term if gold prices are increasing then

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.540 
term if gold prices are increasing then
silver<00:02:09.840> prices<00:02:10.080> most<00:02:10.619> likely<00:02:11.039> will<00:02:11.129> increase

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
silver prices most likely will increase

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.220 
silver prices most likely will increase
as<00:02:11.790> well<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.599> back<00:02:12.780> of

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
as well on the back of

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.899 
as well on the back of
old<00:02:13.379> in<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.590> higher<00:02:13.830> gold<00:02:14.220> price<00:02:14.489> typically

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
old in a higher gold price typically

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.690 
old in a higher gold price typically
lifts<00:02:15.480> silver<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:16.830> think<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.280> initial

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
lifts silver so I think the initial

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.630 
lifts silver so I think the initial
reaction<00:02:17.819> was<00:02:18.540> perhaps<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.560> sell<00:02:19.799> off<00:02:19.980> but

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
reaction was perhaps to to sell off but

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.050 
reaction was perhaps to to sell off but
longer-term<00:02:21.180> if<00:02:21.690> we<00:02:21.930> see<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.200> gold<00:02:22.440> price

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
longer-term if we see the gold price

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.580 
longer-term if we see the gold price
increasing<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.269> continue<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.019> increase<00:02:25.140> or

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
increasing and continue to increase or

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.559 
increasing and continue to increase or
continue<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> go<00:02:26.040> higher<00:02:26.310> from<00:02:26.580> here<00:02:26.940> then<00:02:27.420> is

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
continue to go higher from here then is

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.420 
continue to go higher from here then is
most<00:02:27.780> likely<00:02:28.019> that<00:02:28.200> silver<00:02:28.680> will<00:02:28.830> follow<00:02:29.040> and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
most likely that silver will follow and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.770 
most likely that silver will follow and
so<00:02:29.640> let's<00:02:29.819> touch<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.180> really<00:02:30.540> quickly

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
so let's touch on that really quickly

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.869 
so let's touch on that really quickly
gold<00:02:31.140> prices<00:02:31.440> do<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.010> see<00:02:32.310> gold<00:02:32.640> prices

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
gold prices do you see gold prices

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.509 
gold prices do you see gold prices
continuing<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:34.260> jump<00:02:34.530> up<00:02:34.709> on<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:34.980> Cyprus

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
continuing to to jump up on the Cyprus

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.710 
continuing to to jump up on the Cyprus
news<00:02:35.730> or<00:02:35.879> do<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.030> think<00:02:36.090> things<00:02:36.420> are<00:02:36.510> going<00:02:36.629> to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
news or do you think things are going to

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.270 
news or do you think things are going to
finally<00:02:37.019> cool<00:02:37.200> off<00:02:37.410> from<00:02:37.620> there<00:02:37.860> well<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.190> think

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
finally cool off from there well I think

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.130 
finally cool off from there well I think
that<00:02:38.580> your<00:02:39.209> gold<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.629> reacted<00:02:40.019> very

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
that your gold is reacted very

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.080 
that your gold is reacted very
positively<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.010> think<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.400> many<00:02:41.610> ways<00:02:41.879> this

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
positively and I think in many ways this

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.869 
positively and I think in many ways this
was<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.299> catalyst<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.140> gold<00:02:43.530> had<00:02:43.890> needed<00:02:44.430> to

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
was a catalyst that gold had needed to

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.289 
was a catalyst that gold had needed to
reassure<00:02:45.209> or<00:02:46.049> two<00:02:46.819> you<00:02:47.819> know<00:02:47.910> perhaps

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
reassure or two you know perhaps

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.750 
reassure or two you know perhaps
reassert<00:02:48.959> itself<00:02:49.470> as<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:50.340> store<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:50.970> value<00:02:51.290> type

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
reassert itself as a store of value type

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.670 
reassert itself as a store of value type
investment<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:54.180> these<00:02:54.540> times<00:02:54.870> where<00:02:55.290> you're

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
investment in these times where you're

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.849 
investment in these times where you're
suddenly<00:02:55.970> we're<00:02:56.970> back<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.109> a<00:02:58.140> situation<00:02:58.650> where

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
suddenly we're back to a situation where

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.339 
suddenly we're back to a situation where
everybody<00:02:59.519> perhaps<00:02:59.940> thinks<00:03:00.629> that<00:03:00.810> things<00:03:01.230> are

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
everybody perhaps thinks that things are

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.349 
everybody perhaps thinks that things are
going<00:03:01.560> great<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:02.010> economy<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:02.519> improving<00:03:02.640> and

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
going great the economy is improving and

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.319 
going great the economy is improving and
then<00:03:04.049> out<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.470> nowhere<00:03:05.040> comes<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:05.910> little

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
then out of nowhere comes this little

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.660 
then out of nowhere comes this little
island<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.870> Mediterranean<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:08.190> your

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
island in the Mediterranean that your

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.800 
island in the Mediterranean that your
blows<00:03:09.030> up<00:03:09.390> or<00:03:09.599> has<00:03:10.079> sub<00:03:10.319> your<00:03:10.650> crisis<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.430> that

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
blows up or has sub your crisis and that

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.900 
blows up or has sub your crisis and that
causes<00:03:12.810> people<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.200> reevaluate<00:03:13.859> thinking<00:03:14.760> and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
causes people to reevaluate thinking and

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.589 
causes people to reevaluate thinking and
again<00:03:15.359> by<00:03:15.629> gold<00:03:16.049> as<00:03:16.910> some<00:03:17.910> kind<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.209> protection

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
again by gold as some kind of protection
