your choice so be it then serif was
right<00:00:26.880> about<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.359> thing<00:00:28.159> it's<00:00:29.159> in<00:00:29.339> our<00:00:29.460> nature

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
right about one thing it's in our nature

to want to rise above our limits think
about<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.960> were<00:00:34.079> cold<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.860> harness<00:00:35.130> fire

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
about it we were cold so we harness fire

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.440 
about it we were cold so we harness fire
we<00:00:36.510> were<00:00:36.660> weak<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.260> invented<00:00:37.590> tools<00:00:38.450> every

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
we were weak so we invented tools every

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.210 
we were weak so we invented tools every
time<00:00:39.720> we<00:00:39.960> met<00:00:40.110> an<00:00:40.200> obstacle<00:00:40.560> we<00:00:41.070> use

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
time we met an obstacle we use

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.380 
time we met an obstacle we use
creativity<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.180> ingenuity<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:43.110> overcome<00:00:43.530> it

the<00:00:45.390> cycle<00:00:45.900> is<00:00:46.050> inevitable<00:00:47.000> but<00:00:48.000> will<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the cycle is inevitable but will the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.490 
the cycle is inevitable but will the
outcome<00:00:48.390> always<00:00:49.380> be<00:00:49.590> good

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.680 

I<00:00:54.910> guess<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:55.940> would<00:00:56.180> depend<00:00:56.240> on<00:00:56.540> how<00:00:56.630> we

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
I guess that would depend on how we

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.990 
I guess that would depend on how we
approach<00:00:57.080> it<00:00:59.440> these<00:01:00.440> past<00:01:00.470> few<00:01:00.950> months<00:01:01.190> I<00:01:01.550> was

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
approach it these past few months I was

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.079 
approach it these past few months I was
challenged<00:01:02.600> many<00:01:02.900> times<00:01:03.640> but<00:01:04.640> more<00:01:04.910> often

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
challenged many times but more often

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.600 
challenged many times but more often
than<00:01:05.330> not<00:01:05.390> didn't<00:01:06.200> I<00:01:06.290> try<00:01:06.650> to<00:01:06.680> keep<00:01:07.010> morality

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
than not didn't I try to keep morality

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.820 
than not didn't I try to keep morality
in<00:01:07.760> mind<00:01:08.000> knowing<00:01:08.660> that<00:01:08.900> my<00:01:09.020> actions<00:01:09.260> didn't

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
in mind knowing that my actions didn't

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.330 
in mind knowing that my actions didn't
have<00:01:10.010> to<00:01:10.220> harm<00:01:10.430> others<00:01:11.740> time<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.040> time<00:01:13.310> again

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
have to harm others time and time again

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.120 
have to harm others time and time again
didn't<00:01:14.300> I<00:01:14.360> resist<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.140> urge<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.619> abuse<00:01:15.920> power

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
didn't I resist the urge to abuse power

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.460 
didn't I resist the urge to abuse power
resources<00:01:16.760> simply<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.720> achieve<00:01:17.960> my<00:01:18.170> goals

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.250 

in<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.550> past<00:01:22.820> we've<00:01:23.120> had<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.420> compensate<00:01:23.810> for

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
in the past we've had to compensate for

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.770 
in the past we've had to compensate for

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
only benefit a few but what if we never

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.470 
only benefit a few but what if we never
need<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.710> feel<00:01:30.980> weak<00:01:31.310> or<00:01:31.550> morally<00:01:32.330> conflicted
