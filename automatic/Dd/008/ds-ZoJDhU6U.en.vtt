00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
now today in this video I want to talk

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.759 
now today in this video I want to talk
to<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.699> about<00:00:26.939> where<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.630> hit<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.289> return<00:00:28.439> of

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
to you about where to hit your return of

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.980 
to you about where to hit your return of
serve<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.369> where<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:30.000> should<00:00:30.240> be<00:00:30.449> aiming<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
serve so where you should be aiming and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.979 
serve so where you should be aiming and
I<00:00:31.529> find<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.189> an<00:00:32.430> area<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.750> lot

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
I find that this is an area that a lot

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.420 
I find that this is an area that a lot
of<00:00:34.140> players<00:00:34.350> misunderstand

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
of players misunderstand

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.700 
of players misunderstand
seems<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.239> most<00:00:36.510> players<00:00:36.780> at<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
seems like most players at the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.160 
seems like most players at the
recreational<00:00:38.219> level<00:00:38.399> especially<00:00:39.149> try<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.930> do

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
recreational level especially try to do

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.920 
recreational level especially try to do
way<00:00:40.410> too<00:00:40.440> much<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> return<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.670> serve<00:00:42.059> so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
way too much with the return of serve so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.660 
way too much with the return of serve so
maybe<00:00:43.260> you're<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:43.950> winners<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.550> you're

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
maybe you're going for winners or you're

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.600 
maybe you're going for winners or you're
trying<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> hit<00:00:45.210> crazy<00:00:45.570> angles<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.610> really

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
trying to hit crazy angles and really

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.639 
trying to hit crazy angles and really
the<00:00:47.760> goal<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.390> should<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the goal that you should have on the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.770 
the goal that you should have on the
return<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:49.980> serve<00:00:50.250> against<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.910> good<00:00:51.090> server<00:00:51.449> is

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
return of serve against a good server is

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.680 
return of serve against a good server is
to<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.649> ball<00:00:52.829> deep<00:00:53.309> okay<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.270> get<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
to get the ball deep okay and get the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.799 
to get the ball deep okay and get the
ball<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.140> play<00:00:55.379> that's<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> primary<00:00:56.219> goal

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
ball in play that's the primary goal

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.389 
ball in play that's the primary goal
that<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.989> should<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:59.280> you're

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that you should have when you're

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.430 
that you should have when you're
returning<00:00:59.730> against<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.210> good<00:01:00.329> server<00:01:00.660> now<00:01:01.230> when

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
returning against a good server now when

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.319 
returning against a good server now when
you're<00:01:01.590> returning<00:01:01.920> against<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.670> very<00:01:02.969> weak

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you're returning against a very weak

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.420 
you're returning against a very weak
server<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.199> situation<00:01:04.739> changes<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> little

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
server the situation changes a little

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.700 
server the situation changes a little
bit<00:01:05.729> then<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.510> basically<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:07.170> move<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
bit then you basically just move up to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.020 
bit then you basically just move up to
the<00:01:07.830> ball<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> then<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.400> hit<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.610> regular

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the ball and then you hit a regular

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.010 
the ball and then you hit a regular
forehand<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:09.689> backhand<00:01:09.960> topspin<00:01:10.770> shot<00:01:12.020> okay

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
forehand or backhand topspin shot okay

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.230 
forehand or backhand topspin shot okay
so<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.380> right<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.250> target<00:01:14.820> area

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
so this right here is the target area

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.090 
so this right here is the target area
that<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.540> want<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.140> work<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.979> your

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
return of serve the basic idea is to get

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.160 
return of serve the basic idea is to get
that<00:01:20.100> ball<00:01:20.250> deep<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.030> down<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.689> middle<00:01:21.900> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
if you manage to get that ball in here

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.810 
if you manage to get that ball in here
your<00:01:24.990> opponent<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.040> forced<00:01:26.369> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
your opponent is going to be forced to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.030 
your opponent is going to be forced to
back<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.390> off<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.990> baseline<00:01:28.380> okay<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:28.890> your

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
back up off the baseline okay if your

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.280 
back up off the baseline okay if your
opponent<00:01:29.490> has<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.670> hit<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.060> next<00:01:30.420> shot<00:01:30.479> here

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290

opponent has to hit that next shot here
behind<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.860> baseline<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.119> are<00:01:33.329> going

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
behind the baseline then you are going

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.590 
behind the baseline then you are going
to<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:34.079> least<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.740> neutral<00:01:35.159> position

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
to be at least in a neutral position

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.910 
to be at least in a neutral position
oftentimes<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.750> an<00:01:36.840> offensive<00:01:37.290> position<00:01:37.470> if

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
oftentimes in an offensive position if

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.850 
oftentimes in an offensive position if
you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.520> get<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> ball<00:01:39.000> really<00:01:39.420> deep<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
you can get the ball really deep now the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.289 
you can get the ball really deep now the
other<00:01:41.070> thing<00:01:41.310> you're<00:01:41.430> doing<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
other thing you're doing with this is

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.999 
other thing you're doing with this is
you're<00:01:42.540> eliminating<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.290> lot<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> error

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
you're eliminating a lot of the error

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.800 
you're eliminating a lot of the error
possibilities<00:01:44.939> okay<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.450> you're<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
possibilities okay so you're going to

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.710 
possibilities okay so you're going to
put<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.229> lot<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.799> returns<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.850> play<00:01:48.149> because

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
put a lot of returns in play because

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.480 
put a lot of returns in play because
when<00:01:49.079> you're<00:01:49.200> aiming<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.799> target<00:01:50.070> area

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
when you're aiming for this target area

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.190 
when you're aiming for this target area
it's<00:01:50.790> very<00:01:50.939> unlikely<00:01:51.450> you're<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.049> miss

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it's very unlikely you're going to miss

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.889 
it's very unlikely you're going to miss
wide<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:53.250> also<00:01:53.549> very<00:01:53.880> unlikely<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.570> you're

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
wide it's also very unlikely that you're

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.200 
wide it's also very unlikely that you're
going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.170> miss<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> net<00:01:56.040> because<00:01:56.850> for

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
going to miss in the net because for

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.719 
going to miss in the net because for
depth<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.810> need<00:01:57.990> height<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.619> if<00:01:59.579> you're

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
depth you need height and if you're

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.850 
depth you need height and if you're
returning<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.329> topspin<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.500> also

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
returning with topspin it is also

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.920 
returning with topspin it is also
unlikely<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.700> you're<00:02:02.939> going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.180> miss<00:02:03.420> deep

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
unlikely that you're going to miss deep

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.630 
unlikely that you're going to miss deep
because<00:02:04.229> topspin<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.369> bring<00:02:05.610> that

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
because topspin is going to bring that

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.180 
because topspin is going to bring that
ball<00:02:06.000> back<00:02:06.270> down<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.229> you're<00:02:07.380> eliminating<00:02:08.099> a

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
ball back down so you're eliminating a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.919 
ball back down so you're eliminating a
lot<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.670> error<00:02:08.819> possibilities<00:02:09.720> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
lot of the error possibilities and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.559 
lot of the error possibilities and
putting<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.649> lot<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.009> returns<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.550> play<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
putting a lot of returns in play and the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.760 
putting a lot of returns in play and the
result<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.080> is

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
result of that is

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.290 
result of that is
in<00:02:13.830> my<00:02:14.040> opinion<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.460> you're<00:02:14.820> most<00:02:15.030> likely

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
in my opinion that you're most likely

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.020 
in my opinion that you're most likely
going<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.840> win<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.230> lot<00:02:16.380> more<00:02:16.770> matches<00:02:17.460> all

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
going to win a lot more matches all

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.910 
going to win a lot more matches all
right<00:02:18.240> let's<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.660> look<00:02:18.750> at<00:02:19.020> me<00:02:19.200> practicing

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
right let's have a look at me practicing

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.160 
right let's have a look at me practicing
my<00:02:20.460> returns<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.300> kind<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.690> target<00:02:21.930> area

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
my returns to this kind of a target area

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.340 
my returns to this kind of a target area
with<00:02:22.560> one<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.860> my<00:02:22.920> students<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.900> here<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.320> see

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
with one of my students so here you see

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.530 
with one of my students so here you see
me<00:02:25.710> ready<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.160> practice<00:02:26.610> my<00:02:26.730> return<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.270> serve

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
me ready to practice my return of serve

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.150 
me ready to practice my return of serve
towards<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.200> target<00:02:28.440> area<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.130> other

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
towards that target area on the other

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.430 
towards that target area on the other
side<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.820> net<00:02:30.000> deep<00:02:30.420> down<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.870> middle<00:02:30.930> and

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
side of the net deep down the middle and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.650 
side of the net deep down the middle and
when<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.460> do<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> lot<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:32.970> these<00:02:33.180> your

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
when you do a lot of these your

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.720 
when you do a lot of these your
perception<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:34.500> changes<00:02:35.100> on<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> return

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
perception really changes on the return

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.610 
perception really changes on the return
a<00:02:35.760> lot<00:02:36.210> of<00:02:36.360> good<00:02:36.480> things<00:02:36.720> happen<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.440> let's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
a lot of good things happen so let's

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.280 
a lot of good things happen so let's
take<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.860> look<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:39.360> first<00:02:39.660> one<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:39.930> really

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
take a look on the first one I really

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.930 
take a look on the first one I really
lifted<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:40.920> one<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.250> was<00:02:41.370> an<00:02:41.460> excellent

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
lifted this one that was an excellent

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.590 
lifted this one that was an excellent
return<00:02:42.060> hit<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.660> target<00:02:43.050> area<00:02:43.350> was<00:02:43.530> deep<00:02:43.800> now

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
return hit the target area was deep now

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.510 
return hit the target area was deep now
Sonya<00:02:45.600> serve<00:02:45.870> does<00:02:46.140> kick<00:02:46.410> up<00:02:46.590> high<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.280> that's

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
Sonya serve does kick up high and that's

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.520 
Sonya serve does kick up high and that's
a<00:02:47.640> tough<00:02:47.880> return<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.870> hit<00:02:49.020> with<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.320> one

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
a tough return to hit with that one

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.830 
a tough return to hit with that one
hander<00:02:49.950> here<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.000> second<00:02:51.360> one<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.510> missed

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
hander here on the second one I missed

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.230 
hander here on the second one I missed
it<00:02:51.990> long<00:02:52.260> how<00:02:52.920> long<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.490> best<00:02:53.700> miss<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.210> I

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
it long how long is the best miss that I

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.450 
it long how long is the best miss that I
could<00:02:54.450> possibly<00:02:54.870> have<00:02:54.990> I<00:02:55.560> really<00:02:56.010> gave<00:02:56.250> myself

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
could possibly have I really gave myself

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.430 
could possibly have I really gave myself
a<00:02:57.330> chance<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.870> hit<00:02:57.990> a<00:02:58.020> great<00:02:58.200> return<00:03:00.440> right

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
a chance to hit a great return right

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.340 
a chance to hit a great return right
here<00:03:01.500> forehand<00:03:02.280> return<00:03:02.810> now<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:04.020> was<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.170> very

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
here forehand return now that was a very

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.110 
here forehand return now that was a very
good<00:03:04.440> return<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.010> was<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.130> little<00:03:05.460> bit<00:03:05.610> off<00:03:05.760> to

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
good return it was a little bit off to

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.380 
good return it was a little bit off to
the<00:03:06.150> side<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.500> target<00:03:07.740> area<00:03:08.240> but<00:03:09.240> that's

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
the side of the target area but that's

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.030 
the side of the target area but that's
why<00:03:09.570> we<00:03:09.750> have<00:03:09.990> this<00:03:10.170> kind<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.530> target<00:03:10.920> area

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
why we have this kind of a target area

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.270 
why we have this kind of a target area
because<00:03:11.640> even<00:03:12.240> when<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.420> miss<00:03:12.810> my<00:03:13.080> target<00:03:13.250> by<00:03:14.250> a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
because even when I miss my target by a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.520 
because even when I miss my target by a
little<00:03:14.700> bit<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.450> return<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:15.960> still<00:03:16.170> going<00:03:16.410> to

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
little bit the return is still going to

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.500 
little bit the return is still going to
be<00:03:16.650> good<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.220> we're<00:03:17.430> leaving<00:03:17.790> ourselves<00:03:17.940> with

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
be good and we're leaving ourselves with

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:27.290 
be good and we're leaving ourselves with
a<00:03:18.540> margin<00:03:19.080> for<00:03:19.230> error<00:03:19.410> here

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.240 

now<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.110> one<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.320> framed<00:03:28.740> it<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.950> little<00:03:29.100> bit

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
now this one I framed it a little bit

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.070 
now this one I framed it a little bit
but<00:03:29.490> it<00:03:29.580> looks<00:03:29.730> like<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.000> ball<00:03:30.180> still<00:03:30.510> fell<00:03:30.870> in

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
but it looks like the ball still fell in

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.250 
but it looks like the ball still fell in
and<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:32.370> actually<00:03:32.750> resulted<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.990> good

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
and it actually resulted in a good

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.530 
and it actually resulted in a good
return<00:03:34.710> now<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.880> kind<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.180> effect

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
return now this is the kind of effect

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.850 
return now this is the kind of effect
that<00:03:36.600> we're<00:03:36.840> looking<00:03:36.870> for<00:03:37.380> with<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.650> big

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
that we're looking for with that big

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.800 
that we're looking for with that big
target<00:03:38.340> area<00:03:38.610> because<00:03:38.910> even<00:03:39.300> when<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.450> miss

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
target area because even when you miss

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.020 
target area because even when you miss
hit<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.260> ball<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> little<00:03:40.680> bit<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.430> chances<00:03:41.910> of

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
hit the ball a little bit the chances of

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.090 
hit the ball a little bit the chances of
the<00:03:42.150> ball<00:03:42.360> falling<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:43.080> deep<00:03:43.320> are<00:03:43.530> still<00:03:43.800> very

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
the ball falling in deep are still very

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.120 
the ball falling in deep are still very
good<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:46.170> would<00:03:46.380> not<00:03:46.560> be<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.770> case<00:03:47.070> with

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
good and that would not be the case with

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.340 
good and that would not be the case with
a<00:03:47.370> smaller<00:03:47.760> target<00:03:48.090> area<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:48.660> would<00:03:48.810> result<00:03:49.170> in

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
a smaller target area it would result in

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.280 
a smaller target area it would result in
a<00:03:49.440> lot<00:03:49.620> more<00:03:49.650> errors<00:03:50.780> all<00:03:51.780> right<00:03:51.960> so<00:03:52.170> that's

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
a lot more errors all right so that's

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.110 
a lot more errors all right so that's
the<00:03:52.470> real<00:03:52.710> secret<00:03:53.250> when<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.550> comes<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.940> where

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
the real secret when it comes to where

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.090 
the real secret when it comes to where
you<00:03:54.300> should<00:03:54.540> be<00:03:54.690> aiming<00:03:54.990> on<00:03:55.380> your<00:03:55.620> return<00:03:55.920> of

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
you should be aiming on your return of

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.490 
you should be aiming on your return of
serve<00:03:56.340> if<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:57.210> can<00:03:57.390> hit<00:03:57.570> deep<00:03:57.990> down<00:03:58.290> the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
serve if you can hit deep down the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.750 
serve if you can hit deep down the
middle<00:03:58.710> you're<00:03:58.980> going<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.310> force<00:03:59.610> your

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
middle you're going to force your

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.360 
middle you're going to force your
opponent<00:03:59.820> off<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:01.170> baseline<00:04:01.590> you're<00:04:02.160> not

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
opponent off the baseline you're not

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.950 
opponent off the baseline you're not
going<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.730> give<00:04:02.850> up<00:04:02.970> any<00:04:03.120> angles<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.810> your

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
going to give up any angles to your

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.110 
going to give up any angles to your
opponent<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.590> also<00:04:05.460> you're<00:04:05.610> going<00:04:05.850> to

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
opponent and also you're going to

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.360 
opponent and also you're going to
massively<00:04:06.870> reduce<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.650> errors<00:04:08.040> that<00:04:08.070> you

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
massively reduce the errors that you

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.280 
massively reduce the errors that you
make<00:04:08.610> on<00:04:08.820> your<00:04:08.850> returns<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.600> put<00:04:09.780> more<00:04:09.990> balls

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
make on your returns and put more balls

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.260 
make on your returns and put more balls
in<00:04:10.440> play<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:11.400> this<00:04:11.550> is<00:04:11.700> an<00:04:11.790> extremely

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
in play so this is an extremely

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.590 
in play so this is an extremely
effective<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.110> underused<00:04:13.800> strategy<00:04:14.670> now

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
effective and underused strategy now

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.449 
effective and underused strategy now
next<00:04:15.930> time<00:04:16.080> you<00:04:16.230> watch<00:04:16.440> somebody<00:04:16.890> like<00:04:17.100> Novak

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
next time you watch somebody like Novak

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.210 
next time you watch somebody like Novak
Djokovic<00:04:17.640> on<00:04:18.150> TV<00:04:18.510> take<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.410> close<00:04:19.680> look<00:04:19.860> at

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
Djokovic on TV take a close look at

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.220 
Djokovic on TV take a close look at
where<00:04:20.520> he<00:04:20.730> hits<00:04:20.940> those<00:04:21.150> returns<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.780> serve<00:04:22.020> and

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
where he hits those returns of serve and

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.840 
where he hits those returns of serve and
you'll<00:04:22.320> see<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.740> lot<00:04:22.860> of<00:04:23.250> balls<00:04:23.460> are<00:04:23.700> going

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
you'll see that a lot of balls are going

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.080 
you'll see that a lot of balls are going
to<00:04:23.940> land<00:04:24.240> deep<00:04:24.990> down<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.560> middle<00:04:25.760> now<00:04:26.760> a<00:04:26.790> quick

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
to land deep down the middle now a quick

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.910 
to land deep down the middle now a quick
word<00:04:27.150> on<00:04:27.570> doubles<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.200> know<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.500> a<00:04:28.530> lot<00:04:28.800> of

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
word on doubles I know that a lot of

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.830 
word on doubles I know that a lot of
players<00:04:29.100> are<00:04:29.460> watching<00:04:29.790> these<00:04:29.880> videos<00:04:30.240> play

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
players are watching these videos play

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.110 
players are watching these videos play
doubles<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.440> course<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.400> situation<00:04:32.670> is

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
doubles of course the situation is

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.970 
doubles of course the situation is
different<00:04:33.360> in<00:04:33.660> doubles<00:04:34.050> if<00:04:34.230> you<00:04:34.830> are

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
different in doubles if you are

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.760 
different in doubles if you are
returning<00:04:35.430> against<00:04:36.150> a<00:04:36.270> server<00:04:37.140> that<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.560> going

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
returning against a server that is going

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.160 
returning against a server that is going
to<00:04:37.890> serve<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.340> volley<00:04:38.580> then<00:04:39.480> your<00:04:39.690> primary

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
to serve and volley then your primary

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.440 
to serve and volley then your primary
goal<00:04:40.260> is<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.980> get<00:04:41.130> that<00:04:41.310> return<00:04:41.520> cross-court

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
goal is to get that return cross-court

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.690 
goal is to get that return cross-court
away<00:04:42.720> from<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.170> net<00:04:43.380> player<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:43.980> to<00:04:44.370> get<00:04:44.520> that

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
away from the net player and to get that

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.390 
away from the net player and to get that
return<00:04:44.910> low<00:04:45.630> to<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.990> server's<00:04:46.470> feet<00:04:46.740> so<00:04:47.280> the

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
return low to the server's feet so the

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.830 
return low to the server's feet so the
dynamics<00:04:47.910> are<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.090> little<00:04:48.210> bit<00:04:48.390> different<00:04:48.750> in

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
dynamics are a little bit different in

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.200 
dynamics are a little bit different in
that<00:04:48.870> situation<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:50.220> that<00:04:50.430> was<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.880> third<00:04:51.180> and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
that situation so that was the third and

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.230 
that situation so that was the third and

developing effective returns of serve
now<00:04:57.030> I<00:04:57.060> really<00:04:57.420> hope<00:04:57.630> it<00:04:57.840> helped<00:04:58.110> you<00:04:58.200> improve

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
now I really hope it helped you improve

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.160 
now I really hope it helped you improve
your<00:04:59.250> return<00:04:59.670> of<00:04:59.790> serve<00:05:00.000> but<00:05:00.810> what<00:05:01.020> you<00:05:01.140> just

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
your return of serve but what you just

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.010 
your return of serve but what you just
saw<00:05:01.590> was<00:05:01.860> just<00:05:01.890> a<00:05:02.160> very<00:05:02.340> small<00:05:02.850> sample<00:05:03.360> from<00:05:03.900> my

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
saw was just a very small sample from my

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.290 
saw was just a very small sample from my

course<00:05:06.660> now<00:05:07.590> with<00:05:07.650> this<00:05:07.920> course<00:05:08.280> we're<00:05:08.520> using

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
course now with this course we're using

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.050 
course now with this course we're using
a<00:05:09.120> proven<00:05:09.770> three-step<00:05:10.770> process<00:05:11.040> where<00:05:11.880> we're

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
a proven three-step process where we're

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.510 
a proven three-step process where we're
going<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.390> identify<00:05:13.140> your<00:05:13.620> biggest<00:05:14.040> return<00:05:14.370> of

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
going to identify your biggest return of

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.790
