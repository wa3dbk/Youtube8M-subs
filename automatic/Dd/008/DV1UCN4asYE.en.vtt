select<00:01:00.039> have<00:01:01.039> a<00:01:01.070> workaround<00:01:01.429> I<00:01:01.730> came<00:01:01.940> up<00:01:02.089> with

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
select have a workaround I came up with

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.680 
select have a workaround I came up with
this<00:01:02.570> is<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:03.859> have<00:01:04.070> a<00:01:04.100> extra<00:01:04.879> wire<00:01:05.059> come<00:01:05.420> out<00:01:05.540> of

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
this is to have a extra wire come out of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.800 
this is to have a extra wire come out of
the<00:01:05.810> unit<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.860> into<00:01:07.130> your<00:01:07.280> switch<00:01:07.490> box<00:01:07.730> and<00:01:08.630> we

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
the unit and into your switch box and we

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.560 
the unit and into your switch box and we
would<00:01:08.930> use<00:01:09.080> that<00:01:09.110> extra<00:01:09.590> wire<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:10.130> turn<00:01:10.400> tap<00:01:11.270> on

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
would use that extra wire to turn tap on

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.830 
would use that extra wire to turn tap on
or<00:01:12.320> off<00:01:12.680> that<00:01:13.120> way<00:01:14.120> if<00:01:14.300> you<00:01:14.390> press<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.810> button

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
or off that way if you press the button

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.820 
or off that way if you press the button
so<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:15.350> it<00:01:15.560> was<00:01:15.710> on<00:01:16.180> or<00:01:17.180> latched<00:01:17.420> on<00:01:17.780> it<00:01:18.710> was

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
so that it was on or latched on it was

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.380 
so that it was on or latched on it was
just<00:01:18.980> like<00:01:19.100> having<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.550> tap<00:01:19.760> button<00:01:20.060> pressed

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
just like having the tap button pressed

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.990 
just like having the tap button pressed
all<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.930> time<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.470> when<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.400> tap<00:01:22.580> button<00:01:22.820> is

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
all the time and when the tap button is

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.850 
all the time and when the tap button is
pressed<00:01:23.210> we<00:01:23.930> know<00:01:24.080> that<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.350> two<00:01:24.530> buttons

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
pressed we know that the two buttons

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.420 
pressed we know that the two buttons
here<00:01:25.130> do<00:01:25.760> patch<00:01:26.000> select<00:01:26.740> now<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.800> downside<00:01:28.100> of

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
here do patch select now the downside of

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.910 
here do patch select now the downside of
that<00:01:28.670> mod<00:01:28.910> or<00:01:29.510> that<00:01:29.750> application<00:01:30.440> of<00:01:30.560> it<00:01:30.710> is

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
that mod or that application of it is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.270 
that mod or that application of it is
you<00:01:31.460> needed<00:01:31.760> basically<00:01:32.240> two<00:01:32.540> switches<00:01:33.280> one

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
you needed basically two switches one

you needed basically two switches one
switch<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.820> turn<00:01:35.030> on/off<00:01:35.530> holding<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.620> tap

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
this switch and my others is that it's

not normally off or open this switch
without<00:03:29.750> being<00:03:30.020> pressed<00:03:30.320> is<00:03:30.980> connected

without being pressed is connected

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.990 
without being pressed is connected
we're<00:03:31.940> on<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:33.230> these<00:03:33.380> two<00:03:33.680> right<00:03:34.040> now<00:03:34.250> are

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
we're on so these two right now are

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.570 
we're on so these two right now are
connected<00:03:35.480> together<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:37.400> I'm<00:03:37.459> gonna

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
connected together so I'm gonna

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.480 
connected together so I'm gonna
alligator<00:03:38.060> clip<00:03:38.360> these<00:03:38.900> wires<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.280> wires

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
alligator clip these wires to the wires

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:50.110 
alligator clip these wires to the wires
coming<00:03:40.820> out<00:03:40.940> of<00:03:41.000> my<00:03:41.240> cheese<00:03:43.270> 31<00:03:48.850> there's<00:03:49.850> two

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
coming out of my cheese 31 there's two

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.229 
coming out of my cheese 31 there's two
because<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.260> switch<00:03:51.530> as<00:03:51.800> I<00:03:51.920> said<00:03:52.160> is<00:03:52.790> already

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
because this switch as I said is already

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.410 
because this switch as I said is already
on<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:54.350> starts<00:03:54.709> off<00:03:54.860> in<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.070> on<00:03:55.280> position<00:03:55.459> or

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
on it starts off in the on position or

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.590 
on it starts off in the on position or
closed<00:03:56.810> position<00:03:57.550> it's<00:03:58.550> exactly<00:03:59.030> as<00:03:59.209> if<00:03:59.360> these

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
closed position it's exactly as if these

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.199 
closed position it's exactly as if these
two<00:03:59.840> were<00:04:00.050> touching<00:04:00.380> themselves<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:02.060> what

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
two were touching themselves so what

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.840 
two were touching themselves so what
should<00:04:02.480> happen<00:04:02.540> is<00:04:03.350> that<00:04:03.620> when<00:04:03.830> I<00:04:03.860> press<00:04:04.160> my

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
should happen is that when I press my

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.210 
should happen is that when I press my
patch<00:04:05.120> buttons<00:04:05.570> I<00:04:05.810> will<00:04:06.530> not<00:04:06.709> get<00:04:06.860> scroll

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
patch buttons I will not get scroll

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.140 
patch buttons I will not get scroll
instead<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:08.150> will<00:04:08.390> get<00:04:08.540> patched<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:10.370> there<00:04:11.030> it

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
instead I will get patched and there it

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.539 
instead I will get patched and there it
is<00:04:12.070> so<00:04:13.070> patch<00:04:13.610> works<00:04:14.800> now<00:04:15.800> here's<00:04:16.430> the

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
is so patch works now here's the

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.330 
is so patch works now here's the
coolness<00:04:16.790> about<00:04:17.150> this<00:04:17.359> new<00:04:17.570> mod<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:19.010> most<00:04:19.220> of

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
coolness about this new mod and most of

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.099 
coolness about this new mod and most of
the<00:04:19.400> mods<00:04:19.609> you<00:04:19.790> did<00:04:19.970> before<00:04:20.150> we<00:04:20.720> had<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:20.959> have<00:04:21.080> a

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
the mods you did before we had to have a

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.010 
the mods you did before we had to have a
separate<00:04:21.650> switch<00:04:22.100> one<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:23.000> would<00:04:23.150> lock<00:04:23.720> or

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
separate switch one that would lock or

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.800 
separate switch one that would lock or
unlock<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.770> tap<00:04:25.040> feature<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:26.330> then<00:04:26.539> we<00:04:26.660> could

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
unlock the tap feature and then we could

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.219 
unlock the tap feature and then we could
use<00:04:26.840> this<00:04:27.140> to<00:04:27.710> set<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.130> tap<00:04:28.310> tempo<00:04:29.020> what<00:04:30.020> we're

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
use this to set the tap tempo what we're

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.510 
use this to set the tap tempo what we're
doing<00:04:30.530> here<00:04:30.830> by<00:04:31.220> you

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
doing here by you

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.379 
doing here by you
automatically<00:04:32.270> on<00:04:32.569> switch<00:04:34.090> is<00:04:35.090> we're

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
automatically on switch is we're

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.409 
automatically on switch is we're
connecting<00:04:35.810> these<00:04:35.930> so<00:04:36.259> normally<00:04:37.270> tap<00:04:38.270> is

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
connecting these so normally tap is

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.670 
connecting these so normally tap is
pressed<00:04:38.949> if<00:04:39.949> I<00:04:40.130> press<00:04:40.430> this<00:04:40.639> button<00:04:41.680> tap

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
pressed if I press this button tap

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.600 
pressed if I press this button tap
becomes<00:04:43.210> unpressed<00:04:45.009> and<00:04:46.009> I'll<00:04:46.250> just<00:04:46.430> do<00:04:46.580> that

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
becomes unpressed and I'll just do that

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.020 
becomes unpressed and I'll just do that
a<00:04:46.759> couple<00:04:46.819> of<00:04:47.150> times<00:04:47.330> and<00:04:47.750> it's<00:04:47.960> tap<00:04:48.680> tempo

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
a couple of times and it's tap tempo

00:04:49.030 --> 00:05:04.180 
a couple of times and it's tap tempo
take<00:04:50.030> a<00:04:50.060> look<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.330> see<00:04:53.470> tempo<00:04:54.500> 59<00:04:59.169> 60<00:05:00.169> to<00:05:03.190> 150

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
take a look and see tempo 59 60 to 150

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:11.290 
take a look and see tempo 59 60 to 150
and<00:05:07.840> down<00:05:08.840> to<00:05:08.960> 44<00:05:09.440> it's<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.490> two-in-one<00:05:10.669> switch

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
and down to 44 it's a two-in-one switch

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.570 
and down to 44 it's a two-in-one switch
based<00:05:11.900> on<00:05:12.110> what<00:05:12.229> we've<00:05:12.349> previously<00:05:12.650> done<00:05:13.009> in

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
based on what we've previously done in

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.730 
based on what we've previously done in
the<00:05:13.849> one<00:05:14.030> place<00:05:14.210> it<00:05:14.810> automatically<00:05:15.289> connects

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
the one place it automatically connects

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.969 
the one place it automatically connects
the<00:05:16.490> two<00:05:16.699> solar<00:05:17.120> spots<00:05:17.449> for<00:05:18.199> tap<00:05:18.590> and<00:05:18.949> that

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
the two solar spots for tap and that

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.999 
the two solar spots for tap and that
keeps<00:05:19.789> tap<00:05:20.030> on<00:05:20.300> all<00:05:20.630> the<00:05:20.750> time<00:05:20.990> so<00:05:21.620> that<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:21.770> can

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
keeps tap on all the time so that I can

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:28.529 
keeps tap on all the time so that I can
now<00:05:22.159> use<00:05:23.319> my<00:05:24.319> patch<00:05:24.530> select<00:05:25.009> buttons<00:05:27.250> and

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
now use my patch select buttons and

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.510 
now use my patch select buttons and
we've<00:05:29.539> also<00:05:29.690> have<00:05:30.020> a<00:05:30.050> dedicated<00:05:30.800> tap<00:05:31.130> tempo

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
we've also have a dedicated tap tempo

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.100 
we've also have a dedicated tap tempo
button<00:05:31.699> because<00:05:32.659> when<00:05:32.810> I<00:05:32.840> press<00:05:33.139> it<00:05:33.699> and

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
button because when I press it and

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:43.540 
button because when I press it and
release<00:05:37.659> I'm<00:05:38.659> getting<00:05:39.020> my<00:05:39.139> tempo<00:05:42.550> normally

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
release I'm getting my tempo normally

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.370 
release I'm getting my tempo normally
the<00:05:43.639> tap<00:05:43.849> tempo<00:05:44.090> would<00:05:44.419> work<00:05:44.599> when<00:05:45.199> you

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
the tap tempo would work when you

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.850 
the tap tempo would work when you
pressed<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:46.130> button<00:05:46.389> now<00:05:47.389> it's<00:05:47.630> working

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
pressed the button now it's working

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.260 
pressed the button now it's working
essentially<00:05:48.860> when<00:05:49.039> the<00:05:49.070> switch<00:05:49.550> is<00:05:49.820> being

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
essentially when the switch is being

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.999 
essentially when the switch is being
released<00:05:51.639> but<00:05:52.639> again<00:05:53.050> little<00:05:54.050> fix<00:05:54.289> to<00:05:54.919> our

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
released but again little fix to our

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:58.830 
released but again little fix to our
previous<00:05:55.280> mods<00:05:55.580> is<00:05:55.909> by<00:05:56.750> a<00:05:57.039> normally<00:05:58.039> closed

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
previous mods is by a normally closed

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.480

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
momentary switch wire that to your to

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.459 
momentary switch wire that to your to
tap<00:06:04.810> button<00:06:05.810> solder<00:06:06.229> spots<00:06:07.270> and<00:06:08.270> you<00:06:08.300> get<00:06:09.259> tap

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:29.430 

that's<00:06:19.490> it<00:06:19.729> good<00:06:20.360> luck
