00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.260 
coming up very very soon and I do have a
little<00:01:32.070> bit<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.460> different<00:01:32.490> take<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.150> on

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
little bit of a different take on it on

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.630 
little bit of a different take on it on
the<00:01:33.360> deck<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.500> doesn't<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:34.979> revolve

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the deck and it doesn't just revolve

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.910 
the deck and it doesn't just revolve
around<00:01:35.850> some<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.299> revolution<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
around some of the revolution so it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
around some of the revolution so it
means<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.729> don't<00:01:39.000> draw<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.420> you

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
means that if you don't draw this you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.940 
means that if you don't draw this you
don't<00:01:39.810> die<00:01:40.110> instantly<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.299> we<00:01:43.200> shall<00:01:43.590> go<00:01:43.890> to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
don't die instantly so we shall go to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.179 
don't die instantly so we shall go to
the<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:45.869> here<00:01:46.409> we<00:01:47.159> have

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the right and you can see here we have

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.639

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
very cool deck concept one that I have

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
looked into for a long time of how

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.490 
looked into for a long time of how
convulsion<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:42.180> nature<00:04:42.480> for<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.720> very<00:04:43.230> long

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
convulsion and nature for a very long

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.870 
convulsion and nature for a very long
time<00:04:43.560> if<00:04:44.040> you<00:04:44.130> don't<00:04:44.160> know<00:04:44.370> what<00:04:44.460> it<00:04:44.580> does<00:04:44.700> it's

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
time if you don't know what it does it's

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.210 
time if you don't know what it does it's
a<00:04:44.970> very<00:04:45.180> old<00:04:45.300> card<00:04:45.680> basically<00:04:46.680> it's<00:04:47.160> a

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
a very old card basically it's a

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.400 
a very old card basically it's a
continuous<00:04:47.700> spell<00:04:47.940> card<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.390> turns<00:04:49.080> the

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
continuous spell card that turns the

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.890 
continuous spell card that turns the
decks<00:04:49.680> upside<00:04:50.280> down<00:04:50.550> so<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:51.240> see<00:04:51.540> what<00:04:51.720> your

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
decks upside down so you see what your

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.560 
compulsion in nature but we will get
into<00:06:19.560> that<00:06:19.740> later<00:06:19.890> on<00:06:20.040> but<00:06:20.760> so<00:06:20.970> that's<00:06:21.180> kind<00:06:21.480> of

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
into that later on but so that's kind of
