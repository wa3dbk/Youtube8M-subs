00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hello dear friends of the audience 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.470
 subscribers of my channel in this video we 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.910
 talk about samsung galaxy tab 3 10.1 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.980
 for a start I suggest to run through 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.509
 appearance of the device on the bottom 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.719
 front panel we can see two 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.940
 touch menu keys and back and also 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.710
 almost all home hardware key 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.710
 the front of the tablet takes the elevator 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.570
 display with a resolution of 1280 by 800 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.510
 destroyed by a small number of points 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.099
 here we find only 149 at the top 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.000
 parts of the tablet we can see the logo 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.880
 of the company 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.640
 front camera light sensor and 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.950
 approaching the back of the tablets 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.680
 3 resolution camera is located 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.750
 megapixels and samsung company logo 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.480
 on the top of the tablet is located 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.129
 most of all elements namely button 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.700
 lock adjustment rocker 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.699
 volume connector for micro sd cards and 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.050
 port and connector for micro sim cards on the left 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.449
 the tablet is a headphone jack 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.430
 and one of the speakers on the right side 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.809
 tablet in splendid isolation 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.309
 the second speaker is located now 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.650
 let's talk about the characteristics of this 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.470
 device tablet is equipped with dual-core 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.840
 16 GHz processor 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.450
 ram 1 gigabyte and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.760
 built-in memory of 32 gigabytes also 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.520
 micro sd memory cards up to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.500
 64 gigabyte powervr video processor 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.610
 sgx544 mp2 tablet supports gps 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.460
 glonass 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.350
 there is an accelerometer compass tablet 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.689
 supports 3g s ii lte and unfortunately 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.280
 he is not friendly this device weighs 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.409
 only 512 grams 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.020
 if ip 3 compare there 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.240
 weightless ending with characteristics 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.579
 I would like to talk about synthetic 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.720
 tests I tested the tablet in antutu 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.820
 and nenamark2 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.939
 I suggest to look at the results in 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.909
 antutu tablet showed 19200 73 points 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.619
 this is a decent result but he still 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.619
 quite far behind such 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.250
 devices like htc one lg g2 and samsung 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.110
 galaxy laptop 3 nenamark2 issued 60fps 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.909
 good result for this tablet 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.340
 despite weak entrails 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.500
 the tablet works very well without lags 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.539
 And brakes show damn it 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.310
 I won't be a tablet because I just don't 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.290
 see meaning he is not waiting for 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.750
 perfect for surfing 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.060
 on the internet to sit on YouTube or 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.810
 view movies by reviewing the design 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.150
 devices 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.560
 having talked about the characteristics having studied 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.360
 synthetic tests 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.849
 I propose to conclude this 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.500
 device in my opinion this tablet 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.810
 perfect for those who only 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.540
 gets acquainted with the world of tablets measured 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.190
 android in general this tablet is perfect for 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.780
 those users who are not 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.550
 reflect on the characteristics 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.160
 devices for more demanding 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.260
 users or gamers advise 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.819
 start at least with ipad 4 but here 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.430
 there is a sharp price issues 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.410
 apple products are much more expensive here and 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.420
 all i wanted to say about samsung galaxy 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.489
 tab 3 10.1 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.930

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.930
