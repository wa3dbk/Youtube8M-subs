we've<00:00:47.730> got<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:48.120> that's<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.480> progress<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.230> is

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
we've got one that's in progress this is

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.880 
we've got one that's in progress this is
-<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.950> progress<00:00:50.449> Tim<00:00:51.449> actually<00:00:51.719> made<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.350> PCBs

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
- in progress Tim actually made the PCBs

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.639 
- in progress Tim actually made the PCBs
on<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.660> close<00:00:54.840> here<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.500> can

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
on this if you get in close here you can

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.319 
on this if you get in close here you can
see<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.100> these<00:00:56.340> are<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.640> whole<00:00:56.940> bunch<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
see that these are a whole bunch of

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.979 
see that these are a whole bunch of
cherry<00:00:57.780> switches<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.980> every<00:01:01.980> single

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
cherry switches and every single

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.630 
cherry switches and every single
individual<00:01:03.989> one<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.229> these<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.530> soldered<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
individual one of these is soldered you

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.609 
individual one of these is soldered you
can<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.479> top<00:01:06.810> board<00:01:07.140> but

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
can see this is just the top board but

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.740 
can see this is just the top board but
Tim<00:01:08.040> has<00:01:08.070> put<00:01:08.400> together<00:01:08.520> both<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.630> these

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
Tim has put together both of these

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.800 
Tim has put together both of these
boards<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.400> there's<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.670> bottom<00:01:12.240> board<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.600> well

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
boards so there's a bottom board as well

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.770 
boards so there's a bottom board as well
underneath<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.890> bottom<00:01:14.220> board<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.630> see

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
underneath the bottom board you can see

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.280 
underneath the bottom board you can see
we've<00:01:15.900> got<00:01:16.020> these<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:16.590> tactile<00:01:17.130> switches

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
we've got these little tactile switches

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.890 
we've got these little tactile switches
that<00:01:19.290> run<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> bottom<00:01:20.189> see<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.630> flip

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
that run on the bottom see if I flip

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.760 
that run on the bottom see if I flip
this<00:01:22.080> over<00:01:23.299> see<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.259> I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this over see if I can get you to see I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.289 
this over see if I can get you to see I
don't<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:26.040> if<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.729> gonna<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> little

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
don't know if this is gonna be a little

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.109 
don't know if this is gonna be a little
bit<00:01:27.479> much<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.500> these<00:01:28.740> cherry<00:01:29.549> switches<00:01:29.970> when

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
bit much but these cherry switches when

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.469 
bit much but these cherry switches when
you<00:01:30.270> pull<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.280> little<00:01:32.280> nub<00:01:32.610> off<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.060> bottom

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
you pull the little nub off the bottom

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.390 
you pull the little nub off the bottom
has<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> little<00:01:34.020> plunger<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.829> goes<00:01:35.100> all<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
has a little plunger that goes all the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.440 
has a little plunger that goes all the
way<00:01:35.549> through<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:38.100> will<00:01:38.340> make<00:01:38.549> contact<00:01:39.180> with

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
way through that will make contact with

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.660 
way through that will make contact with
the<00:01:39.780> tactile<00:01:40.320> switches<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the tactile switches and you get a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.480 
the tactile switches and you get a
slight<00:01:42.060> time<00:01:42.420> delay<00:01:43.220> between<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:46.380> top<00:01:47.220> switch

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
slight time delay between the top switch

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
slight time delay between the top switch
being<00:01:47.700> push<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.210> bottom<00:01:48.540> switch<00:01:48.689> being

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
being push and the bottom switch being

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.380 
being push and the bottom switch being
pushed<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.159> that's<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.700> gives<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
pushed and that's what gives you the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.080 
pushed and that's what gives you the
velocity<00:01:51.570> sensitive<00:01:53.810> keyboard<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.700> yeah<00:01:56.700> you

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
velocity sensitive keyboard so yeah you

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.090 
velocity sensitive keyboard so yeah you
wanna<00:01:57.270> play<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.570> little<00:01:57.810> bit<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.469> see

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
wanna play a little bit so we can see

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.050 
wanna play a little bit so we can see
how<00:01:59.219> yours<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.670> working

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
how yours is working

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.660 
how yours is working
yeah<00:02:00.450> I'm<00:02:00.509> triggering<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.290> piano<00:02:01.649> sample<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.549> we

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
yeah I'm triggering a piano sample so we

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.990 
yeah I'm triggering a piano sample so we
can<00:02:02.850> see<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
can see the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.880 
can see the
Dynamix<00:02:05.000> basically<00:02:11.020> getting<00:02:12.020> this<00:02:12.440> should<00:02:12.740> be

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
Dynamix basically getting this should be

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:21.610 
Dynamix basically getting this should be
a<00:02:12.920> velocity<00:02:13.460> of<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:13.970> barely<00:02:14.900> audible<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
a velocity of one barely audible and the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.130 
a velocity of one barely audible and the
the<00:02:21.980> key<00:02:22.160> layout<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.850> basically<00:02:23.840> there's

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
the key layout is basically there's

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.770 
the key layout is basically there's
fifths<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.850> columns<00:02:28.090> diagonally<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.570> the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
fifths and the columns diagonally to the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.730 
fifths and the columns diagonally to the
right<00:02:30.050> is<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.500> major<00:02:31.190> third<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.500> left

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
right is a major third and to the left

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.200 
right is a major third and to the left
is<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> minor<00:02:34.190> third<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:36.590> once<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.040> get<00:02:37.160> hex<00:02:37.820> key

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
is a minor third so once you get hex key

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.330 
is a minor third so once you get hex key
caps<00:02:38.510> on<00:02:38.720> here<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:39.140> can<00:02:39.170> do<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.470> triad<00:02:40.070> with<00:02:40.190> one

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
caps on here you can do a triad with one

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.410 
caps on here you can do a triad with one
finger<00:02:40.580> it's<00:02:40.820> kind<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.000> hard<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.180> do<00:02:41.330> with

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
finger it's kind of hard to do with

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.660 
finger it's kind of hard to do with
these<00:02:41.570> keyboard<00:02:41.990> keys<00:02:42.170> but<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:46.340> all<00:02:46.520> the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
these keyboard keys but so all the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.630 
these keyboard keys but so all the
chords<00:02:47.120> are<00:02:47.480> just<00:02:47.959> patterns<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:49.130> in<00:02:49.310> order<00:02:49.550> to

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
chords are just patterns so in order to

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.160 
chords are just patterns so in order to
move<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.940> chord<00:02:50.209> from<00:02:50.360> one<00:02:50.600> key<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.990> another

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
move a chord from one key to another

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.820 
move a chord from one key to another
it's<00:02:51.890> just<00:02:52.040> moving<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.550> same<00:02:52.760> pattern<00:02:53.830> around

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
it's just moving the same pattern around

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.850 
it's just moving the same pattern around
on<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.100> keyboard<00:02:59.200> so<00:03:00.200> still<00:03:00.560> doing<00:03:00.740> some

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
on the keyboard so still doing some

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.050 
on the keyboard so still doing some
learning<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.190> how<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.459> actually<00:03:01.610> play<00:03:01.910> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
learning on how to actually play the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.970 
learning on how to actually play the
thing<00:03:02.240> but<00:03:02.530> hoping<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.620> would<00:03:03.709> be<00:03:03.740> more

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
thing but hoping it would be more

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.580 
thing but hoping it would be more
intuitive<00:03:04.190> than<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.580> piano<00:03:05.050> very<00:03:06.050> cool<00:03:06.320> and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
intuitive than a piano very cool and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.190 
intuitive than a piano very cool and
next<00:03:07.490> step<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:07.880> we're<00:03:08.000> gonna<00:03:08.060> do<00:03:08.510> some<00:03:08.989> key

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
next step is we're gonna do some key

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.410 
next step is we're gonna do some key
caps<00:03:09.470> on<00:03:09.739> these<00:03:09.950> as<00:03:10.220> well<00:03:10.400> some<00:03:10.730> hexagonal<00:03:11.239> key

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
caps on these as well some hexagonal key

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.140 
caps on these as well some hexagonal key
caps<00:03:11.630> we're<00:03:11.780> gonna<00:03:11.870> manufacture<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:14.000> is

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
caps we're gonna manufacture this is

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.060 
caps we're gonna manufacture this is
some<00:03:14.330> color<00:03:14.540> coordination<00:03:15.050> so<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.560> actually

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
some color coordination so you actually

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.590 
some color coordination so you actually
know<00:03:16.280> where<00:03:16.459> you're<00:03:16.610> at<00:03:16.640> on<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:16.940> keyboard<00:03:17.480> as

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
know where you're at on the keyboard as

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.420 
know where you're at on the keyboard as
well<00:03:18.610> overall<00:03:19.610> an<00:03:19.820> excellent<00:03:20.239> project
