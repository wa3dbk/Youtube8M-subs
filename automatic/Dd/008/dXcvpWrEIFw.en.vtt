00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
ants and the car was sold so I use the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.200 
ants and the car was sold so I use the
existing<00:00:16.260> setup<00:00:16.680> while<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.340> up<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.090> it

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
and this last must fit that was here

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.660 
and this last must fit that was here
everything<00:00:22.650> all<00:00:22.740> split<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.279> last<00:00:23.490> one

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670

this<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.949> when<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.099> soldered<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.670> there<00:00:27.630> was<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
this is when I soldered it there was a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.330 
this is when I soldered it there was a
little<00:00:27.930> bit<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.230> run<00:00:28.380> by<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.619> soldering<00:00:29.070> raid

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340

little bit of run by this soldering raid
left<00:00:29.609> over<00:00:29.789> from<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> previous<00:00:30.090> job<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.289> it's

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
left over from the previous job but it's

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.090 
left over from the previous job but it's
short<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.859> these<00:00:32.009> two<00:00:32.279> BT<00:00:32.669> together<00:00:34.100> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
short of these two BT together the

collector and emitter the shorted

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.160 
collector and emitter the shorted
together<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.160> wire<00:00:38.309> soldered<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.930> very<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
together but the wire soldered it very a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.690 
together but the wire soldered it very a
little<00:00:40.620> couple<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.070> strands<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.579> are

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
little couple of strands of this are

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.119 
little couple of strands of this are
left<00:00:41.850> behind<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.440> it's<00:00:43.440> short<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> giver

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
left behind and it's short of the giver

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.650 
left behind and it's short of the giver
I<00:00:44.219> couldn't<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.789> why<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.239> known<00:00:45.390> until<00:00:45.600> I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
I couldn't see why it was known until I

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.910 
I couldn't see why it was known until I
look<00:00:45.809> really<00:00:46.079> closely<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> sort<00:00:46.860> of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
look really closely and I sort of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.190 
look really closely and I sort of
thought<00:00:47.219> they<00:00:47.460> were<00:00:47.550> short<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:47.910> together<00:00:48.200> and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
thought they were short up together and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.180 
thought they were short up together and
blew<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> emitter<00:00:49.980> off<00:00:50.160> monied<00:00:50.460> fit<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:52.190> got

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
blew the emitter off monied fit I got

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.580 
blew the emitter off monied fit I got
another<00:00:53.370> one<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:53.780> as<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> replacement<00:00:55.140> saying

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
another one here as a replacement saying

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.160 
another one here as a replacement saying
this<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.670> they<00:00:56.730> all<00:00:56.850> said<00:00:57.059> tests<00:00:57.449> good<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.079> I'm

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

never<00:01:42.869> turn<00:01:43.140> these<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.820> about<00:01:44.820> 4.5<00:01:45.390> volts

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
never turn these to about 4.5 volts

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.770 
never turn these to about 4.5 volts
exactly<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.710> same<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.070> him<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.430> then<00:01:48.000> they

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
exactly the same with him and then they

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.850 
exactly the same with him and then they
were<00:01:48.840> getting<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> same

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
were getting the same

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.370 
were getting the same
both<00:01:51.860> thirsty<00:01:52.700> Oh<00:01:52.730> got<00:01:53.270> nothing<00:01:53.690> there<00:01:54.290> you've

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
both thirsty Oh got nothing there you've

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.780 
both thirsty Oh got nothing there you've
got<00:01:54.410> nothing<00:01:54.830> there<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:55.490> go

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
got nothing there you go

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.460 
got nothing there you go
I<00:01:55.820> think<00:01:56.300> in<00:01:56.570> those<00:01:56.750> first<00:01:56.990> two<00:01:57.170> look<00:01:57.350> with

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
I think in those first two look with

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.460 
I think in those first two look with
nothing<00:01:57.970> but<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.180> voltage<00:01:59.270> gating<00:01:59.840> four<00:02:00.320> and

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
nothing but the voltage gating four and

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.980 
nothing but the voltage gating four and
a<00:02:00.500> half<00:02:00.530> volts<00:02:00.830> is<00:02:01.040> going<00:02:01.310> into<00:02:01.550> them<00:02:01.990> but

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
a half volts is going into them but

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.630 
a half volts is going into them but
these<00:02:03.200> actually<00:02:03.470> working<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:09.610> mass<00:02:10.610> is

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
these actually working so mass is

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.420 
these actually working so mass is
something<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.330> I'd<00:02:11.900> far<00:02:12.170> verify<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.100> father

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
something that I'd far verify the father

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.250 
something that I'd far verify the father
