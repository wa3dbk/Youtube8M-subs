lost all of your items although you

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.510 
lost all of your items although you
could<00:02:45.480> get<00:02:45.660> them<00:02:45.780> back<00:02:45.930> technically<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:46.680> if

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
could get them back technically but if

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.950 
could get them back technically but if
they<00:02:47.970> were<00:02:48.030> too<00:02:48.240> far<00:02:48.420> away<00:02:48.570> or<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.840> were

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
they were too far away or you were

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.630 
they were too far away or you were
exploring<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.410> couldn't<00:02:49.650> get<00:02:49.740> them<00:02:49.890> back<00:02:50.070> so

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
exploring you couldn't get them back so

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.010 
exploring you couldn't get them back so
if<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.850> sort<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.450> lose<00:02:51.660> all<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.900> your

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
if you sort of you lose all of your

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.380 
if you sort of you lose all of your
experience<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:52.860> die<00:02:53.040> which<00:02:53.280> makes<00:02:53.520> the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
experience if you die which makes the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.090 
experience if you die which makes the
risk<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.750> much<00:02:55.110> greater<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.680> better<00:02:55.890> you

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
risk that much greater the better you

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.710 
risk that much greater the better you
get<00:02:56.250> at<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.400> game<00:02:56.670> which<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.510> really

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
get at the game which is really

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.060 
get at the game which is really
interesting<00:02:57.930> it's<00:02:58.290> sort<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:58.560> an<00:02:58.680> inverse

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
interesting it's sort of like an inverse

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.860 
interesting it's sort of like an inverse
function<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.580> how<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.850> all<00:02:59.940> works<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.660> better

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
function of how it all works the better

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.050 
function of how it all works the better
you<00:03:01.050> are<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.560> higher<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.980> challenges<00:03:02.580> the

you are the higher the challenges the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.360 
you are the higher the challenges the
more<00:03:03.390> save<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.780> have<00:03:03.960> to<00:03:04.110> be<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.800> I'm<00:03:05.190> not

animation<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:58.260> I'm<00:03:58.350> sure<00:03:58.640> c418<00:03:59.640> is<00:03:59.910> working

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
animation and I'm sure c418 is working

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.510 
animation and I'm sure c418 is working
on<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.450> sound<00:04:00.630> effects<00:04:00.870> for<00:04:01.130> which<00:04:02.130> is<00:04:02.280> great

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
on the sound effects for which is great

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.970 
on the sound effects for which is great
because<00:04:02.959> not<00:04:03.959> actually<00:04:04.320> was<00:04:04.440> talking<00:04:04.739> about

doesn't have joints and the animations
are<00:04:11.610> certainly<00:04:11.850> going<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.030> be<00:04:12.090> interesting<00:04:12.570> I

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
are certainly going to be interesting I

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.750 
are certainly going to be interesting I

what Jeb was hinting at here as you say
the<00:04:42.630> chicken<00:04:42.900> maybe<00:04:43.050> too<00:04:43.320> smooth<00:04:43.530> compared<00:04:43.950> to

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
the chicken maybe too smooth compared to

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.340 
the chicken maybe too smooth compared to
other<00:04:44.160> minecraft<00:04:44.640> items<00:04:44.970> so<00:04:45.390> yeah<00:04:45.960> we're

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
other minecraft items so yeah we're

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.330 
other minecraft items so yeah we're
gonna<00:04:46.470> have<00:04:46.740> chicken<00:04:47.280> which<00:04:48.150> is<00:04:48.240> interesting

gonna have chicken which is interesting

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.560 
gonna have chicken which is interesting
the<00:04:50.340> fact<00:04:50.550> that<00:04:50.610> we<00:04:50.760> have<00:04:50.880> new<00:04:51.000> food<00:04:51.180> options

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
the fact that we have new food options

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.330 
the fact that we have new food options
is<00:04:51.690> absolutely<00:04:52.140> great<00:04:52.260> an<00:04:52.560> interesting

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
is absolutely great an interesting

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
is absolutely great an interesting
thought<00:04:53.490> is<00:04:53.670> if<00:04:53.850> you're<00:04:54.000> going<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.240> be

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
thought is if you're going to be

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.590 
thought is if you're going to be
exploring<00:04:54.900> though<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.350> lot<00:04:55.590> underground<00:04:56.160> as

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
exploring though a lot underground as

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.030 
exploring though a lot underground as
we're<00:04:57.600> getting<00:04:57.810> new<00:04:57.930> strongholds<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:58.830> new

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
we're getting new strongholds and new

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.950 
we're getting new strongholds and new
ravines<00:04:59.400> and<00:04:59.520> all<00:04:59.640> that<00:04:59.820> will<00:05:00.450> there<00:05:00.600> be<00:05:00.630> food

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
ravines and all that will there be food

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.820 
ravines and all that will there be food
options<00:05:01.380> underground<00:05:02.300> um<00:05:03.300> will<00:05:04.020> there<00:05:04.200> I<00:05:04.470> know

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
options underground um will there I know

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.410 
options underground um will there I know
we<00:05:05.100> have<00:05:05.250> mushrooms<00:05:05.700> right<00:05:05.850> now<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.120> mushroom

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
we have mushrooms right now and mushroom

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.440 
we have mushrooms right now and mushroom
stews<00:05:06.720> but<00:05:07.500> will<00:05:07.950> there<00:05:08.130> be<00:05:08.160> mobs<00:05:08.550> that<00:05:08.940> we<00:05:09.270> can

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
stews but will there be mobs that we can

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.930 
stews but will there be mobs that we can
kill<00:05:10.050> for<00:05:10.320> food<00:05:10.470> for<00:05:10.740> example<00:05:10.880> think<00:05:11.880> about

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
kill for food for example think about

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.580 
kill for food for example think about
zombies<00:05:12.420> they<00:05:12.600> they<00:05:12.900> only<00:05:13.050> drop<00:05:13.290> feathers

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
zombies they they only drop feathers

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.510 
zombies they they only drop feathers
right<00:05:13.740> now<00:05:13.920> and<00:05:14.040> feathers<00:05:14.310> aren't

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
right now and feathers aren't

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.940 
right now and feathers aren't
particularly<00:05:14.910> useful<00:05:15.390> because<00:05:15.750> they're<00:05:16.620> used

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
particularly useful because they're used

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.970 
particularly useful because they're used
as<00:05:17.880> far<00:05:18.180> as<00:05:18.300> I<00:05:18.390> can<00:05:18.450> remember<00:05:19.110> only<00:05:19.620> four

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
as far as I can remember only four

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.250 
as far as I can remember only four
arrows<00:05:20.550> and<00:05:20.730> chickens<00:05:21.630> already<00:05:21.900> dropped<00:05:22.110> that

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
arrows and chickens already dropped that

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.460 
arrows and chickens already dropped that
and<00:05:22.440> skeletons<00:05:22.980> already<00:05:23.280> drop<00:05:23.460> arrows<00:05:23.850> so

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
and skeletons already drop arrows so

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.620 
and skeletons already drop arrows so
it's<00:05:25.470> sort<00:05:25.680> of<00:05:25.830> like<00:05:25.950> overkill<00:05:26.520> so<00:05:27.090> maybe

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
it's sort of like overkill so maybe

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.200 
it's sort of like overkill so maybe
zombies<00:05:28.080> will<00:05:28.290> or<00:05:28.890> that's<00:05:29.370> not<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:29.610> can't<00:05:30.060> say

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
zombies will or that's not I can't say

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.640 
zombies will or that's not I can't say
maybe<00:05:30.480> because<00:05:30.960> that's<00:05:31.320> something<00:05:31.470> I'm

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
maybe because that's something I'm

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.870 
maybe because that's something I'm
hoping<00:05:31.950> for<00:05:32.190> but<00:05:33.980> it's<00:05:34.980> something<00:05:35.430> to<00:05:35.550> keep<00:05:35.790> in

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
hoping for but it's something to keep in

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.340 
hoping for but it's something to keep in
mind<00:05:35.970> what<00:05:36.360> new<00:05:36.600> food<00:05:36.870> options<00:05:37.200> will<00:05:37.320> be

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
mind what new food options will be

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.870 
mind what new food options will be
explored<00:05:37.830> for<00:05:38.010> the<00:05:38.100> underground<00:05:38.520> and<00:05:38.760> the

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
explored for the underground and the

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.630 
explored for the underground and the
final<00:05:39.210> thing<00:05:39.240> that<00:05:39.420> Jeb<00:05:39.920> mentioned<00:05:40.920> was<00:05:41.610> that

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
final thing that Jeb mentioned was that

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.900 
final thing that Jeb mentioned was that
he<00:05:42.030> is<00:05:42.120> adding<00:05:42.420> in<00:05:42.540> windows<00:05:43.040> which<00:05:44.040> looks<00:05:44.580> cool

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
he is adding in windows which looks cool

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.940 
he is adding in windows which looks cool
it's<00:05:45.390> a<00:05:45.510> nice<00:05:45.630> aesthetic<00:05:45.870> little<00:05:46.500> addition

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
it's a nice aesthetic little addition

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.400 
it's a nice aesthetic little addition
i'm<00:05:47.280> not<00:05:47.850> sure<00:05:48.090> what<00:05:48.390> it's<00:05:48.570> going<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:49.050> add<00:05:49.230> to

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
i'm not sure what it's going to add to

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.200 
i'm not sure what it's going to add to
the<00:05:49.500> game<00:05:49.680> really<00:05:49.920> though<00:05:50.160> yeah<00:05:50.850> it<00:05:51.090> looks

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
the game really though yeah it looks

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.740 
the game really though yeah it looks
like<00:05:51.450> basically<00:05:52.260> retextured<00:05:52.950> fences<00:05:53.400> that

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
like basically retextured fences that

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.850 
like basically retextured fences that
probably<00:05:54.750> don't<00:05:55.050> have<00:05:55.110> the<00:05:55.470> same<00:05:55.650> height

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
probably don't have the same height

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.640 
probably don't have the same height
limit<00:05:56.160> as<00:05:56.250> fences<00:05:56.640> and<00:05:57.450> I<00:05:57.660> can<00:05:57.810> tell<00:05:58.050> Oregon

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
limit as fences and I can tell Oregon

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.820 
limit as fences and I can tell Oregon
sort<00:05:58.890> of<00:05:58.950> figure<00:05:59.700> that<00:05:59.940> it's<00:06:00.470> based<00:06:01.470> on<00:06:01.680> the

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
sort of figure that it's based on the

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.020 
sort of figure that it's based on the
fence<00:06:02.040> structure<00:06:02.400> because<00:06:02.640> of<00:06:02.760> the<00:06:02.820> way<00:06:02.910> it

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
fence structure because of the way it

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.930 
fence structure because of the way it
bends<00:06:03.240> here<00:06:03.720> and<00:06:03.930> how<00:06:04.590> it's<00:06:04.890> basically<00:06:05.700> in<00:06:05.850> the

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
bends here and how it's basically in the

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.810 
bends here and how it's basically in the
same<00:06:05.970> position<00:06:06.540> in<00:06:06.780> shape<00:06:07.350> as<00:06:07.560> fences<00:06:08.070> I<00:06:08.280> mean

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
same position in shape as fences I mean

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.300 
same position in shape as fences I mean
what<00:06:09.060> more<00:06:09.210> can<00:06:09.330> be<00:06:09.450> said<00:06:09.480> and<00:06:09.920> it's<00:06:10.920> basically

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
what more can be said and it's basically

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.880 
what more can be said and it's basically
just<00:06:11.430> like<00:06:11.700> one<00:06:12.030> pane<00:06:12.330> of<00:06:12.660> glass<00:06:12.720> that<00:06:13.080> goes<00:06:13.560> in

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
just like one pane of glass that goes in

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.300 
just like one pane of glass that goes in
between<00:06:14.420> blocks<00:06:15.470> an<00:06:16.470> interesting<00:06:16.950> aesthetic

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
between blocks an interesting aesthetic

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.870 
between blocks an interesting aesthetic
addition<00:06:17.910> and<00:06:18.200> I<00:06:19.200> really<00:06:19.500> can't<00:06:19.710> wait<00:06:19.920> and<00:06:20.160> I
