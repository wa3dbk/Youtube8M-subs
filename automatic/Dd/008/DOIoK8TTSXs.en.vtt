 great bomb for us reaches the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.500
 four o'clock in the morning more or 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.360

 also for pc yes indeed as 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.500
 the listening is already totally 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.790
 confirmed are no longer rumors or shit 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.860
 is fully confirmed in the 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.030
 conference of that as I say went to the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.230
 four o'clock in the morning when 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.180
 we are all there sleeping 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.260
 then there they release the piece of evidence the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.660
 true they are super smart 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.370
 obviously that good conference that 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.630
 event is performed in the angels and 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.010
 just when here are four and 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.690
 average because there is day or night 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.860
 darkening so obviously the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.450
 news was for the people there not 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.310
 for the people of Spain, but not as 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.900
 I say I found out exactly the same 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.030
 when you lift you will look at what my mother has 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.770

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.380
 be amazing and good then this is the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.270
 gta 5 to playstation 4 ipc 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.070
 will go as they said at the conference 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.680
 the end of this year is the end of 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.570
 2014 in autumn more or less worth and good 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.009
 well tell you that this can be improved 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.209
 in gt5 then we can now basically 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.530
 all by the way by the way super 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.360
 important to leave is right down in 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.310
 the description a link which will carry 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.950
 to a trailer that has published rock star 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.510
 on its official channel de de gea 5 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.160
 obviously the good as I say also 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.570
 good to leave the link in Spanish for 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.040
 that you understand it better and good as well as 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.270
 I say in that link that I will leave the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.100
 description is a trailer of which 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.989
 published just when in the 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.739
 sony conference said that this 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.000
 good that is 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.000
 for the cne they have and pc 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.219
 Automatically published this trailer 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.079
 so that people would see what it would look like 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.400
 and as you are going to see good I will have 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.840
 just below the description and the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.430
 graphics that you will see in that trailers 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.900
 and you put it to 1080p or I recommend that 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.280
 put on the highest quality so that 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.840
 appreciate the great quality that has the time 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.879
 when seen my mother is tealight 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.069
 The good one is awesome and as I say 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.450
 because this trailer is taken from faces 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.189
 with 4 for is recording soon is 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.299
 recorded on playstation 4 so you can 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:57.890
 see how this game will look in 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.569
 playstation 4 that madryn already communicated 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.769
 he looks impressively impressive 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.150
 although this phrase does not exist but I 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.010
 I say because it 's super-printed earlier 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.409
 but as I say you can improve this in 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.030
 the game so it comes out for pc and a 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.530
 little one impression 4 the first thing that 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.150
 can improve graphics to the graph going 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.560
 to be awesome is also going to improve 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.030
 how good there are going to be many more people 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.560
 the street the good the game is going to be able 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.209
 throw a lot more on the consoles because 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.680
 you know that the consoles since well 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.209
 they are much more powerful than it is 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.220
 playstation 3 xbox360 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.870
 so as I say there are going to be many more 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.760
 cars many more people many more 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.319
 many more planes of everything is going to see 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.669
 everything we are going to give his because we can 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.319
 buy more guys picking up the remains 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.669
 sincerely I have no idea but 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.200
 we will see it as the 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.609
 obviously I have the xbox here 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.750
 one so when it comes out then what 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.220
 you will have here in the channel and percent 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.540
 this summer I'm going to catch a pc 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.460
 of this so super powerful to be able 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.950
 play on pc and such and then then to me 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.110
 5 of tpc that as you know I started then 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.670
 you can measure all the modes like 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.140
 cycles in the world be neither playstation 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.760
 hacked or wrong 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.560
 in fish where you can really get into 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.060
 all the modes you want to use this goes 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.140
 to be awesome from 7 to 5 I started 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.540
 because Madrid is bird will be able 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.680
 poke up even flying pigs that 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.390
 I catch the news I wanted to comment 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.740
 you have the link of the trailer just 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.180
 down in the description I do not know what you think 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.770
 of this I suppose that everyone thinks 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.270
 that to see although there are people who do not 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.710
 can afford the new consoles 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.150
 generation with a powerful position for 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.290
 can play this game but good 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.520
 I guess people will be happy 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.900
 especially since good at least 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.610
 also on youtube, there will be new 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.710
 content we will not be able to upload 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.910
 different videos when low and not even 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.470
 well to interest everyone 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.640
 so as I say I hope there 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.900
 liked this edition by the team 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.460

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.840
 is coming out new about stress or 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.040
