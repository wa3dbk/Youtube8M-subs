00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
be perfectly honest I was kind of hoping

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340

that<00:00:51.000> after<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.360> drama<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> last<00:00:52.140> one

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
that after the drama with the last one

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.389 
that after the drama with the last one
that<00:00:52.379> they<00:00:52.590> would<00:00:52.710> make<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.190> really

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that they would make this one really

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.700 
that they would make this one really
good<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.879> we're<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> see<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:55.110> there<00:00:55.590> was

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
a little bit surprised by like i don't
understand<00:01:16.170> why<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.500> would<00:01:16.530> repackage<00:01:17.310> but

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
understand why they would repackage but

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.910 
understand why they would repackage but
then<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:18.930> know<00:01:19.049> everyone's<00:01:19.470> trying<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.830> be

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
then you know everyone's trying to be

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.070 
then you know everyone's trying to be
eco-friendly<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.640> whatever<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.420> maybe<00:01:21.930> they

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
eco-friendly and whatever so maybe they

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.630 
eco-friendly and whatever so maybe they
had<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> really<00:01:22.409> good<00:01:22.590> reason<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.159> i<00:01:23.250> did<00:01:23.400> hear

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
had a really good reason and i did hear

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060 
had a really good reason and i did hear
some<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.479> know<00:01:24.509> whatever<00:01:25.070> I

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
some of it but you know whatever I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.800 
some of it but you know whatever I
probably<00:01:26.430> wasn't<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> use<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> product

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810

ended up having my name put on the back

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.840 
ended up having my name put on the back
just<00:05:08.120> because<00:05:08.600> I<00:05:09.140> thought<00:05:09.860> if<00:05:10.100> someone<00:05:10.460> steals

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
just because I thought if someone steals

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.280 
just because I thought if someone steals
it<00:05:11.120> like<00:05:11.270> it's<00:05:11.420> not<00:05:11.570> going<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:11.780> stop<00:05:11.840> someone

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
it like it's not going to stop someone

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.600 
it like it's not going to stop someone
from<00:05:12.350> stealing<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:13.040> if<00:05:13.160> they're<00:05:13.340> already

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
from stealing it if they're already

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.950 
from stealing it if they're already
inclined<00:05:14.150> to<00:05:14.270> steal<00:05:14.480> it<00:05:14.630> then<00:05:14.720> they're<00:05:14.870> going

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
inclined to steal it then they're going

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.770 
inclined to steal it then they're going
to<00:05:15.050> steal<00:05:15.290> it<00:05:15.440> anyway<00:05:15.560> but<00:05:16.490> maybe<00:05:17.270> when<00:05:17.660> they

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
to steal it anyway but maybe when they

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.960 
to steal it anyway but maybe when they
take<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.110> home<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:18.800> then<00:05:18.980> their<00:05:19.400> mom<00:05:19.550> looks<00:05:19.850> at

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
take it home and then their mom looks at

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.370 
take it home and then their mom looks at
