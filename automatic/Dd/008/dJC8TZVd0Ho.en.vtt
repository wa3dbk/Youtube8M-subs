00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.160 
the website we've done a load of other
benchmarks<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.729> anvil<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.750> all<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.960> type

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
benchmarks like anvil and all that type

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.770 
benchmarks like anvil and all that type
of<00:01:49.200> stuff<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.649> well<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.220> all<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.520> your

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780

like I said I was trying to keep this
really<00:01:56.100> really<00:01:56.250> quick<00:01:56.659> but<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:58.020> terabyte<00:01:58.860> for

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
really really quick but a terabyte for

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.700 
really really quick but a terabyte for
300<00:01:59.610> quid<00:01:59.759> if<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.719> wanted<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.590> have
