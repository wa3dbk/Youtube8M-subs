desk and a computer for most of their
work<00:00:20.910> days<00:00:21.210> really<00:00:21.990> need<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.500> engage<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.949> some

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
work days really need to engage in some

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.330 
work days really need to engage in some
regular<00:00:23.670> habits<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.510> offset<00:00:25.140> some<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
regular habits to offset some of the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.480 
regular habits to offset some of the
things<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.510> do<00:00:27.720> because<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.189> not<00:00:29.429> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
things that we do because this is not a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.319 
things that we do because this is not a
good<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.970> healthy<00:00:30.119> position<00:00:30.859> and<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.340> first

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
good and healthy position and so first

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.620 
good and healthy position and so first
one<00:00:33.540> burgers<00:00:34.500> relief<00:00:34.860> position<00:00:35.700> which<00:00:36.420> is

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
one burgers relief position which is

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.600 
one burgers relief position which is
basically<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.230> doing<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.739> exact<00:00:38.010> opposite

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
basically just doing the exact opposite

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.119 
basically just doing the exact opposite
of<00:00:38.820> kind<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.510> position<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.010> we're

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
of kind of this position and so we're

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.319 
of kind of this position and so we're
going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> do<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.520> feet<00:00:41.730> shoulder<00:00:42.180> width<00:00:42.300> apart

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
going to do is feet shoulder width apart

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.380 
going to do is feet shoulder width apart
chest<00:00:43.430> high<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> air

chest high up in the air
shoulder<00:00:46.170> blades<00:00:46.410> what<00:00:46.620> we're<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.860> try

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
shoulder blades what we're going to try

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.350 
shoulder blades what we're going to try
to<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.460> bring<00:00:47.700> our<00:00:47.820> shoulder<00:00:48.149> blades

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
to do is bring our shoulder blades

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.930 
to do is bring our shoulder blades
together<00:00:48.570> while<00:00:49.500> extending<00:00:50.100> our<00:00:50.250> head<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.879> it

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
together while extending our head so it

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.569 
together while extending our head so it
looks<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:55.469> again<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.399> couple

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
looks like this and again just a couple

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.799 
looks like this and again just a couple
of<00:00:56.699> seconds<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.270> repeat<00:00:59.090> my<00:01:00.090> recommendation

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
of seconds and repeat my recommendation

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.299 
of seconds and repeat my recommendation
for<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> set<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> little<00:01:02.100> timer

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
for this is that you set a little timer

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.119 
for this is that you set a little timer
on<00:01:02.520> your<00:01:02.550> phone<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:03.030> your<00:01:03.090> computer<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.949> do<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
on your phone or your computer and do it

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.609 
on your phone or your computer and do it
every<00:01:05.820> 15<00:01:06.240> minutes<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.110> alarm<00:01:07.409> go<00:01:07.590> off

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
every 15 minutes have the alarm go off

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.130 
every 15 minutes have the alarm go off
check<00:01:08.310> your<00:01:08.460> posture<00:01:08.670> do<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.630> position

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
check your posture do that position

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.980 
check your posture do that position
because<00:01:10.799> that's<00:01:10.979> gonna<00:01:11.130> basically<00:01:11.970> undo<00:01:12.479> this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
because that's gonna basically undo this

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.050 
because that's gonna basically undo this
position<00:01:13.590> right<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.310> next<00:01:14.580> one<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> simple

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
position right the next one is a simple

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.660 
position right the next one is a simple
version<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.290> median<00:01:16.619> nerve<00:01:16.650> loss<00:01:17.130> video

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
through that but this is a simple

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.510 
through that but this is a simple
version<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.119> opening<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.840> arm<00:01:25.520> into

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that supinated position with a wrist

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.319 
that supinated position with a wrist
extension<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.130> looks<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.640> make

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
extension so it looks like this make

and all you're doing is opening that up

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.190 
and all you're doing is opening that up
stretching<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.650> wrist<00:01:37.650> flexors<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.200> it's

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
one or two three-second holds and do you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.520 
one or two three-second holds and do you
have<00:01:44.670> about<00:01:44.880> five<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.270> ten<00:01:45.479> times<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:46.079> couple

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
have about five to ten times a couple

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.770 
have about five to ten times a couple
times<00:01:46.860> every<00:01:47.040> hour<00:01:47.390> make<00:01:48.390> sure<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.750> both

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
times every hour make sure you do both

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.410 
times every hour make sure you do both
both<00:01:49.619> sides

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
both sides

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.660 
both sides
the<00:01:51.420> last<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.020> chin<00:01:52.290> retraction<00:01:52.950> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the last one is chin retraction and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.810 
the last one is chin retraction and
again<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.630> lot<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.140> times<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.710> desk<00:01:56.159> workers<00:01:56.579> I

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
again a lot of times the desk workers I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.179 
again a lot of times the desk workers I
evaluate<00:01:57.390> their<00:01:57.930> server<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.770> posture

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
evaluate their server in this posture

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.950 
evaluate their server in this posture
which<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.759> called<00:01:59.969> forward<00:02:00.509> head<00:02:00.659> carriage

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
which is called forward head carriage

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.690 
which is called forward head carriage
because<00:02:01.320> we're<00:02:01.590> carrying<00:02:01.920> our<00:02:02.040> head<00:02:02.250> forward

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
because we're carrying our head forward

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.440 
because we're carrying our head forward
where<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.000> should<00:02:03.240> be

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
where it should be

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.800 
where it should be
and<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:05.070> what<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:05.700> gonna<00:02:05.790> teach<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.420> chin

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and so what I'm gonna teach you is chin

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.770 
and so what I'm gonna teach you is chin
retraction<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.580> actually

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
retraction and so it's actually

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.210 
retraction and so it's actually
translation<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:10.050> lot<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.530> times<00:02:10.739> when<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> teach

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
translation a lot of times when I teach

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.380 
translation a lot of times when I teach
people<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.670> they<00:02:11.730> can

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
people this they can

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.080 
people this they can
that's<00:02:13.020> not<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.410> motion<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.340> motion<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.850> this

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
that's not the motion the motion is this

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.180 
that's not the motion the motion is this
from<00:02:15.660> here<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:18.600> they're<00:02:19.040> translating<00:02:20.040> the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
from here so they're translating the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.240 
from here so they're translating the
chin<00:02:20.460> backwards<00:02:21.360> if<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.630> can't<00:02:22.100> do<00:02:23.100> it

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
chin backwards if you can't do it

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.710 
chin backwards if you can't do it
without<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.610> finger<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.120> your<00:02:24.390> chin<00:02:24.570> that's

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
without a finger on your chin that's

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.320 
without a finger on your chin that's
okay<00:02:25.140> just<00:02:25.590> keep<00:02:25.740> yourself<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:26.220> little<00:02:26.820> visual

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
okay just keep yourself a little visual

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.710 
okay just keep yourself a little visual
cue<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.740> actually<00:02:29.100> works<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.700> lot<00:02:30.570> of

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
cue and that actually works a lot of

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.110 
cue and that actually works a lot of
those<00:02:30.870> muscles<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:31.890> soft<00:02:32.130> tissues<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:33.090> are

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
those muscles and soft tissues that are

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.180 
those muscles and soft tissues that are
sort<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.480> chronically<00:02:33.900> under<00:02:34.230> tension<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:35.100> I
