00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.230
 the fourth stage of the 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.819
 back to Colombia on a bicycle that came out 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.220
 of the municipality of Nobsa in the 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.560
 department of boyacá and ended in 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.890
 level in cundinamarca for a total of 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.100
 198 kilometers away a stage 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.980
 long complicated by the terrain by the 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.320
 height by climate changes by the 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.140
 strong wind wind that was present 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.630
 the rain also made her more demanding 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.850
 for the lot that Miguel commanded 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.249
 rubiano team columbia who are we 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.589
 Watching the cyclist on screen 

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:38.050
 Bogota who has already been the winner of 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:40.839
 stage in the turn of italy that comes from 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.670
 run the turn of italy with this team 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.710
 that represents our country at a 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.260
 international 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.910
 the group allowed a leak in a 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.850
 principle composed of six cyclists 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.550
 but then it was captured at that moment 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.730
 after passing the sisga he turned to 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.989
 present another leak that he tried to find 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.930
 the stage but the lot that commanded the 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.110
 team columbia then gave us again 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.050
 captures many teams interested in 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.140
 the massive arrival 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.930
 then taking into account that this was 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.600
 one of the level stages 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.190
 not to say the only one where there is a lot 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.880
 option for the packers of each 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.120
 team 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.590
 that's why there are interests and they got together 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.899
 why 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.369

 near the capital of the country where it has 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.759
 done as a cyclist and then it has been 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.859

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.020
 to be able to figure and get to where 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.709
 find in this moment there we see the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.229
 work of the different teams that 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:04.979

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.829
 stage but I did not count on that back 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.690
 there were interests of various teams for 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:16.230
