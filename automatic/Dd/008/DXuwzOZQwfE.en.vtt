00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
could be understandable they were having

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.889 
could be understandable they were having
a<00:00:38.100> sale<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.210> might<00:00:39.780> have

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
a sale going on so they might have

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.299 
a sale going on so they might have
gotten<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.230> lot<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.440> orders<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.010> that's<00:00:41.129> why

actually why I ordered stuff from them
in<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.620> first<00:03:46.770> place<00:03:46.890> they<00:03:47.040> were<00:03:47.190> having<00:03:47.400> a

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
in the first place they were having a

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.070 
in the first place they were having a
fifty<00:03:47.670> percent<00:03:47.940> off<00:03:48.120> sale<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:48.840> this<00:03:48.959> was

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
fifty percent off sale so this was

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.590 
fifty percent off sale so this was
originally<00:03:49.260> five<00:03:50.160> dollars<00:03:50.550> and<00:03:50.850> what<00:03:51.510> the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
originally five dollars and what the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.199 
originally five dollars and what the
fifty<00:03:51.780> percent<00:03:51.990> off<00:03:52.140> is<00:03:52.320> obviously<00:03:52.620> 250<00:03:53.209> so

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
fifty percent off is obviously 250 so

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.020
