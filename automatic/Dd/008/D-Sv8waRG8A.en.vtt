things<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.020> doing<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.440> journey<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
things about doing this journey in a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.040 
things about doing this journey in a
land<00:01:29.310> rover<00:01:29.520> bar<00:01:29.760> than<00:01:30.000> any<00:01:30.150> other<00:01:30.330> vehicle<00:01:30.840> is

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
land rover bar than any other vehicle is

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.650 
land rover bar than any other vehicle is
the<00:01:31.530> fact<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.250> brand<00:01:32.610> that's<00:01:33.120> really

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
the fact that it's a brand that's really

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.590 
the fact that it's a brand that's really
recognized<00:01:34.230> around<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.490> world<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:36.240> vehicle

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
recognized around the world the vehicle

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.480 
recognized around the world the vehicle
will<00:01:36.780> act<00:01:36.900> as<00:01:37.050> a<00:01:37.140> form<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.410> transport<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.250> also

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
will act as a form of transport but also

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.850 
will act as a form of transport but also
act<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.780> something<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.200> will<00:01:40.410> break<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> ice

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
act as something that will break the ice

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.470 
act as something that will break the ice
so<00:01:40.890> when<00:01:41.280> we're<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.640> into<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.060> far-flung

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
so when we're going into a far-flung

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.210 
so when we're going into a far-flung
village<00:01:42.900> of<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.080> defender<00:01:43.650> will<00:01:43.800> attract

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
village of the defender will attract

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.700 
village of the defender will attract
that<00:01:44.400> good<00:01:44.730> will<00:01:44.970> start<00:01:45.630> those<00:01:45.840> conversations

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that good will start those conversations

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.550 
that good will start those conversations
that<00:01:47.100> will<00:01:47.640> then<00:01:47.850> lead<00:01:47.910> on<00:01:48.360> maybe<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.260> all

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that will then lead on maybe to all

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.729 
that will then lead on maybe to all
sorts<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.950> other<00:01:50.070> adventures
