developed<00:00:58.800> as<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.039> signature<00:00:59.399> amplifier<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
developed as a signature amplifier that

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.260 
developed as a signature amplifier that
was<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.289> based<00:01:01.500> off<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.940> brigands<00:01:02.940> clean

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
was really based off of brigands clean

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.509 
was really based off of brigands clean
Channel<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.229> had<00:01:04.379> some<00:01:04.589> voicing<00:01:05.010> tweaks<00:01:05.250> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
Channel but had some voicing tweaks to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.090 
Channel but had some voicing tweaks to
where<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:06.060> fit<00:01:06.299> more<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.720> his<00:01:07.020> tone<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.830> he

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
where it fit more with his tone that he

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.060 
where it fit more with his tone that he
was<00:01:08.250> looking<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.610> get

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
was looking to get

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.020 
was looking to get
in<00:01:10.760> more<00:01:11.270> natural<00:01:11.510> eq<00:01:12.170> settings<00:01:12.350> i<00:01:12.590> guess<00:01:13.030> he

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
in more natural eq settings i guess he

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.440 
in more natural eq settings i guess he
won<00:01:14.210> in<00:01:14.360> a<00:01:14.450> 212<00:01:14.870> combo<00:01:15.290> format<00:01:16.360> wanted<00:01:17.360> to

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450

loud settings so what we did was he
basically<00:01:32.270> took<00:01:32.720> channel<00:01:33.229> one

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
basically took channel one

basically took channel one
I<00:01:34.160> made<00:01:34.520> some<00:01:34.729> voicing<00:01:35.120> tweaks<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:35.570> I

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
I made some voicing tweaks to it I

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.340 
I made some voicing tweaks to it I
changed<00:01:36.080> its<00:01:36.229> own<00:01:36.380> stack<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:37.430> I<00:01:37.640> added<00:01:38.350> three

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
changed its own stack and I added three

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.560 
changed its own stack and I added three
reverbs<00:01:39.860> built<00:01:40.370> in<00:01:40.550> to<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.000> amp<00:01:41.150> which<00:01:41.360> are

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
reverbs built in to the amp which are

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.480 
reverbs built in to the amp which are
which<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:41.960> really<00:01:42.200> cool<00:01:42.410> feature<00:01:42.650> it's<00:01:43.009> it's

check<00:01:46.880> out<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.150> amp<00:01:47.410> is<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.770> versatility<00:01:49.369> of

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
check out the amp is the versatility of

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.670 
check out the amp is the versatility of
these<00:01:49.640> these<00:01:50.240> three<00:01:50.509> reverbs<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.320> speaking

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
these these three reverbs and speaking

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.310 
these these three reverbs and speaking
of<00:01:51.770> versatility<00:01:52.160> that's<00:01:52.520> really<00:01:53.200> what<00:01:54.200> we're

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
of versatility that's really what we're

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.870 
of versatility that's really what we're
going<00:01:54.590> for<00:01:54.770> here<00:01:54.800> it's<00:01:55.040> a<00:01:55.130> single<00:01:55.430> channel<00:01:55.729> amp

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
going for here it's a single channel amp

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.520 
going for here it's a single channel amp
but<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:56.180> can<00:01:56.300> get<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:56.750> many<00:01:56.960> different<00:01:57.140> tones

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
but you can get so many different tones

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.770 
but you can get so many different tones
out<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.800> it<00:01:58.009> it's<00:01:58.430> so<00:01:58.700> responsive<00:01:58.910> and<00:01:59.540> so

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
out of it it's so responsive and so

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.350 
out of it it's so responsive and so
dynamic<00:02:00.440> that<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:01.460> can<00:02:01.700> get<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:02.060> know<00:02:02.090> just

out of it let's walk through and have
Johnny<00:02:06.320> demonstrate<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.950> reverb<00:02:07.280> types<00:02:07.580> on

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
Johnny demonstrate the reverb types on

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.669 
Johnny demonstrate the reverb types on
there<00:02:08.000> okay<00:02:08.570> we're<00:02:08.810> on<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.080> long<00:02:09.290> reverb

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
there okay we're on the long reverb

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:34.610
