00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.460 

not<00:00:29.430> getting<00:00:29.640> any<00:00:29.759> reading<00:00:30.119> there<00:00:30.240> there

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
not getting any reading there there

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:44.459 
not getting any reading there there
there<00:00:31.470> guys

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.190 

the<00:00:45.059> fumer<00:00:46.199> yeah<00:00:47.199> that's<00:00:47.410> a<00:00:47.500> few<00:00:47.680> what

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the fumer yeah that's a few what

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.750 
the fumer yeah that's a few what
bring<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> ignition<00:00:50.070> matter<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.610> can

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
bring up the ignition matter if you can

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.430 
bring up the ignition matter if you can
you<00:00:51.660> sure<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.020> got<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> yeah

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
you sure that we got it yeah

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.060 
you sure that we got it yeah
so<00:00:55.010> that's<00:00:55.329> revolutions<00:00:56.329> that's<00:00:56.950> timing<00:00:57.950> and

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
so that's revolutions that's timing and

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.110 
so that's revolutions that's timing and
degrees<00:00:58.400> and<00:00:59.410> of<00:01:00.410> course<00:01:00.970> depending<00:01:01.970> on<00:01:02.059> the

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
degrees and of course depending on the

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.580 
degrees and of course depending on the
revolutions<00:01:02.750> I'll<00:01:02.900> say<00:01:03.020> that's<00:01:03.200> the<00:01:03.410> load

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
revolutions I'll say that's the load

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.500 
revolutions I'll say that's the load
that's<00:01:04.280> your<00:01:04.489> revolution<00:01:05.000> depending<00:01:05.449> on

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
that's your revolution depending on

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.080 
that's your revolution depending on
loading<00:01:05.780> revolutions<00:01:06.470> your<00:01:06.880> computer<00:01:07.880> gets

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
loading revolutions your computer gets

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.440 
loading revolutions your computer gets
out<00:01:08.479> of<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.660> map<00:01:08.870> it's<00:01:09.320> really<00:01:09.620> a<00:01:09.650> 3d<00:01:10.400> map<00:01:10.580> of

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
out of the map it's really a 3d map of

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.900 
out of the map it's really a 3d map of
what<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.780> ignition<00:01:12.740> time<00:01:13.010> we<00:01:13.100> should<00:01:13.250> be<00:01:13.369> get

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
what the ignition time we should be get

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.760 
what the ignition time we should be get
over<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.210> fuel<00:01:14.420> yen

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.490 

same<00:01:21.770> thing<00:01:21.950> again<00:01:22.040> trade<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.490> map<00:01:22.790> of<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.500> fuel

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
same thing again trade a map of the fuel

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.910 
same thing again trade a map of the fuel
car<00:01:24.770> in<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.070> engine

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.170
