00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.279 
revive her again and you do this by
battling<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.769> colossi<00:04:14.329> which<00:04:15.329> are<00:04:15.630> more<00:04:16.200> or

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
battling the colossi which are more or

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.129 
battling the colossi which are more or
less<00:04:16.380> huge<00:04:16.859> puzzles<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.609> themselves<00:04:18.150> mmm<00:04:18.510> so

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
less huge puzzles and themselves mmm so

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.589 
less huge puzzles and themselves mmm so
that<00:04:19.829> holds<00:04:20.130> up<00:04:20.250> apparently<00:04:20.729> that<00:04:20.910> holds<00:04:21.510> up

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
that holds up apparently that holds up

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.070 
that holds up apparently that holds up
really<00:04:21.630> well<00:04:21.959> on<00:04:23.389> most<00:04:24.389> of<00:04:24.539> all<00:04:24.630> because<00:04:24.810> they

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
really well on most of all because they

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.779 
really well on most of all because they
could<00:04:25.200> get<00:04:25.349> the<00:04:25.650> gameplay<00:04:26.010> mechanics<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.610> mean

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
could get the gameplay mechanics I mean

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.610 
could get the gameplay mechanics I mean
some<00:04:27.150> would<00:04:27.330> compare<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.050> game<00:04:28.440> like

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
some would compare it to a game like

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.650 
some would compare it to a game like
Prince<00:04:29.190> of<00:04:29.310> Persia<00:04:29.460> where<00:04:29.940> it's<00:04:30.270> about

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
Prince of Persia where it's about

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.779 
Prince of Persia where it's about
traversal<00:04:31.229> and<00:04:31.349> Shadow<00:04:32.160> of<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.310> Colossus<00:04:32.760> is

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
traversal and Shadow of the Colossus is

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.450 
traversal and Shadow of the Colossus is
definitely<00:04:33.419> a

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
definitely a

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.430 
definitely a
where<00:04:35.120> that's<00:04:35.690> at<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.050> focus<00:04:37.600> but<00:04:38.600> the

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
where that's at the focus but the

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.870 
where that's at the focus but the
difference<00:04:39.830> is<00:04:39.949> that<00:04:40.009> this<00:04:40.310> time<00:04:40.520> around<00:04:40.550> the

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
difference is that this time around the

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.689 
difference is that this time around the
puzzles<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:41.419> shall<00:04:41.630> live<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.259> they're

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
puzzles I shall live and they're

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.070 
puzzles I shall live and they're
fiercely<00:04:43.699> trying<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.240> compare<00:04:44.479> you<00:04:44.720> killing

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
fiercely trying to compare you killing

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.770 
fiercely trying to compare you killing
them<00:04:45.229> of<00:04:45.380> course<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.060> have<00:04:47.210> to<00:04:47.360> find<00:04:47.660> the

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
them of course and you have to find the

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.290 
them of course and you have to find the
weak<00:04:47.960> points<00:04:48.410> actually<00:04:48.590> climb<00:04:49.099> and<00:04:49.819> top<00:04:50.150> of

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
weak points actually climb and top of

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.600 
weak points actually climb and top of
them<00:04:50.479> and<00:04:50.509> just<00:04:50.990> you<00:04:51.289> know<00:04:51.400> stab<00:04:52.400> them<00:04:52.580> with

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
them and just you know stab them with

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.260 
them and just you know stab them with
your<00:04:52.880> sword<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:54.069> it's<00:04:55.069> just<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:55.490> powerful<00:04:55.699> and

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
your sword and it's just so powerful and

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.850 
your sword and it's just so powerful and
the<00:04:56.360> thing<00:04:56.599> about<00:04:56.690> shadow<00:04:57.080> of<00:04:57.199> colossus<00:04:57.680> in

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
the thing about shadow of colossus in

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.240 
the thing about shadow of colossus in
the<00:04:57.979> HD<00:04:58.310> collection<00:04:58.729> is<00:04:58.910> that<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.389> still<00:04:59.720> looks

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
the HD collection is that it still looks

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.029 
the HD collection is that it still looks
really<00:05:01.250> good<00:05:01.430> mmm<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.060> mean<00:05:02.530> it's<00:05:03.530> probably<00:05:03.710> the

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
really good mmm I mean it's probably the

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.870 
really good mmm I mean it's probably the
best<00:05:05.020> re-imagining<00:05:06.020> or<00:05:06.229> update<00:05:07.070> of<00:05:07.250> her<00:05:07.430> up<00:05:07.699> a

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
best re-imagining or update of her up a

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.879 
best re-imagining or update of her up a
game<00:05:08.090> of<00:05:08.330> a<00:05:08.509> ps2<00:05:08.870> game<00:05:09.050> I've<00:05:09.259> seen<00:05:09.440> on<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:09.650> ps3

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
game of a ps2 game I've seen on the ps3

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.770 
game of a ps2 game I've seen on the ps3
how<00:05:10.520> much<00:05:10.699> is<00:05:10.910> it's<00:05:11.090> different<00:05:11.419> on<00:05:11.509> the<00:05:11.630> other

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
how much is it's different on the other

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.420 
how much is it's different on the other
technical<00:05:12.139> side<00:05:12.410> of<00:05:12.440> things<00:05:12.560> compared<00:05:13.190> to<00:05:13.220> the

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
technical side of things compared to the

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.050 
technical side of things compared to the
old<00:05:13.550> version<00:05:13.699> um<00:05:14.680> for<00:05:15.680> both<00:05:15.800> games<00:05:16.039> I<00:05:16.280> think

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
old version um for both games I think

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.749 
old version um for both games I think
what<00:05:17.870> would<00:05:18.080> really<00:05:18.410> makes<00:05:19.340> them<00:05:19.610> better

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
what would really makes them better

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.580 
what would really makes them better
games<00:05:20.090> are<00:05:20.300> just<00:05:20.360> a<00:05:20.720> solid<00:05:21.050> frame<00:05:21.259> rate<00:05:21.440> it

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
games are just a solid frame rate it

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.629 
games are just a solid frame rate it
definitely<00:05:21.949> goes<00:05:22.039> to<00:05:22.099> shout<00:05:22.430> out<00:05:22.460> the

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
definitely goes to shout out the

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.760 
definitely goes to shout out the
Colossus<00:05:23.090> but<00:05:23.479> also<00:05:23.599> filters<00:05:24.199> like<00:05:24.440> anti

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
Colossus but also filters like anti

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.890 
Colossus but also filters like anti
lysing<00:05:25.220> upscaling<00:05:26.150> and<00:05:26.449> everything<00:05:26.870> just

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
lysing upscaling and everything just

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.200 
lysing upscaling and everything just
makes<00:05:27.289> it<00:05:27.500> seem<00:05:27.740> much<00:05:28.009> more<00:05:28.039> clear<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.759> I

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
makes it seem much more clear and I

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.870 
makes it seem much more clear and I
think<00:05:29.570> it's<00:05:29.750> fair<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:29.930> say<00:05:30.080> today<00:05:30.440> that

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
think it's fair to say today that

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.040 
think it's fair to say today that
forgiveness<00:05:31.880> share<00:05:32.210> of<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.419> Colossus<00:05:32.870> that

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
forgiveness share of the Colossus that

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.140 
forgiveness share of the Colossus that
the<00:05:33.229> original<00:05:33.440> team<00:05:33.949> did<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.370> game<00:05:34.580> tried

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
the original team did the game tried

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.760 
the original team did the game tried
some<00:05:35.330> techniques<00:05:35.750> on<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.169> PlayStation<00:05:36.650> 2

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
some techniques on the PlayStation 2

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.909 
some techniques on the PlayStation 2
that<00:05:36.979> it<00:05:37.130> probably<00:05:37.460> wasn't<00:05:37.789> meant<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.270> do<00:05:38.919> but

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
that it probably wasn't meant to do but

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.409 
that it probably wasn't meant to do but
of<00:05:40.039> course<00:05:40.070> techniques<00:05:40.669> that<00:05:40.789> are<00:05:40.849> no<00:05:41.060> problem

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
of course techniques that are no problem

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.480 
of course techniques that are no problem
for<00:05:41.570> the<00:05:41.659> PlayStation<00:05:42.080> 3<00:05:42.380> so<00:05:42.740> so<00:05:43.039> just<00:05:43.280> playing

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
for the PlayStation 3 so so just playing

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.800 
for the PlayStation 3 so so just playing
Shadow<00:05:43.759> of<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:43.880> Colossus<00:05:44.330> with<00:05:44.509> a<00:05:44.539> solid

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
Shadow of the Colossus with a solid

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.360 
Shadow of the Colossus with a solid
frame<00:05:45.199> rate<00:05:45.440> isn't<00:05:45.680> an<00:05:45.889> amazing<00:05:46.280> experience

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
frame rate isn't an amazing experience

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.730 
frame rate isn't an amazing experience
but<00:05:47.180> also<00:05:47.210> seeing<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:48.139> the<00:05:48.380> all<00:05:48.560> their

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
but also seeing the the all their

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.890 
but also seeing the the all their
fixed-up<00:05:49.190> scaled<00:05:49.550> it<00:05:49.849> looks<00:05:50.120> really<00:05:50.659> really

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
fixed-up scaled it looks really really

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.290 
fixed-up scaled it looks really really
good<00:05:50.930> so<00:05:51.740> this<00:05:51.949> is<00:05:52.130> a<00:05:52.159> sort<00:05:52.550> of<00:05:52.639> piece<00:05:53.150> of

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
good so this is a sort of piece of

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.760 
good so this is a sort of piece of
gaming<00:05:53.630> history<00:05:53.719> you<00:05:54.139> should<00:05:54.169> own<00:05:54.500> if<00:05:54.680> you

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
gaming history you should own if you

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.200 
gaming history you should own if you
have<00:05:54.919> here<00:05:55.130> three<00:05:55.310> I<00:05:55.550> would<00:05:55.849> definitely<00:05:55.940> say

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
have here three I would definitely say

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.050 
have here three I would definitely say
so<00:05:56.360> and<00:05:56.690> there's<00:05:56.930> so<00:05:57.139> many<00:05:57.320> people<00:05:57.590> who<00:05:57.919> have

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
so and there's so many people who have
