everything looks pretty good in place I

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.790 
everything looks pretty good in place I
also<00:03:56.459> think<00:03:56.760> they<00:03:56.880> would<00:03:57.000> look<00:03:57.180> good<00:03:57.360> in

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
also think they would look good in

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.770 
also think they would look good in
contexts<00:03:58.800> in<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.430> many<00:03:59.700> other<00:04:00.000> different

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
contexts in in many other different

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.380 
contexts in in many other different
houses<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.470> kind<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.340> fits<00:04:02.580> with<00:04:02.820> different

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
houses and kind of fits with different

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.140 
houses and kind of fits with different
different<00:04:04.050> eras<00:04:04.440> as<00:04:04.680> well<00:04:04.950> so<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.700> think<00:04:05.820> that

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
different eras as well so I think that

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.310 
different eras as well so I think that
this<00:04:06.269> would<00:04:06.480> actually<00:04:06.510> look<00:04:06.870> pretty

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
this would actually look pretty

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.770 
this would actually look pretty
respectable<00:04:08.160> in<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.850> modern<00:04:09.180> house<00:04:09.450> in

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
respectable in a modern house in

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.979 
respectable in a modern house in
