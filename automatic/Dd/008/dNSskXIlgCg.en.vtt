around and there's this nice this green
brain<00:01:48.270> part<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.110> suppose<00:01:50.630> because<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.020> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
brain part I suppose because this is a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.700 
brain part I suppose because this is a
bad<00:01:52.560> guy<00:01:52.880> now<00:01:53.880> one<00:01:54.810> thing<00:01:54.930> I'll<00:01:55.079> point<00:01:55.110> out<00:01:55.409> to

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
bad guy now one thing I'll point out to

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.340 
bad guy now one thing I'll point out to
you<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:56.820> end<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.540> supposed<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.990> go<00:01:58.229> in

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
you the end of it is supposed to go in

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.819 
you the end of it is supposed to go in
here<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.570> I<00:02:00.570> believe<00:02:01.079> stay<00:02:02.689> but<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:04.320> does<00:02:04.619> like

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
here and I believe stay but it does like

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.490 
here and I believe stay but it does like
to<00:02:04.950> pop<00:02:05.189> out<00:02:05.430> from<00:02:05.670> time<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.090> time<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:07.170> won't

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
to pop out from time to time so won't

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.080 
to pop out from time to time so won't
stay<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:07.920> there<00:02:08.039> completely<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.789> if<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.940> do

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
stay in there completely so if you do

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.500 
stay in there completely so if you do
like<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.780> your<00:02:09.929> shelf<00:02:11.209> that<00:02:12.209> piece

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
like have this on your shelf that piece

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.300 
like have this on your shelf that piece
will<00:02:12.720> pop<00:02:12.930> out

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
will pop out

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.080 
will pop out
eventually<00:02:13.630> we<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:14.780> get<00:02:14.959> these<00:02:15.230> green

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
eventually we do get these green

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.390 
eventually we do get these green
translucent<00:02:17.090> bangs<00:02:17.680> coming<00:02:18.680> off<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.040> his<00:02:19.160> face

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
translucent bangs coming off of his face

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.300 
translucent bangs coming off of his face
and<00:02:20.140> they<00:02:21.140> will<00:02:21.290> also<00:02:21.470> be<00:02:21.709> compatible<00:02:21.980> with

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
and they will also be compatible with

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.570 
and they will also be compatible with
regular<00:02:22.880> Lego<00:02:23.870> I'll<00:02:24.260> show<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:27.370> guess<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> lot

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
regular Lego I'll show you I guess a lot

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.610 
regular Lego I'll show you I guess a lot
of<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.880> would<00:02:29.060> be<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.780> kind<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.050> reminds<00:02:30.500> me

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
of this would be it kind of reminds me

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.490 
of this would be it kind of reminds me
when<00:02:30.890> we<00:02:31.160> were<00:02:31.220> putting<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.550> together<00:02:31.670> of

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
when we were putting it together of

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500 
when we were putting it together of
Kai's<00:02:33.500> fire<00:02:33.860> mech<00:02:34.220> because<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.090> had<00:02:35.269> a<00:02:35.300> lot

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
Kai's fire mech because that had a lot

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.610 
Kai's fire mech because that had a lot
of<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:36.170> know<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.470> same<00:02:36.680> type<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:39.500> know

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
of you know the same type of you know

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.140 
of you know the same type of you know
same<00:02:39.890> type<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.069> joints<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.640> guess<00:02:40.849> this<00:02:41.000> is

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
same type of joints so I guess this is

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.430 
same type of joints so I guess this is
kind<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.420> what<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.630> would<00:02:41.720> look<00:02:41.840> like<00:02:41.900> walking

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
kind of what it would look like walking

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.699 
kind of what it would look like walking
at<00:02:42.560> yeah<00:02:43.690> he's<00:02:44.690> kind<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.989> fallen<00:02:45.260> over<00:02:45.530> there

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
at yeah he's kind of fallen over there

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.180 
at yeah he's kind of fallen over there
but<00:02:46.549> that<00:02:46.670> could<00:02:46.819> be<00:02:46.880> fun<00:02:47.180> extremely<00:02:47.989> poseable

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.190 

these<00:02:52.190> feet<00:02:53.150> are<00:02:54.069> single<00:02:55.069> molds<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.930> we<00:02:57.049> have

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
these feet are single molds so we have

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.839 
these feet are single molds so we have
seen<00:02:57.470> feet<00:02:57.769> with<00:02:57.920> some<00:02:58.069> of<00:02:58.160> our<00:02:58.310> other<00:02:58.370> sets
