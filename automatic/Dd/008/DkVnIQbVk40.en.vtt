should but that's probably cuz the sub
box<00:01:19.030> is<00:01:19.149> just<00:01:19.359> completely<00:01:19.719> screwing<00:01:20.139> up

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
I was thinking about doing a series

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.109 
I was thinking about doing a series
where<00:02:05.169> I<00:02:05.649> mean<00:02:06.310> at<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.490> moment<00:02:06.520> I'm<00:02:06.849> not<00:02:06.880> gonna

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
where I mean at the moment I'm not gonna

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.330 
where I mean at the moment I'm not gonna
deny<00:02:07.270> I'm<00:02:07.599> really<00:02:07.899> bad<00:02:08.080> at<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:08.319> game<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.590> find

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
deny I'm really bad at this game I find

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.949 
deny I'm really bad at this game I find
it<00:02:09.399> really<00:02:09.459> hard<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.759> win<00:02:09.939> matches<00:02:10.149> so<00:02:10.810> what<00:02:10.929> I

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
it really hard to win matches so what I

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.479 
it really hard to win matches so what I
could<00:02:11.049> do<00:02:11.319> with<00:02:11.439> ez<00:02:11.650> series<00:02:12.069> where<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.280> can't

touch<00:02:23.410> controllers<00:02:23.920> made<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.459> lot

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
touch controllers made it a lot

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.220 
touch controllers made it a lot
different<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:25.569> game<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.930> lot

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
different and this game is a lot

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.220 
different and this game is a lot
different<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:27.130> FIFA<00:02:27.400> 12<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.819> feel<00:02:28.150> anyway<00:02:28.690> so

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
different to FIFA 12 in feel anyway so

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.330 
different to FIFA 12 in feel anyway so
it<00:02:29.290> does<00:02:29.380> take<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.590> lot<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.740> getting<00:02:29.860> used<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.190> in

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
it does take a lot of getting used to in

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.309 
it does take a lot of getting used to in
my<00:02:30.430> opinion<00:02:30.490> so<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.390> guess<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.050> could<00:02:32.200> be<00:02:32.230> a

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
my opinion so I guess that could be a

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.260 
my opinion so I guess that could be a
pretty<00:02:32.500> good<00:02:32.590> series<00:02:32.950> but<00:02:33.489> that's<00:02:34.030> basically

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
pretty good series but that's basically

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.670 
pretty good series but that's basically
it<00:02:34.480> what<00:02:34.660> do<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.840> guys<00:02:34.959> want<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.290> see<00:02:35.410> from<00:02:35.590> me

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.860 
you'd have thought them I'd have a first
Suarez<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:12.940> Ramirez<00:04:13.450> because<00:04:13.690> they<00:04:13.780> had

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
Suarez and Ramirez because they had

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.890 
Suarez and Ramirez because they had
four-star<00:04:14.320> skills<00:04:14.560> but<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.760> don't<00:04:16.359> find<00:04:16.570> school

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
four-star skills but I don't find school

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.300 
four-star skills but I don't find school
moves<00:04:17.079> are<00:04:17.320> as<00:04:17.350> effective<00:04:17.890> in<00:04:18.010> this<00:04:18.070> game<00:04:18.280> I

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
moves are as effective in this game I

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.029 
moves are as effective in this game I
think<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:18.789> episode<00:04:19.630> a<00:04:19.660> while<00:04:19.900> back<00:04:20.140> I<00:04:20.350> said<00:04:20.829> the

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
think I episode a while back I said the

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.529 
think I episode a while back I said the
skill<00:04:21.640> moves<00:04:21.820> are<00:04:21.880> really<00:04:22.000> effective<00:04:22.390> in<00:04:22.479> this

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
skill moves are really effective in this

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.029 
skill moves are really effective in this
game<00:04:22.720> but<00:04:22.840> I<00:04:22.990> don't<00:04:23.050> feel<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.380> anymore<00:04:23.710> I

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
game but I don't feel that anymore I

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.070 
game but I don't feel that anymore I
think<00:04:24.390> that<00:04:25.390> the<00:04:25.479> what<00:04:25.659> was<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:25.960> called<00:04:26.110> first

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
think that the what was it called first

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.149 
think that the what was it called first
control<00:04:27.349> is<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.620> what<00:04:27.740> they<00:04:27.830> thought<00:04:27.979> this

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:28.159 
control is that what they thought this

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:29.589 
control is that what they thought this
year<00:04:28.430> they<00:04:28.759> seem<00:04:28.970> to<00:04:29.060> have<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.210> different<00:04:29.389> name

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
year they seem to have a different name

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:30.700 
year they seem to have a different name
for<00:04:29.629> the<00:04:29.810> dribbling<00:04:30.139> system<00:04:30.500> every<00:04:30.680> single

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
for the dribbling system every single

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.649 
for the dribbling system every single
year<00:04:31.069> I<00:04:31.250> think<00:04:31.729> its<00:04:31.879> first<00:04:32.030> time<00:04:32.330> it's<00:04:32.599> not

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:32.659 
year I think its first time it's not

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:35.350 
year I think its first time it's not
those<00:04:32.870> touches<00:04:33.819> what's<00:04:34.819> it<00:04:34.970> called

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
those touches what's it called

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.850 
those touches what's it called
I<00:04:35.389> have<00:04:35.539> no<00:04:35.719> what's<00:04:36.139> the<00:04:36.259> new<00:04:36.349> get<00:04:36.560> some<00:04:36.740> could

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
I have no what's the new get some could

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.689 
I have no what's the new get some could
leave<00:04:36.979> that<00:04:37.009> in<00:04:37.129> the<00:04:37.189> comments<00:04:37.460> what's<00:04:37.610> the

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
leave that in the comments what's the

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.959 
leave that in the comments what's the
new<00:04:37.789> dribbling<00:04:38.150> system<00:04:38.419> called<00:04:38.629> is<00:04:38.810> it<00:04:38.960> um<00:04:39.169> I

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:39.969 
new dribbling system called is it um I

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.480 
new dribbling system called is it um I
have<00:04:40.969> no<00:04:41.150> idea<00:04:41.259> something<00:04:42.259> is<00:04:42.590> something<00:04:43.370> to

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
have no idea something is something to

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.159 
have no idea something is something to
do<00:04:43.550> with<00:04:43.610> control<00:04:43.969> I<00:04:44.000> think<00:04:44.150> but<00:04:44.569> anyway<00:04:44.870> the

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
do with control I think but anyway the

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.320 
do with control I think but anyway the
new<00:04:45.319> dribbling<00:04:45.680> system<00:04:46.009> where<00:04:46.159> you<00:04:46.280> hold<00:04:46.520> LT

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
new dribbling system where you hold LT

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.899 
new dribbling system where you hold LT
and<00:04:48.110> RT<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:48.860> then<00:04:49.250> your<00:04:49.400> player<00:04:49.639> kind<00:04:49.759> of

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
and RT and then your player kind of

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:51.580 
and RT and then your player kind of
shuffles<00:04:50.270> around<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.629> ball<00:04:50.810> I<00:04:51.020> find<00:04:51.500> that

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
shuffles around the ball I find that

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.339 
shuffles around the ball I find that
it's<00:04:51.710> really<00:04:51.740> really<00:04:52.189> useful<00:04:52.539> to<00:04:53.539> like<00:04:53.840> get

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
it's really really useful to like get

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:55.869 
it's really really useful to like get
past<00:04:54.379> players<00:04:54.860> if<00:04:55.219> you<00:04:55.400> just<00:04:55.550> stand<00:04:55.729> in<00:04:55.849> the

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:55.879 
past players if you just stand in the

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.939 
past players if you just stand in the
same<00:04:56.060> spot<00:04:56.479> and<00:04:57.050> kind<00:04:57.199> of<00:04:57.229> move<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.800> ball

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
same spot and kind of move the ball

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.499 
same spot and kind of move the ball
between<00:04:58.069> your<00:04:58.219> feet<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:58.729> then<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.210> finally

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
between your feet and then you finally

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.029 
between your feet and then you finally
easily<00:04:59.750> be<00:04:59.840> able<00:04:59.930> to<00:05:00.050> go<00:05:00.139> past<00:05:00.319> defenders<00:05:00.800> and

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
easily be able to go past defenders and

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.110 
easily be able to go past defenders and
you<00:05:01.099> seem<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.310> get<00:05:01.460> a<00:05:01.520> sudden<00:05:01.819> burst<00:05:02.000> of

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
you seem to get a sudden burst of

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.999 
you seem to get a sudden burst of
acceleration<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:03.080> when<00:05:03.409> you<00:05:03.530> start<00:05:03.830> moving

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
acceleration and when you start moving

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.159 
acceleration and when you start moving
after<00:05:04.460> that<00:05:04.639> so<00:05:05.419> that's<00:05:05.539> pretty<00:05:05.569> good<00:05:05.840> anyway

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
after that so that's pretty good anyway

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:07.600 
after that so that's pretty good anyway
I<00:05:06.409> just<00:05:06.530> see<00:05:06.770> that<00:05:06.889> we<00:05:07.069> took<00:05:07.099> the<00:05:07.340> lead<00:05:07.460> but

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
I just see that we took the lead but

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.719 
I just see that we took the lead but
then<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:07.789> guy<00:05:07.909> trumped<00:05:08.360> it<00:05:08.479> with<00:05:08.690> Obama

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
then the guy trumped it with Obama

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.709 
then the guy trumped it with Obama
yang-hee<00:05:10.729> and<00:05:10.969> I<00:05:11.090> think<00:05:11.240> this<00:05:11.360> gonna<00:05:11.509> sort<00:05:11.659> of

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719 
yang-hee and I think this gonna sort of

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:13.330 
yang-hee and I think this gonna sort of
lead<00:05:11.870> one<00:05:12.080> signer<00:05:12.379> in<00:05:12.560> a<00:05:12.620> four<00:05:12.830> on<00:05:12.860> two<00:05:13.039> or<00:05:13.159> two

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
lead one signer in a four on two or two

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.580 
lead one signer in a four on two or two
as<00:05:13.759> far<00:05:13.940> as<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:14.120> remember<00:05:14.150> actually<00:05:15.020> or<00:05:15.319> two<00:05:15.440> one

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
as far as I remember actually or two one

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.170 
as far as I remember actually or two one
up<00:05:15.680> there<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.099> then<00:05:16.250> Cavani<00:05:16.669> gets<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.000> goal

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
up there and then Cavani gets the goal

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.300 
up there and then Cavani gets the goal
there<00:05:17.330> is<00:05:17.449> for<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:17.870> shot<00:05:18.169> many<00:05:18.889> players<00:05:19.159> I

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
there is for that shot many players I

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.790 
there is for that shot many players I
find<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:20.060> finisher<00:05:20.509> finessing<00:05:21.349> in<00:05:21.440> general
