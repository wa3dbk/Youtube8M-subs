00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.660
 sarah 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.470
 seemingly what does this have to do with 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.099
 cars 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.540
 and after all once so called gas-24 with 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.059
 station wagon 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.090
 This car was released by Gorky 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.400
 car factory in 1971 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.010
 such cargo passenger versions were 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.210
 in demand in the ambulance at the post office 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.130
 different institutions 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.560
 now let's take a look at it 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.520
 agree 20 foursome and so it was 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.640
 nice but the wagon still looks 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.610
 more interesting 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.550
 our car is a taxi version 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.790
 called gas-24 ts from here and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.570
 checkered color and and 5-door 6 seater 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.149
 body has 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.969
 Unlike the base sedan front all 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.850
 also an abundance of chrome elegant streamlined 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.579
 mirrors difference starts with average 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.649
 stand here all their own panel 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.350
 square rear door frames 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.930
 facilitates loading and see what 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.510
 thing on the roof almost street racing you and 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.970
 wing by the way this is the first Soviet 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.770
 the car is equipped with a rear spoiler 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.290
 he directs the air flow so 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.130
 way that dirt does not fall on the glass 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.740
 tailgate 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.290
 she single-door rises up a 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.869
 under it is the hatch behind which they live 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.509
 spare wheel and tools in the trunk can 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.400
 put up to 400 kilograms of every 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.439
 stuff from here and klychko sary 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.080
 the driver's seat is exactly the same here 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.170
 like the sedan double sofa but if 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.240
 remove the armrest seats will be 3 to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.540
 torpedo taximeter and now let's 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.820
 look at the back of the second row of seats 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.729
 as comfortable as the ovsky sedan it is more 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.320
 hard under the hood usual volgovsky 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.970
 four engine cylinder 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.579
 two and a half liters and 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.860
 power 85 de horsepower 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.200
 forced gasoline for 76 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.990
 it is easy to start the motor as usual 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.079
 in the Volga sedan unusually heavy for 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.440
 us spoiled power steering though 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.380
 no, not hard 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.390
 and so easy so even shivering 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.790
 overall shift knob 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.050
 nice car is quiet and not creaky 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.840
 a little imposing 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.640
 it seemed to me that Volga wagon 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.430
 slightly more dynamic than the base machine 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.800
 maximum speed of Volga 145 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.200
 kilometers per hour and gas mileage around 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.930
 11 liters that's something like 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.380
 sarah turned out to be a great car 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.890
 And I rushed to another dac fridge 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.890
 take away
