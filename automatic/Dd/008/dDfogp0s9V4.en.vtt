00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.600
 Well, to all that I embroider there so I 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.769
 see a little more 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.969
 and accumulates a lot wrong with me 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.769
 of course they can throw everything away 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.289
 I'll show you all of me now 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.600
 big have it all you can throw but 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.810
 you can stretch your fingers and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.600
 do something to some extent here it is 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.840
 and do not need anyone but I'll show you now 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.900
 what do i make up myself i do 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.940
 here remember once there were such hooks 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:39.180
 these hooks raised loops in 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.020
 tights when the arrow pads 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.730
 they were allowed to sit as it were 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.520
 don't get this hook now maybe 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.000
 and do not but as antiques so and so 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.469
 like the hook of this little one 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.739
 right now there is such a big hook 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.079
 see me the principle is exactly the same I 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.210
 I'll show you what I'm doing the very beginning before 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.610
 but let's say I have such a piece 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.400

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.530
 here that is doing 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:45.580

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:58.180
 show or folded 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:02.890
 I fold this thread in half 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:07.060
 in half and take it in the left pen in the right 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.600
 my hook is in my hand 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.509
 Ushlepok 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.840

 clothes bag and i like to use 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.840
 This mesh is certainly better when the mesh 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.060
 so big 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.330
 cells if sold meet in 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.810
 the store if the embroidery is so canvas 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.310
 with wide holes of course for already 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.190
 there will be a better mat if you 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.420
 want to do here you see here in 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.950
 one hole from my friend and yes I 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.950
 I will show slow will be seen 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.940
 cling thread and spend the hook see 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.790
 how I spend here such a doggy and 3 as 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.560
 name and thread I caught because 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.590
 uvula hooked enclose and hooks 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.709
 closes and I'll post it yes now 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.470
 see again just watch your hands 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.989
 I will show you several times that 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.680
 it was in the loop was gone for this little dog 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:18.239
 I again make a loop 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.709
 stretch and pull this thread 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.340
 when the hand is stuffed very quickly 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.140
 it turns out if we start here I brought 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.090
 and here there is a roughness not terrible 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.000
 then when you have done a lot 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:37.209
 align here and get such a knot 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.079
 nodule very strong take again show 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.690
 I fold the thread on the net 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.330
 jackknife turns so much 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.860
 loop she to me in his hand I twist no 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.420
 twist nowhere not climb not like this 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.770
 here everything works 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.080
 in front of me again the next girl 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.690
 and bring out on a baking sheet it turns me 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.290
 from under the partition seize 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.110
 Loop grabbed the loop and spend 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.910
 yourself further and yourself the rule is right here 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.200
 little girls like that are hard 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.090
 a little bit when there will be good me too 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.569
 it will be easy to work see the rule 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.569
 has revealed 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.989
 capturing already 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:22.270
 both do not consider it benito whose captured 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:25.660
 I take the loop for this foot or how 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.570
 and call correctly and bring the thread 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.620
 brought out and again it turns out such a knot 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.889
 threads but you can take a little red thread 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.669
 for a change, so I take for 5 folded 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:48.330
 twice 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:54.610
 neatly yes and again the same thing for 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:59.500
 poured the rule of petechka again just 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:02.830
 here and it turns out here 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.870
 you have a rug who have some imagination 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:10.110
 you do me what you want 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.110
 I'll show you the bill for a moment 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.770
 today's sample yes that's what i 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.190
 trained and made so small 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.160
 mat 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.550
 if you add a little imagination and 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.820
 taste of these residues can be made 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.950
 very beautiful carpet such a product yes 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.160
 and I like it better 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:37.350
 these strings the longer the more beautiful me 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.350
 how about strength and see here and icon and 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.500
 it would seem so easy yes she is very 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:46.180
 holding well you can not be afraid she I 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.250
 already washed it the special Skorik 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.810

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:56.490
