an<00:01:00.680> oval<00:01:00.860> track<00:01:01.040> program<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:01.699> it<00:01:02.239> was<00:01:02.330> pretty

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
an oval track program so it was pretty

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.579 
an oval track program so it was pretty
much<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.660> no-brainer<00:01:02.750> for<00:01:03.199> me<00:01:03.320> to<00:01:03.440> go<00:01:03.559> over

there they have access to a lot of
technology<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:06.140> in<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:06.530> future<00:01:06.680> I<00:01:06.920> think

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
technology so in the future I think

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.440

just a warm-up cycle and it will tell

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.790 
just a warm-up cycle and it will tell
you<00:03:14.660> if<00:03:14.750> everything's<00:03:15.080> tightened<00:03:15.320> up<00:03:15.530> and

you if everything's tightened up and
right<00:03:16.040> put<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.640> little<00:03:16.790> heat<00:03:16.970> in<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.180> shock

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
right put a little heat in the shock

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.030 
right put a little heat in the shock
absorber<00:03:17.840> then<00:03:18.380> what<00:03:18.530> it's<00:03:18.650> going<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:18.830> do<00:03:18.950> is

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
absorber then what it's going to do is

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.860 
absorber then what it's going to do is
go<00:03:19.160> into<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.519> gas<00:03:19.790> flow<00:03:20.120> test<00:03:20.420> it's<00:03:20.630> going<00:03:20.780> to

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
go into a gas flow test it's going to

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.810 
go into a gas flow test it's going to
tell<00:03:21.050> us<00:03:21.080> how<00:03:21.709> much<00:03:21.860> gas<00:03:22.160> we<00:03:22.430> have<00:03:22.610> in<00:03:22.700> this

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
tell us how much gas we have in this

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.520 
tell us how much gas we have in this
shocked<00:03:23.060> how<00:03:23.269> much<00:03:23.330> spring<00:03:23.810> load<00:03:23.989> is<00:03:24.170> actually

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
shocked how much spring load is actually

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.440 
shocked how much spring load is actually
putting<00:03:24.769> on<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.250> then<00:03:25.820> from<00:03:25.970> there<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.360> will

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450

putting on and then from there it will
just<00:03:26.630> go<00:03:26.750> into<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.050> valve<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.470> show<00:03:27.680> us<00:03:27.800> what

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
just go into the valve and show us what

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.500 
just go into the valve and show us what
our<00:03:27.950> rebound<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.580> compression<00:03:28.640> forces<00:03:29.269> are

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
our rebound and compression forces are

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.540 
our rebound and compression forces are
so<00:03:30.230> do<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:30.410> have<00:03:30.470> guys<00:03:30.650> coming<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.430> and

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
saying I want you to build be a shock

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.199 
saying I want you to build be a shock
with<00:03:33.470> this<00:03:33.620> rebound<00:03:34.100> of<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.400> compression<00:03:34.880> or

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
with this rebound of this compression or

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.210 
with this rebound of this compression or
is<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.660> mostly<00:03:35.989> coming<00:03:36.350> from<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.680> guys<00:03:36.800> given

there<00:03:43.880> are<00:03:43.970> some<00:03:44.180> guys<00:03:44.329> that<00:03:44.360> are<00:03:44.690> very

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
there are some guys that are very

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.100 
there are some guys that are very
fortunate<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.299> be<00:03:47.420> familiar<00:03:47.600> with<00:03:47.840> shock

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
fortunate to be familiar with shock

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.539 
fortunate to be familiar with shock
absorbers<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:48.860> they<00:03:48.980> have<00:03:49.160> some<00:03:49.340> of<00:03:49.430> their

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
absorbers so they have some of their

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.490 
absorbers so they have some of their
ideas<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.000> their<00:03:50.329> own<00:03:50.480> tendencies<00:03:50.989> so<00:03:51.260> about

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
ideas and their own tendencies so about

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.870 
ideas and their own tendencies so about
forty<00:03:51.739> percent<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.100> guys<00:03:52.220> will<00:03:52.700> tell<00:03:52.820> us

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
forty percent of guys will tell us

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.520 
forty percent of guys will tell us
exactly<00:03:53.000> what<00:03:53.450> they<00:03:53.570> want<00:03:53.810> we<00:03:54.049> just<00:03:54.260> make<00:03:54.380> it

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
exactly what they want we just make it

exactly what they want we just make it
so<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.280> shock<00:03:55.489> now<00:03:55.700> gone<00:03:55.910> through<00:03:56.150> a

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
so the shock now gone through a

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.660 
so the shock now gone through a
20-second<00:03:57.290> run<00:03:57.410> there<00:03:57.590> where<00:03:58.160> we<00:03:58.190> picking<00:03:58.549> up

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
20-second run there where we picking up

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.100 
20-second run there where we picking up
the<00:03:58.760> data<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.239> what<00:03:59.450> are<00:03:59.510> you<00:03:59.600> looking<00:03:59.900> for

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
the data and what are you looking for

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.479 
the data and what are you looking for
here<00:04:00.260> basically<00:04:00.829> what's<00:04:01.070> going<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.280> do<00:04:01.400> is

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
here basically what's going to do is

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:02.949 
here basically what's going to do is
just<00:04:01.519> going<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.820> show<00:04:01.970> us<00:04:02.150> our<00:04:02.299> like<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:02.780> said

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
just going to show us our like I said

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.990 
just going to show us our like I said
it's<00:04:03.200> going<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.350> take<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.560> gas<00:04:04.340> sampling<00:04:04.790> on

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
it's going to take a gas sampling on

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.160 
it's going to take a gas sampling on
there<00:04:05.150> see<00:04:05.299> how<00:04:05.390> much<00:04:05.510> spring<00:04:05.780> rate<00:04:06.019> we're

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
there see how much spring rate we're

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.720 
there see how much spring rate we're
actually<00:04:06.320> adding<00:04:06.560> into<00:04:06.829> the<00:04:06.920> car<00:04:07.070> and<00:04:07.280> then

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
actually adding into the car and then

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.890 
actually adding into the car and then
from<00:04:07.850> there<00:04:08.030> we're<00:04:08.120> going<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.329> do<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.450> rebound

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
from there we're going to do a rebound

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.710 
from there we're going to do a rebound
and<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.260> compression<00:04:09.860> cycle<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:10.579> what<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:11.600> does

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
and a compression cycle and what it does

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.300 
and a compression cycle and what it does
is<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:11.870> picks<00:04:12.079> it<00:04:12.140> up<00:04:12.260> in<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.500> Aurora<00:04:12.890> load

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
is it picks it up in the Aurora load

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.830 
is it picks it up in the Aurora load
cell<00:04:13.579> hair<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.150> then<00:04:14.269> we<00:04:14.329> just<00:04:14.510> look<00:04:14.630> at<00:04:14.810> it

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
cell hair and then we just look at it

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.719 
cell hair and then we just look at it
and<00:04:15.110> that's<00:04:15.320> ready<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.560> go<00:04:15.680> all<00:04:16.400> right<00:04:16.609> well

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
and that's ready to go all right well

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:17.770 
and that's ready to go all right well
