 ten years later 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.830
 all this is very important today the one that has immediately 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.739
 watched also criticized for its slowness 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.739

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.249
 I'm mad 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.249
 frankly I have the impression that anything is possible 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 and that even in the worst of situations 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.370

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.680
 we must mobilize 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.490

 all I can to keep it 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.740
 the first thing you ask for a climate of terror 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 it's a reality 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.750
 the year 2005 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.590
 his 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 when 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.489
 following the program 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.559
 I am proud of her 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:14.149
 the day 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.959
 and in the dark night
