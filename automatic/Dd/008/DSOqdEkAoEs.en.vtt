 Below I will detail the 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.480
 characteristics 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.930

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.840

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.720
 the girlfriend of this cell phone has in the 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.989
 bravia engine system which is what 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.480
 makes the images clearer and a 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.149
 super good definition does not have too 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.030
 ex long which is what gives it a high 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:45.449
 definition in the sound has wifi

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.030
 fast so you do not get stuck with 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.360

 5 megapixels 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.580
 with built- in flash 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.080
 has one the most important and novel thing about 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.410
 this cell phone is that it has a 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.410

 rain and nothing happens if you're bathing 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.590
