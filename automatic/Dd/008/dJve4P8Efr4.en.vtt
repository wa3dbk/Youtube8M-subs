quiet<00:00:59.840> you<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.109> stand<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.920> next<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
quiet you have to stand right next to it

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.719 
quiet you have to stand right next to it
to<00:01:02.850> basically<00:01:03.510> hear<00:01:03.750> anything<00:01:04.610> but<00:01:05.610> still<00:01:06.510> it

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
to basically hear anything but still it

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.770 
to basically hear anything but still it
kills<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:09.180> well<00:01:09.770> I<00:01:11.119> don't<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> see

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
kills very well I don't know if you see

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.030 
kills very well I don't know if you see
it<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.049> there<00:01:13.200> are<00:01:13.380> quite<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.710> bit<00:01:13.799> of

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
it but there are quite a bit of

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.640 
it but there are quite a bit of
mosquitoes<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.880> bugs<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.869> all<00:01:16.110> sorts<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
mosquitoes and bugs and all sorts of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.780 
mosquitoes and bugs and all sorts of
crap<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:19.710> only<00:01:19.890> issue<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.220> see<00:01:20.759> with

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
crap in there the only issue I see with

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.350 
crap in there the only issue I see with
this<00:01:21.240> unit<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:24.200> clogs<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.470> very<00:01:25.860> quick

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
this unit is that it clogs up very quick

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.429 
this unit is that it clogs up very quick
with<00:01:27.360> all<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.380> bugs<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.890> mosquitoes<00:01:30.259> have<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
with all the bugs and mosquitoes have to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.230 
with all the bugs and mosquitoes have to
blow<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.799> out<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.159> daily<00:01:34.130> but<00:01:35.130> oh<00:01:35.400> no<00:01:35.759> teams

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
blow it out about daily but oh no teams

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.210 
blow it out about daily but oh no teams
do<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> pretty<00:01:36.659> good<00:01:36.780> job<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:38.009> fact

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
do a pretty good job of it and in fact

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.719 
do a pretty good job of it and in fact
you<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.670> blow<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.970> out<00:01:40.189> daily<00:01:41.189> hay<00:01:41.490> is

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you have to blow it out daily hay is

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.389 
you have to blow it out daily hay is
just<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.210> air<00:01:42.540> compressor<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:44.149> then<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:46.399> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
just a air compressor and then on the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.540 
just a air compressor and then on the
other<00:01:47.430> side<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.450> stinger<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:51.320> that

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
other side we have the stinger and that

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.260 
other side we have the stinger and that
as<00:01:54.550> right<00:01:55.450> now<00:01:55.600> in<00:01:56.640> mosquito<00:01:57.640> kill<00:01:58.000> mode<00:01:58.740> it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
as right now in mosquito kill mode it

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.050 
as right now in mosquito kill mode it
turns<00:02:01.270> off<00:02:01.480> the<00:02:01.750> blacklight<00:02:02.380> every<00:02:03.060> 30

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
turns off the blacklight every 30

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:12.770 
turns off the blacklight every 30
minutes<00:02:04.510> for<00:02:05.140> about<00:02:05.260> five<00:02:05.710> minutes<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:08.100> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.120 

after<00:02:13.780> 5<00:02:13.990> minutes<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.350> blacklight<00:02:14.860> comes

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
after 5 minutes the blacklight comes

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.300 
after 5 minutes the blacklight comes
back<00:02:15.370> on<00:02:16.020> stay<00:02:17.020> on<00:02:17.050> for<00:02:17.560> another<00:02:17.590> 30<00:02:18.040> minutes

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
back on stay on for another 30 minutes

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.070 
back on stay on for another 30 minutes
before<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.210> turns<00:02:19.390> off<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.890> uh<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:22.150> theory

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
before it turns off but uh in theory

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.220 
before it turns off but uh in theory
this<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.530> supposed<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.040> work<00:02:24.100> better<00:02:24.780> than<00:02:25.780> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
this is supposed to work better than the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.570 
this is supposed to work better than the
black<00:02:26.440> flag<00:02:26.890> because<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:29.560> mosquitoes<00:02:30.280> are

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
black flag because the mosquitoes are

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.790 
black flag because the mosquitoes are
attracted<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.590> green<00:02:33.340> LED<00:02:33.820> lights<00:02:34.800> which

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
attracted to the green LED lights which

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.770 
attracted to the green LED lights which
is<00:02:36.070> supposed<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.550> draw<00:02:36.940> them<00:02:37.270> in<00:02:37.480> more<00:02:40.890> and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
is supposed to draw them in more and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.850 
is supposed to draw them in more and
they're<00:02:43.780> not<00:02:43.930> as<00:02:44.170> attractive<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:45.160> as

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
they're not as attractive to as

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.100 
they're not as attractive to as
attracted<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.120> UV<00:02:49.120> lights<00:02:50.459> in<00:02:51.459> theory<00:02:52.240> you

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
attracted to UV lights in theory you

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.560 
attracted to UV lights in theory you
know<00:02:53.260> they're<00:02:53.560> in<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.800> shade<00:02:54.040> not<00:02:54.610> in<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.330> Sun

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
know they're in the shade not in the Sun

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.520 
know they're in the shade not in the Sun
so<00:02:56.730> ultraviolet<00:02:57.750> being<00:02:58.750> off<00:02:58.900> it's<00:02:59.290> supposed

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
so ultraviolet being off it's supposed

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.420 
so ultraviolet being off it's supposed
to<00:02:59.620> attract<00:02:59.890> them<00:03:00.100> in<00:03:00.250> one<00:03:01.060> more<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:03.160> kill

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
to attract them in one more the kill

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.540 
to attract them in one more the kill
grid<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:03.850> this<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:05.520> parallel<00:03:06.520> grid<00:03:07.440> which

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
grid on this is parallel grid which

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:16.400 
grid on this is parallel grid which
seems<00:03:09.550> to<00:03:09.730> be<00:03:10.360> more<00:03:11.260> effective<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:14.970> this<00:03:15.970> one

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
seems to be more effective on this one

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
seems to be more effective on this one
you<00:03:17.880> don't<00:03:18.880> have<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:20.700> blow<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.880> out<00:03:22.000> daily

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
you don't have to blow it out daily

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.770 
you don't have to blow it out daily
which<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:24.640> really<00:03:24.970> nice<00:03:26.160> this<00:03:27.160> unit<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.180> a

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
which is really nice this unit is a

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.640 
which is really nice this unit is a
little<00:03:29.110> bit<00:03:29.200> louder<00:03:29.640> if<00:03:30.640> you<00:03:30.790> like<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.180> zaps

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
little bit louder if you like the zaps

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.860 
little bit louder if you like the zaps
then<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:33.010> probably<00:03:33.220> want<00:03:33.459> this<00:03:33.700> one<00:03:36.870> other

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
then you probably want this one other

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.460 
then you probably want this one other
than<00:03:38.080> that<00:03:38.320> they're<00:03:38.950> both<00:03:39.100> pretty<00:03:39.370> similar<00:03:39.850> I

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
than that they're both pretty similar I

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.780 
than that they're both pretty similar I
don't<00:03:41.470> know<00:03:41.560> which<00:03:41.739> one

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.510 

they<00:03:46.790> claim<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.120> be<00:03:48.670> both<00:03:49.720> very<00:03:50.720> good<00:03:50.960> but

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
they claim to be both very good but

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.270 
they claim to be both very good but
we're<00:03:52.520> going<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:52.670> do<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:52.910> kill<00:03:53.870> test<00:03:54.740> on<00:03:55.070> it

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
we're going to do a kill test on it

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.940 
we're going to do a kill test on it
tonight<00:03:55.490> see<00:03:56.270> about<00:03:56.840> how<00:03:57.140> many<00:03:57.350> we<00:03:57.560> end<00:03:57.710> up

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
tonight see about how many we end up

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.120 
tonight see about how many we end up
with<00:03:59.260> which<00:04:00.260> one<00:04:00.560> gets<00:04:00.920> more<00:04:01.400> out<00:04:02.030> of<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.330> two

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
with which one gets more out of the two

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.530 
with which one gets more out of the two
but<00:04:05.740> I'm<00:04:06.740> guessing<00:04:07.640> it's<00:04:08.060> going<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.270> be<00:04:08.390> the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
but I'm guessing it's going to be the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.450 
but I'm guessing it's going to be the
stinger<00:04:08.960> and<00:04:11.140> just<00:04:12.140> because<00:04:12.500> its<00:04:12.800> method

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
stinger and just because its method

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.910 
stinger and just because its method
seems<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:14.300> be<00:04:14.450> a<00:04:14.480> little<00:04:14.780> bit<00:04:15.020> more<00:04:15.230> logically

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
seems to be a little bit more logically

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:23.470 
seems to be a little bit more logically
better<00:04:17.440> but<00:04:18.459> yeah<00:04:20.200> both<00:04:21.200> pretty<00:04:21.440> similar<00:04:22.480> yet

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
better but yeah both pretty similar yet

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.470 
better but yeah both pretty similar yet
a<00:04:23.660> little<00:04:23.840> different<00:04:24.850> so<00:04:25.850> thanks<00:04:26.390> for

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
a little different so thanks for

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.840 
a little different so thanks for
watching
