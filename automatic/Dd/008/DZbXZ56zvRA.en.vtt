either up for the high pass and have

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.880 
either up for the high pass and have
your<00:01:31.599> tour<00:01:31.810> receivers<00:01:32.319> go<00:01:32.440> up<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:32.740> get<00:01:32.830> the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
your tour receivers go up and get the

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.469 
your tour receivers go up and get the
