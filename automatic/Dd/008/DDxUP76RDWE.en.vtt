okay<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.810> test<00:00:22.490> apparatus<00:00:23.539> with

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
okay here we have a test apparatus with

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.820 
okay here we have a test apparatus with
a<00:00:24.769> vacuum<00:00:25.769> chamber<00:00:26.220> here<00:00:27.289> and<00:00:28.289> I've<00:00:28.590> got<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
a vacuum chamber here and I've got a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.150 
a vacuum chamber here and I've got a
hand<00:00:29.490> pump<00:00:29.820> hooked<00:00:30.150> up<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.890> inside<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
hand pump hooked up to that inside the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.740 
hand pump hooked up to that inside the
chamber<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.500> standard<00:00:34.500> plasma<00:00:35.280> globe

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
chamber is a standard plasma globe

chamber is a standard plasma globe
plasma<00:00:36.750> ball<00:00:36.930> well<00:00:37.800> zoom<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:40.340> okay<00:00:41.340> we've<00:00:42.120> got

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
plasma ball well zoom in okay we've got

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.209 
plasma ball well zoom in okay we've got
the<00:00:42.420> plasma<00:00:42.989> ball<00:00:43.200> inside<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.110> vacuum

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
the plasma ball inside of the vacuum

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.799 
the plasma ball inside of the vacuum
container<00:00:47.219> here<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.730> we're<00:00:48.270> taking<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
container here and we're taking the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.600 
container here and we're taking the
vacuum<00:00:49.230> down<00:00:50.870> see<00:00:51.870> our<00:00:52.199> hose<00:00:52.559> goes<00:00:53.100> underneath

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
vacuum down see our hose goes underneath

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.630 
vacuum down see our hose goes underneath
and<00:00:55.190> there<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.520> being<00:00:56.910> pumped<00:00:58.160> well

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and there is being pumped well

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.050 
and there is being pumped well
loyal<00:01:00.539> helper<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:02.000> loyal<00:01:03.000> lab<00:01:03.390> technician

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
loyal helper your loyal lab technician

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.679 
loyal helper your loyal lab technician
and<00:01:06.260> oh<00:01:07.260> there<00:01:07.830> goes<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.790> even<00:01:09.030> 20<00:01:09.450> just

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and oh there goes not even 20 just

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.980 
and oh there goes not even 20 just
caught<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.250> it's<00:01:11.250> got<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> slight<00:01:11.909> glow<00:01:12.540> left

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
caught it it's got a slight glow left

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.039 
caught it it's got a slight glow left
but<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.439> basically<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> bulb<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.909> out<00:01:15.450> at<00:01:15.869> this

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
but it basically the bulb is out at this

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.100 
but it basically the bulb is out at this
point<00:01:16.970> no<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.150> completely<00:01:18.540> out<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.869> we

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
point no it's completely out now so we

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.370 
point no it's completely out now so we
have<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> question<00:01:22.710> whether<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:24.229> plasma<00:01:25.229> ball

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
have a question whether the plasma ball

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.819 
have a question whether the plasma ball
is<00:01:26.150> draining<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.360> batteries<00:01:27.990> more<00:01:28.560> than

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
is draining the batteries more than

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.109 
is draining the batteries more than
usual<00:01:29.280> now<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:30.090> less<00:01:31.079> than<00:01:31.380> usual<00:01:31.829> or<00:01:32.119> maybe

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
usual now or less than usual or maybe

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.730 
usual now or less than usual or maybe
it's<00:01:33.420> even<00:01:33.600> charging<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.590> batteries<00:01:36.740> it

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
it's even charging the batteries it

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.770 
it's even charging the batteries it
would<00:01:37.920> not<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.310> cool

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.280 

okay<00:01:46.780> further<00:01:47.320> experiments<00:01:48.450> with<00:01:49.450> our<00:01:49.600> plasma

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
okay further experiments with our plasma

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.580 
okay further experiments with our plasma
ball<00:01:50.500> they<00:01:50.830> have<00:01:51.010> a<00:01:51.690> magnet<00:01:52.690> on<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.080> top<00:01:53.290> it's

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
ball they have a magnet on the top it's

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.960 
ball they have a magnet on the top it's
a<00:01:53.680> ring<00:01:53.920> magnet<00:01:54.460> with<00:01:55.150> north-south

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
a ring magnet with north-south

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.190 
a ring magnet with north-south
orientated<00:01:57.970> that<00:01:58.180> way<00:01:58.390> on<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.780> magnet

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
orientated that way on the magnet

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
orientated that way on the magnet
instead<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.860> north-south<00:02:00.400> this<00:02:00.940> way<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:02.470> so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
instead of north-south this way and so

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.370 
instead of north-south this way and so
we're<00:02:03.340> gonna<00:02:03.460> just<00:02:03.730> set<00:02:04.000> that<00:02:04.180> on<00:02:04.330> top<00:02:04.510> very

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
we're gonna just set that on top very

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.300 
we're gonna just set that on top very
dangerously<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:07.500> then<00:02:08.500> we're<00:02:08.649> gonna<00:02:08.740> put<00:02:09.070> the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
dangerously and then we're gonna put the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.680 
dangerously and then we're gonna put the
vacuum<00:02:09.820> chamber<00:02:10.740> on<00:02:11.740> top<00:02:12.070> and<00:02:13.030> take<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.480> down

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
vacuum chamber on top and take it down

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.200 
vacuum chamber on top and take it down
and<00:02:14.020> see<00:02:14.560> what<00:02:14.590> happens<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:17.730> far<00:02:18.730> everything

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
and see what happens so far everything

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
and see what happens so far everything
is<00:02:19.240> about<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.720> same<00:02:20.260> as<00:02:20.290> when<00:02:20.950> we<00:02:21.190> began<00:02:22.230> how

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
is about the same as when we began how

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.550 
is about the same as when we began how
many<00:02:23.470> inches<00:02:24.040> of<00:02:24.250> mercury<00:02:24.490> degrees<00:02:25.030> out<00:02:25.180> there

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
many inches of mercury degrees out there

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.550 
many inches of mercury degrees out there
19<00:02:26.560> 19<00:02:28.680> last<00:02:29.680> time<00:02:30.070> we<00:02:30.490> got<00:02:30.700> an<00:02:30.790> effect<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.560> 22

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
19 19 last time we got an effect that 22

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.030 
19 19 last time we got an effect that 22
I<00:02:32.590> think<00:02:32.770> it<00:02:33.100> was<00:02:33.480> where<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.810> entire<00:02:35.230> plasma

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
I think it was where the entire plasma

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.430 
I think it was where the entire plasma
ball<00:02:36.250> shut<00:02:37.060> down<00:02:37.330> Oh<00:02:39.120> 20<00:02:40.120> now<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.960> just<00:02:40.990> did

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
ball shut down Oh 20 now and it just did

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.700 
ball shut down Oh 20 now and it just did
the<00:02:41.590> same<00:02:41.830> thing<00:02:42.280> Wow<00:02:42.670> at<00:02:43.210> 20<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.750> assist<00:02:44.320> so<00:02:44.560> at

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
the same thing Wow at 20 I assist so at

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.480 
the same thing Wow at 20 I assist so at
20<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.460> cut<00:02:46.240> out<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.660> plasma<00:02:47.140> ball<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:48.070> we're

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
20 it cut out the plasma ball that we're

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.240 
20 it cut out the plasma ball that we're
still<00:02:48.820> amazed<00:02:49.120> by<00:02:49.480> this<00:02:49.540> phenomena<00:02:50.260> even<00:02:50.560> when

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
still amazed by this phenomena even when

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.280 
still amazed by this phenomena even when
you<00:02:51.400> touch<00:02:51.670> close<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.660> doesn't<00:02:53.050> your

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
you touch close to it it doesn't your

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.350 
you touch close to it it doesn't your
middle<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.770> glowing<00:02:54.070> now<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.790> glowing<00:02:55.090> when

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
middle is glowing now it is glowing when

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.250 
middle is glowing now it is glowing when
I<00:02:55.630> said<00:02:56.940> 1913<00:02:57.940> got<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.570> middle<00:02:58.840> glowing

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
I said 1913 got the middle glowing

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.130 
I said 1913 got the middle glowing
slightly<00:03:00.330> if<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:01.420> kill<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.720> already

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
slightly if you kill it already

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.000 
slightly if you kill it already
Oh<00:03:03.090> starting<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.150> come<00:03:04.270> back<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> little<00:03:04.750> bit<00:03:05.820> 15

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
Oh starting to come back a little bit 15

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.210 
Oh starting to come back a little bit 15
no<00:03:09.010> burners<00:03:09.459> back<00:03:10.020> there<00:03:11.020> pretty<00:03:11.170> much<00:03:11.470> normal

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
no burners back there pretty much normal

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.170 
no burners back there pretty much normal
there<00:03:12.459> now<00:03:12.670> it

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
there now it

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.729 
there now it
how<00:03:13.570> much<00:03:13.890> 13<00:03:14.890> 13<00:03:15.840> let<00:03:16.840> me<00:03:16.900> take<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:17.140> back<00:03:17.260> up<00:03:17.590> to

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
how much 13 13 let me take it back up to

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:28.330 
how much 13 13 let me take it back up to
15<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.520> think<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:18.850> was<00:03:18.970> cut<00:03:19.209> out

that<00:03:37.790> something<00:03:38.540> at<00:03:38.750> 21<00:03:39.410> that's<00:03:39.920> about<00:03:40.520> where

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
that something at 21 that's about where

that something at 21 that's about where
it<00:03:40.849> was<00:03:41.000> before<00:03:41.270> and<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.900> just<00:03:41.930> cut<00:03:42.739> right<00:03:43.010> out

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
it was before and it just cut right out

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:51.930 
it was before and it just cut right out
and<00:03:44.380> stopped<00:03:45.380> working<00:03:47.980> it's<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.690> very<00:03:50.690> strange

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
and stopped working it's a very strange

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.229 
and stopped working it's a very strange
phenomena<00:03:53.410> we<00:03:54.410> have<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.590> did<00:03:54.950> plasma<00:03:55.489> ball<00:03:55.700> well

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
phenomena we have a did plasma ball well

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.610 
phenomena we have a did plasma ball well
let's<00:03:56.480> see<00:03:56.630> if<00:03:56.690> we<00:03:56.780> can<00:03:56.930> bring<00:03:57.110> it<00:03:57.260> back<00:03:57.410> to

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
let's see if we can bring it back to

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:10.479 
let's see if we can bring it back to
life<00:04:05.080> there<00:04:06.080> it<00:04:06.200> goes<00:04:06.519> so<00:04:07.519> rats<00:04:07.880> was<00:04:08.360> at<00:04:09.489> 1515

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
life there it goes so rats was at 1515

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.110 
life there it goes so rats was at 1515
this<00:04:10.819> time<00:04:11.090> instead<00:04:11.330> of<00:04:11.480> 13<00:04:12.080> last<00:04:12.350> time<00:04:13.120> so

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
this time instead of 13 last time so

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.789 
this time instead of 13 last time so
it's<00:04:14.269> around<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.530> five<00:04:15.799> inches<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.669> mercury

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
it's around the five inches of mercury

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.699 
it's around the five inches of mercury
range<00:04:18.799> where<00:04:19.400> this<00:04:19.669> plasma<00:04:20.239> ball<00:04:20.450> cuts<00:04:21.410> out

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
range where this plasma ball cuts out

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.890 
range where this plasma ball cuts out
and<00:04:21.979> then<00:04:22.100> it<00:04:22.220> won't<00:04:22.340> cut<00:04:22.970> back<00:04:23.240> in<00:04:23.570> again

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
and then it won't cut back in again

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.409 
and then it won't cut back in again
until<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:24.620> drops<00:04:24.830> down<00:04:25.070> five<00:04:25.820> inches<00:04:26.360> of

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419

have<00:04:38.750> a<00:04:38.780> pretty<00:04:39.620> good<00:04:39.830> arc<00:04:40.070> about<00:04:40.580> like<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.150> was

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
have a pretty good arc about like it was

00:04:41.590 --> 00:05:03.100 
have a pretty good arc about like it was
originally<00:04:59.229> this<00:05:00.229> and<00:05:00.530> pumping<00:05:01.070> is<00:05:01.870> just<00:05:02.870> not

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
originally this and pumping is just not

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.370 
originally this and pumping is just not
the<00:05:03.440> way<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:03.620> go<00:05:03.950> for<00:05:04.370> efficiency<00:05:05.090> but<00:05:06.050> boy

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
the way to go for efficiency but boy

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:17.580 
the way to go for efficiency but boy
we're<00:05:06.710> building<00:05:07.100> up<00:05:07.220> our<00:05:07.340> forearms<00:05:15.430> 22<00:05:16.430> oh<00:05:16.729> wow

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
we're building up our forearms 22 oh wow

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:25.060 
we're building up our forearms 22 oh wow
so<00:05:18.590> it's<00:05:18.919> ding<00:05:19.310> oh<00:05:21.820> just<00:05:22.820> like<00:05:23.000> a<00:05:23.060> switch<00:05:23.860> bingo

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
so it's ding oh just like a switch bingo

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.969 
so it's ding oh just like a switch bingo
gone<00:05:26.229> assistant<00:05:27.229> is<00:05:27.410> a<00:05:27.440> little<00:05:27.710> out<00:05:27.830> of<00:05:27.860> breath

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979

on<00:05:28.400> this<00:05:28.520> experiment<00:05:29.360> it's<00:05:29.750> breathless

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
on this experiment it's breathless

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.480 
on this experiment it's breathless
it<00:05:32.389> is<00:05:32.569> rather<00:05:32.810> breathtaking<00:05:33.250> actually<00:05:34.250> to

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
it is rather breathtaking actually to

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.170 
it is rather breathtaking actually to
see<00:05:34.729> this<00:05:35.289> plasma<00:05:36.289> globe<00:05:36.530> just<00:05:37.189> instantly<00:05:37.879> go

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
see this plasma globe just instantly go

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.959 
see this plasma globe just instantly go
out<00:05:38.889> at<00:05:39.889> how<00:05:40.340> much<00:05:40.520> it<00:05:40.849> was<00:05:40.969> 23<00:05:41.710> 22<00:05:42.710> 22<00:05:43.400> inches

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:43.969 
out at how much it was 23 22 22 inches

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.469 
out at how much it was 23 22 22 inches
of<00:05:44.150> mercury<00:05:44.300> oh<00:05:45.009> it<00:05:46.009> just<00:05:46.039> came<00:05:46.250> back<00:05:46.610> really

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
of mercury oh it just came back really

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.790 
of mercury oh it just came back really
it's<00:05:47.750> still<00:05:47.870> a<00:05:48.020> 22<00:05:48.590> oh<00:05:48.830> my<00:05:49.490> god<00:05:50.319> that<00:05:51.319> is<00:05:51.349> so

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
it's still a 22 oh my god that is so

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.540 
it's still a 22 oh my god that is so
bizarre

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
bizarre

00:05:52.550 --> 00:06:04.869 
bizarre
I<00:05:55.210> guess<00:05:56.210> that<00:05:56.419> means<00:05:56.569> more<00:05:56.810> bumping<00:06:00.909> oh<00:06:03.879> there

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:04.879 
I guess that means more bumping oh there

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:10.149 
I guess that means more bumping oh there
it<00:06:05.000> goes<00:06:06.460> 22<00:06:07.460> and<00:06:07.580> a<00:06:07.669> half<00:06:07.879> now<00:06:08.150> yeah<00:06:08.949> you<00:06:09.949> have

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:10.159 
it goes 22 and a half now yeah you have

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:12.129 
it goes 22 and a half now yeah you have
a<00:06:10.189> theory<00:06:10.639> that<00:06:10.789> it<00:06:11.180> has<00:06:11.389> to<00:06:11.599> do<00:06:11.750> with<00:06:11.900> the

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
a theory that it has to do with the

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.269 
a theory that it has to do with the
capacitance<00:06:13.069> of<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.520> air<00:06:13.699> around<00:06:14.419> the<00:06:15.279> around

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:16.279 
capacitance of the air around the around

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:20.019 
capacitance of the air around the around
the<00:06:16.550> globe<00:06:17.409> that<00:06:18.409> is<00:06:18.469> the<00:06:18.979> plasma<00:06:19.219> globe<00:06:19.669> not

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:20.029 
the globe that is the plasma globe not

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:24.820 
the globe that is the plasma globe not
the<00:06:20.240> world<00:06:20.509> globe<00:06:21.310> who<00:06:22.310> would<00:06:22.490> tend<00:06:22.819> to<00:06:23.830> make

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
the world globe who would tend to make

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.740 
the world globe who would tend to make
the<00:06:24.979> plasma<00:06:25.430> work<00:06:25.669> so<00:06:26.000> if<00:06:26.090> we<00:06:26.210> take<00:06:26.360> away<00:06:26.509> the

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
the plasma work so if we take away the

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.100 
the plasma work so if we take away the
air<00:06:26.870> the<00:06:27.199> plasma<00:06:27.710> no<00:06:27.949> longer<00:06:28.460> has<00:06:29.240> a<00:06:29.270> place<00:06:29.539> to

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.980 
air the plasma no longer has a place to
flow<00:06:30.379> to<00:06:30.710> but<00:06:31.430> then<00:06:31.610> we<00:06:31.729> put<00:06:31.909> this<00:06:32.060> tin<00:06:32.360> foil<00:06:32.689> in

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
flow to but then we put this tin foil in

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.279 
flow to but then we put this tin foil in
touching<00:06:33.469> the<00:06:33.800> metal<00:06:34.069> down<00:06:34.639> below<00:06:35.240> here<00:06:35.779> the
