and<00:01:17.459> I'm<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> start<00:01:17.909> at<00:01:17.999> the<00:01:18.090> tip

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:32.820 

and<00:01:21.830> work<00:01:22.040> my<00:01:22.190> way<00:01:22.340> down

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.400 

now<00:01:33.700> make<00:01:33.880> sure<00:01:33.910> you<00:01:34.060> only<00:01:34.450> put<00:01:34.780> this<00:01:34.930> on<00:01:35.170> right

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
now make sure you only put this on right

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.530 
now make sure you only put this on right
before<00:01:35.590> you're<00:01:36.460> about<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.820> serve<00:01:37.030> it<00:01:37.180> because

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
before you're about to serve it because

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.500 
before you're about to serve it because
the<00:01:37.690> raspberries<00:01:38.230> will<00:01:38.440> bleed<00:01:38.680> over<00:01:38.710> time<00:01:39.510> and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
the raspberries will bleed over time and

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.630 
the raspberries will bleed over time and
because<00:01:40.840> raspberries<00:01:41.440> are<00:01:41.620> naturally<00:01:42.190> pointy

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
because raspberries are naturally pointy

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.730 
because raspberries are naturally pointy
I<00:01:42.880> can<00:01:43.840> just<00:01:43.960> fit<00:01:44.170> them<00:01:44.320> into<00:01:44.470> these<00:01:44.680> little

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
I can just fit them into these little

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.220 
I can just fit them into these little
points<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.460> I<00:01:45.820> save<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.270> pointiest<00:01:46.660> ones<00:01:46.960> for

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
points and I save the pointiest ones for

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.120 
points and I save the pointiest ones for
those<00:01:47.350> tips<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:50.500> I'm<00:01:50.560> going<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.800> peel<00:01:51.100> back

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
those tips now I'm going to peel back

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.380 
those tips now I'm going to peel back
before<00:01:51.820> I<00:01:51.850> do<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.210> stem<00:01:52.480> you<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:55.000> just<00:01:55.240> hold

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
before I do the stem you can just hold

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.700 
before I do the stem you can just hold
them<00:01:55.540> down<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.900> make<00:01:56.020> sure<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.380> none<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.560> them

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
them down to make sure that none of them

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:05.270 
them down to make sure that none of them
come<00:01:56.890> up<00:02:02.760> and<00:02:03.760> if<00:02:03.850> one<00:02:04.030> gets<00:02:04.180> away<00:02:04.330> from<00:02:04.450> you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
come up and if one gets away from you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.930 
come up and if one gets away from you
just<00:02:06.280> put<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:06.550> back<00:02:06.700> into<00:02:06.880> place<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:08.940> finish

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
just put it back into place and finish

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.760 
just put it back into place and finish
the<00:02:10.090> stem<00:02:10.330> here<00:02:12.750> now<00:02:13.750> if<00:02:13.870> any<00:02:14.020> places<00:02:14.320> look<00:02:14.680> a

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
the stem here now if any places look a

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.699 
the stem here now if any places look a
little<00:02:14.920> bit<00:02:15.240> thin<00:02:16.240> you<00:02:16.480> can<00:02:16.510> just<00:02:16.840> beat<00:02:17.500> them

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
little bit thin you can just beat them

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.860 
little bit thin you can just beat them
up<00:02:17.830> with<00:02:17.980> extra<00:02:18.250> raspberries<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:21.750> there<00:02:22.750> you
