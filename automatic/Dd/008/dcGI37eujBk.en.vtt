00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 the very well-identified flying object 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.780
 has been taking charge of the skies of Brazil 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.090
 the small unmanned aircraft drones 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.370
 originally used by the military 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.590
 now these equipments have been 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.020
 employees also to replace the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.920
 helicopters in advertising videos and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.920
 news coverage 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.380
 looking closely at him looks like a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.859
 aircraft of the future as if it had come out 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.680
 of some fiction movie whom agility 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.680
 stops in the air and still makes maneuvers 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.540
 these are the so-called little drones 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.260
 unmanned aircraft that begin to 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.760
 gain space also in Brazil in countries 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.280
 how the united states 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.239
 some more sophisticated ones have won 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.129
 military use will serve to spy 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.340
 but the story began to change after 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.410
 of the attacks of September 11 the country 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.080
 sent three controlled airplanes 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.689
 remotely to Afghanistan 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.670
 the novelty is that the aircraft no longer 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.799
 served only for missions of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.979
 recognition with technology 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:25.439
 and explosive missile bombs but for

 maintenance of these flying toys 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.020
 this simpler model costs 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.300
 up to 1,800 reais
