00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
and I knew that as well and it was

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.380 
and I knew that as well and it was
really<00:04:09.580> hard<00:04:09.820> i<00:04:10.000> guess<00:04:10.209> on<00:04:10.450> every<00:04:11.880> member<00:04:12.880> that

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
really hard i guess on every member that

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.640 
really hard i guess on every member that
was<00:04:13.540> actually<00:04:13.959> in<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.549> vehicle<00:04:15.549> at<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.700> time

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
was actually in the vehicle at the time

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
so anyway I remember riding in the back

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.710 
so anyway I remember riding in the back
seat<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:21.580> didn't<00:04:22.210> even<00:04:22.270> want<00:04:22.539> to<00:04:22.570> go<00:04:22.690> to
