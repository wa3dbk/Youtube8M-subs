and wax resist techniques tape off your
paper<00:00:27.539> into<00:00:27.960> squares<00:00:28.580> so<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.730> your

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
paper into squares so that your

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.150 
paper into squares so that your
watercolor<00:00:30.420> techniques<00:00:31.050> won't<00:00:31.349> bleed<00:00:31.560> into

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
watercolor techniques won't bleed into

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.610 
watercolor techniques won't bleed into
each<00:00:32.219> other<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.510> first<00:00:33.750> square<00:00:33.960> let's<00:00:34.410> do

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
each other in the first square let's do

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.700 
each other in the first square let's do
a<00:00:34.649> gradient<00:00:35.510> for<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.660> technique<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.590> will

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
a gradient for this technique you will

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.799 
a gradient for this technique you will
use<00:00:37.920> two<00:00:38.190> colors<00:00:38.430> paint<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.360> side<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.780> one

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
use two colors paint one side with one

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.290 
use two colors paint one side with one
color<00:00:40.200> make<00:00:41.040> sure<00:00:41.190> your<00:00:41.340> brush<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.820> nice<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
color make sure your brush is nice and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.130 
color make sure your brush is nice and
wet<00:00:43.579> then<00:00:44.579> paint<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> other<00:00:45.149> side<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
wet then paint the other side with a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.090 
wet then paint the other side with a
different<00:00:46.559> color

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
different color

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.819 
different color
the<00:00:49.030> two<00:00:49.239> colors<00:00:49.570> will<00:00:49.930> bleed<00:00:50.170> together<00:00:50.350> in

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
the two colors will bleed together in

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.439 
the two colors will bleed together in
the<00:00:50.980> middle<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:54.190> is<00:00:54.370> how<00:00:54.519> it<00:00:54.730> will<00:00:54.820> look<00:00:54.879> once

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
the middle this is how it will look once

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.170 
the middle this is how it will look once
it<00:00:55.690> is<00:00:55.809> dry<00:00:58.800> next<00:00:59.800> let's<00:01:00.519> try<00:01:00.760> wet<00:01:01.000> on<00:01:01.149> wet

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
it is dry next let's try wet on wet

with a clean brush loaded with just

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.780 
with a clean brush loaded with just
water<00:01:06.670> paint<00:01:07.570> your<00:01:07.720> box

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.030 

next<00:01:11.790> drop<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:12.600> stroke<00:01:12.930> paint<00:01:13.320> onto<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> wet

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
next drop or stroke paint onto the wet

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.660 
next drop or stroke paint onto the wet
surface

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.690 

you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.630> move<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> paper<00:01:19.200> around<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.310> mix<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you can move the paper around to mix the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.090 
you can move the paper around to mix the
colors<00:01:21.060> or<00:01:21.390> add<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:21.990> water

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.469 

this<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.280> how<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.640> will<00:01:26.760> look<00:01:26.790> once<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.690> dry

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
this is how it will look once it is dry

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.550 
this is how it will look once it is dry
next<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.720> wax<00:01:31.049> resist<00:01:33.200> use<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> white

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
next is the wax resist use a white

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.929 
next is the wax resist use a white
crayon<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.310> create<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.640> design

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
crayon to create a design

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.930 
crayon to create a design
paint<00:01:38.939> over<00:01:39.360> your<00:01:39.540> whole<00:01:40.259> square

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.390 

the<00:01:43.540> wax<00:01:43.780> crayon<00:01:44.290> will<00:01:44.620> resist<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.130> paint

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.050 

this<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.420> how<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.780> will<00:01:51.930> look<00:01:51.960> once<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.860> dry

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.550 

now<00:01:56.780> for<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.140> salt<00:01:57.380> technique<00:01:59.140> paint<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.290> flat

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
now for the salt technique paint a flat

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.190 
now for the salt technique paint a flat
color<00:02:00.890> onto<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.729> square<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.299> lightly<00:02:02.780> salt

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
color onto the square and lightly salt

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.450 
color onto the square and lightly salt
the<00:02:03.350> area

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.219 

this<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.640> how<00:02:07.790> it<00:02:08.000> will<00:02:08.119> look<00:02:08.149> once<00:02:08.690> it<00:02:08.930> is<00:02:09.020> dry

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
this is how it will look once it is dry

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.730 
this is how it will look once it is dry
and<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.680> salt<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.070> removed<00:02:11.410> for<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.500> last

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
and the salt is removed for the last

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.470 
and the salt is removed for the last
technique<00:02:13.190> we<00:02:13.520> will<00:02:13.670> do<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.970> saran<00:02:14.300> wrap

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
technique we will do the saran wrap

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.740 
technique we will do the saran wrap
technique<00:02:15.520> paint<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.610> flat<00:02:16.880> color<00:02:17.180> onto<00:02:17.480> the

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
technique paint a flat color onto the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.470 
technique paint a flat color onto the
square

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
square

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.059 
square
crumpled<00:02:20.480> up<00:02:20.569> your<00:02:20.810> saran<00:02:21.140> wrap<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:21.590> place<00:02:21.770> it

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
crumpled up your saran wrap and place it

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.900 
crumpled up your saran wrap and place it
onto<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.430> paint

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.640 

this<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.090> how<00:02:29.240> it<00:02:29.420> will<00:02:29.570> look<00:02:29.600> once<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.470> dry

this is how it will look once it is dry

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.220 
this is how it will look once it is dry
and<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.160> saran<00:02:31.460> wrap<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:31.700> removed

once<00:02:34.530> everything<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.010> dry<00:02:35.069> remove<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.000> tape

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
once everything is dry remove the tape

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.890 
once everything is dry remove the tape
