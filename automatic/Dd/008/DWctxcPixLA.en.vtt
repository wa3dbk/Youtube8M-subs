00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.530
 a great her and one islamay the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.200
 winner of this from blue pitti here at 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.860
 venice was very complimented thanks 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.599
 one thousand 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.750
 c immediately when you understand that you would have 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.850
 won well remained whole there was a 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.789
 very lucky shot was the one in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.010
 whose domenico opens buttons I 've got 16 buy 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.070
 with ace 57 it was a hand we can 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.020
 host a part sometimes taken 25 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.809
 on the flop and we got them all equal 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.550
 stack them and being in position up on 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.570
 Sunday let's say a little bit I did 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.879
 worth the fact of being in position 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.460
 on him when we were in heads up 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 and therefore had some favorable spots 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.320
 then heads up 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.000
 we left with two to one and there is none 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.920
 It was a lot of possibilities for him and a little 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.360
 because it was a card and it is a bit because of the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.070
 end I was lucky to win with cech e 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.140
 10 against from a jack also 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.469
 consideration on this final table 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.989
 I don't know with what expectations you started as 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.640
 you found the fil of the two bersani was 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.700
 a very tough final table 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.340
 there were very strong players 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.469
 bernardini for antonio bernaudo hope 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.189
 in short, Sunday is also the other foods 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.869
 by were all very very much we say e 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.880
 strong and therefore to be at a Venetian table 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.869
 study party with half stack I was 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.520
 fourth in chips 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.009
 however in the situation so easy or 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.689
 better for the short stacks was the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.460
 their strategy instead I had to wait 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.490
 a little bit because a stack for which 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.929
 I was neither chipleader nor short then 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.719
 I had to wait for them 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.610
 dynamics resolved he had seen 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.259
 even at some point here is waiting 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.950
 but for the opportune moment and given the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.810
 paw important wishes we say if 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.259
 I take advantage of the moment situations 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.759
 quite right 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.380
 if I put myself in the best 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.929
 possible condition to exploit 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.209
 the spots then obviously need to 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.009
 having a little luck is 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:01.049
 undeniable being able to win a tournament and I have 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.119
 also had a bit of luck but a 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.009
 pinch you really are an online grinder 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.829
 this, however, purely as the hiv the 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.899
 your best result I believe in so far 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.780
 absolutely if this is the first one is the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.359
 my best result made sixth at the gup 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.100
 so it was last year 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.750
 venice brings me particularly well 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.970
 but this undoubtedly is mine 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.310
 best 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.350

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.850

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.180
 I will continue to grind as usual 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.180
 in short, I'm glad I have 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.910
 won most of mine though 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.470

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.040

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.950

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.329
 or or not throughout the tournament 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.340
