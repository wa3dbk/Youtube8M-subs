a<00:03:53.040> important<00:03:53.819> thing<00:03:53.910> that<00:03:53.940> I'll<00:03:54.120> have<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.299> do

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
a important thing that I'll have to do

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.030 
a important thing that I'll have to do
from<00:03:54.660> here<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.959> learn<00:03:55.440> about<00:03:55.709> how<00:03:55.980> to

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
from here is learn about how to

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.979 
from here is learn about how to

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
integrate these chickens in with my big

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.990 
integrate these chickens in with my big
chickens<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.620> think<00:03:59.130> it's<00:03:59.250> gonna<00:03:59.400> be<00:03:59.669> a<00:03:59.700> while

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
chickens I think it's gonna be a while

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.220 
chickens I think it's gonna be a while
I'm<00:04:00.120> gonna<00:04:00.239> try<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.480> keep<00:04:00.660> them<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:00.959> here<00:04:01.139> as

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.440 
I'm gonna try to keep them in here as
long<00:04:01.260> as<00:04:01.470> I<00:04:01.650> possibly<00:04:01.799> can<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.519> then<00:04:03.120> maybe

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
long as I possibly can and then maybe

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.210 
long as I possibly can and then maybe
sneak<00:04:03.900> them<00:04:04.139> out<00:04:04.290> into<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.680> coop<00:04:04.859> one<00:04:05.040> night

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
sneak them out into the coop one night

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.250 
sneak them out into the coop one night
inside<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:05.700> cage<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.389> leave<00:04:06.840> them<00:04:06.989> in<00:04:07.109> there

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
inside the cage and leave them in there

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.780 
inside the cage and leave them in there
for<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.500> while<00:04:07.680> until<00:04:07.739> everyone<00:04:08.250> gets<00:04:08.400> out<00:04:08.519> come

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
for a while until everyone gets out come

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.550 
for a while until everyone gets out come
acclimated<00:04:09.359> to<00:04:09.389> each<00:04:09.569> other<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.959> then<00:04:10.380> when

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
acclimated to each other and then when

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.870 
acclimated to each other and then when
they<00:04:10.680> open<00:04:10.950> it<00:04:11.040> up<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.400> hopefully<00:04:11.549> they<00:04:11.849> can

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
they open it up and hopefully they can

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.539 
they open it up and hopefully they can
all<00:04:12.120> just<00:04:12.150> kind<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:12.660> mesh<00:04:13.470> together<00:04:13.680> but<00:04:14.250> I
