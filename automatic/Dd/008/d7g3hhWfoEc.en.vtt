today can be taking a look at what many

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.690 
today can be taking a look at what many
consider<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.960> be<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.320> worst<00:00:13.740> gun<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.519> game

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
consider to be the worst gun in the game

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.029 
consider to be the worst gun in the game
and<00:00:14.969> that's<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.690> nce<00:00:16.020> empire<00:00:16.560> specific

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
and that's the nce empire specific

and that's the nce empire specific
antibody<00:00:17.580> weapon<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.359> canister<00:00:18.930> now<00:00:19.380> on

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
antibody weapon the canister now on

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710 
antibody weapon the canister now on
paper<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:20.010> looks<00:00:20.039> all<00:00:20.460> right<00:00:20.520> now<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.510> works

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
paper it looks all right now it works

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.480 
paper it looks all right now it works
like<00:00:21.900> an<00:00:22.020> automatic<00:00:22.500> shotgun<00:00:22.949> but<00:00:23.310> with<00:00:23.460> a

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
like an automatic shotgun but with a

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.130 
like an automatic shotgun but with a
much<00:00:23.699> tighter<00:00:23.939> spreads<00:00:24.300> its<00:00:24.660> effective<00:00:25.019> up<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
much tighter spreads its effective up to

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.769 
much tighter spreads its effective up to
say<00:00:25.740> about<00:00:25.800> 50<00:00:26.490> meters<00:00:26.640> also<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
say about 50 meters also like a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.800 
say about 50 meters also like a
pump-action<00:00:28.140> shotgun<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.859> has<00:00:29.070> 11<00:00:29.760> pellets<00:00:30.179> so

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
pump-action shotgun it has 11 pellets so

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.440 
pump-action shotgun it has 11 pellets so
it<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.410> one-shot<00:00:31.650> infantry<00:00:32.489> at<00:00:32.759> close<00:00:33.120> range

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
it can one-shot infantry at close range

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.630 
it can one-shot infantry at close range
however<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.469> practice<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:35.130> has<00:00:35.280> always<00:00:35.489> been

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
however in practice it has always been

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.000 
however in practice it has always been
utter<00:00:36.149> garbage<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.530> reason<00:00:37.860> why<00:00:37.980> is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
utter garbage and the reason why is

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.920 
utter garbage and the reason why is
where<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.610> effective<00:00:38.910> means<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.690> get

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
where it to be effective means to get

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.470 
where it to be effective means to get
very<00:00:40.379> close<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> NBA<00:00:41.489> now<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> Terran

Republic and pass specific antigen
weapons<00:00:44.700> also<00:00:44.940> requires<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> be<00:00:45.660> close<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
weapons also requires you to be close to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.260 
weapons also requires you to be close to
the<00:00:46.469> target<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.610> does<00:00:47.730> explosive

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the target but because it does explosive

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.180 
the target but because it does explosive
damage<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.719> used<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.230> very<00:00:49.260> good<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.950> her

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
damage it used to be very good on her

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.580 
damage it used to be very good on her
assets<00:00:50.370> before<00:00:50.820> they<00:00:51.270> got<00:00:51.420> nerfed<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.410> was

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
assets before they got nerfed this was

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.630 
assets before they got nerfed this was
because<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.010> didn't<00:00:53.250> really<00:00:53.399> need<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> be

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
because you didn't really need to be

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.950 
because you didn't really need to be
very<00:00:53.789> accurate<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.660> need<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.840> do

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
very accurate with it all you need to do

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.779 
very accurate with it all you need to do
is<00:00:54.989> spam<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> lot<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.739> damage<00:00:55.949> very<00:00:56.430> quickly

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
is spam a lot of damage very quickly

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.180 
is spam a lot of damage very quickly
however<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.719> Marauder<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> canister

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
however the Marauder like the canister

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.670 
however the Marauder like the canister
is<00:00:59.340> generally<00:01:00.300> not<00:01:00.570> used<00:01:00.629> love<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.230> tanks

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
is generally not used love on tanks

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.439 
is generally not used love on tanks
because<00:01:01.859> fundamentally<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> problem

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
because fundamentally have the problem

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.570 
because fundamentally have the problem
that<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> tank<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.739> don't<00:01:05.040> want<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.400> get

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
that with a tank you don't want to get

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.030 
that with a tank you don't want to get
very<00:01:05.790> close<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.390> enemy<00:01:06.750> infantry<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.860> is

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
very close to enemy infantry this is

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.010 
very close to enemy infantry this is
because<00:01:08.189> you're<00:01:08.790> likely<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.600> forward

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
because you're likely to get see forward

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.380 
because you're likely to get see forward
if<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.470> however<00:01:11.250> because<00:01:11.820> these<00:01:11.970> Empire

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
if you do however because these Empire

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.000 
if you do however because these Empire
specific<00:01:12.810> activity<00:01:13.320> weapons<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.799> only

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
specific activity weapons are only

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.460 
specific activity weapons are only
effective<00:01:14.460> at<00:01:14.760> close<00:01:14.880> range<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:16.020> no

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
effective at close range you have no

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.830 
effective at close range you have no
choice<00:01:16.799> if<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.369> using<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.970> which<00:01:18.479> begs<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
choice if you're using it which begs the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.960 
choice if you're using it which begs the
question<00:01:19.290> why<00:01:19.680> use<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.040> at<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
question why use it at all and the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.789 
question why use it at all and the
answer<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.509> case<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.960> because<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.710> a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
answer is in this case a because it's a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
answer is in this case a because it's a
laugh<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.700> because<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.180> think<00:01:24.360> has<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> very

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
laugh and be because I think has a very

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.679 
laugh and be because I think has a very
specific<00:01:25.470> niche<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.240> what<00:01:27.420> today's

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
specific niche and that is what today's

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.480 
specific niche and that is what today's
load<00:01:27.930> out<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.290> about<00:01:28.619> now<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> don't<00:01:29.189> want<00:01:29.430> this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
load out is about now I don't want this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.620 
load out is about now I don't want this
to<00:01:29.579> come<00:01:29.729> across<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.180> some<00:01:30.299> sort<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.509> apology

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
to come across as some sort of apology

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390 
to come across as some sort of apology
for<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.200> current<00:01:31.409> state<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> gun<00:01:32.070> because

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
for the current state of the gun because

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.060 
for the current state of the gun because
in<00:01:32.579> general<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.210> utter<00:01:33.540> garbage<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.799> have

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
in general it's utter garbage but I have

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.340 
in general it's utter garbage but I have
found<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.549> way<00:01:35.729> which<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.060> find<00:01:36.299> makes<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.140> work

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
found one way which I find makes it work

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.109 
found one way which I find makes it work
effectively<00:01:37.950> now<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.610> fundamental

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
effectively now the fundamental

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.429 
effectively now the fundamental
advantage<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> gun<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.259> get

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
advantage of the gun is that if you get

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.620 
advantage of the gun is that if you get
close<00:01:40.619> range<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.729> one-shot<00:01:41.970> enemy

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
close range you can one-shot enemy
