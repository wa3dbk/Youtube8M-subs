 flash resources you put them there you 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.730
 bedtime all replaced and makes you 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.560
 copy replace hop there once 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.340
 you did that when you go 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.750
 launch the game you'll see that so 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.730
 here we are on the game so their deal 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.730
 pleaded moan matter what we do not care 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.150
 but there 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.750
 so there you see there are just the 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.280
 texts at the bottom left as expected and 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.530
 as soon as there is a job that there will be 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.740
 the frags at the top right then me 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.970
 I have a trick to hide the texts 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.410
 given that I press my touch by the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.180
 rooms and in the east so I do not know 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.050
 why but it would have them so if 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.860
 I press on 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.060
 they disappeared so me that's what I 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.230
 do I advise you to do that I 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.660
 do not know if it will work at home but 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.459
 at home it works 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.709
 So here we were, you were finished 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.580
 do everything vori strings etc 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.290
 last thing to do so you 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.070
 return to your file where you 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:19.690
 have saved the original flashes 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:22.239
 you just copy them hop you then 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.530
 in the game directory you 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:30.790
 select everything you paste you say 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:35.530
 copy replace you layer up do 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.790
 that for all applied and there it is good 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.519
 your game is back as before 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.500
 so no worries the only thing is 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.940
 that after making a video must be well 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.019
 think about coming to do this if not 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.870
 the next time you launched the 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.410
 game you will have no radar no step 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.810
 many things 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.940

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.260
