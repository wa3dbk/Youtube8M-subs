here that this pot has been in in place

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.080 
here that this pot has been in in place
for<00:01:09.360> several<00:01:09.600> months<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.640> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.760> see<00:01:11.940> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
for several months and you can see the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.570 
for several months and you can see the
soil<00:01:12.300> around<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.350> really<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:14.040> very<00:01:14.190> nice

soil around it is really very very nice
and<00:01:14.610> moist<00:01:14.990> holding<00:01:15.990> its<00:01:16.110> shape<00:01:16.200> really<00:01:16.740> well

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and moist holding its shape really well

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.850 
and moist holding its shape really well
but<00:01:17.760> it's<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.270> wet<00:01:18.690> I<00:01:18.840> can't<00:01:19.080> squeeze<00:01:19.410> any<00:01:19.740> of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
but it's not wet I can't squeeze any of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.130 
but it's not wet I can't squeeze any of
any<00:01:20.220> water<00:01:20.490> out<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> really

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
any water out of it so it's a really

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.040 
any water out of it so it's a really
good<00:01:22.490> way<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> keeping<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.000> moist<00:01:24.150> without

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
good way of keeping it moist without

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.640 
good way of keeping it moist without
getting<00:01:25.650> over<00:01:26.540> overly<00:01:27.830> wet<00:01:28.830> with<00:01:30.530> keeping<00:01:31.530> the

getting over overly wet with keeping the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.090 
getting over overly wet with keeping the
soil<00:01:31.830> wet<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.640> keeping<00:01:33.120> it<00:01:33.240> moist<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:34.980> I

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
soil wet it's keeping it moist so as I

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.470 
soil wet it's keeping it moist so as I
say<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.490> they<00:01:35.640> connected<00:01:36.090> together<00:01:36.210> using

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
say that they connected together using

water<00:04:11.180> on<00:04:12.180> average<00:04:12.600> I'd<00:04:12.750> probably<00:04:12.930> try<00:04:13.200> to

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
water on average I'd probably try to

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.949

bleed it once a month or once every two
months<00:04:16.530> just<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.799> make<00:04:16.919> sure<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.280> it's

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
months just to make sure that it's

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.150 
months just to make sure that it's
running<00:04:17.580> fine<00:04:17.910> now<00:04:18.870> as<00:04:19.169> part<00:04:19.500> from<00:04:19.680> watering

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
back here and the wet pot is buried down

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.600 
back here and the wet pot is buried down
down<00:05:03.610> deep<00:05:04.240> in<00:05:04.419> in<00:05:04.690> in<00:05:04.870> there<00:05:05.280> which<00:05:06.280> provides

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
down deep in in in there which provides

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.790 
down deep in in in there which provides
lots<00:05:06.760> of<00:05:06.850> nice<00:05:07.030> moisture<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.960> as<00:05:08.500> I'm<00:05:08.650> saying

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
lots of nice moisture and as I'm saying

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.290 
lots of nice moisture and as I'm saying
before<00:05:08.979> it<00:05:09.220> doesn't<00:05:09.580> actually<00:05:09.700> keep<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.060> soil

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
before it doesn't actually keep the soil

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.680 
before it doesn't actually keep the soil
the<00:05:10.870> roots<00:05:10.900> of<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.440> plant<00:05:11.680> in<00:05:12.520> water<00:05:12.940> so<00:05:13.540> they

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
the roots of the plant in water so they

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.330 
the roots of the plant in water so they
still<00:05:13.900> feel<00:05:14.260> walk<00:05:14.470> around<00:05:14.740> there's<00:05:15.010> get<00:05:15.160> lots

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
still feel walk around there's get lots

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.620 
still feel walk around there's get lots
of<00:05:15.430> moisture<00:05:15.790> and<00:05:15.850> you<00:05:15.940> can<00:05:16.060> see<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:16.510> this

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
of moisture and you can see that this

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.390 
of moisture and you can see that this
plant<00:05:16.900> here<00:05:17.139> has<00:05:17.229> really<00:05:17.710> gone<00:05:17.830> berserk<00:05:18.039> with

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
plant here has really gone berserk with

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.440 
plant here has really gone berserk with
the<00:05:18.490> wet<00:05:18.610> pots<00:05:18.850> and<00:05:19.389> in<00:05:20.139> fact<00:05:20.410> has<00:05:20.620> grown<00:05:21.450> that

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
the wet pots and in fact has grown that

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.390 
the wet pots and in fact has grown that
much<00:05:22.889> in<00:05:23.889> the<00:05:24.250> last<00:05:25.800> probably<00:05:26.800> added<00:05:27.190> about

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
much in the last probably added about

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.450 
much in the last probably added about
one<00:05:27.520> third<00:05:27.729> of<00:05:27.760> its<00:05:28.000> height<00:05:28.150> in<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:29.080> last

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
one third of its height in the last

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.219 
one third of its height in the last
probably<00:05:30.460> bit<00:05:30.639> two<00:05:30.789> months<00:05:31.150> so<00:05:31.479> really<00:05:32.080> is

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
probably bit two months so really is

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.129 
probably bit two months so really is
quite<00:05:32.530> an<00:05:32.740> efficient<00:05:33.250> method<00:05:33.580> of<00:05:33.669> watering<00:05:34.150> to

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
quite an efficient method of watering to

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.890 
quite an efficient method of watering to
give<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:35.380> an<00:05:35.470> idea<00:05:35.620> I<00:05:36.160> have<00:05:36.520> this<00:05:37.120> garden<00:05:37.389> area

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
give you an idea I have this garden area

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.909 
give you an idea I have this garden area
watered<00:05:38.350> with<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.650> wet<00:05:38.830> parts<00:05:39.570> and<00:05:40.570> I<00:05:41.440> use

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
watered with the wet parts and I use

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.250 
watered with the wet parts and I use
approximately<00:05:42.789> 400<00:05:43.419> liters<00:05:43.720> of<00:05:43.840> fortnight<00:05:44.229> or

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
approximately 400 liters of fortnight or

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.710 
approximately 400 liters of fortnight or
200<00:05:44.710> litres<00:05:44.950> a<00:05:44.979> week<00:05:45.190> to<00:05:45.910> water<00:05:46.150> this<00:05:46.300> area

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
200 litres a week to water this area

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.190 
200 litres a week to water this area
which<00:05:46.900> is<00:05:47.370> significantly<00:05:48.370> less<00:05:48.669> than<00:05:49.000> the<00:05:49.539> old

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
which is significantly less than the old

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.770 
which is significantly less than the old
drip<00:05:50.860> irrigation<00:05:51.250> which<00:05:52.030> is<00:05:52.180> dusting<00:05:52.570> here<00:05:52.720> I

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
drip irrigation which is dusting here I

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.150 
drip irrigation which is dusting here I
haven't<00:05:53.050> actually<00:05:53.200> popped<00:05:53.500> this<00:05:53.620> up<00:05:53.770> yet<00:05:54.010> but

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
haven't actually popped this up yet but

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.010 
haven't actually popped this up yet but
this<00:05:54.729> is<00:05:54.849> the<00:05:54.970> old<00:05:55.090> drip<00:05:55.270> irrigation<00:05:55.660> I<00:05:55.870> was

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
this is the old drip irrigation I was

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.750 
this is the old drip irrigation I was
running<00:05:56.289> which<00:05:56.410> was<00:05:56.680> very<00:05:56.950> very<00:05:57.099> efficient

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
running which was very very efficient

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.129 
running which was very very efficient
but<00:05:57.970> nowhere<00:05:58.330> near<00:05:58.389> as<00:05:58.510> efficient<00:05:58.900> as<00:05:58.960> a<00:05:58.990> wet

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
but nowhere near as efficient as a wet

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.560 
but nowhere near as efficient as a wet
pot<00:05:59.320> system
