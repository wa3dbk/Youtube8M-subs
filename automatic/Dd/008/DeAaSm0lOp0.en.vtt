00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:07.730 
here when it comes to space and it is

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.350

and what you're looking at here is what
they're<00:00:26.010> saying<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:27.529> flickering<00:00:28.529> white<00:00:28.920> blotch

fount<00:00:31.070> on<00:00:32.149> Ceres<00:00:34.579> now<00:00:35.579> they<00:00:35.790> admit<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
fount on Ceres now they admit it's a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.780 
fount on Ceres now they admit it's a
mystery<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.500> spot<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.129> reflecting

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
mystery and that this spot is reflecting

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.920 
mystery and that this spot is reflecting
more<00:00:39.149> light<00:00:39.390> than<00:00:39.420> others<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:41.120> I<00:00:42.120> mean

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
more light than others and I mean

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.250 
more light than others and I mean
anything<00:00:43.320> they<00:00:43.649> deemed<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.190> mystery

anything they deemed to be a mystery

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.959 
anything they deemed to be a mystery
that's<00:00:46.260> kind<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.500> changing<00:00:46.800> giving<00:00:47.670> off<00:00:47.820> light

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
that's kind of changing giving off light

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.200 
that's kind of changing giving off light
or<00:00:48.360> reflecting<00:00:49.170> light<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.860> pretty<00:00:50.760> intriguing

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
or reflecting light is pretty intriguing

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.229 
or reflecting light is pretty intriguing
now<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> big<00:00:53.399> things<00:00:53.699> about

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
now this is one of the big things about

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.270 
now this is one of the big things about

this dwarf planet / asteroid monster
asteroid<00:01:00.079> that<00:01:01.079> most<00:01:01.379> people<00:01:01.710> don't<00:01:01.980> know<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
asteroid that most people don't know and

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.450 
asteroid that most people don't know and
it's<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.619> largest<00:01:05.010> body

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it's that this is the largest body

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.890 
it's that this is the largest body
between<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> Sun<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.650> Pluto<00:01:08.869> that<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
between the Sun and Pluto that a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.969 
between the Sun and Pluto that a
spacecraft<00:01:10.710> has<00:01:11.100> never<00:01:11.400> been<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:12.740> so<00:01:13.740> they<00:01:13.950> say

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
spacecraft has never been to so they say

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.289 
spacecraft has never been to so they say
so<00:01:14.850> they<00:01:15.000> tell<00:01:15.180> us<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:17.340> as<00:01:17.549> far<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> world

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
so they tell us so as far as the world

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.490 
so they tell us so as far as the world
stage<00:01:18.600> goes<00:01:20.030> that's<00:01:21.030> what<00:01:21.240> they're<00:01:21.479> saying<00:01:21.750> so

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
stage goes that's what they're saying so

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.190 
stage goes that's what they're saying so
as<00:01:22.770> they<00:01:23.130> get<00:01:23.280> closer<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.759> closer<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.750> images

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
as they get closer and closer the images

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.090 
as they get closer and closer the images
are<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.490> clearer<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.150> clearer<00:01:28.100> now

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
are going to get clearer and clearer now

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
are going to get clearer and clearer now

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
it talks about how first they will come

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.819 
it talks about how first they will come
up<00:01:39.530> old<00:01:40.530> series<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:42.320> then<00:01:43.320> later<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.770> year

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
up old series and then later this year

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.670 
up old series and then later this year
on<00:01:44.250> pluto<00:01:44.810> now<00:01:45.810> New<00:01:46.320> Horizons<00:01:46.530> will<00:01:48.530> be<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
on pluto now New Horizons will be the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.260 
on pluto now New Horizons will be the
one<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.040> makes<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> trip<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> Pluto<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
one that makes the trip to Pluto and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.389 
one that makes the trip to Pluto and
they<00:01:52.020> state<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.649> by<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.310> time<00:01:54.979> these<00:01:55.979> things

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
they state that by the time these things

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.429 
they state that by the time these things
get<00:01:56.939> close<00:01:57.210> enough<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.540> these<00:01:57.750> planets<00:01:58.259> that

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
get close enough to these planets that

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.060 
get close enough to these planets that
they're<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.640> crystal-clear

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
they're going to have crystal-clear

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.249 
they're going to have crystal-clear
images<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.520> never<00:02:02.759> before<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:03.780> let's

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
images like never before now let's

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.810 
images like never before now let's
remember<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.740> because<00:02:05.070> we're<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
remember that because we're going to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.889 
remember that because we're going to
hold<00:02:06.030> them<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.910> see<00:02:09.149> what<00:02:09.330> they<00:02:09.479> end<00:02:09.720> up

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
hold them to it and see what they end up

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.199 
hold them to it and see what they end up
giving<00:02:10.739> out<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> public<00:02:11.459> but<00:02:11.849> they<00:02:11.970> say

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
giving out to the public but they say

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.850 
giving out to the public but they say
unlike<00:02:13.080> any<00:02:13.319> other<00:02:13.530> time

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
unlike any other time

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.200 
unlike any other time
for<00:02:14.100> they're<00:02:14.220> going<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.400> have<00:02:14.490> all<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:14.970> data

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
for they're going to have all this data

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.040 
for they're going to have all this data
high<00:02:15.690> resolution<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:17.240> once<00:02:18.240> they<00:02:18.420> get<00:02:18.600> super

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
high resolution and once they get super

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.870 
high resolution and once they get super
close<00:02:19.320> they're<00:02:20.040> going<00:02:20.160> to<00:02:20.250> beat<00:02:20.460> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
close they're going to beat the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.160 
close they're going to beat the
resolution<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.780> Hubble<00:02:22.170> had<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:24.600> they<00:02:24.870> look

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
resolution that Hubble had so they look

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.230 
resolution that Hubble had so they look
to<00:02:25.350> provide<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> lot<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.070> good<00:02:26.220> images<00:02:26.910> here

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
to provide a lot of good images here

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.330 
to provide a lot of good images here
this<00:02:27.660> year<00:02:27.710> they're<00:02:28.710> getting<00:02:28.920> closer<00:02:29.160> and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
this year they're getting closer and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.430 
this year they're getting closer and
closer<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.470> they<00:02:31.470> also<00:02:31.620> go<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.070> explain<00:02:32.550> in

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
closer and they also go and explain in

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.590 
closer and they also go and explain in
