00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:14.820
 good friends part of the order first the 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.820
 speed that more or less and then 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.129
 no no 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.170
 now it's going 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.679
 it goes slow 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.679
 Y 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.500
 ah 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.090
 ah 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.450
 here is a part that I was not 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:58.329
 and except for changes 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.329
 because there was flying spoon 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.900
 but I do it 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.930
 so good 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.200
 with his son 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.000
 and I'm not the owner of the truth but a 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.400
 simple advice or that makes me every 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.750
 unit but 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.750
 something that has served me 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:40.970
 to see if it's better to sacrifice speed 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.490
 for more clarity cleaning 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.310
 sound 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.660
 Y 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.580
 so yes 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.580
 the idea is to do it 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.490
 cleansed 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.470
 as you practice it 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.140
 increasing the speed but always 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:07.030
 clean always clean 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:10.260
 and have another advice here too 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.730
 it will also be to me it served me 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.720
 and he says that when you hit him down 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.620
 that has a certain volume I did not see it 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:25.940
 when I make sound where I do not mean 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:29.460
 volume not but playing for the whole to 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.330
 down one has a volume x 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.200
 and when I made the sack 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.070
 if you can not make the apu with the same 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.280
 intensity 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.990
 it's like two people are playing 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.990
 different for the beautiful little song 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.689
 and start making sure 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.000
 for 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.580
 because if the volume goes down there is a lot of 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.710
 difference then 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.710
 it served me practiced is water 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.050
 when the practice when in practice 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.810
 strong 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.840
 to then look for sounds but 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.550
 I needed the firmness of the agreements 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.350
 eye 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.269
 I'm not a child the truth I turn to 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.180
 I repeat what seemed to me that 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.259
 that can also serve you 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.259
 so good would 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.620
 I hope that today I serve you and what I know 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:39.419
 do they just merely agree what 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.420
 I told you about sound and cleanliness if 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:45.620
 they listen 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:47.419
 the recordings of rem and daniel there is 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.010
 there you will listen to what I say 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.010
 about cleaning the sound
