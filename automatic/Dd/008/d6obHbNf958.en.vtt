masks<00:00:08.820> now<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.110> lot<00:00:10.429> easier<00:00:11.429> said<00:00:11.880> than

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030

Smart<00:00:12.750> Filters<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.170> mash<00:00:13.410> sounds<00:00:13.769> confusing

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
Smart Filters and mash sounds confusing

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.990 
Smart Filters and mash sounds confusing
but<00:00:14.759> it's<00:00:14.910> not<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:16.109> now<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:16.949> we<00:00:17.340> know<00:00:17.520> what

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
but it's not so now that we know what

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.929 
but it's not so now that we know what
mask<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.199> now<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.070> we<00:00:20.220> know<00:00:20.490> how<00:00:20.910> to

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
mask is and now that we know how to

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.500 
mask is and now that we know how to
apply<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> filter<00:00:22.340> or<00:00:23.340> more<00:00:23.820> specifically<00:00:24.420> a

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
apply a filter or more specifically a

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.439 
apply a filter or more specifically a
smart<00:00:24.990> filter<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.220> mask<00:00:26.519> out<00:00:26.910> certain

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
smart filter we can mask out certain

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.439 
smart filter we can mask out certain
parts<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.170> filter<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.970> example<00:00:30.359> if

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
parts of this filter so for example if

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.089 
parts of this filter so for example if
you<00:00:30.539> watch<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.869> last<00:00:31.109> tutorial<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.859> know

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you watch the last tutorial you know

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.690 
you watch the last tutorial you know
that<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.790> applied<00:00:33.600> glowing<00:00:34.590> edges<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.250> glass

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that I applied glowing edges and glass

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.750 
that I applied glowing edges and glass
filter<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.360> these<00:00:36.510> cows<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:38.070> they<00:00:38.460> are

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
filter to these cows so that they are

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.240 
filter to these cows so that they are
let<00:00:39.329> me<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.540> toggle<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.960> off<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.040> gives

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
let me just toggle this off so it gives

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
let me just toggle this off so it gives
them<00:00:41.399> kind<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.879> weird<00:00:42.149> look<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.410> we

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
them kind of a weird look but what if we

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.740 
them kind of a weird look but what if we
only<00:00:43.829> wanted<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.489> apply<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:44.910> filter<00:00:45.539> on

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
only wanted to apply this filter on

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.100 
only wanted to apply this filter on
certain<00:00:46.680> parts<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.280> our<00:00:47.520> image<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.600> for

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
certain parts of our image so for

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.610 
certain parts of our image so for
example<00:00:49.530> maybe<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.219> wanted<00:00:50.610> um<00:00:51.289> like<00:00:52.289> one

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
example maybe we just wanted um like one

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.010 
example maybe we just wanted um like one
of<00:00:52.770> these<00:00:52.949> cows<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.480> glowing<00:00:54.750> edges

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
of these cows to have like glowing edges

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.580 
of these cows to have like glowing edges
around<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.710> well<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.820> order<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.960> what

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
around it well in order to do that what

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.880 
around it well in order to do that what
we<00:00:58.710> need<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.460> make<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> mask<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
we need to do is make a mask on the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.850 
we need to do is make a mask on the
filter<00:01:02.280> layer<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.750> little<00:01:04.140> white<00:01:04.589> box

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
filter layer so this little white box

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.490 
filter layer so this little white box
you<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.460> all<00:01:05.970> right<00:01:06.030> why<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.540> white<00:01:06.990> box<00:01:07.260> here

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
for nothing this is actually the mask so

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.940 
for nothing this is actually the mask so

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
black selected and now when we start

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.520 
black selected and now when we start
painting<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:38.880> see<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.049> gets

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
painting you can see that it's it gets

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.700 
painting you can see that it's it gets
rid<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.250> mask<00:01:41.899> so<00:01:42.899> let's<00:01:43.259> go<00:01:43.409> ahead<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.609 
rid of the mask so let's go ahead and
paint<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.880> black<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.500> see

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
paint this with black and as you can see

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.520 
paint this with black and as you can see
whenever<00:01:47.280> we<00:01:47.520> would<00:01:47.670> paint<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.930> mask<00:01:49.229> is

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
whenever we would paint it the mask is

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.330 
whenever we would paint it the mask is
gone<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.369> say<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.509> went<00:01:52.229> outside<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:53.189> we

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
gone and say we went outside what we

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.490 
gone and say we went outside what we
wanted<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:53.850> all<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.200> paint

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
wanted to do all we have to do is paint

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.700 
wanted to do all we have to do is paint
with<00:01:55.740> white<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:58.219> then<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.759> mask<00:02:00.060> would<00:02:00.420> um

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
with white and then the mask would um

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.649 
with white and then the mask would um
reappear<00:02:01.710> again<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.579> black<00:02:02.880> gets<00:02:03.180> rid<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
reappear again so black gets rid of the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.969 
reappear again so black gets rid of the
mask<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.229> white<00:02:05.180> makes<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.560> show<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.740> again

entire image so if you find it's easier
to<00:03:03.050> paint<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.440> like<00:03:03.590> this<00:03:03.860> way<00:03:05.080> then<00:03:06.080> that's

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
to paint it like this way then that's

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.520 
to paint it like this way then that's
how<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.709> do<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.630> now<00:03:08.630> aside<00:03:09.050> from<00:03:09.080> just

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
how you do that now aside from just

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.010 
how you do that now aside from just
painting<00:03:09.980> with<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.280> paintbrush<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:11.600> can<00:03:11.780> also

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
painting with a paintbrush you can also

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.740 
painting with a paintbrush you can also
use<00:03:12.590> stuff<00:03:13.190> like<00:03:13.310> gradients<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:14.180> if<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.570> go

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
use stuff like gradients so if you go

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.729 
use stuff like gradients so if you go
ahead<00:03:14.989> right<00:03:15.320> here

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
ahead right here

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.789 
ahead right here
and<00:03:15.830> pick<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.580> gradient<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.870> can<00:03:18.110> go<00:03:18.230> ahead<00:03:18.380> and

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
and pick a gradient you can go ahead and

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.440 
and pick a gradient you can go ahead and
apply<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:19.459> mask<00:03:19.850> this<00:03:20.330> way<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:21.790> look<00:03:22.790> at<00:03:22.910> that<00:03:22.940> if

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
apply a mask this way so look at that if

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.500 
apply a mask this way so look at that if
you<00:03:24.170> uh<00:03:24.200> click<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.280> drag<00:03:25.519> that<00:03:25.549> or<00:03:26.000> drag<00:03:26.390> it

inward you got a nice little gradient in

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.590 
inward you got a nice little gradient in
