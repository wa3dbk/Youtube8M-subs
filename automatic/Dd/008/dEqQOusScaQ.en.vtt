00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
underneath the step right there I guess

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.219 
underneath the step right there I guess
these<00:01:37.049> aren't<00:01:37.320> really<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:38.700> tickets<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.570> was

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
these aren't really the tickets I was

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.390 
these aren't really the tickets I was
expecting<00:01:40.439> something<00:01:40.710> different<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.280> wonder

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
expecting something different I wonder

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.190 
expecting something different I wonder
if<00:01:41.610> these<00:01:41.700> are<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:42.060> giving<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.630> rare<00:01:42.899> i<00:01:42.930> know

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
if these are be giving is rare i know

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.679 
if these are be giving is rare i know
the<00:01:43.350> tickets<00:01:43.710> when<00:01:44.460> they<00:01:44.610> said<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.450> could<00:01:45.570> buy

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the tickets when they said you could buy

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.480 
the tickets when they said you could buy
the<00:01:45.720> tickets<00:01:46.200> instead<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.619> ticket<00:01:46.920> plaques<00:01:47.159> i

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the tickets instead of ticket plaques i

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
the tickets instead of ticket plaques i
was<00:01:47.640> thinking<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:48.360> would<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.960> as

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
was thinking that they would be just as

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.020 
was thinking that they would be just as
rare<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.560> other<00:01:49.649> ones<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.909> other

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
rare as the other ones but the other

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.200 
rare as the other ones but the other
ones<00:01:51.210> were<00:01:51.329> limited<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.810> i<00:01:51.960> think<00:01:52.259> 1000<00:01:53.210> pairs

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
ones were limited to i think 1000 pairs

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.700 
ones were limited to i think 1000 pairs
so<00:01:54.509> i<00:01:54.570> guess<00:01:54.689> only<00:01:54.840> two<00:01:55.110> thousand<00:01:55.590> tickets

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
so i guess only two thousand tickets

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.700 
so i guess only two thousand tickets
this<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.030> sort<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.659> paint<00:01:58.590> it

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
this is just sort of like that paint it
