those is every accent is going to be
moved<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.990> way<00:01:53.080> I'm<00:01:53.170> gonna<00:01:53.290> play<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.680> is<00:01:53.770> in

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
moved the way I'm gonna play it is in

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.070 
moved the way I'm gonna play it is in
each<00:01:54.160> five<00:01:54.400> note<00:01:54.640> grouping<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.330> first<00:01:55.360> accent

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
each five note grouping the first accent

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.900 
each five note grouping the first accent
is<00:01:56.200> going<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.440> go<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.860> floor<00:01:57.130> tom<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.520> the

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
is going to go to the floor tom and the

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.639 
is going to go to the floor tom and the
second<00:01:58.270> accent<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.690> going<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.899> go<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.229> closed

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
second accent is going to go to a closed

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:45.970 
second accent is going to go to a closed
hi-hat<00:01:59.979> with<00:02:00.399> no<00:02:00.670> kick<00:02:00.910> drum<00:02:01.119> underneath<00:02:01.509> it

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.949 

so<00:02:46.980> that's<00:02:47.310> my<00:02:47.820> favorite<00:02:48.360> way<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.450> orchestrate

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
so that's my favorite way to orchestrate

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.390 
so that's my favorite way to orchestrate
this<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:49.350> can<00:02:49.560> be<00:02:49.620> moved<00:02:49.830> all<00:02:50.010> over<00:02:50.069> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
this but this can be moved all over the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.740 
this but this can be moved all over the
plate<00:02:50.610> remember<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:51.030> also<00:02:51.150> double<00:02:51.630> this

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
plate remember you can also double this
