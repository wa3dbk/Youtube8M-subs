straight<00:02:18.849> leg<00:02:19.030> oblique<00:02:19.390> crunch<00:02:19.660> which<00:02:19.900> I'll

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
straight leg oblique crunch which I'll

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.449 
straight leg oblique crunch which I'll
demonstrate<00:02:20.110> out<00:02:20.560> there<00:02:20.799> so<00:02:21.549> here<00:02:21.790> we<00:02:21.849> go<00:02:23.459> so

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
demonstrate out there so here we go so

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.699 
demonstrate out there so here we go so
it's<00:02:24.549> very<00:02:24.640> important<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.230> completely<00:02:26.230> flex

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
it's very important to completely flex

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.800 
it's very important to completely flex
those<00:02:26.890> legs<00:02:27.280> straight<00:02:28.440> crunch<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:30.810> you

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
those legs straight crunch in you

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.690 
those legs straight crunch in you
shouldn't<00:02:32.079> be<00:02:32.170> off-balance<00:02:32.739> nice<00:02:33.489> and

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
shouldn't be off-balance nice and

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:46.750 
shouldn't be off-balance nice and
centered

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.480 

now<00:02:47.960> screw<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:49.050> into<00:02:49.200> oblique<00:02:49.920> crunches<00:02:50.280> here

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
now screw it into oblique crunches here

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.000 
now screw it into oblique crunches here
so<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.180> get<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.330> rest<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.690> one<00:02:51.840> side<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.950> can

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
so you get a rest on one side you can

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.960 
so you get a rest on one side you can
find<00:02:53.310> me<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.460> straight<00:02:53.730> line<00:02:55.550> feel<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.700> right

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
find me the straight line feel it right

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:17.860 
find me the straight line feel it right
here

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:28.740 

switch<00:03:18.290> sides

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.600 

it's<00:03:29.050> really<00:03:29.380> gonna<00:03:29.530> target<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.980> entire<00:03:30.340> side

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
it's really gonna target the entire side

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:47.420 
it's really gonna target the entire side
of<00:03:30.640> your<00:03:30.820> obliques

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.399 

all<00:03:48.030> right<00:03:48.120> third<00:03:48.390> abdominal<00:03:48.840> superset<00:03:49.319> we've

all right third abdominal superset we've

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:50.809 
all right third abdominal superset we've
got<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> killer<00:03:49.859> oblique<00:03:50.370> one<00:03:50.549> we're<00:03:50.670> going<00:03:50.760> to

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
got a killer oblique one we're going to

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.759 
got a killer oblique one we're going to
go<00:03:50.969> weighted<00:03:51.359> side<00:03:51.569> bones<00:03:51.840> right<00:03:52.439> into
