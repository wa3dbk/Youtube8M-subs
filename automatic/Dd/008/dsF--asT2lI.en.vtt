00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.820 

so<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.310> tuning<00:00:05.760> is<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.720> E<00:00:06.960> flat<00:00:06.990> so<00:00:07.560> it's<00:00:07.650> e

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
so the tuning is in E flat so it's e

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:29.710 
so the tuning is in E flat so it's e
flat<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.220> flat<00:00:08.309> D<00:00:08.760> flat<00:00:08.880> G<00:00:09.180> flat<00:00:10.020> B<00:00:10.590> flat<00:00:10.620> E<00:00:11.160> flat

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.620 

power<00:00:30.410> cord<00:00:30.710> on<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.009> second<00:00:31.279> fret

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.889 

then<00:00:36.350> you<00:00:36.440> put<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:36.740> off<00:00:36.920> too<00:00:37.340> and<00:00:37.370> open

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.380 

then

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:53.140 

then<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.809> threat<00:00:46.230> power<00:00:46.620> cord

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:06.710 

to<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:54.270> whole<00:00:54.390> life

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.910 

so<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.780> whole<00:01:07.990> thing<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.409> making<00:01:08.799> the

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
so the whole thing is making the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.050 
so the whole thing is making the
difference<00:01:09.070> in<00:01:09.400> south

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.609 

second<00:01:15.060> drifts<00:01:15.390> power<00:01:15.780> cord<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> fourth

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
second drifts power cord on the fourth

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.770 
second drifts power cord on the fourth
fret

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.340 

so<00:01:25.780> today<00:01:25.990> we're<00:01:26.620> jumping<00:01:27.040> from<00:01:27.190> here

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so today we're jumping from here

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.609 
so today we're jumping from here
threats<00:01:29.350> are<00:01:29.530> here<00:01:29.770> so<00:01:30.070> you've<00:01:30.220> got<00:01:30.840> an<00:01:31.840> die

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.170 

then<00:01:36.340> you're<00:01:36.520> putting<00:01:36.700> off

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:58.600 

right

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.190 

so<00:01:59.610> we've<00:02:00.090> got<00:02:00.210> power<00:02:00.450> cord<00:02:00.720> on<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> sixth

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
so we've got power cord on the sixth

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.960 
so we've got power cord on the sixth
fret<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:04.860> sliding<00:02:05.190> down<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
fret so you just sliding down to the

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:15.289 
fret so you just sliding down to the
fourth

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:28.580 

so<00:02:16.299> same<00:02:16.689> as<00:02:16.719> earlier<00:02:16.959> you<00:02:17.379> just<00:02:17.590> go<00:02:17.739> outside

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.559 

so<00:02:29.670> powerful<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.879> sixth<00:02:31.180> fret<00:02:33.269> again<00:02:34.269> jump

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
so powerful on the sixth fret again jump

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.789 
so powerful on the sixth fret again jump
up<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.019> eighth<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.650> eleven<00:02:35.950> point<00:02:37.799> so

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
up to the eighth and the eleven point so

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:58.780 
up to the eighth and the eleven point so
similar<00:02:39.189> to<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.689> with<00:02:40.689> two<00:02:40.900> weeks<00:02:41.110> ago<00:02:41.349> so

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.610 

so<00:02:59.790> on<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.450> sixth<00:03:00.840> fret<00:03:02.659> down<00:03:03.659> a<00:03:03.719> little<00:03:04.109> hit

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
so on the sixth fret down a little hit

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.610 
so on the sixth fret down a little hit
and<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.920> slide<00:03:06.379> and<00:03:07.379> again

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.570 

so<00:03:11.489> again

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.640
