00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
I got the land spiders a second code

I got the land spiders a second code
name<00:00:49.930> is<00:00:50.050> chaos<00:00:50.500> slip<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.660> one<00:00:52.810> thing<00:00:52.990> that

the<00:00:53.200> chaos<00:00:53.530> live<00:00:53.890> I<00:00:54.310> wish<00:00:54.640> it<00:00:54.820> would<00:00:54.910> allow<00:00:55.150> you

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
the chaos live I wish it would allow you

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.630 
the chaos live I wish it would allow you
to<00:00:55.450> choose<00:00:55.690> your<00:00:55.750> first<00:00:56.230> jump<00:00:56.470> point<00:00:58.230> because

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
to choose your first jump point because

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.580 
to choose your first jump point because
random<00:01:00.640> is<00:01:00.790> great<00:01:01.120> but<00:01:01.630> if<00:01:02.140> you<00:01:02.200> don't<00:01:02.470> have

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
random is great but if you don't have

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.090 
random is great but if you don't have
your<00:01:02.680> first<00:01:02.980> jump<00:01:03.220> point<00:01:03.520> set<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.880> in<00:01:04.030> our<00:01:04.180> neck

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
your first jump point set to in our neck

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.930 
your first jump point set to in our neck
that's<00:01:06.210> kind<00:01:07.210> of<00:01:07.330> frustrating<00:01:08.520> well<00:01:09.520> i<00:01:09.670> got

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
that's kind of frustrating well i got

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.910 
that's kind of frustrating well i got
the<00:01:10.060> frozen<00:01:10.360> hell<00:01:10.540> cooling<00:01:11.020> system<00:01:11.440> now<00:01:11.619> that

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
the frozen hell cooling system now that

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.249 
the frozen hell cooling system now that
I<00:01:11.950> wanted<00:01:12.400> previously<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:13.660> couldn't<00:01:14.020> get

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
I wanted previously that I couldn't get

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.650 
I wanted previously that I couldn't get
I<00:01:16.080> wish<00:01:17.080> it<00:01:17.259> could<00:01:17.910> purchase<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.180> parts<00:01:19.420> ahead

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
I wish it could purchase the parts ahead

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.690 
I wish it could purchase the parts ahead
of<00:01:19.780> time<00:01:19.960> but<00:01:20.200> since<00:01:20.530> I<00:01:20.680> didn't<00:01:21.009> have<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.460> part

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
of time but since I didn't have the part

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.790 
of time but since I didn't have the part
at<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:21.910> time<00:01:22.210> that<00:01:22.930> I<00:01:22.960> needed<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.410> get<00:01:23.619> the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
at the time that I needed to get the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.990 
at the time that I needed to get the
frozen<00:01:24.130> hell<00:01:24.310> I<00:01:24.610> couldn't<00:01:25.119> do<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:25.300> at<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.570> time

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
frozen hell I couldn't do it at the time

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.070 
frozen hell I couldn't do it at the time
at<00:01:27.510> least<00:01:27.690> I<00:01:27.810> got<00:01:27.900> now<00:01:29.780> ultimately<00:01:30.780> doesn't

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
at least I got now ultimately doesn't

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.890 
at least I got now ultimately doesn't
matter<00:01:31.410> i<00:01:31.530> overclock<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:33.560> really<00:01:35.180> poor<00:01:36.180> CPU<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
matter i overclock the really poor CPU I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.560 
matter i overclock the really poor CPU I
didn't<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.470> never<00:01:37.890> ended<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.700> buying<00:01:39.300> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
didn't I never ended up buying the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.870 
didn't I never ended up buying the
proper<00:01:40.110> cpu<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.800> that<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> there<00:01:41.760> was

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
proper cpu for that so I there was

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.250 
proper cpu for that so I there was
really<00:01:42.030> no<00:01:42.210> point<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.600> me<00:01:42.630> doing<00:01:42.780> that

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
really no point of me doing that

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:51.980 
really no point of me doing that
truthfully<00:01:50.030> all<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.270> let's<00:01:51.510> get<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.780> land

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
truthfully all right let's get the land

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.700 
truthfully all right let's get the land
spoof<00:01:52.410> and<00:01:52.800> that<00:01:52.950> should<00:01:53.430> finish<00:01:54.270> off<00:01:54.660> my<00:01:55.260> land

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
spoof and that should finish off my land

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.400 
spoof and that should finish off my land
tools<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.369> I'm<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.790> need<00:01:57.320> for<00:01:58.320> an

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
tools that I'm gonna need for an

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.510 
tools that I'm gonna need for an
upcoming<00:01:58.560> hack<00:02:00.410> but<00:02:01.410> ultimately<00:02:01.920> right<00:02:02.250> now

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
upcoming hack but ultimately right now

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.300 
upcoming hack but ultimately right now
my<00:02:03.890> purchases<00:02:04.890> are<00:02:05.250> actually<00:02:05.820> aimed<00:02:06.090> toward

my purchases are actually aimed toward

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.120 
my purchases are actually aimed toward
hacking<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:09.200> uplink<00:02:10.200> internal<00:02:10.619> services

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
hacking the uplink internal services

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.090 
hacking the uplink internal services
right<00:02:11.340> now<00:02:12.050> making<00:02:13.050> sure<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.440> have<00:02:13.560> every

right now making sure I have every

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.729 
right now making sure I have every
little<00:02:15.020> files<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:18.300> utility<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.200> I'm<00:02:19.380> going

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
little files and utility that I'm going

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:28.640 
little files and utility that I'm going
to<00:02:19.890> need

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.240 

okay<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.950> should<00:02:30.370> do<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.610> for<00:02:30.730> them<00:02:32.250> now

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
okay that should do it for them now

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.820 
okay that should do it for them now
let's<00:02:33.459> head<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.760> internet<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.920> go<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.540> Steve

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
let's head to internet and go to Steve

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.870 
let's head to internet and go to Steve
Jackson<00:02:38.830> games

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.260 

why<00:02:42.880> here<00:02:44.070> because<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:47.200> server<00:02:48.270> actually

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
why here because this server actually

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.960 
why here because this server actually
has<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:50.110> real<00:02:50.470> life<00:02:50.710> and<00:02:50.970> implications

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
has a real life and implications

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.140 
has a real life and implications
actually<00:02:52.510> which<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:53.080> our<00:02:53.200> state<00:02:54.000> I'm<00:02:55.000> going

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
actually which is in our state I'm going

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.610 
actually which is in our state I'm going
to<00:02:55.210> connect<00:02:55.480> even<00:02:55.690> look<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.080> bounce<00:02:56.290> list

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
to connect even look the bounce list

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.110 
to connect even look the bounce list
even<00:02:56.800> though<00:02:56.950> it's<00:02:57.160> not<00:02:57.370> necessary<00:02:57.910> since

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
even though it's not necessary since

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.400 
even though it's not necessary since
there's<00:02:58.300> actually<00:02:58.660> no<00:02:58.750> trace<00:02:59.050> but<00:02:59.230> I'm<00:02:59.320> gonna

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
there's actually no trace but I'm gonna

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.650 
there's actually no trace but I'm gonna
