today on canon rumors calm we saw our

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.550 
today on canon rumors calm we saw our
first<00:00:02.790> glimpse<00:00:03.240> of<00:00:03.510> what<00:00:03.780> is<00:00:03.899> probably<00:00:04.440> the

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
first glimpse of what is probably the

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.970 
first glimpse of what is probably the
canon<00:00:05.130> 60d<00:00:05.660> now<00:00:06.660> by<00:00:07.200> looking<00:00:07.500> at<00:00:07.799> these

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
canon 60d now by looking at these

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.709 
canon 60d now by looking at these
pictures<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:09.000> can<00:00:09.179> definitely<00:00:09.330> tell<00:00:09.660> that

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
pictures we can definitely tell that

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.749 
pictures we can definitely tell that
there's<00:00:10.050> been<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> few<00:00:10.469> changes<00:00:10.759> certainly

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
there's been a few changes certainly

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.740 
there's been a few changes certainly
over<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.360> old<00:00:12.870> body<00:00:13.139> style<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.740> 50d<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:15.540> most

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
over the old body style of 50d the most

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.960 
over the old body style of 50d the most
exciting<00:00:16.379> visual<00:00:16.890> feature<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.520> we<00:00:17.609> see<00:00:17.789> so

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
exciting visual feature that we see so

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.410 
exciting visual feature that we see so
far<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.900> new<00:00:19.080> flip<00:00:19.470> screen<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:21.240> will

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
far is a new flip screen so this will

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.140 
far is a new flip screen so this will
definitely<00:00:21.800> improve<00:00:22.800> shooting<00:00:23.550> video<00:00:23.820> with

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
definitely improve shooting video with

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.080 
definitely improve shooting video with
any<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.779> mccannon<00:00:25.500> DSLR<00:00:26.490> camera<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.060> that

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
any of the mccannon DSLR camera so that

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.570 
any of the mccannon DSLR camera so that
it'll<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.539> step<00:00:27.869> above<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:29.160> flip<00:00:29.369> screen

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
it'll be a step above the flip screen

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.370 
it'll be a step above the flip screen
will<00:00:30.119> allow<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.840> be<00:00:30.960> able<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.199> film

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
will allow you to be able to film

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.410 
will allow you to be able to film
yourself<00:00:31.489> it'll<00:00:32.489> allow<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.180> able<00:00:33.210> to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
yourself it'll allow you to be able to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.870 
yourself it'll allow you to be able to
film<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.930> different<00:00:34.469> areas<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.800> from<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.700> low

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
film in different areas and from a low

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.180 
film in different areas and from a low
angle<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> high<00:00:36.840> angle<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:37.890> just

angle or a high angle and not just

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.060 
angle or a high angle and not just
shooting<00:00:38.640> straight<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.469> also<00:00:40.469> from<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.680> specs

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
shooting straight on also from the specs

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.639 
shooting straight on also from the specs
that<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.489> been<00:00:41.870> essentially<00:00:42.870> released<00:00:43.260> or

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that have been essentially released or

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.670 
that have been essentially released or
thought<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:45.030> been<00:00:45.059> released<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.719> far<00:00:45.750> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
thought to have been released so far it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.010 
thought to have been released so far it
looks<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.730> still<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.450> an<00:00:48.600> 18

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
looks like it's still going to be an 18

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.020 
looks like it's still going to be an 18
megapixel<00:00:49.230> sensor<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.030> t2i<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.440> 70

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
megapixel sensor like the t2i and the 70

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.410 
megapixel sensor like the t2i and the 70
now<00:00:54.030> if<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.890> combined<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.910> digit<00:00:57.239> 5

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
now if this is combined with the digit 5

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.479 
now if this is combined with the digit 5
we<00:00:57.840> might<00:00:58.020> actually<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.410> an<00:00:58.800> enhancement<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
we might actually see an enhancement to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.420 
we might actually see an enhancement to
the<00:00:59.579> video<00:00:59.910> mode<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.260> also<00:01:01.410> might<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the video mode but we also might not and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.390 
the video mode but we also might not and
here's<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> reason<00:01:03.030> why<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:04.159> think<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
here's the reason why I think that the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.270 
here's the reason why I think that the
main<00:01:05.640> reason<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> issues<00:01:08.130> in

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
main reason that we see the issues in

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.750 
main reason that we see the issues in
the<00:01:08.369> video<00:01:08.610> mode<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> 70<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.960> t2i<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.979> not

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the video mode with a 70 and t2i is not

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.670 
the video mode with a 70 and t2i is not
due<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> fact<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.720> cannon<00:01:13.200> can't<00:01:13.470> read

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
due to the fact that cannon can't read

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
due to the fact that cannon can't read
the<00:01:13.860> whole<00:01:14.070> sensor<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.880> once<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:17.310> if

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the whole sensor at once it's that if

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
the whole sensor at once it's that if
they<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:17.939> it'll<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.900> very<00:01:19.200> very<00:01:19.590> slow<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:21.360> what

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
they do it'll be very very slow so what

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
they do it'll be very very slow so what
would<00:01:21.840> happen<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.470> during<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.340> pan<00:01:23.610> you'd<00:01:23.820> see<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
would happen is during a pan you'd see a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.399 
would happen is during a pan you'd see a
jello<00:01:24.960> worse<00:01:25.770> than<00:01:26.159> say<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.790> nikon<00:01:27.240> d90<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.350> i

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
jello worse than say a nikon d90 and i

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.730 
jello worse than say a nikon d90 and i
think<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> would<00:01:28.890> happen<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.490> they<00:01:29.759> were<00:01:29.820> to

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
think that would happen if they were to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.550 
think that would happen if they were to
stop<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.950> pixel<00:01:32.340> bending<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.380> even<00:01:34.380> use<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
stop the pixel bending and even use a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.880 
stop the pixel bending and even use a
method<00:01:34.860> similar<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.150> gh1<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
method similar to the gh1 to get the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.740 
method similar to the gh1 to get the
video<00:01:38.159> mode<00:01:38.400> picture<00:01:38.820> now<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> could<00:01:39.689> be

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
video mode picture now it could be

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.810 
video mode picture now it could be
completely<00:01:40.110> wrong<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.740> new<00:01:40.890> digit<00:01:41.280> 5<00:01:41.460> might

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
completely wrong the new digit 5 might

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.700 
completely wrong the new digit 5 might
have<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> new<00:01:42.240> way<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.479> processing<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.470> video

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
have a new way of processing the video

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.679 
have a new way of processing the video
straight<00:01:44.009> off<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.189> center<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> wouldn't

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
straight off the center but I wouldn't

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.490 
straight off the center but I wouldn't
count<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:47.450> for<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> real<00:01:48.810> video<00:01:49.229> mode

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
count on it for a real video mode

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.920 
count on it for a real video mode
improvement<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.250> would<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.720> new

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
improvement I would think that the new

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.660 
improvement I would think that the new
Canon<00:01:52.439> hybrid<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.430> real<00:01:55.159> would<00:01:56.159> fix<00:01:56.460> that

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
Canon hybrid if it's real would fix that

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.609 
Canon hybrid if it's real would fix that
issue<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.780> would<00:01:57.930> think<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.290> would<00:01:58.380> fix

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
issue and I would think it would fix

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.510 
issue and I would think it would fix
that<00:01:58.799> issue<00:01:58.950> by<00:01:59.340> using<00:01:59.640> a<00:02:00.090> lower<00:02:00.869> density

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
that issue by using a lower density

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.310 
that issue by using a lower density
sensor<00:02:02.520> probably<00:02:03.119> something<00:02:03.360> around<00:02:03.719> 12

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
sensor probably something around 12

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.289 
sensor probably something around 12
megapixels<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.579> able<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.820> leave<00:02:06.000> that

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
megapixels to be able to leave that

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.449 
megapixels to be able to leave that
whole<00:02:06.540> sensor<00:02:07.110> at<00:02:07.290> once<00:02:07.530> some<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> other

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
whole sensor at once some of the other

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.699 
whole sensor at once some of the other
things<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.970> think<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> 60d<00:02:09.869> will<00:02:10.319> bring

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
things that I think the 60d will bring

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.430 
things that I think the 60d will bring
the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.310 
the
and<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.890> t2i<00:02:12.370> does<00:02:12.700> not<00:02:12.910> have<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.870> 70

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
and the t2i does not have that the 70

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.220 
and the t2i does not have that the 70
does<00:02:14.560> have<00:02:14.860> but<00:02:15.430> for<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.670> lower<00:02:15.850> price<00:02:16.020> will<00:02:17.020> be

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
does have but for a lower price will be

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.850 
does have but for a lower price will be
10<00:02:17.710> ati<00:02:18.010> hdmi<00:02:18.730> out<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.930> i<00:02:20.080> also<00:02:20.260> think<00:02:20.560> it'll

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
10 ati hdmi out and i also think it'll

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.830 
10 ati hdmi out and i also think it'll
be<00:02:20.890> able<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.310> select<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.820> native<00:02:22.150> iso<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.630> the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
be able to select the native iso to the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.940 
be able to select the native iso to the
sensor<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.770> those<00:02:24.280> 13<00:02:25.080> iso<00:02:26.080> steps<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.710> aren't

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
sensor so those 13 iso steps that aren't

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.310 
sensor so those 13 iso steps that aren't
available<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.550> t2i<00:02:27.940> i<00:02:28.330> wouldn't<00:02:29.200> hesitate

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
available on the t2i i wouldn't hesitate

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.380 
available on the t2i i wouldn't hesitate
to<00:02:29.800> believe<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.370> they'll<00:02:30.550> be<00:02:30.580> included<00:02:31.240> on

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
to believe that they'll be included on

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.600 
to believe that they'll be included on
the<00:02:31.600> 60d<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.320> any<00:02:32.740> case<00:02:32.830> from<00:02:33.280> what's<00:02:33.520> been

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
the 60d in any case from what's been

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.410 
the 60d in any case from what's been
released<00:02:34.120> about<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:35.320> 60d<00:02:35.860> so<00:02:36.070> far<00:02:36.420> it's

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
released about the 60d so far it's

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.970 
released about the 60d so far it's
probably<00:02:37.750> going<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.020> be<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.320> best<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.920> most

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
probably going to be the best and most

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.140 
probably going to be the best and most

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
cost efficient canon DSLR to buy to use

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.020 
cost efficient canon DSLR to buy to use

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.090 
strictly for video mode now for stills I
would<00:02:46.210> still<00:02:46.480> assume<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.960> 60d<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.680> going<00:02:47.980> to

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
would still assume the 60d is going to

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.720 
would still assume the 60d is going to
be<00:02:48.250> slower<00:02:48.970> in<00:02:49.210> frames<00:02:49.540> per<00:02:49.690> second<00:02:50.080> than<00:02:50.230> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
be slower in frames per second than the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.910 
be slower in frames per second than the
70<00:02:51.730> but<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.540> still<00:02:52.930> might<00:02:53.110> be<00:02:53.170> weatherproof

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
70 but it still might be weatherproof

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.150 
70 but it still might be weatherproof
like<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.520> 17<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:56.080> from<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.500> rumors<00:02:56.890> that

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
like the 17 so from of the rumors that

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.100 
like the 17 so from of the rumors that
have<00:02:57.340> been<00:02:57.400> released<00:02:57.820> so<00:02:58.180> far<00:02:58.210> i<00:02:58.420> would<00:02:58.840> think

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
have been released so far i would think

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.990 
have been released so far i would think
that<00:02:59.260> probably<00:02:59.830> it<00:03:00.250> will<00:03:00.340> get<00:03:00.490> announced<00:03:00.940> in

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
that probably it will get announced in

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.060 
that probably it will get announced in
the<00:03:01.060> next<00:03:01.300> couple<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.630> weeks<00:03:01.900> and<00:03:02.200> from<00:03:02.920> there

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
the next couple of weeks and from there

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.190 
the next couple of weeks and from there
you<00:03:03.100> should<00:03:03.460> see<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:04.180> lot<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.570> these<00:03:04.810> things<00:03:04.960> i'm

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
you should see a lot of these things i'm

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.680 
you should see a lot of these things i'm
telling<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.590> are<00:03:05.680> probably<00:03:06.040> true<00:03:06.670> if<00:03:07.390> not

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
telling you are probably true if not

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.040 
telling you are probably true if not
i'll<00:03:07.840> do<00:03:07.960> another<00:03:07.990> update<00:03:08.530> going<00:03:08.830> over
