opinion is seen as a threat a world
where<00:00:15.740> artists<00:00:16.340> have<00:00:16.670> to<00:00:16.699> live<00:00:17.060> in<00:00:17.210> fear<00:00:17.240> of

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
where artists have to live in fear of

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.409 
where artists have to live in fear of
creating<00:00:18.650> art<00:00:19.539> in<00:00:21.159> my<00:00:22.159> mind<00:00:22.460> this<00:00:22.820> world<00:00:23.150> is

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
creating art in my mind this world is

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.159 
creating art in my mind this world is
dark<00:00:23.869> and<00:00:24.109> lonely<00:00:24.909> not<00:00:25.909> only<00:00:26.119> for<00:00:26.419> artists<00:00:26.960> but

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
dark and lonely not only for artists but

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.409 
dark and lonely not only for artists but
also<00:00:27.230> for<00:00:27.859> people<00:00:28.220> who<00:00:28.429> cannot<00:00:28.730> be<00:00:28.789> inspired

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
also for people who cannot be inspired

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.979 
also for people who cannot be inspired
by<00:00:29.599> their<00:00:29.989> works<00:00:30.169> of<00:00:30.439> art<00:00:31.450> my<00:00:32.450> life<00:00:32.720> for

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
by their works of art my life for

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.720 
by their works of art my life for
instance<00:00:33.380> would<00:00:33.710> be<00:00:33.890> completely<00:00:34.520> different

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
instance would be completely different

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.270 
instance would be completely different
if<00:00:35.180> I'd<00:00:35.360> not<00:00:35.600> been<00:00:35.810> exposed<00:00:36.290> to<00:00:36.620> certain<00:00:36.890> works

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
if I'd not been exposed to certain works

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.510 
if I'd not been exposed to certain works
of<00:00:37.490> art<00:00:37.700> I<00:00:38.140> can<00:00:39.140> remember<00:00:39.410> pieces<00:00:39.980> that<00:00:40.130> vastly

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
of art I can remember pieces that vastly

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.250 
of art I can remember pieces that vastly
changed<00:00:40.790> my<00:00:41.060> perception<00:00:41.420> of<00:00:41.720> the<00:00:41.840> world<00:00:41.960> and

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
changed my perception of the world and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.680 
changed my perception of the world and
sometimes<00:00:43.100> I<00:00:43.250> wonder<00:00:43.430> what<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:44.030> would<00:00:44.360> be<00:00:44.510> like

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
sometimes I wonder what I would be like

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.650 
sometimes I wonder what I would be like
I<00:00:44.960> not<00:00:45.200> experienced<00:00:45.860> them<00:00:46.660> even

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
I not experienced them even

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.020 
I not experienced them even
conversations<00:00:48.590> that<00:00:48.830> would<00:00:48.980> take<00:00:49.190> place<00:00:49.490> and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
conversations that would take place and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.000 
conversations that would take place and
the<00:00:50.240> lack<00:00:50.450> of<00:00:50.480> energy<00:00:50.960> in<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.350> world<00:00:51.530> would<00:00:51.860> be

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
the lack of energy in the world would be

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.050 
the lack of energy in the world would be
dull<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:52.580> horrifying<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:55.400> world<00:00:55.700> would<00:00:55.940> be

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
dull and horrifying the world would be

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.630 
dull and horrifying the world would be
divided<00:00:56.660> with<00:00:57.050> people<00:00:57.410> always<00:00:57.890> wondering<00:00:58.460> if

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
divided with people always wondering if

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.880 
divided with people always wondering if
others<00:00:59.000> were<00:00:59.240> feeling<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.630> same<00:00:59.960> emotions<00:01:00.620> as

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
others were feeling the same emotions as

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.790 
others were feeling the same emotions as
they<00:01:01.100> were<00:01:01.690> perhaps<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:03.050> be<00:01:03.260> able<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.530> talk

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
they were perhaps to be able to talk

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.800 
they were perhaps to be able to talk
about<00:01:03.980> it<00:01:04.129> but<00:01:04.579> nothing<00:01:05.150> communicates

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
about it but nothing communicates

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.899 
about it but nothing communicates
emotion<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.680> way<00:01:06.710> art<00:01:07.040> does

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.880 

so<00:01:13.909> maybe<00:01:14.149> artists<00:01:14.810> would<00:01:14.899> still<00:01:15.259> be<00:01:15.409> creating

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
so maybe artists would still be creating

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.069 
so maybe artists would still be creating
work<00:01:16.100> but<00:01:16.970> that<00:01:17.149> work<00:01:17.390> would<00:01:17.630> have<00:01:17.689> to<00:01:17.990> be

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
work but that work would have to be

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.410 
work but that work would have to be
locked<00:01:18.380> up<00:01:18.590> where<00:01:19.280> no<00:01:19.520> one<00:01:19.700> could<00:01:19.880> find<00:01:19.939> it

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
locked up where no one could find it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.160 
locked up where no one could find it
where<00:01:21.290> no<00:01:21.560> one<00:01:21.770> could<00:01:21.979> be<00:01:22.130> inspired<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.170> no

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
where no one could be inspired and no

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:42.069 
where no one could be inspired and no
one<00:01:24.409> could<00:01:24.680> feel<00:01:24.920> joy

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.410 

but<00:01:43.079> thankfully<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:44.040> not<00:01:44.340> how<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.909> you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
but thankfully that's not how it is you
