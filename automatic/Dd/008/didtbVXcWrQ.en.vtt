Background music playing.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.170
Music playing.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.170
Violin playing.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.170
I think of Ace Venture when I hear this song.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.309
We ended up having to wait two hours to get
a table here in the Tea Salon.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:01:02.010
Initially they told us it would only be a
one hour wait but by the time one hour had

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.049
passed we had waited so long that we figured
it was probably worth it to stay and now Sam

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.110
is not very pleased.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.110
He's looking at me with evil eyes.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.110
Are you freaking kidding me.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.110
Sam is hiding behind the camera because he's
so angry that he had to wait for two hours.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.110
That now I'm being punished by having to be
on camera all alone.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.110
Okay, so if your'e looking to go afternoon
tea in Hong Kong.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.650
The Peninsula is the place to come.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:34.250
This is the oldest hotel in all of Hong Kong
and it's super popular.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.510
The lineups really speak for themselves.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.630
background music playing.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.719
Symphony orchestra.

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:56.060
Mmmm, so I got my self a nice little tea cup
of mango tea.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.450
And it smells like fresh mangoes.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.920
So good.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.380
Mmmm, tropical.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.580
Background music playing.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.970
We've already dug into the food.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.900
We couldn't help it.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.350
If you go to the bottom here we have the scones
which we can eat with the clotted cream and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.360
jam.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.910
Over here we have some nice finger sandwiches
with salmon, cucumber and up top we have the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.150
cakes and the macaroons and lots of other
treats.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.800
So here I'm preparing my scones with clotted
cream and jam.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.890
This is a favorite of mine.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:39.890
Whenever I go to London to visit my friend
Rebecca I always end up staying at her house

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:47.519
and I eat scones with clotted cream and jam
three times a day.

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.519
I eat it for breakfast, for lunch and also
for my late night snack.

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.970
So I always get fat when I go over there.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.810
Symphony music playing.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.650
Background music playing.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.110
The food was amazing.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.239
I think it was definitely worth the two hour
wait.

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.989
Although, I would have preferred not having
to wait that long.

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:19.080
Some favorites were the little lemon meringue
tarts in a chocolate shell.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.900
Plus I really liked the scones with the clotted
cream.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.040
Then they had sandwiches with salmon that
were amazing.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.450
So I'm a happy girl.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.060
So I think it's kind of funny that we had
to wait two hours in line but it only took

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.310
us 30 minutes to finish off all of the food
in front of us.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.430
That doesn't make sense.
