your opponent um live hard is very fast
much<00:00:41.339> faster<00:00:41.370> than<00:00:41.820> Sableye<00:00:42.239> because<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
much faster than Sableye because if the

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.420 
much faster than Sableye because if the
base<00:00:42.989> speed<00:00:43.199> is<00:00:43.350> actually<00:00:43.829> very<00:00:43.860> very<00:00:44.250> high

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
base speed is actually very very high

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.030 
base speed is actually very very high
and<00:00:44.900> therefore<00:00:45.900> if<00:00:46.049> you<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.290> ever<00:00:46.559> against

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
part is definitely sure that XP that

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.090 
part is definitely sure that XP that
Pokemon<00:00:51.839> unless<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.409> like<00:00:52.470> a<00:00:52.530> Lim's<00:00:52.769> Akkad

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
but then again you could also put speed

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:55.850 
but then again you could also put speed
investment<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.140> I'm<00:00:55.260> sure<00:00:55.409> you'll<00:00:55.619> be<00:00:55.769> able

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.460 
feel afraid to switch in the lie part
and<00:01:35.220> then<00:01:35.550> go<00:01:35.730> for<00:01:35.940> an<00:01:36.030> encore<00:01:36.180> cuz<00:01:36.720> basically

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and then go for an encore cuz basically

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.630 
and then go for an encore cuz basically
your<00:01:37.560> opponent's<00:01:37.920> force<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.250> switch<00:01:38.430> out

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
your opponent's force to switch out

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.149 
your opponent's force to switch out
because<00:01:38.970> they<00:01:39.570> can't<00:01:39.810> change<00:01:40.290> moves<00:01:40.620> as<00:01:40.860> if

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
because they can't change moves as if

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.410 
because they can't change moves as if
they<00:01:41.280> think<00:01:41.370> they<00:01:41.580> even<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.330> they

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
they think they even know what they

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.969 
they think they even know what they
might<00:01:42.570> reach<00:01:42.750> plastic<00:01:43.200> speed<00:01:43.470> they<00:01:43.650> still<00:01:43.830> can

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
might reach plastic speed they still can

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.440 
might reach plastic speed they still can
change<00:01:44.190> moves<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.240> price

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
change moves because you have the price

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.620 
change moves because you have the price

to<00:01:53.970> move<00:01:54.180> that's<00:01:54.630> gonna<00:01:54.840> basically<00:01:55.290> force

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
to move that's gonna basically force

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.469

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
switching out then they're stupid

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.520 
switching out then they're stupid

small chance to miss I think it has 99 t
at<00:03:03.790> crissy<00:03:04.359> so<00:03:04.900> definitely<00:03:05.760> watch<00:03:06.760> out<00:03:07.000> for

at crissy so definitely watch out for
those<00:03:07.659> this<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.049> because<00:03:08.230> sometimes<00:03:08.590> that

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
those this is because sometimes that

those this is because sometimes that

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
might cheer you up a little bit but

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.240 
might cheer you up a little bit but
that's<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.209> big<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:11.650> will<00:03:11.769> play<00:03:11.919> is<00:03:11.980> there

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
because fat employees base damage is

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.780 
because fat employees base damage is
based<00:03:14.379> off<00:03:14.530> how<00:03:14.769> much<00:03:14.919> attacks<00:03:15.310> dad<00:03:15.609> your

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
for the swagger is that we went for a

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.599 
for the swagger is that we went for a
confused<00:03:26.470> rate<00:03:26.650> or<00:03:26.769> something<00:03:27.069> like<00:03:27.190> that<00:03:27.250> so

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
confused rate or something like that so

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.869 
confused rate or something like that so

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
me you during good it's much but I think
