engine<00:02:12.769> wise<00:02:12.950> than<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.370> old<00:02:13.550> soul<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:14.120> it

engine wise than the old soul and it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.690 
engine wise than the old soul and it
does<00:02:14.720> use<00:02:15.019> more<00:02:15.380> fuel<00:02:15.680> because<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.400> bigger

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
does use more fuel because it is bigger

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.930 
does use more fuel because it is bigger
and<00:02:16.970> heavier<00:02:18.190> after<00:02:19.190> spending<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.670> few<00:02:19.880> hours

behind<00:02:20.299> the<00:02:20.540> wheel<00:02:20.570> I'd<00:02:20.959> say<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.290> ride<00:02:21.470> is

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
behind the wheel I'd say the ride is

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.880 
behind the wheel I'd say the ride is
firm<00:02:21.769> but<00:02:22.340> not<00:02:22.940> too<00:02:23.330> rough<00:02:23.769> well<00:02:24.769> it's

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
firm but not too rough well it's

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.680 
firm but not too rough well it's
actually<00:02:25.100> been<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.250> lot<00:02:25.580> of<00:02:25.610> fun<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.090> drive<00:02:26.330> and
