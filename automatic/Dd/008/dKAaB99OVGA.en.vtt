 occupy the truth is that they are going to be 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.730
 very easy this will need 'www 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.410
 interior to activate our theme it 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.630
 We prepare to activate what is being 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.390
 the logos 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.420
 that includes us creator and we are going to 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.420
 need 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.810
 good in case you want to install 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.180
 I recommend it a lot and good 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.710
 it would be all going to perform a response 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.090
 device and to activate it is going to be 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.670
 very easy now they are going to say to winter 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.040
 board 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.990
 we are not going to select themes 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.030
 and here in select subjects I would 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.280
 I recommend that you activate them from this 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.370
 way how good is the folder that 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.780
 says and are the main images for 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.210
 activate the icons or modify the 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.250
 icons notification icons 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.780
 what is being the shadow nostra and 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.820
 two types of shadows for both 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.290
 for us it is essential that I 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.900
 I liked this staff more than it says there is 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.570
 21 shell on the screen 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.240

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.580
 in account also here we can activate 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.410
 the various images for others 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.820
 tics so it's good that you already activate 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.889
 according to what they have installed in 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.630
 your device and you will perform a 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.240
 I breathe and well, gentlemen, it would be 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.770
