00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.970
 like in your darkroom you felt a 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.710

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.030
 asleep and the only thing that worries you is 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.220
 that in the morning they are going to claim you 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.870
 have arrived home so late when 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.410

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.479
 midnight good you're tired and you fall to 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.300
 the bed with the same speed that you used 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.660
 to sneak away a peaceful sleep 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.500
 seize you steps steps out of your 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.090
 room you get up that is think and 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.190

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.500
 betray remember the stories of 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.390
 your friends but quickly discard 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.820
 that option because you know that everything 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.530
 they exaggerated their stories so 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.410
 you just lie down again and 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.180

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.090
 minutes you hear stealth steps

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.670
 belonging to every centimeter of your 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.770
 skin doubting your judgment 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.260
 you get up and turn on the light at the bottom of 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.480
 your room because you know that as a child that 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.180

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.340
