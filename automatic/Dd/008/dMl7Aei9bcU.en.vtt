kangaroo leather versions so this is a

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.380 
kangaroo leather versions so this is a
boot<00:00:17.460> I'll<00:00:17.609> show<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.449> site<00:00:20.750> up<00:00:21.750> here<00:00:23.390> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
boot I'll show you the site up here the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.750 
boot I'll show you the site up here the
back

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.870 

so<00:00:31.360> for<00:00:31.630> these<00:00:31.810> boots<00:00:32.370> it<00:00:33.370> is<00:00:33.550> kangaroo

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
so for these boots it is kangaroo

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.670 
so for these boots it is kangaroo
leather<00:00:35.040> obviously<00:00:36.040> and<00:00:37.560> comparing<00:00:38.560> the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
leather obviously and comparing the

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.350 
leather obviously and comparing the
kangaroo<00:00:39.190> leather<00:00:39.220> version<00:00:39.820> to<00:00:40.330> the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
kangaroo leather version to the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.510 
kangaroo leather version to the
synthetic<00:00:41.140> leather<00:00:41.650> version<00:00:41.950> is<00:00:42.250> a<00:00:42.280> big

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
synthetic leather version is a big

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.880 
synthetic leather version is a big
difference<00:00:42.730> where<00:00:43.480> the<00:00:44.290> synthetic<00:00:44.500> leather

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
difference where the synthetic leather

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.060 
difference where the synthetic leather
version<00:00:45.280> has<00:00:45.700> the<00:00:46.059> rubber<00:00:46.930> part<00:00:47.050> here<00:00:47.739> to

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
version has the rubber part here to

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.380 
version has the rubber part here to
teach<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.239> creative<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:49.809> enhanced<00:00:50.260> but<00:00:50.500> I

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
teach the creative is enhanced but I

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.250 
teach the creative is enhanced but I
don't<00:00:52.390> think<00:00:52.600> that<00:00:52.809> makes<00:00:52.989> a<00:00:53.080> big<00:00:53.230> difference

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
don't think that makes a big difference

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.210 
don't think that makes a big difference
though<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:54.790> it<00:00:54.910> has<00:00:55.059> a<00:00:55.090> shot<00:00:55.600> shield<00:00:56.220> there

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
though and it has a shot shield there

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.500 
though and it has a shot shield there
it's<00:00:58.150> increase<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.780> grip<00:00:59.050> we<00:00:59.850> let<00:01:00.850> me<00:01:00.970> get<00:01:01.480> a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
it's increase the grip we let me get a

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.260 
it's increase the grip we let me get a
ball<00:01:01.780> here<00:01:02.050> it<00:01:02.320> has<00:01:02.500> more<00:01:02.739> power<00:01:03.010> on<00:01:03.190> it<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
ball here it has more power on it and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.160 
ball here it has more power on it and
here<00:01:07.270> there's<00:01:07.510> rubber<00:01:07.840> which<00:01:08.370> one<00:01:09.370> ball

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
here there's rubber which one ball

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.440 
here there's rubber which one ball
because<00:01:11.170> you<00:01:11.290> can<00:01:11.440> serve<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.860> ball<00:01:12.070> more

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
because you can serve the ball more

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.790 
because you can serve the ball more

here<00:01:19.080> lacing<00:01:20.080> system<00:01:20.260> exterior<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.430> a<00:01:21.460> twin

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
here lacing system exterior is a twin

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.320 
here lacing system exterior is a twin
lacing<00:01:22.270> system<00:01:22.450> which<00:01:23.440> one<00:01:24.340> lace<00:01:24.640> gets<00:01:24.970> closer

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
lacing system which one lace gets closer

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.830 
lacing system which one lace gets closer
and<00:01:25.540> another<00:01:25.930> laser<00:01:26.200> slip<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:28.540> not<00:01:28.659> like

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
and another laser slip it's not like

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.270 
and another laser slip it's not like
cross<00:01:29.440> switching<00:01:30.040> type<00:01:30.850> of<00:01:31.479> thing<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.979> the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
cross switching type of thing and the

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.090 
cross switching type of thing and the
start<00:01:33.580> this<00:01:33.940> part<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:35.110> very<00:01:35.380> cool<00:01:35.560> alignment

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
start this part is a very cool alignment

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.170 
start this part is a very cool alignment
of<00:01:36.250> parking<00:01:36.640> spots<00:01:38.520> provides<00:01:39.520> great<00:01:39.760> traction

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
of parking spots provides great traction

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.160 
of parking spots provides great traction
and<00:01:40.540> so<00:01:40.720> things<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:42.450> subsequently<00:01:43.450> a<00:01:43.750> male

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
and so things and subsequently a male

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.210 
and so things and subsequently a male
like<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.410> bit<00:01:44.710> of<00:01:45.330> transparent
