have to Train to hold us down he knew

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.350 
have to Train to hold us down he knew
what<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.369> guy<00:01:59.490> wasn't<00:01:59.820> like<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.210> knew

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
what to do this guy wasn't like you knew

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.539 
what to do this guy wasn't like you knew
all<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> legends<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.020> everything<00:02:01.549> he

already knew it he controls Great Ape
and<00:02:03.990> everything<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.590> thought<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.159> was

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and everything so I thought that was

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.359 
and everything so I thought that was
good<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.729> liked<00:02:06.210> how<00:02:06.479> Vegeta<00:02:06.990> was<00:02:07.350> able<00:02:07.649> to

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
good I liked how Vegeta was able to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.859 
good I liked how Vegeta was able to
come<00:02:08.549> back<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> end<00:02:09.060> I'm<00:02:09.450> hoping<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.810> he

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
come back at the end I'm hoping that he

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.750 
come back at the end I'm hoping that he
comes<00:02:10.019> back<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.709> magical<00:02:11.159> who<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.549> one

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.430 
comes back so magical who is this one
this<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.180> but<00:02:12.330> here<00:02:12.989> we<00:02:13.049> go

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
this one but here we go

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.570 
this one but here we go
this<00:02:13.799> is<00:02:13.920> probably<00:02:14.190> were<00:02:14.280> they<00:02:14.370> gonna<00:02:14.489> be

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
this is probably were they gonna be

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.009 
this is probably were they gonna be
fighting<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.120> movie<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:15.659> solar<00:02:15.900> and

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
fighting in the movie to like solar and

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.080 
fighting in the movie to like solar and
outer<00:02:16.170> space<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.799> this<00:02:16.980> like<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.940> outer

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
outer space like this like on the outer

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.820 
outer space like this like on the outer
perimeters<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.659> Earth<00:02:18.900> but<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.319> somewhat

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
perimeters of Earth but this is somewhat

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.199 
perimeters of Earth but this is somewhat
similar<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.400> scenery

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
similar to scenery

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.780

like that it really aren't that's what a
lot<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.739> animes<00:03:14.040> fail<00:03:14.450> anyway<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.660> my

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
lot of animes fail anyway and my

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.839 
lot of animes fail anyway and my
personal<00:03:16.739> opinion<00:03:17.010> Super<00:03:17.250> Saiyan<00:03:17.489> God<00:03:17.579> Goku

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
personal opinion Super Saiyan God Goku

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.349 
personal opinion Super Saiyan God Goku
would<00:03:18.120> defeat<00:03:18.450> Super<00:03:18.720> Saiyan<00:03:18.959> for<00:03:19.430> Goku<00:03:20.430> mate

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
would defeat Super Saiyan for Goku mate

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.089 
would defeat Super Saiyan for Goku mate
for<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.599> main<00:03:21.750> reason<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.440> also<00:03:22.709> is<00:03:22.799> because

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
for the main reason just also is because

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.589 
for the main reason just also is because
I<00:03:23.280> think<00:03:23.400> bills<00:03:23.790> would<00:03:23.910> be<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.150> same<00:03:24.299> levels

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
I think bills would be the same levels

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.349 
I think bills would be the same levels
will<00:03:24.690> make<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> Shenron<00:03:25.349> unless<00:03:26.160> unless<00:03:26.879> it's

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
will make a Shenron unless unless it's

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.259 
will make a Shenron unless unless it's
the<00:03:27.599> same<00:03:27.810> powers<00:03:28.139> we're<00:03:28.470> saying<00:03:28.650> for<00:03:29.269> Goku

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
the same powers we're saying for Goku

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.819 
the same powers we're saying for Goku
