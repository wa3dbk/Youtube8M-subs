00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:07.609
 I want to show you a video on 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:12.670
 connecting this device 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:17.480
 called super mini dvr makers 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.330
 there are different firmware different after 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.030
 I unsuccessfully stitched my 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.480
 the device he hung with me I decided 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.610
 to make 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:35.050
 according to the description of the forum 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:41.530
 connection via serial port 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.530
 here we have here we see four points 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:55.489
 here they are 1 2 3 4 4 dots we thaw 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:59.690
 we look at them as follows wire 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.500
 power + 3 3 volts optional 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.990
 unsolder 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.959
 it is up to whoever wants 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:13.219
 black wire is the most common 

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:22.729
 right next goes green pro green 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:26.539
 wire is the wire rxd 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:30.069
 that is, it connects with us on t 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:36.219
 xd our adapter 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:37.340
 we change the yellow wire is our txd 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:42.200
 signal 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:46.909
 it connects to pin rxd 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.840
 our adapter is an adapter yusbi tt 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.370
 logic can be any what you have 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.700
 We establish the main thing that would 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:59.050
 whether the driver and the like that is 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.460
 so that no problems connect the power 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:09.260
 by wire yuzbi 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.800
 computer next we take connect our 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.800
 adapter 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.500
 We turn our attention to our super 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:31.379
 computer 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:31.379
 run the path set the settings 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.129
 we have an adapter usb adapter 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.879
 hanged on whom port 6 don't know see 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:46.629
 you or not believe the word 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:53.310
 Specify the com port 6 serial and speed 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:58.530
 115 200 all connect connect 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.530
 Now we take press the power button 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.450
 went to boot our device here 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.970
 it was desirable to press the spacebar 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:17.349
 to stop autoload 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:21.880
 stopped further you can climb by 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:25.150
 relief is standard but small 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.410
 bootable which gives us the opportunity 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.099
 some machinations that i don't know 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:36.030
 so that still wanted to say 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:39.630
 recovery occurred by loading 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.019
 with usb flash drives 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:49.000
 This operation is described in detail on 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:54.239
 the forum has been inserted a usb flash drive 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.319
 it was first recorded but boot 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.319
 download files recorded 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:06.510
 images inserted included that is 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.730
 turned off 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.629
 included and we went to boot from 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:19.299
 yusbi for Russian but given this moment to me 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:20.150
 izba is a full download all like this 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.009
 way 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.009
 as for connecting usb adapter 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.009
 thank
