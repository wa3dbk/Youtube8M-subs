00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.730 

so<00:04:25.090> basically<00:04:25.390> you've<00:04:25.570> got<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.810> grid<00:04:25.990> here<00:04:26.170> we

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
so basically you've got the grid here we

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.170 
so basically you've got the grid here we
look<00:04:26.860> at<00:04:26.920> class<00:04:27.220> rule<00:04:29.520> ok<00:04:30.520> we<00:04:30.670> can<00:04:30.700> move<00:04:31.000> it

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
look at class rule ok we can move it

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.290 
look at class rule ok we can move it
along<00:04:31.920> ok<00:04:32.920> so<00:04:32.980> what<00:04:33.280> we've<00:04:33.460> got<00:04:33.490> what<00:04:34.150> we've

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
along ok so what we've got what we've

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.220 
along ok so what we've got what we've
got<00:04:34.540> now<00:04:34.570> is<00:04:35.050> an<00:04:35.290> analysis<00:04:35.890> of<00:04:36.180> everybody's

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
got now is an analysis of everybody's

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.140 
got now is an analysis of everybody's
questions<00:04:38.230> everyone's<00:04:38.980> answers<00:04:39.550> in<00:04:39.820> how

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
questions everyone's answers in how

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150 
questions everyone's answers in how
we've<00:04:40.420> done<00:04:40.660> okay<00:04:41.170> so<00:04:41.830> you've<00:04:41.980> got<00:04:42.010> your

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
we've done okay so you've got your

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.910 
we've done okay so you've got your
totals<00:04:42.700> out<00:04:42.820> of<00:04:43.060> 10<00:04:43.330> your<00:04:43.840> percentages<00:04:44.590> and

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
totals out of 10 your percentages and

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.100 
totals out of 10 your percentages and
your<00:04:45.280> average<00:04:45.610> response<00:04:45.910> so<00:04:46.510> your<00:04:46.660> response

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
your average response so your response

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.750 
your average response so your response
time<00:04:47.500> some<00:04:47.860> of<00:04:47.980> your<00:04:48.130> a<00:04:48.190> bit<00:04:48.340> quicker<00:04:48.580> than

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
time some of your a bit quicker than

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.640 
time some of your a bit quicker than
others<00:04:48.880> okay<00:04:49.630> but<00:04:49.960> that<00:04:50.110> doesn't<00:04:50.350> matter<00:04:50.440> it

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
others okay but that doesn't matter it

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.960 
others okay but that doesn't matter it
might<00:04:50.830> mean<00:04:51.040> that<00:04:51.070> you've<00:04:51.340> got<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.550> answers

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
might mean that you've got the answers

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.500 
might mean that you've got the answers
more<00:04:52.540> than<00:04:52.750> someone<00:04:53.020> else<00:04:53.200> okay<00:04:53.530> so<00:04:54.510> okay

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
more than someone else okay so okay

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.270 
more than someone else okay so okay
right<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:55.990> if<00:04:56.320> we<00:04:56.410> look<00:04:56.440> at<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.710> first<00:04:56.950> the

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
right so if we look at the first the

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.950 
right so if we look at the first the
software<00:04:57.580> also<00:04:57.850> enables<00:04:58.360> teachers<00:04:58.510> to<00:04:58.840> go

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
software also enables teachers to go

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.870 
software also enables teachers to go
through<00:04:59.200> each<00:04:59.230> question<00:04:59.740> in<00:05:00.040> turn<00:05:00.280> after<00:05:00.610> the

do you want to come up you come up for

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.680 
do you want to come up you come up for
me<00:05:08.740> come<00:05:09.280> to<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.460> front<00:05:09.580> don't<00:05:10.150> you<00:05:10.270> explain

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
me come to the front don't you explain

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.680 
me come to the front don't you explain
how<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:11.590> come<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.250> the<00:05:12.340> answer<00:05:12.820> of<00:05:13.030> which

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
how you come to the answer of which

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.490 
how you come to the answer of which
letter<00:05:14.140> has<00:05:14.410> rotational<00:05:14.920> symmetry<00:05:16.500> okay

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
letter has rotational symmetry okay

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.880 
letter has rotational symmetry okay
please<00:05:17.680> come<00:05:18.600> okay<00:05:19.600> so<00:05:20.230> how<00:05:20.380> did<00:05:20.440> you<00:05:20.620> get<00:05:20.770> to

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
please come okay so how did you get to

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.720 
please come okay so how did you get to
that<00:05:20.920> rotational<00:05:21.640> symmetry<00:05:24.270> okay

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
that rotational symmetry okay

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:32.150 
that rotational symmetry okay
okay<00:05:27.730> so<00:05:27.790> what<00:05:28.030> about<00:05:28.060> rotational<00:05:28.960> symmetry

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.970 

yeah<00:05:33.480> brilliant<00:05:34.480> okay<00:05:35.020> what<00:05:35.560> Taylor's<00:05:35.950> just

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
yeah brilliant okay what Taylor's just

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.340 
yeah brilliant okay what Taylor's just
said<00:05:36.340> is<00:05:36.580> if<00:05:36.790> you<00:05:36.970> turn<00:05:37.210> it<00:05:37.240> around<00:05:37.510> or<00:05:37.960> upside

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
said is if you turn it around or upside

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.650 
said is if you turn it around or upside
down<00:05:38.680> it<00:05:39.010> will<00:05:39.190> still<00:05:39.460> look<00:05:39.670> the<00:05:39.730> same<00:05:39.880> which

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
down it will still look the same which

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.840 
down it will still look the same which
is<00:05:40.690> what<00:05:41.050> rotational<00:05:41.830> symmetry<00:05:42.340> is<00:05:42.490> so<00:05:42.670> if<00:05:42.760> you

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
is what rotational symmetry is so if you

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.490 
is what rotational symmetry is so if you
didn't<00:05:43.120> know<00:05:43.240> that<00:05:43.510> that<00:05:43.990> is<00:05:44.140> what<00:05:44.290> we<00:05:44.470> are

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
didn't know that that is what we are

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.410 
didn't know that that is what we are
looking<00:05:44.710> for<00:05:44.920> well<00:05:45.250> done<00:05:45.460> Taylor<00:05:45.760> to<00:05:46.030> sit<00:05:46.240> down

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
looking for well done Taylor to sit down

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.590 
looking for well done Taylor to sit down
okay<00:05:46.690> brilliant<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:48.580> analysis<00:05:49.000> results<00:05:49.450> can

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
okay brilliant the analysis results can

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.600
