now look when you actually set this up
for<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.410> first<00:03:52.650> time<00:03:52.830> it's<00:03:53.100> going<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.430> ask<00:03:53.519> you

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
for the first time it's going to ask you

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.910 
for the first time it's going to ask you
if<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.060> have<00:03:54.299> different<00:03:55.049> various<00:03:55.440> accounts

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
if you have different various accounts

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.630 
if you have different various accounts
so<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.070> sign<00:03:56.400> into<00:03:56.640> your<00:03:56.910> Windows<00:03:57.630> Live<00:03:57.900> your

so you sign into your Windows Live your

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.990 
so you sign into your Windows Live your

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
messenger your outlook your gmail and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.120 
messenger your outlook your gmail and
also<00:04:03.239> Facebook<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:03.959> Twitter<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.980> will

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
also Facebook and Twitter and it will

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.530 
also Facebook and Twitter and it will
begin<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.640> pull<00:04:05.910> information<00:04:06.299> from<00:04:06.750> all<00:04:07.290> those

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
begin to pull information from all those

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.190 
begin to pull information from all those
sites<00:04:08.959> or<00:04:09.260> services<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.459> aggregate<00:04:11.209> them<00:04:11.390> for

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
sites or services and aggregate them for

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.990 
sites or services and aggregate them for
the<00:04:12.290> most<00:04:12.500> part<00:04:12.769> is<00:04:13.040> an<00:04:13.159> intelligence<00:04:13.760> built

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
the most part is an intelligence built

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.420 
the most part is an intelligence built
in<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:14.510> that<00:04:14.689> if<00:04:14.840> it's<00:04:15.079> finding<00:04:15.530> duplications

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
in so that if it's finding duplications

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.379 
in so that if it's finding duplications
of<00:04:16.729> people<00:04:17.600> it<00:04:18.320> will<00:04:18.500> check<00:04:18.919> the<00:04:19.519> email<00:04:19.940> the

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
of people it will check the email the

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.150 
of people it will check the email the
the<00:04:20.630> names<00:04:20.870> obviously<00:04:21.259> and<00:04:21.709> then<00:04:21.799> be<00:04:21.949> able<00:04:21.979> to

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
the names obviously and then be able to

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.830 
the names obviously and then be able to
cross<00:04:22.430> ago<00:04:22.729> these<00:04:22.910> are<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.150> same<00:04:23.300> people<00:04:23.360> so

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
cross ago these are the same people so

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.939 
cross ago these are the same people so
that's<00:04:23.990> going<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.199> merge<00:04:24.470> them<00:04:24.710> into<00:04:24.770> one

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
that's going to merge them into one

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.430 
that's going to merge them into one
account<00:04:25.460> one<00:04:26.000> profile<00:04:26.449> but<00:04:27.080> here's<00:04:27.259> an

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
account one profile but here's an

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.439 
account one profile but here's an
example<00:04:27.740> where<00:04:28.100> I<00:04:28.160> have<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.460> friend<00:04:28.850> and<00:04:29.060> it

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
example where I have a friend and it

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.270 
example where I have a friend and it
wasn't<00:04:29.840> sure<00:04:30.110> there<00:04:30.350> wasn't<00:04:30.470> enough<00:04:30.770> data<00:04:31.070> to

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
wasn't sure there wasn't enough data to

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.100 
wasn't sure there wasn't enough data to
be<00:04:31.520> sure<00:04:31.759> if<00:04:31.880> this<00:04:32.000> is<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.180> same<00:04:32.419> individual

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
be sure if this is the same individual

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.920 
be sure if this is the same individual
but<00:04:33.770> as<00:04:33.979> you<00:04:34.130> can<00:04:34.280> see<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.729> know<00:04:34.820> there's<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.630> go

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
but as you can see you know there's a go

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.050 
but as you can see you know there's a go
into<00:04:36.139> the<00:04:36.229> link<00:04:36.440> option<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.130> it's<00:04:37.460> proposing

coal<00:05:18.530> attendance<00:05:18.919> in<00:05:19.039> them<00:05:19.220> so<00:05:19.400> this<00:05:20.030> is

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
coal attendance in them so this is

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.450 
coal attendance in them so this is
another<00:05:20.419> full<00:05:21.020> circle<00:05:21.440> 360<00:05:22.010> approach<00:05:22.340> that

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
another full circle 360 approach that
