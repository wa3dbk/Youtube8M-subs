seems<00:01:08.420> very<00:01:08.720> jumps<00:01:09.350> it's<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.650> system<00:01:10.280> of

seems very jumps it's a system of

assessment not a single instrument and
it's<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.640> system<00:01:13.820> that's<00:01:14.030> based<00:01:14.390> on<00:01:14.690> a<00:01:14.750> number

it's a system that's based on a number

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
of components that goes on all year long

of components that goes on all year long
and<00:01:18.010> culminates<00:01:19.010> in<00:01:19.220> certain<00:01:19.580> kinds<00:01:20.240> of<00:01:20.330> tasks

and culminates in certain kinds of tasks

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.540 
and culminates in certain kinds of tasks
which<00:01:21.140> we<00:01:21.290> ask<00:01:21.500> students<00:01:21.890> to<00:01:21.950> do<00:01:22.220> but

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
which we ask students to do but

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.610 
which we ask students to do but
demonstrate<00:01:23.270> that<00:01:23.450> they<00:01:23.600> can<00:01:23.660> actually<00:01:24.050> do

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
demonstrate that they can actually do

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.410 
demonstrate that they can actually do
something<00:01:25.040> they<00:01:25.190> can<00:01:25.220> write<00:01:25.970> research<00:01:26.210> papers

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
something they can write research papers

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.900 
something they can write research papers
they<00:01:26.960> can<00:01:27.170> apply<00:01:27.590> mathematical<00:01:28.430> concepts

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
they can apply mathematical concepts

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.230 
they can apply mathematical concepts
basically<00:01:29.720> I<00:01:29.750> was<00:01:29.840> just<00:01:30.380> gonna<00:01:30.470> discuss<00:01:31.240> the

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
basically I was just gonna discuss the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.120 
basically I was just gonna discuss the
current<00:01:32.570> drug<00:01:32.750> policy<00:01:32.780> in<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.590> United<00:01:33.920> States

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
current drug policy in the United States

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.190 
current drug policy in the United States
so<00:01:34.490> it's<00:01:34.640> really<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.940> good<00:01:35.210> indicator<00:01:35.720> we

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
so it's really a good indicator we

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.570 
so it's really a good indicator we
believe<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.710> there's<00:01:36.890> a<00:01:36.950> real<00:01:37.100> predictive

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
believe that there's a real predictive

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.340 
believe that there's a real predictive
validity<00:01:37.670> in<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.180> way<00:01:38.570> in<00:01:38.720> which<00:01:38.900> we<00:01:39.110> approach

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
validity in the way in which we approach

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.040 
validity in the way in which we approach
assessments<00:01:40.340> rather<00:01:41.150> than<00:01:41.570> having<00:01:41.810> a

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
assessments rather than having a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.500 
assessments rather than having a
high-stakes<00:01:42.530> test<00:01:42.890> which<00:01:43.640> puts<00:01:44.240> everything

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
high-stakes test which puts everything

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.980 
high-stakes test which puts everything
on<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:44.840> single<00:01:45.290> score<00:01:45.980> and<00:01:46.760> which<00:01:47.360> leads<00:01:47.720> we

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
on a single score and which leads we

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.050 
on a single score and which leads we
think<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.409> formulaic<00:01:48.950> writing<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.670> doesn't

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
think to formulaic writing and doesn't

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.000 
think to formulaic writing and doesn't
really<00:01:50.300> invest<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.990> kids<00:01:51.260> in<00:01:51.440> any<00:01:51.560> way<00:01:51.800> and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
really invest the kids in any way and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.110 
really invest the kids in any way and
what<00:01:52.190> they're<00:01:52.340> learning<00:01:52.460> is<00:01:52.729> because<00:01:52.909> when<00:01:53.060> I

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
what they're learning is because when I

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.399 
what they're learning is because when I
was<00:01:53.240> reading<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.659> I<00:01:53.720> thought<00:01:54.110> that<00:01:54.260> you<00:01:54.320> have

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
was reading it I thought that you have

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.810 
was reading it I thought that you have
really<00:01:54.680> excellent<00:01:55.010> ideas<00:01:55.370> I<00:01:55.490> just<00:01:55.520> thought

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
really excellent ideas I just thought

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.730 
really excellent ideas I just thought
that<00:01:56.090> maybe<00:01:56.510> we<00:01:56.750> could<00:01:56.870> do<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.050> little<00:01:57.260> shifting

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
that maybe we could do a little shifting

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.680 
that maybe we could do a little shifting
around<00:01:57.979> of<00:01:58.190> certain<00:01:58.520> things<00:01:58.550> we<00:01:59.210> want<00:01:59.450> them<00:01:59.630> to

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
around of certain things we want them to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.960 
around of certain things we want them to
be<00:01:59.900> able<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.290> take<00:02:00.500> text<00:02:01.010> and<00:02:01.220> talk<00:02:01.520> about<00:02:01.820> it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.399 
be able to take text and talk about it
be<00:02:02.090> able<00:02:02.150> to<00:02:02.270> understand<00:02:02.810> how<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:02.960> compare

American Revolution for the whole term

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.869 
American Revolution for the whole term
and<00:03:56.650> we<00:03:57.650> just<00:03:57.859> sat<00:03:58.010> down<00:03:58.069> and<00:03:58.280> took<00:03:58.430> notes<00:03:58.670> and

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
and we just sat down and took notes and

we<00:03:59.060> read<00:03:59.239> about<00:03:59.540> it<00:04:00.700> but<00:04:03.250> when<00:04:04.250> i<00:04:04.280> came<00:04:04.400> here

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
we read about it but when i came here

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.479 
we read about it but when i came here
and<00:04:05.299> i<00:04:05.510> took<00:04:05.569> constitutional<00:04:06.500> law<00:04:06.650> i<00:04:07.010> got<00:04:07.370> to

and i took constitutional law i got to

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.280 
and i took constitutional law i got to

them<00:04:09.469> i<00:04:10.310> had<00:04:10.489> to<00:04:10.730> defend<00:04:11.480> them<00:04:11.689> and<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:11.900> had<00:04:12.139> to

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
them i had to defend them and I had to

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.810 
them i had to defend them and I had to
make<00:04:13.010> my<00:04:13.250> case<00:04:13.579> and<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.510> really<00:04:14.959> really<00:04:15.829> makes

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
make my case and it really really makes

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.810 
make my case and it really really makes
you<00:04:17.000> have<00:04:17.209> to<00:04:17.449> think<00:04:18.199> logically<00:04:18.739> I<00:04:19.099> think<00:04:19.759> the

you have to think logically I think the

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.460 
you have to think logically I think the
