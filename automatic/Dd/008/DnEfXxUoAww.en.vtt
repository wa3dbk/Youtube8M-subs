don't know how much he goes for that's

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.550 
don't know how much he goes for that's
pretty<00:05:05.520> good<00:05:06.080> but<00:05:07.080> yeah<00:05:07.200> I'm<00:05:07.320> taking

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
pretty good but yeah I'm taking

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.590 
pretty good but yeah I'm taking
chemistry<00:05:07.830> right<00:05:08.070> now<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:08.400> then<00:05:08.600> last

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
chemistry right now and then last

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.710 
chemistry right now and then last
semester<00:05:09.810> I<00:05:10.080> took<00:05:10.230> human<00:05:11.070> dissection<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.690> I

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
semester I took human dissection so I

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.170 
semester I took human dissection so I
dissected<00:05:13.290> a<00:05:13.530> cadaver<00:05:13.920> which<00:05:14.280> is<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.520> dead<00:05:14.970> body

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
dissected a cadaver which is a dead body

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.170 
dissected a cadaver which is a dead body
so<00:05:15.950> I'm<00:05:16.950> sure<00:05:17.190> there's<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.520> lot<00:05:17.670> of<00:05:17.700> squeamish

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
so I'm sure there's a lot of squeamish

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.750 
so I'm sure there's a lot of squeamish
people<00:05:18.540> out<00:05:18.630> there<00:05:18.870> but<00:05:19.140> I<00:05:19.440> pretty<00:05:20.340> much<00:05:20.430> know
