00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.269
 today we will show you a 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.160
 man of the common good here in Japan who 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.199
 You find me easily. 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:45.309

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:45.309
 of the day and salon xavier mouse 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.340
 we're out of the wind so let's go 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.019
 show for you bullet taste salmon and 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.519
 milk made from rice 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.620
 according to some research that people 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.780
 made on the internet milk made from rice 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.000
 it is popular in america and europe but 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.679
 in japan it only started to be sold this 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.750
 year all those milks that we 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:11.780
 we find that it is written with 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.670
 rice here from japan 100% these two here 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.830
 They are made from brown rice and these 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.630
 two here are made of white rice 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:28.970
 first let's open here it's the same 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:31.640
 No brand of rice or ours either. 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.799
 side so after an ok but I will not 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.479
 take everything he finally mine that is 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.399
 made with brown rice is a little bit 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.950
 yellow just a little bit I found it well 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:45.229
 saved but let's also look forward to it 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.079
 same and it seems a little from my south 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:56.990
 injury is a bit of the taste of playing 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:59.180
 for taking sd that is well has a taste is 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.130
 Yes, a rice puddle 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.079
 This is not nice, but it's a lot 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.720
 water next we will learn and if you already have 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:12.130
 a scent of support in my opinion the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.130
 people have a strong smell of rice 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.390
 this one is white rice and seems to be 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:22.030
 richer than the other and this one is 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.030
 of brown rice and looks like dirty water 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.749
 at this point is that there is worse 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.760
 This is where the dog is from here. 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:36.129
 white rice I thought he looked like a 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.129
 Little do you have a nokia baby in the little cup? 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.959
 to see and run dust particles and 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.689
 cheeses too strong clues way 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.849
 Do you feel like you're drinking in time? 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.459
 Looks very watered this one from here I like 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.620
 very strong rice in joyce da 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.139
 packaging pt is tastier comparing 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.540
 with these I think these two here 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.859
 they did much the same with the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.169
 rice flavor 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.760
 I brought both here and I think they want 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.950
 cheat and make more like milk 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.079
 even if you are going to take these two 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.569
 Remember that this hopscotch here to 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.049
 I have a little taste of that 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.540
 rice 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.519
 Already the white guy I like 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.109
 It's sweet but it feels like a 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.269
 perhaps because of this milk of 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.769
 rice is a new product on the market it 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.449
 it's still a bit expensive this one here 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.459
 liter cost 600 yen 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:23.560
 and these three little ones here each 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.120
 approximately 300 yen 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.980
 searching the internet we saw that 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.379
 This milk made from rice is rich in 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.329
 carbohydrate but he is not 14 and 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.669
 cholesterol this is very good for who it is 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.019
 lactose intolerant and does not like it very much. 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.519
 in that soy milk 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.709
 they also put some vitamins 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.989
 extras to give that substance 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.099
 who have milk in a test where the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.500
 piggy bank line pulled since taste 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.870
 only 1 was probably here 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.359
 taste of salmon because it was from him 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.759
 This ball was developed here. 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.040
 This little file has this one here. 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:58.870
 because he is a character you can 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.900
 search the internet that has several 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.159
 things about it is chemistry once a 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.470
 People were in the game that way. 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.509
 photo with this Japanese costume here 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.969
 with this little fish character this 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:20.079
 picture here is on our official facebook 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:22.919
 Let's open a business, let's see. 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.919
 How's this little ball? 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.759
 these are the colors of the ball on top 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.190
 that gray color that looks like line 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:32.110
 underneath it is all rosy like fish and 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.510
 inside it seems to have some balls are 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.270
 written on the packaging that has input goal 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:43.300
 on the inside is the salmon flavor 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:45.640
 enter here but I found it interesting 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.860
 because I had the impression that it would be 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.450
 one bad taste and another salty until 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.970
 Allow the base tastes ball 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.180
 normal I like salmon is much more 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.080
 very soft if you stay experiencing 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.580
 even savoring the ball you 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.440
 Can you feel the taste a little? 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.410
 salty so I liked the one I found 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.760
 the bullet a normal bullet I felt a 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.920
 very light flavor 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.720
 Well, I was really looking forward to it. 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.640
 try this bullet that I thought 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.070
 I would have the taste of the salon because I like it 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.960
 of salmon and had nothing 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.450
 every little pack of soap bubbles here 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.250
 we pay the value of 100 yen 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.530
 then adding up everything we bought 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.720
 the jellybeans more milks we pay 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.120

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.120
 yen approximately 48 reais 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.490

 rice and milk from rice and milk comes 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.990
