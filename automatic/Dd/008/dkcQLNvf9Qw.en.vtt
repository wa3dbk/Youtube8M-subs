00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.710 

and<00:02:32.170> then<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.160> search<00:02:33.450> Starbucks<00:02:34.450> logo

so<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:35.680> went<00:02:36.610> with<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:36.970> really<00:02:37.269> really<00:02:37.390> big<00:02:37.569> one

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
so I went with the really really big one

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.420 
so I went with the really really big one
because<00:02:37.900> we're<00:02:38.140> buying<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.590> real<00:02:38.739> big<00:02:39.099> one<00:02:39.250> and

because we're buying a real big one and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.220 
because we're buying a real big one and

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
then you just go to print that out on

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.009 
then you just go to print that out on
some<00:02:42.160> transfer<00:02:42.730> paper<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.780> know<00:02:43.840> I'm<00:02:43.930> just

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
some transfer paper you know I'm just

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
making my apron all flat before I start

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.890 
making my apron all flat before I start
with<00:02:46.900> putting<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.190> logo<00:02:48.519> on<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.180> it's

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
with putting in the logo on and it's

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.229 
with putting in the logo on and it's
making<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.230> all<00:02:50.379> flat<00:02:50.709> with<00:02:50.950> my<00:02:51.099> I<00:02:51.310> run<00:02:51.609> not

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
making it all flat with my I run not

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.699 
making it all flat with my I run not
that<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.510> transfer<00:02:52.810> paper<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:53.140> rip<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.620> apart

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
that you transfer paper and rip it apart

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.699 
that you transfer paper and rip it apart
so<00:02:54.040> becomes<00:02:54.310> two<00:02:54.609> different<00:02:55.569> types<00:02:56.109> of<00:02:56.349> logos

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
so becomes two different types of logos

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.440 
so becomes two different types of logos
and<00:02:56.890> then<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.069> take<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.340> one<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:57.640> has<00:02:57.819> salt

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
and then you take the one that has salt

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.809 
and then you take the one that has salt
explode<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.049> want<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.410> on<00:02:59.639> and<00:03:00.639> then<00:03:00.790> you

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
explode that you want it on and then you

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.190 
explode that you want it on and then you
just<00:03:01.060> leave<00:03:01.209> that<00:03:01.269> where<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.810> want<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.109> and

just leave that where you want it and

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.569 
just leave that where you want it and

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.250 
then you keep some parchment paper over
that<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.359> then<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.630> just<00:03:04.660> take<00:03:04.959> your<00:03:05.049> iron

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
and I ruin that all over it all so it's

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.270 
and I ruin that all over it all so it's
