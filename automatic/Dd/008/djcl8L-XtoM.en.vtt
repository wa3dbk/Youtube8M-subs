00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
once again we're in this D modal tuning

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.620 
once again we're in this D modal tuning
that's<00:00:11.740> from<00:00:12.280> low<00:00:12.459> to<00:00:12.519> high<00:00:12.639> that's<00:00:13.000> D<00:00:13.450> a<00:00:14.250> D<00:00:15.330> G<00:00:16.330> B

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.620 
that's from low to high that's D a D G B
D<00:00:17.470> so<00:00:18.130> both<00:00:18.550> of<00:00:18.580> your<00:00:18.820> East<00:00:19.060> strings<00:00:19.330> are<00:00:19.480> down

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
D so both of your East strings are down

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
to D and once you get in that tuning

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.240 
to D and once you get in that tuning
this<00:00:22.840> example<00:00:23.230> shouldn't<00:00:23.650> be<00:00:23.740> too<00:00:23.949> hard<00:00:24.160> to

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
this example shouldn't be too hard to

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.490 
this example shouldn't be too hard to
play<00:00:24.519> it's<00:00:25.119> got<00:00:25.300> a<00:00:25.330> nice<00:00:25.539> arpeggiated<00:00:26.320> thing

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
play it's got a nice arpeggiated thing

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.339 
play it's got a nice arpeggiated thing
that<00:00:26.679> makes<00:00:26.859> use<00:00:27.189> of<00:00:27.220> that<00:00:27.609> high<00:00:28.170> open<00:00:29.170> D

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
that makes use of that high open D

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.249 
that makes use of that high open D
string<00:00:29.380> as<00:00:29.859> a<00:00:29.890> drone<00:00:30.340> and<00:00:30.960> then<00:00:31.960> there's<00:00:32.110> some

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
string as a drone and then there's some

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.660 
string as a drone and then there's some
heavy<00:00:32.439> riffing<00:00:32.949> towards<00:00:33.220> the<00:00:33.339> end<00:00:33.489> of<00:00:33.580> the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
heavy riffing towards the end of the

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.579 
heavy riffing towards the end of the
riff<00:00:33.850> it's<00:00:34.000> it's<00:00:34.239> it<00:00:34.540> starts<00:00:34.870> out<00:00:35.019> pretty<00:00:35.050> and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:35.589 
riff it's it's it starts out pretty and

riff it's it's it starts out pretty and
it<00:00:35.980> ends<00:00:36.280> up<00:00:36.339> heavy<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.940> it<00:00:37.239> goes<00:00:37.390> like<00:00:37.600> this

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.070 

now<00:01:18.350> this<00:01:18.740> is<00:01:18.950> like<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:20.120> verse<00:01:20.420> part<00:01:20.780> of

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
now this is like the the verse part of

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.310 
now this is like the the verse part of
Cinnamon<00:01:21.770> Girl<00:01:22.090> it's<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.330> nice<00:01:23.510> arpeggiated

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
thing but with this special tuning that

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.750 
thing but with this special tuning that
we're<00:01:26.120> in<00:01:26.270> we've<00:01:26.810> got<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.140> high<00:01:27.350> open<00:01:28.010> D

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
we're in we've got the high open D

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.790 
we're in we've got the high open D
string<00:01:28.790> so<00:01:29.450> when<00:01:29.570> you<00:01:29.660> play<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:29.930> D<00:01:30.260> chord<00:01:30.560> and

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
string so when you play a D chord and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.320 
string so when you play a D chord and
you<00:01:30.890> arpeggiate<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:33.430> now<00:01:34.430> you've<00:01:34.610> got<00:01:34.760> two<00:01:35.060> DS

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
you arpeggiate it now you've got two DS

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.450 
you arpeggiate it now you've got two DS
ringing<00:01:36.260> together<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.950> course<00:01:37.100> they're<00:01:37.310> never

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
ringing together of course they're never

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.220 
ringing together of course they're never
going<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.730> be<00:01:37.820> exactly<00:01:38.390> in<00:01:38.570> tune<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.050> that's

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
going to be exactly in tune and that's

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.690 
going to be exactly in tune and that's
that's<00:01:39.680> part<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:39.980> the<00:01:40.070> magic<00:01:40.460> of<00:01:40.550> that<00:01:40.730> sound

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.270 

and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:45.390> an<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.750> minor<00:01:46.080> seven<00:01:46.590> chord<00:01:46.620> also

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
and then an a minor seven chord also

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.460 
and then an a minor seven chord also
with<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.880> open

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.969 

and<00:01:53.980> then<00:01:54.100> Secord

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.980 

and<00:01:58.430> G<00:01:58.850> over<00:01:59.210> be

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.230 

it's<00:02:03.590> little<00:02:03.890> hammer<00:02:04.100> on<00:02:04.250> on<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:05.030> fifth

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
it's little hammer on on the fifth

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.420 
it's little hammer on on the fifth
string

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
string

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.090 
string
now<00:02:08.150> this<00:02:08.330> parts<00:02:08.660> interesting<00:02:09.320> it<00:02:09.470> gets<00:02:09.619> heavy

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
now this parts interesting it gets heavy

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.250 
now this parts interesting it gets heavy
again<00:02:10.460> we've<00:02:11.180> gone<00:02:11.360> from<00:02:11.540> these<00:02:11.720> nice<00:02:11.960> pretty

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
again we've gone from these nice pretty

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.560 
again we've gone from these nice pretty
arpeggios<00:02:12.950> into<00:02:13.700> this<00:02:13.820> kind<00:02:14.210> of<00:02:14.270> heavy

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
arpeggios into this kind of heavy

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.830 
arpeggios into this kind of heavy
riffing<00:02:15.140> thing<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:15.710> we<00:02:15.830> get<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:20.420> yeah<00:02:20.600> that

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
riffing thing so we get and yeah that

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.910 
riffing thing so we get and yeah that
there's<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.230> position<00:02:21.500> shift<00:02:22.130> there<00:02:26.170> I've<00:02:27.170> seen

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
there's a position shift there I've seen

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.560 
there's a position shift there I've seen
Neil<00:02:28.280> Young<00:02:28.520> play<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.760> bunch<00:02:28.940> of<00:02:29.090> times<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.510> he

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
Neil Young play a bunch of times and he

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.190 
Neil Young play a bunch of times and he
always<00:02:29.780> does<00:02:30.140> that<00:02:30.320> they<00:02:30.650> sound<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.130> same<00:02:31.160> I

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
always does that they sound the same I

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.860 
always does that they sound the same I
couldn't<00:02:33.200> tell<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.440> why<00:02:33.590> he<00:02:33.740> does<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.130> but

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
couldn't tell you why he does that but

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:45.710 
couldn't tell you why he does that but
but<00:02:35.870> that's<00:02:36.080> what<00:02:36.260> Neil<00:02:36.440> does<00:02:36.650> so

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.170 

you<00:02:46.290> know<00:02:46.410> maybe<00:02:46.680> it's<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.490> if<00:02:47.820> you<00:02:47.970> play

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
you know maybe it's that it if you play

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.150 
you know maybe it's that it if you play
the<00:02:48.360> D<00:02:48.570> here<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.050> second<00:02:49.440> time<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.740> sets<00:02:50.010> you

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
the D here the second time it sets you

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.890 
the D here the second time it sets you
up<00:02:50.190> for<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.580> open<00:02:50.970> position<00:02:51.120> thing<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.810> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
up for this open position thing in the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.870 
up for this open position thing in the
end<00:02:52.020> of<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.260> lick<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.620> really<00:02:53.130> don't<00:02:53.310> know<00:02:53.490> who

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
end of the lick I really don't know who

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.960 
end of the lick I really don't know who
knows<00:02:54.200> what<00:02:55.200> makes<00:02:56.100> Neil<00:02:56.340> Young<00:02:56.550> want<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.850> play

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
knows what makes Neil Young want to play

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.910 
knows what makes Neil Young want to play
the<00:02:57.120> way<00:02:57.210> he<00:02:57.240> does<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.780> certainly<00:02:58.080> don't<00:02:58.350> but<00:02:58.890> I

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
the way he does I certainly don't but I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.560 
the way he does I certainly don't but I
don't<00:02:59.100> play<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.400> all<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.790> way<00:03:00.330> through

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
don't play this all the way through

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.720 
don't play this all the way through
again<00:03:00.660> from<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.110> top<00:03:01.290> because<00:03:01.620> it's<00:03:01.770> nice<00:03:01.950> two

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
again from the top because it's nice two

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.320 
again from the top because it's nice two
three<00:03:03.570> four
