00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.529
 economy 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.389
 I am 18 years old and I am following the course 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.969
 teaching assistant to very stop when 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.019
 I do an internship at elementary school mosaic 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.910
 lelystad 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.080
 I have a very good supervisor copy 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.690
 are right but with all assignments 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.730
 I get those plans from school 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.980
 We discuss it together and then there is 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.289
 it while out for the command if 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.090
 for example an observation that 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.340
 observation it and also be approved 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.710
 and they must tell what has improved 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.690
 can be through another command that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.250
 I get creative for example 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.680
 toe is a creative assignment with 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.120
 Children also get there freedom 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.040
 in this need 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.760
 So in short the guidance is good with the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.760
 necessary freedom 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.860
 totally good i have a frame school 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.780
 chosen because it is a new concept 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.250
 has concept stars school 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.780
 in this concept they work with a 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.550
 continuous schedule 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.350
 and there is a lot of attention for internal 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.880
 guidance the part in the sheets 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.559
 guidance is just one of mine 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.570
 biggest learning goals and that's why I have 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.350
 chosen and knitting school for the in the many 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.100
 guidance then we first need one 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.230
 other 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.470
 a day ahead of me usually looks like me 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.760
 Start morning with 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.620
 read and flash letters 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.170
 after that I give spelling count 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.290
 vocabulary and for group 1 2 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.330
 substantiated that is actually more 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.920
 while we learn, we learn how to play 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.920
 going outside with groups 1 2 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.570
 nice than what we did so far what i did 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.400
 what I have helped with is it 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.869
 assisting with the school outing we went 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.690
 to the a4 fold the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.640
 then very large type of mega zoo 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.780
 with a lot of bird species 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.780
 so that is really a huge success 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.440
 the most important quality you need 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.460
 if you are an online penny to the 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.670

 further yes you must be social also stand 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.000

 A passion for having something new for us 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.459
 to learn our new challenges 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.769
 offer 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.050
 There are challenges in seeing children 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.670
