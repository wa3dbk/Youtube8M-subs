00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
Hoover which I'll show you how to do but

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.649 
Hoover which I'll show you how to do but
just<00:01:29.039> keep<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.609> mind<00:01:29.850> when<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.090> use<00:01:30.390> them

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
just keep in mind when you use them

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.719 
just keep in mind when you use them
sometimes<00:01:31.350> people<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:31.920> keep<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.310> jumping

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
sometimes people just keep on jumping

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.330 
sometimes people just keep on jumping
back<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.240> T<00:01:33.420> which<00:01:33.569> gets<00:01:33.810> very<00:01:34.020> irritating<00:01:34.649> so

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
back on T which gets very irritating so

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.800 
back on T which gets very irritating so
basically<00:01:35.609> to<00:01:35.789> get<00:01:35.909> rid<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.119> someone<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.569> need

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
basically to get rid of someone you need

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.880 
basically to get rid of someone you need
to<00:01:36.840> fly<00:01:37.079> underneath<00:01:37.439> one<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.920> these<00:01:38.780> now<00:01:39.890> what

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
to fly underneath one of these now what

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.559 
to fly underneath one of these now what
we<00:01:41.039> actually<00:01:41.189> need<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.819> the<00:01:41.909> trophy<00:01:42.390> is

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
we actually need to do for the trophy is

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.600 
we actually need to do for the trophy is
you<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:42.959> these<00:01:43.110> lights<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:44.130> need<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.369> turn

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
you see these lights we need to turn

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.839 
you see these lights we need to turn
them<00:01:44.789> on<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.619> electrocute<00:01:47.189> yourself<00:01:47.250> like

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:47.849 
them on so you electrocute yourself like

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:52.130 
them on so you electrocute yourself like
so<00:01:48.560> then<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.679> have<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.890> fly<00:01:50.219> past<00:01:50.959> all<00:01:51.959> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
so then you have to fly past all the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.869 
so then you have to fly past all the
lights<00:01:52.349> and<00:01:52.649> you'll<00:01:53.159> notice<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> two<00:01:53.729> on

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:53.879 
lights and you'll notice that the two on

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:57.529 
lights and you'll notice that the two on
the<00:01:53.969> ends<00:01:54.209> also<00:01:54.629> light<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:56.390> think<00:01:57.390> there's

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
the ends also light up I think there's

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.080 
the ends also light up I think there's
about<00:01:57.770> six<00:01:58.770> sets<00:01:59.039> of<00:01:59.189> lights<00:01:59.459> but<00:01:59.789> I<00:01:59.849> might<00:02:00.060> be

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
about six sets of lights but I might be

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
about six sets of lights but I might be
mistaken

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.660 

try<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.320> hit<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.800> warning<00:02:09.070> Luongo<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.430> makes

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
try and hit the warning Luongo it makes

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.990 
try and hit the warning Luongo it makes
