00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
darice i made this strategy a few months

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.240 
darice i made this strategy a few months
ago<00:00:08.090> it's<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.300> spin-off<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.870> King<00:00:10.440> Jack's<00:00:10.769> high

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.190 
ago it's a spin-off of King Jack's high
round<00:00:11.490> strategy<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.360> use<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.840> same<00:00:12.990> two

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
round strategy you use the same two

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.320 
round strategy you use the same two
traps<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.889> keep<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.250> same<00:00:14.460> door<00:00:14.820> shut<00:00:15.089> at

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
traps so you keep the same door shut at

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.510 
traps so you keep the same door shut at
Thompson<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.289> keep<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> upstairs<00:00:17.100> Thompson

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
Thompson you keep the upstairs Thompson

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.910 
Thompson you keep the upstairs Thompson
door<00:00:17.670> shut<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.029> then<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.840> go<00:00:19.020> over<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
door shut and then you go over to the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.560 
door shut and then you go over to the
trench<00:00:20.189> gun<00:00:20.369> trap<00:00:20.640> like<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:21.060> doing<00:00:21.359> right<00:00:21.390> now

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
trench gun trap like I'm doing right now

well actually you double-dip with this

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.150 
well actually you double-dip with this
trap<00:00:24.000> as<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.660> guys<00:00:24.810> will<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.140> seeing<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.859> I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
got hit with the trap right there such a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.530

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
what you guys may be seeing is that

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.170 
what you guys may be seeing is that
they're<00:00:46.200> still<00:00:46.469> spawning<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.760> other<00:00:47.910> side

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
they're still spawning on the other side

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.660 
they're still spawning on the other side
of<00:00:48.210> trap<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.780> if<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.559> know<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:50.129> basics

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
of trap and if you know your basics

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.540 
of trap and if you know your basics
about<00:00:50.820> spawn<00:00:51.270> control<00:00:51.770> being<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.100> M<00:00:53.280> kit

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
about spawn control being in that M kit

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.569 
about spawn control being in that M kit
mp40<00:00:54.480> room<00:00:54.660> should<00:00:54.930> stop<00:00:55.260> them<00:00:55.559> from<00:00:55.800> spawning

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
mp40 room should stop them from spawning

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.610 
mp40 room should stop them from spawning
on<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.390> other<00:00:57.510> side<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> trap<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.350> for

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
on the other side of trap but for

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.160 
on the other side of trap but for
whatever<00:00:58.859> reason<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.670> doesn't<00:00:59.850> work<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.449> but

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
whatever reason it doesn't work here but

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.170 
whatever reason it doesn't work here but
what<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.649> does<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.609> make<00:01:02.730> some<00:01:02.969> not

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
what it does do is to make some not

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.479 
what it does do is to make some not
spawn<00:01:03.539> up<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.110> jug<00:01:04.439> area<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:05.309> if

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
spawn up at the jug area because if

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.859 
spawn up at the jug area because if
you're<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> trench<00:01:06.330> gun<00:01:06.479> room<00:01:06.659> they

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you're just in the trench gun room they

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.260 
you're just in the trench gun room they
would<00:01:06.990> still<00:01:07.170> spawn<00:01:07.500> up<00:01:07.650> there<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.000> does

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
would still spawn up there so it does

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.450 
would still spawn up there so it does
still<00:01:09.600> make<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.810> faster<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:11.070> that's<00:01:11.280> why<00:01:11.430> I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
still make it faster but that's why I

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.700 
still make it faster but that's why I
rebuild<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.180> barrier<00:01:12.570> that's<00:01:12.840> right<00:01:13.560> in

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
rebuild that barrier that's right in

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
rebuild that barrier that's right in
front<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.070> trap<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:15.270> two<00:01:15.720> or<00:01:15.900> three

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
front of the trap like two or three

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
front of the trap like two or three
times<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:16.740> you'll<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:17.009> safe<00:01:17.250> every<00:01:17.490> time

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
times and then you'll be safe every time

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.289 
times and then you'll be safe every time
they<00:01:18.360> do<00:01:18.420> also<00:01:18.720> spawn<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.650> near<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
they do also spawn at the one near the

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.999 
they do also spawn at the one near the
m1<00:01:21.299> carbine<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.080> think<00:01:22.320> that's<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> gun

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
m1 carbine I think that's what the gun

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.429 
m1 carbine I think that's what the gun
is<00:01:23.100> called<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.880> they<00:01:24.180> take<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.869> long<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.229> spawn

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
is called but they take so long to spawn

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.990 
is called but they take so long to spawn
there<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.770> only<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.340> rebuild<00:01:26.820> that

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
there you only have to rebuild that

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.330 
there you only have to rebuild that
barrier<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:28.020> yeah<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.829> pretty

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
barrier so yeah I think it's a pretty

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.490 
barrier so yeah I think it's a pretty
good<00:01:29.549> strat<00:01:30.060> dogs<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.380> annoying

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
good strat dogs can get kind of annoying

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
good strat dogs can get kind of annoying
on<00:01:31.890> here<00:01:32.159> but<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.700> there's<00:01:32.909> ever<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.540> made<00:01:33.689> dogs

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
on here but if there's ever to made dogs

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.749 
on here but if there's ever to made dogs
you<00:01:34.110> think<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.470> gonna<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.680> risky<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.310> run

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
you think it's gonna be risky just run

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.300 
you think it's gonna be risky just run
with<00:01:35.790> your<00:01:36.150> Wunderwaffe<00:01:37.079> out<00:01:37.310> especially

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
with your Wunderwaffe out especially

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.850 
with your Wunderwaffe out especially
when<00:01:38.600> jumping<00:01:39.600> through<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.229> other<00:01:40.470> trap

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
when jumping through that other trap

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.620 
when jumping through that other trap
you're<00:01:41.130> pretty<00:01:41.610> much<00:01:41.759> always<00:01:41.970> gonna<00:01:42.210> happen

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you're pretty much always gonna happen

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.109 
you're pretty much always gonna happen
want<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:44.159> Wunderwaffe<00:01:44.909> out

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
want to have that the Wunderwaffe out

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.230 
want to have that the Wunderwaffe out
because<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:47.430> never<00:01:47.579> know<00:01:47.729> what's<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
because you never know what's going to

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.389 
because you never know what's going to
happen<00:01:48.299> they<00:01:48.720> might<00:01:48.930> already<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.920> breached

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
happen they might already have breached

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.889 
happen they might already have breached
down<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> barrier<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.390> might<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.570> going

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
down the barrier and might be going

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.569 
down the barrier and might be going
through<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.140> trap<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.619> if<00:01:52.920> they<00:01:53.130> are<00:01:53.280> just

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
through the trap so if they are just

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.219 
through the trap so if they are just
shoot<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.180> wonder<00:01:54.450> off<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> then<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.020> should

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
shoot a wonder off and then you should

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.100 
shoot a wonder off and then you should
still<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.829> able<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.070> run<00:01:56.880> through<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> trap<00:01:57.420> so

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
still be able to run through the trap so

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.649

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
commentaries and that way they're also

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.500 
commentaries and that way they're also
easier<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.370> make<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:21.850> they're<00:03:22.150> funnier<00:03:22.480> to

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.520 
oh well usually right when i leave the
head<00:03:53.159> first<00:03:53.370> room<00:03:53.609> i<00:03:53.819> switch<00:03:54.629> immediately<00:03:54.870> to

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
head first room i switch immediately to

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.410 
head first room i switch immediately to
the<00:03:55.560> Wunderwaffe<00:03:56.040> i<00:03:56.280> guess<00:03:56.519> i<00:03:56.639> try<00:03:56.819> use<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.120> mo

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
the Wunderwaffe i guess i try use the mo

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.030 
the Wunderwaffe i guess i try use the mo
first<00:03:57.659> that's<00:03:57.840> why<00:03:58.019> i<00:03:58.260> didn't<00:03:58.530> switch<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.920> it

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
first that's why i didn't switch to it

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.849 
first that's why i didn't switch to it
immediately<00:03:59.359> um<00:04:00.359> but<00:04:00.989> yeah<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.290> think<00:04:01.530> that's

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
immediately um but yeah I think that's

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.890
