right<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.370> let's<00:00:59.520> jump<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.850> alright<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.750> here

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
right so let's jump in alright so here

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.349 
right so let's jump in alright so here
are<00:01:01.079> some<00:01:01.289> more<00:01:01.680> examples<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.789> some<00:01:03.059> basic

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
are some more examples of some basic

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.140 
are some more examples of some basic
variables<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.619> right<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.460> my<00:01:05.489> name

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
variables so right here I have my name

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.200 
variables so right here I have my name
or<00:01:06.990> my<00:01:07.020> underscore<00:01:07.680> name<00:01:07.799> equals<00:01:08.250> Brad<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
or my underscore name equals Brad and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.149 
or my underscore name equals Brad and
Brad<00:01:09.450> as<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> string<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.710> text

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
Brad as a string because it's just text

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.160 
Brad as a string because it's just text
and<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.400> between<00:01:11.520> two<00:01:12.000> double<00:01:12.689> quotation

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and it's between two double quotation

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.190 
and it's between two double quotation
marks<00:01:13.200> I've<00:01:13.650> ended<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.979> with<00:01:14.040> semicolon<00:01:15.200> so

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
marks I've ended it with semicolon so

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.140 
marks I've ended it with semicolon so
that<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.590> add<00:01:16.740> another<00:01:16.920> variable<00:01:17.700> below

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
that I can add another variable below

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.030 
that I can add another variable below
here<00:01:18.390> which<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.659> my<00:01:18.810> underscore<00:01:19.259> age<00:01:19.470> equals

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
here which is my underscore age equals

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.450 
here which is my underscore age equals
and<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.240> an<00:01:22.080> integer<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.950> it's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
and this one is in an integer so it's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.990 
and this one is in an integer so it's
just<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> whole<00:01:23.790> number<00:01:24.000> 25<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:26.820> have

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
just a whole number 25 and I have

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.600 
just a whole number 25 and I have
another<00:01:27.710> variable<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:28.740> which<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> string

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
another variable here which is a string

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
another variable here which is a string
fav<00:01:30.180> underscore<00:01:30.810> color<00:01:31.110> equals<00:01:32.070> blue<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.509> now

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
fav underscore color equals blue so now

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.420 
fav underscore color equals blue so now
if<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.810> want<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> display<00:01:34.350> those<00:01:34.799> variables<00:01:35.340> on

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
if I want to display those variables on

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.039 
if I want to display those variables on
the<00:01:35.520> page<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:36.030> some<00:01:36.240> sort<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.479> meaningful<00:01:36.630> way

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
the page in some sort of meaningful way

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.660 
the page in some sort of meaningful way
I<00:01:37.259> could<00:01:37.799> use<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.579> PHP<00:01:39.270> print<00:01:40.079> function<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.549> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
I could use the PHP print function so it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.310 
I could use the PHP print function so it
looks<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.909> little<00:01:42.000> bit<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.600> use<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
looks a little bit like this use the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.060 
looks a little bit like this use the
opening<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.829> closing<00:01:44.189> PHP<00:01:44.820> declaration<00:01:45.810> and

opening and closing PHP declaration and

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.649 
opening and closing PHP declaration and
I<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.430> print<00:01:47.670> function<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:49.340> inside

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
I have the print function and inside

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.730 
I have the print function and inside
after<00:01:51.290> print<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:51.680> have<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:53.110> opening<00:01:54.110> bracket<00:01:54.590> and

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
after print I have a opening bracket and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.219 
after print I have a opening bracket and
a<00:01:55.399> or<00:01:55.789> opening<00:01:56.180> parenthesis<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.810> closing

a or opening parenthesis and a closing

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.010 
a or opening parenthesis and a closing
parenthesis<00:01:58.149> within<00:01:59.149> that<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.299> have<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.509> string

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
parenthesis within that I have a string

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.490 
parenthesis within that I have a string
and<00:02:00.490> then<00:02:01.490> I'm<00:02:01.640> just<00:02:01.759> writing<00:02:02.119> some<00:02:02.479> text<00:02:03.079> but

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
and then I'm just writing some text but

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.060 
and then I'm just writing some text but
watch<00:02:03.679> this

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
watch this

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.179 
watch this
so<00:02:04.159> my<00:02:04.310> name<00:02:04.520> is<00:02:04.789> and<00:02:05.119> then<00:02:05.149> I'm<00:02:05.630> displaying

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
so my name is and then I'm displaying

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.059 
so my name is and then I'm displaying
where<00:02:07.189> I'm<00:02:07.340> typing<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.899> variable<00:02:09.380> my<00:02:09.739> name

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
where I'm typing the variable my name

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.699 
where I'm typing the variable my name
and<00:02:10.340> then<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.420> use<00:02:11.569> an<00:02:11.750> HTML<00:02:11.870> break<00:02:12.260> tag<00:02:12.500> to

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
and then I use an HTML break tag to

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.059 
and then I use an HTML break tag to
break<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.099> to<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.280> new<00:02:13.430> line<00:02:13.640> I'm<00:02:14.680> my<00:02:15.680> age

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
break it on to a new line I'm my age

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.290 
break it on to a new line I'm my age
years<00:02:16.790> old<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.769> color<00:02:18.980> fav<00:02:19.819> color

years old and like the color fav color
so<00:02:20.959> now<00:02:21.310> PHP<00:02:22.310> will<00:02:22.880> render<00:02:23.269> that<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.780> spit<00:02:24.590> out

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
so now PHP will render that and spit out

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.570 
so now PHP will render that and spit out

for<00:02:34.190> variables<00:02:34.610> right<00:02:34.790> now<00:02:35.060> we<00:02:35.480> will<00:02:35.750> be<00:02:35.900> using

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
for variables right now we will be using

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.309 
for variables right now we will be using
variables<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.489> lot<00:02:38.060> throughout<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.959> entire

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
variables a lot throughout the entire

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.930 
variables a lot throughout the entire
course<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:39.950> don't<00:02:40.160> worry<00:02:40.310> if<00:02:40.519> you<00:02:40.640> feel<00:02:40.790> like
