00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
i mean by that is that there are few and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.400 
i mean by that is that there are few and
moments<00:00:50.879> where<00:00:51.120> something<00:00:51.930> completely

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
problems with licensing issues and I'm

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.559 
problems with licensing issues and I'm
sure<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.130> does<00:03:38.250> cost<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.579> lot<00:03:38.730> but<00:03:38.790> until<00:03:39.419> they

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
sure it does cost a lot but until they

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.120 
sure it does cost a lot but until they
get<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.930> fixed<00:03:40.319> I<00:03:40.440> don't<00:03:40.650> think<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.950> can

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
get that fixed I don't think I can

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.830 
get that fixed I don't think I can
personally<00:03:41.370> give<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:41.880> more<00:03:42.090> than<00:03:42.359> an<00:03:42.510> eighth

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
personally give it more than an eighth

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.720 
personally give it more than an eighth
after<00:03:43.079> ten<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:43.889> is<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.040> quality<00:03:44.250> game<00:03:44.549> though

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
after ten this is a quality game though

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.650 
after ten this is a quality game though
and<00:03:44.910> if<00:03:44.970> you're<00:03:45.060> trying<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.329> choose<00:03:45.569> between

and if you're trying to choose between

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.629 
and if you're trying to choose between
this<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:45.989> FIFA<00:03:46.440> my<00:03:46.709> advice<00:03:46.980> would<00:03:47.130> be<00:03:47.190> think

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
this and FIFA my advice would be think

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.250 
this and FIFA my advice would be think
about<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:47.940> type<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.299> game<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:48.810> want<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.079> buy

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
about the type of game you want to buy

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.750 
about the type of game you want to buy
if<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.829> want<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.010> buy<00:03:50.099> something<00:03:50.340> with<00:03:50.549> a<00:03:50.639> bit

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
if you want to buy something with a bit

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.520 
if you want to buy something with a bit
more<00:03:50.790> tactical<00:03:51.510> involvement<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.319> a<00:03:52.410> bit

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
more tactical involvement and a bit

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.289 
more tactical involvement and a bit
slower<00:03:52.799> paced<00:03:53.130> Pro<00:03:53.519> Evo<00:03:53.760> is<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:53.940> game<00:03:54.090> for<00:03:54.239> you

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299
