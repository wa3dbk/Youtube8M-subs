00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
make them square it does exactly the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.719 
make them square it does exactly the
same<00:01:25.229> thing<00:01:25.439> we're<00:01:25.890> all<00:01:25.950> black<00:01:26.159> two<00:01:26.310> words<00:01:26.610> go

same thing we're all black two words go

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.940 
same thing we're all black two words go
together<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.810> reason<00:01:28.200> i<00:01:28.290> like<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> second

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
together the reason i like the second

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.160 
together the reason i like the second
version<00:01:29.100> by<00:01:29.490> version<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:31.020> looks

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
version by version is because it looks

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.749 
version by version is because it looks
more<00:01:31.350> visual<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.070> actually<00:01:32.159> see<00:01:32.340> that

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
more visual you can actually see that

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.429
