00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.940
 Hello, welcome to Todd's kitchen. Lasania 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.010
 Definitely the most familiar and favorite dish on the planet, but 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.819
 It can get quite dull, so I have to mix it up, a little bit 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:17.819
 So join me today because I put my version of the Lasagna cake. 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.859
 I have a medium on the stove, in a hot frying pan. 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.139
 So add a chopped onion 

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:34.710
 Then some chopped mushrooms 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.390
 Then we will stir up these for about a minute. 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.870
 Until the onion begins to soften 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.210
 It’s been around for a minute or so, added to our broiler 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.020
 Then break it 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.260
 Keep breaking it and keep stirring until all the chicken is cooked 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.960
 All the way through 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.860
 Now, the chicken is cooked all the way through, we will add 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.240
 Two teaspoons minced garlic 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.510
 Then some spaghetti sauce, you can choose whatever you like, I want to use 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.240
 Mushrooms and tomatoes, just this right down 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.500
 I have already reduced the heat 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.120
 One from low to medium heat 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.820
 So the whole line is connected 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.670
 Next, add a half teaspoon of dried oregano 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.330
 And half teaspoon of dried basil 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.650
 And mixing through 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.200
 If you like to add some salt and pepper, but my personal medicine is enough 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.920
 Next, we are going to cook this one and let it 煨

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.040
 About 10 minutes 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.880
 Next, we will use a muffin tray rack 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.120
 Next page grease and some cooking oil spray 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.229
 Next, our mink is placed in each one. 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.040
 Muffin hole 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.900
 Next place in some ricotta 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.780
 This is a low fat cheese 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.620
 If you can't find ricotta for this video you come from where it will be a link 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.309
 I just made a video on how to make ricotta cheese. 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.860
 Next add some chicken mixture from the stove 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.949
 Grab this 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.099
 And put it inside 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.019
 Then sprinkle some mozzarella cheese 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.799
 The top of the Mozilla cheese at the top of the page is in another 馄饨

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.949
 Powerfully pushed down 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.519
 Some ricotta cheese 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.119
 Then there are more chicken mixtures 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.040
 Finally again mozzarella cheese 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.870
 Next, we are going to a preheated oven at one hundred and ninety degreased Celsius 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.909
 About 10 minutes until the cheese is well melted. 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.259
 There we have it, we are lovely 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:53.099
 health 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.619
 Lasagna cake 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.349
 Now, you don't have to stick to the chicken, you can use mashed beef if you like it 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.829
 The type of meat you use 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.779
 But by using these suede 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:07.449
 It really helps to make these cakes healthy 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:14.449
 But enough to make an attempt 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.249
 It’s so good 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.339
 Its heat 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:21.759
 But it's so good 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:26.229
 I can say wow, they are very good, they are really 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.709
 I think this is a perfect combination, it does work 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.230
 These suede are not bad, soft 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.700
 But the shape they hold 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.649
 But when you take them to taste everything that is simple and delicious 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:43.179
 Lasagna, it is a more interesting and healthy alternative, so please give 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:46.939
 As soon as it goes, let me know what you are thinking, because I am sure that you will not regret it. 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.899
