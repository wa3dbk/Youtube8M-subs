started filming with it there it was

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.770 
started filming with it there it was
like<00:02:14.959> an<00:02:15.170> epiphany<00:02:15.260> because<00:02:15.849> initially<00:02:16.849> I<00:02:17.120> was

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
like an epiphany because initially I was

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.600 
like an epiphany because initially I was
thinking<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.170> phantoms<00:02:18.620> as<00:02:18.739> replacements<00:02:19.489> for

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
thinking of phantoms as replacements for

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.339 
thinking of phantoms as replacements for
helicopter<00:02:20.209> shot<00:02:20.420> because<00:02:20.870> they<00:02:21.290> were

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
helicopter shot because they were

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.400 
helicopter shot because they were
expensive<00:02:21.940> there's<00:02:22.940> budgets<00:02:23.750> always<00:02:24.200> been

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
expensive there's budgets always been

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.440 
expensive there's budgets always been
laying<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:24.860> trying<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.130> get<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:26.090> know<00:02:26.239> if
