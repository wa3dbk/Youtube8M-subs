00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
believe it was a final Eliminator it was

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.240 
believe it was a final Eliminator it was
a<00:02:36.490> fight<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.030> was<00:02:37.300> ordered<00:02:37.780> by<00:02:38.470> one<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.160> this

one of the governing bodies so these

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.560 
one of the governing bodies so these
fights<00:02:41.860> these<00:02:42.130> cross-network<00:02:42.730> fights<00:02:43.210> can

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
fights these cross-network fights can

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.930 
fights these cross-network fights can
