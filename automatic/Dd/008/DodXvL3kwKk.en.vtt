 hundreds of ovetenses that my peace to the smiths germany 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.280
 water as it should be 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.610
 in 1948 acz photo cristian min opened his colonial business producing here 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.610
 selling small electric motors bombastic 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.700
 in the next 60 years the family business specialized in technologies 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.700
 respectful with the environment 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.559
 today the German family business operates in the third generation and its 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:31.489
 Headquarters is located in Berlin 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.329
 All products that are developed introduced in Germany 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.949
 guaranteeing a very high quality as a result of our long experience in the 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.070
 manufacture of special techniques efe double bet exclusively on the 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.770
 nelly technologies much less p &amp; g double vp products are sold without 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.660
 More than 35 countries in all 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.800
 shipments arrive directly from the headquarters in germany 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.800
 at the international level the advisors that double a post find the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.260
 best solutions for your needs with competence and effective 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.490
 against the lime I'm sorry 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.490
 Ura water contains a high concentration of heat 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.560
 plaque is not harmful to the human body 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.420
 but it causes huge problems in piping systems and appliances 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.480
 electric 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.370
 the deposits of lime in the bathroom a kitchen the fuenla surfaces 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.280
 they are often the first ain khaled visible indicator of water 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.740
 eliminating these incrustations supposes a continued effort of cleaning 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.570
 in the hotel industry, especially the cleaning of hotel bathrooms 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.380
 fast-food restaurant are a considerable factor of added cost 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.520
 is more many electrical appliances can be rendered useless in the long run 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.960
 due to jail deposits 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.260
 this always happens when hard water comes into contact with these equipment or 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.670
 machinery 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.200
 the problem affects everyone equally whether they are large private homes 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.950
 buildings today are industrial nations 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.179
 the biggest problem is often invisible and not noticed until it's too much 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.129
 late the lime can get to destroy your pipe system 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:16.979
 the pipes become clogged and there is no alternative but to change them 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:22.019
 only one millimeter of quality can result in a reduction of 10 percent 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.669
 hundred in the girl has a heating 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.949
 taking into account the current energy costs it is easy to calculate 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.969
 how much money is literally going down the drain 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.870
 however there is a very simple solution to the hunting problem 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.889
 the vulcano system 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:38.929
 one 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:42.809
 we seek uses a technology that has been applied successfully on surfaces 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:48.579
 industrial and commercial for more than 15 years normally the crystals of 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.399
 calp form complex structures that crystallize in the form of deposits 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:53.190
 banking 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.999
 difficult to eliminate 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:59.369
 Vulcan water treatment uses high frequency pulses that 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:02.369
 change the lime crystal to a simple structure 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.589
 the adherence of lime is reduced, preventing the pipeline from being deposited 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.349
 that simply dragged by the water 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.329
 the natural crystallization process accumulates exchange deposits are joined by 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.159
 the carbonic acid in the water and that in parallel they are eliminated again 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.899
 but sedimentation usually predominates 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.289
 Vulcan slightly portfolio l'equip carbon-grade an increase of 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:34.349
 carbonic acid eliminates deposits and 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.529
 existing 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.529
 in this way the system of pipelines seminci 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:44.409
 All metal pipes are protected by a protective layer of 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.500
 carbonic metal 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.619
 what prevents his training 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:53.229
 vulcan is easy to install in a few minutes first adjust the 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:56.229
 Main pipe unit 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.650
 then the role of the two impulse cables around the pipe 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:06.179
 and with this new the power adapter 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.279
 vulcan works on all pipe materials 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:14.009
 without salt and without chemicals 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:15.210
 respecting well 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.979
 environment 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.389
 important minerals such as calcium and magnesium remain in the water 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.460
 potable 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.539
 vulcan is a product made in germany its capabilities have been 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.639
 recognized by renowned institutions for their quality and safety 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.669
 Volcano impulse technology has been used for many years and successfully 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.460
 in the commercial private sector 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460
 and industrial 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.559
 vulcan I can be thirsty in different sizes that adapt to pipes 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:53.559
 diameters from one to 20 inches 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.999
 duncan that has the expansion of sediments and bank deposits 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.100
 in pipes and vulcan appliances clean your pipe system and long term 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.000
 Protect the metal tubes with a layer of metal carbonate the effort 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 of cleaning are reduced and detergents are saved 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.769
 Costly repairs and maintenance costs are also saved 

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:27.969
 of the teams 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.069
 furcal increases the efficiency of your production and saves you costs 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:34.930
 vulcano 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.300
 your ecological solution against lime 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.300
