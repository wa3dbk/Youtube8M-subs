00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.299 
see they've been leaked by Sam mobile
which<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.140> usually<00:00:07.470> pretty<00:00:07.710> good<00:00:07.830> at<00:00:08.010> getting

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
which is usually pretty good at getting

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.250 
which is usually pretty good at getting
this<00:00:08.400> stuff<00:00:08.670> right<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.660> most<00:00:10.019> likely

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
this stuff right so this is most likely

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.440 
this stuff right so this is most likely
what<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.679> upcoming<00:00:10.980> Galaxy<00:00:11.309> Note<00:00:11.610> 3<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:12.120> going

what the upcoming Galaxy Note 3 is going
to<00:00:12.509> be<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:12.900> let's<00:00:13.049> go<00:00:13.139> ahead<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.380> check<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.740> out

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
to be so let's go ahead and check it out

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.189 
to be so let's go ahead and check it out
here<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:15.210> first<00:00:15.389> thing<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.719> know<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:15.900> it

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
here and the first thing to know is it

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.630 
here and the first thing to know is it
does<00:00:16.379> have<00:00:16.619> two<00:00:16.859> variants<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.460> some

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
does have two variants for some

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.550 
does have two variants for some
reasoning<00:00:17.910> Samsung<00:00:18.390> just<00:00:18.570> throw<00:00:19.080> loads<00:00:19.410> of

different variants out in the market and
just<00:00:21.180> see<00:00:21.630> what<00:00:21.779> sticks<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.830> can<00:00:22.949> see

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
to the cpu and this is where again it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.170 
to the cpu and this is where again it
gets<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.619> little<00:01:10.740> bit<00:01:10.890> more<00:01:11.040> interesting<00:01:11.310> you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
gets a little bit more interesting you

the new Exynos octa core processor if we

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
the new Exynos octa core processor if we
flick<00:01:24.270> over<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.720> tab<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.920> can

flick over to this tab here you can

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.249 
flick over to this tab here you can
basically<00:01:26.369> see<00:01:26.909> somewhere<00:01:27.600> over<00:01:27.780> here<00:01:27.810> yep

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
basically see somewhere over here yep

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.020 
basically see somewhere over here yep
that<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.710> giving<00:01:29.040> twenty<00:01:29.400> percent<00:01:29.700> more

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that it's giving twenty percent more

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.719 
that it's giving twenty percent more
performance<00:01:30.990> than<00:01:31.079> its<00:01:31.320> predecessor<00:01:31.920> which

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
performance than its predecessor which

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.940 
performance than its predecessor which
was<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> X<00:01:33.299> which<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> octa-core<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.770> saw

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
was the X which was the octa-core we saw

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.340 
was the X which was the octa-core we saw
in<00:01:35.070> some<00:01:35.310> variants<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.909> galaxy<00:01:36.299> s4<00:01:36.689> so

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
in some variants of that galaxy s4 so

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350 
in some variants of that galaxy s4 so
it's<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.400> even<00:01:38.610> more<00:01:38.850> powerful<00:01:39.119> than

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
it's going to be even more powerful than

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.330 
it's going to be even more powerful than
that<00:01:39.570> pretty<00:01:39.900> awesome<00:01:40.079> obviously<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.189> has

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that pretty awesome obviously it has

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.190 
that pretty awesome obviously it has
eight<00:01:41.549> cause<00:01:41.820> being<00:01:42.090> octa-core<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.869> really

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
eight cause being octa-core but really

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.760 
eight cause being octa-core but really
it's<00:01:43.439> 24<00:01:44.220> powered<00:01:44.579> sets<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> has<00:01:45.990> four<00:01:46.530> high

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it's 24 powered sets so it has four high

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.609 
it's 24 powered sets so it has four high
powered<00:01:47.100> cores<00:01:47.340> at<00:01:47.549> 1.8<00:01:48.119> giga<00:01:48.299> hertz<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> for

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.380 
powered cores at 1.8 giga hertz and for
low<00:01:49.950> powered<00:01:50.310> cause<00:01:50.549> probably<00:01:50.880> at<00:01:51.090> one<00:01:51.210> point

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390

like<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.730> help<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.540> CPU<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.080> GPU<00:02:22.140> we've

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
like that to help the CPU and GPU we've

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.550 
like that to help the CPU and GPU we've
got<00:02:22.890> very<00:02:23.220> fast<00:02:23.610> RAM<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.270> more<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.990> so<00:02:25.470> you

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
got very fast RAM and more of it so you

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.500 
got very fast RAM and more of it so you
can<00:02:25.709> see<00:02:25.830> right<00:02:25.860> here<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:27.120> RAM<00:02:27.330> is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
can see right here the RAM is

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.570 
can see right here the RAM is
unconfirmed<00:02:27.990> for<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> n900<00:02:28.650> version<00:02:29.280> but<00:02:29.400> for

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
RAM of LP ddr3 LP means low powered ddr3

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.600 
RAM of LP ddr3 LP means low powered ddr3
is<00:02:39.240> faster<00:02:40.020> than<00:02:40.050> ddr2<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:40.920> if<00:02:41.130> we<00:02:41.220> flick<00:02:41.459> over

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
is faster than ddr2 and if we flick over

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.260 
is faster than ddr2 and if we flick over
here<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:41.940> can<00:02:42.090> see<00:02:42.330> it's<00:02:42.600> dual<00:02:43.350> channel<00:02:43.709> at

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
here you can see it's dual channel at

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.810 
here you can see it's dual channel at
933<00:02:45.270> megahertz<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.590> faster<00:02:47.130> than<00:02:47.160> ddr2

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
933 megahertz that is faster than ddr2

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.030 
933 megahertz that is faster than ddr2
again<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.870> faster<00:02:49.320> ram<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.620> going<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.860> help

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
again that faster ram is going to help

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.470 
again that faster ram is going to help
with<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.340> performance<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.180> stuff<00:02:51.360> like

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
with you I performance and stuff like

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.790 
with you I performance and stuff like
that<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:52.019> shouldn't<00:02:52.230> be<00:02:52.290> any<00:02:52.320> bottlenecks

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
that so it shouldn't be any bottlenecks

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.040 
that so it shouldn't be any bottlenecks
and<00:02:53.190> yeah<00:02:53.880> you've<00:02:54.030> got<00:02:54.180> more<00:02:54.360> RAM<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:54.870> this<00:02:54.959> is

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
and yeah you've got more RAM so this is

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.570 
and yeah you've got more RAM so this is
probably<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.380> first<00:02:55.470> device<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.100> come<00:02:56.250> with<00:02:56.370> 3

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
probably the first device to come with 3

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.520 
probably the first device to come with 3
gigabytes<00:02:57.080> probably<00:02:58.080> going<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.290> help<00:02:58.410> with

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
gigabytes probably going to help with

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.949 
gigabytes probably going to help with
stuff<00:02:58.709> like<00:02:58.739> multitasking<00:02:59.239> your<00:03:00.239> apps<00:03:00.600> will

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
stuff like multitasking your apps will

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.720 
stuff like multitasking your apps will
stay<00:03:01.140> in<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.500> memory<00:03:01.920> for<00:03:02.100> longer<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.430> won't

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
stay in the memory for longer and won't

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.820 
stay in the memory for longer and won't
get<00:03:02.820> cleared<00:03:03.090> out<00:03:03.269> pretty<00:03:03.840> awesome<00:03:04.019> so<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
get cleared out pretty awesome so the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.680 
get cleared out pretty awesome so the
specs<00:03:05.130> are<00:03:05.400> very<00:03:05.640> high<00:03:05.880> for<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.150> galaxy<00:03:06.570> note

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
specs are very high for this galaxy note

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.900 
specs are very high for this galaxy note
3<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.080> far<00:03:07.110> in<00:03:07.620> terms<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.370> camera<00:03:08.760> it's

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
3 so far in terms of the camera it's

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.180 
3 so far in terms of the camera it's
quoted<00:03:09.150> as<00:03:09.360> having<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.690> 13<00:03:10.170> megapixel<00:03:10.410> camera

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
quoted as having a 13 megapixel camera

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.160 
quoted as having a 13 megapixel camera

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
with OIS which is optical image

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.290 
with OIS which is optical image
stabilization<00:03:13.590> which<00:03:14.130> just<00:03:14.760> helps<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.030> get<00:03:15.239> a

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
stabilization which just helps you get a

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.270 
stabilization which just helps you get a
clearer<00:03:15.750> image<00:03:15.870> if<00:03:16.320> you're<00:03:16.470> kind<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.769> shaky<00:03:17.160> or

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
clearer image if you're kind of shaky or

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.180 
clearer image if you're kind of shaky or
moving<00:03:17.610> around<00:03:17.820> stuff<00:03:18.150> like<00:03:18.299> that<00:03:19.190> LTE

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
moving around stuff like that LTE

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.780 
moving around stuff like that LTE
connectivity<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:21.450> n900<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.440> no<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.860> end<00:03:23.010> 9005

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
connectivity the n900 is no the end 9005

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.750 
connectivity the n900 is no the end 9005
is<00:03:23.970> yes<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.870> maybe<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.530> n900<00:03:25.920> which<00:03:26.370> has<00:03:26.579> the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
is yes so maybe the n900 which has the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.520 
is yes so maybe the n900 which has the
octa-core<00:03:27.209> here<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.840> can<00:03:27.959> see<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.140> octa-core

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
octa-core here you can see the octa-core

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.970 
octa-core here you can see the octa-core
exynos<00:03:29.100> 5420<00:03:29.940> maybe<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.959> chipset<00:03:31.500> doesn't

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
exynos 5420 maybe that chipset doesn't

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.220 
exynos 5420 maybe that chipset doesn't
support<00:03:32.280> LTE<00:03:32.549> connectivity<00:03:33.090> I'm<00:03:33.720> not<00:03:34.170> sure

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
support LTE connectivity I'm not sure

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.050 
support LTE connectivity I'm not sure
we'll<00:03:34.650> have<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.890> wait<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.070> see<00:03:35.220> again<00:03:35.670> in

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
we'll have to wait and see again in

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.900 
we'll have to wait and see again in
terms<00:03:36.900> of<00:03:37.110> storage<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.650> comes<00:03:37.829> with<00:03:38.010> 16<00:03:38.370> 32<00:03:38.790> and

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
terms of storage it comes with 16 32 and

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.910 
terms of storage it comes with 16 32 and
64<00:03:39.630> though<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.900> did<00:03:40.140> here<00:03:40.350> somewhere<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:40.829> the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
64 though I did here somewhere that the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.800 
64 though I did here somewhere that the
64<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:41.579> only<00:03:41.700> going<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.000> be<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.269> some<00:03:42.540> markets

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
64 is only going to be in some markets

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.600 
64 is only going to be in some markets
so<00:03:43.140> it's<00:03:43.290> probably<00:03:43.500> going<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.709> be<00:03:43.769> mainly<00:03:44.040> 16

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
so it's probably going to be mainly 16

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.750 
so it's probably going to be mainly 16
and<00:03:44.790> 32<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.510> you've<00:03:46.440> also<00:03:46.590> got<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.920> microSD

with the 3200 milliamp hour battery that
is<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.560> big<00:04:13.799> battery<00:04:14.190> obviously<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.640> galaxy

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
is a big battery obviously the galaxy

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.180 
is a big battery obviously the galaxy
note<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.359> a<00:04:15.390> big<00:04:15.840> device<00:04:16.140> so<00:04:16.350> it<00:04:16.470> can<00:04:16.590> fit<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.890> big

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
note is a big device so it can fit a big

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.800 
note is a big device so it can fit a big
battery<00:04:17.579> in<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:17.760> but<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:18.329> should<00:04:18.539> easily

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
battery in it but this should easily

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.779 
battery in it but this should easily
last<00:04:19.169> you<00:04:19.470> through<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.100> day<00:04:20.250> obviously<00:04:20.489> we'll

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
last you through the day obviously we'll

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.310 
last you through the day obviously we'll
have<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:21.030> see<00:04:21.209> about<00:04:21.239> usage<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.080> all<00:04:22.169> that

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
have to see about usage and all that

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.740 
have to see about usage and all that
stuff<00:04:22.490> it's<00:04:23.490> got<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.700> big<00:04:23.940> screen<00:04:24.240> it's<00:04:24.539> got<00:04:24.720> a

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
stuff it's got a big screen it's got a

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.930 
stuff it's got a big screen it's got a
1.8<00:04:25.289> giga<00:04:25.440> hertz<00:04:25.710> octa-core<00:04:26.099> processor<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:26.880> a

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
1.8 giga hertz octa-core processor and a

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.830 
1.8 giga hertz octa-core processor and a
good<00:04:27.120> GPU

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
good GPU

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.030 
good GPU
so<00:04:28.080> that's<00:04:28.199> obviously<00:04:28.350> going<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.770> hurt<00:04:28.919> the

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
so that's obviously going to hurt the

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.770 
so that's obviously going to hurt the
battery<00:04:29.310> life<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.550> little<00:04:29.669> bit<00:04:29.880> but<00:04:30.389> it's<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.600> big

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
battery life a little bit but it's a big

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.150 
battery life a little bit but it's a big
battery<00:04:31.169> it<00:04:31.260> should<00:04:31.500> get<00:04:31.710> you<00:04:31.800> through<00:04:31.830> the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
battery it should get you through the

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.120 
battery it should get you through the
day<00:04:32.190> like<00:04:32.550> most<00:04:32.910> Galaxy<00:04:33.389> Note<00:04:33.540> 3<00:04:33.570> devices<00:04:34.169> so

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
day like most Galaxy Note 3 devices so

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.879 
day like most Galaxy Note 3 devices so
yeah<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.389> mean<00:04:36.419> this<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:36.960> pretty<00:04:37.020> awesome<00:04:37.440> the

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
yeah I mean this is pretty awesome the

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.210 
yeah I mean this is pretty awesome the
specs<00:04:38.310> of<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:38.610> thing<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:39.560> hi<00:04:40.560> it's<00:04:40.919> just

specs of this thing is hi it's just

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.310 
specs of this thing is hi it's just
going<00:04:41.699> to<00:04:41.729> be<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:42.090> top<00:04:42.330> end<00:04:42.540> it<00:04:42.720> should<00:04:42.750> kill

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
going to be the top end it should kill

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.890 
going to be the top end it should kill
most<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.830> benchmarks<00:04:44.540> yeah<00:04:45.540> let<00:04:45.810> me<00:04:45.870> know

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
most the benchmarks yeah let me know

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.120 
most the benchmarks yeah let me know
what<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.169> guys<00:04:46.290> think<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.740> Galaxy<00:04:47.100> Note

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130

what you guys think the Galaxy Note
range<00:04:47.460> for<00:04:47.669> me<00:04:47.760> has<00:04:47.910> always<00:04:48.000> been<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.330> little

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
range for me has always been a little

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.420 
range for me has always been a little
bit<00:04:48.660> too<00:04:48.810> big<00:04:49.020> for<00:04:49.199> my<00:04:49.290> hand<00:04:49.320> but<00:04:49.830> five<00:04:50.220> point

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
bit too big for my hand but five point

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.980
