is<00:00:20.300> an<00:00:20.720> important<00:00:21.380> part<00:00:21.650> of<00:00:21.740> everything<00:00:21.980> we're

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:22.249 
is an important part of everything we're

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.669 
is an important part of everything we're
doing<00:00:22.279> it<00:00:22.669> ends<00:00:22.999> but<00:00:23.900> we<00:00:24.019> also<00:00:24.169> believe<00:00:24.499> that

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
doing it ends but we also believe that

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.069 
doing it ends but we also believe that
by<00:00:25.099> impacting<00:00:25.789> them<00:00:25.970> in<00:00:26.119> areas<00:00:26.480> that<00:00:26.509> won't<00:00:26.900> in

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
by impacting them in areas that won't in

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.529

like<00:00:27.259> them<00:00:27.439> becoming<00:00:27.800> a<00:00:27.949> man<00:00:28.269> what<00:00:29.269> we<00:00:29.390> think

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
like them becoming a man what we think

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.659 
like them becoming a man what we think
will<00:00:29.720> happen<00:00:29.960> is<00:00:30.259> they'll<00:00:30.650> start<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:31.279> draw

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
will happen is they'll start to draw

would put them in a position to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.969 
would put them in a position to
accelerate<00:01:26.930> everything<00:01:27.470> they<00:01:27.590> want<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.860> try

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
accelerate everything they want to try

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.280 
accelerate everything they want to try
to<00:01:28.040> achieve<00:01:28.220> faster<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:29.120> isn't<00:01:29.930> that<00:01:29.990> what<00:01:30.080> we
