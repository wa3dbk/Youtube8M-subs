so I've changed a few things in the cage
so<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.270> thought<00:00:09.600> it<00:00:09.690> would<00:00:09.809> be<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.930> good<00:00:10.260> time<00:00:10.889> to

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
so I thought it would be a good time to

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.230 
so I thought it would be a good time to
do<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> cage<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.930> our<00:00:13.080> video<00:00:13.789> so<00:00:14.789> as<00:00:15.059> you've

icy cubes for the hay racks but they

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.860 
icy cubes for the hay racks but they
were<00:00:31.170> very<00:00:31.260> messy<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.969> rabbits<00:00:33.600> could

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
were very messy and the rabbits could

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.340 
were very messy and the rabbits could
sometimes<00:00:34.110> get<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.980> them<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.489> pee<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.730> them<00:00:36.350> so

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
sometimes get in them and pee in them so

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.280 
sometimes get in them and pee in them so
this<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.210> wooden<00:00:39.210> hay<00:00:39.480> rack<00:00:39.720> that<00:00:39.780> me<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.170> my

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
this is a wooden hay rack that me and my

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.819 
this is a wooden hay rack that me and my
dad<00:00:40.320> built<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> bunnies<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.120> Christmas

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
dad built for the bunnies for Christmas

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.710 
dad built for the bunnies for Christmas
but<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.890> couldn't<00:00:44.220> I<00:00:44.400> couldn't<00:00:44.610> use<00:00:45.150> it<00:00:45.180> because

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
but I couldn't I couldn't use it because

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.560 
but I couldn't I couldn't use it because
it<00:00:46.530> wasn't<00:00:46.800> tall<00:00:47.130> enough<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> go<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.060> top<00:00:48.420> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it wasn't tall enough to go on top of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.069 
it wasn't tall enough to go on top of
the<00:00:48.660> two<00:00:48.840> litter<00:00:49.020> boxes<00:00:49.470> so<00:00:49.880> yes<00:00:50.880> two<00:00:51.600> days<00:00:51.780> ago

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the two litter boxes so yes two days ago

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.260 
the two litter boxes so yes two days ago
I<00:00:52.110> think<00:00:52.290> my<00:00:52.890> dad<00:00:53.100> built<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.489> stand<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
I think my dad built a stand for it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.740 
I think my dad built a stand for it
so<00:00:54.989> now<00:00:55.290> it<00:00:55.380> can<00:00:55.500> sit<00:00:55.800> right<00:00:56.399> above<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.510> litter

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
so now it can sit right above the litter

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.170 
so now it can sit right above the litter
boxes<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.950> can<00:00:59.220> see<00:00:59.399> right<00:00:59.610> here<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.149> is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
boxes as you can see right here there is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.080 
boxes as you can see right here there is
a<00:01:00.300> white<00:01:00.630> grid<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.230> between<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> hay<00:01:02.489> rack<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
a white grid in between the hay rack and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.050 
a white grid in between the hay rack and
the<00:01:03.390> wall<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.500> because<00:01:04.949> there<00:01:05.579> was<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.729> gap

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the wall that is because there was a gap

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.520 
the wall that is because there was a gap
and<00:01:06.649> so<00:01:07.649> we<00:01:07.979> had<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.250> cut<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.880> grid<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.780> half<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and so we had to cut a grid in half and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.760 
and so we had to cut a grid in half and
we<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.159> half<00:01:11.580> over<00:01:11.880> there<00:01:12.000> half<00:01:12.210> down<00:01:12.479> there

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
we have half over there half down there

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.420 
we have half over there half down there
over<00:01:13.770> there<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> mean<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:15.120> down<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.430> we

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
over there I mean and then down here we

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.690 
over there I mean and then down here we
have<00:01:17.580> another<00:01:18.570> cut<00:01:18.990> grid<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.979> here<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
have another cut grid right here and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.000 
have another cut grid right here and
over<00:01:21.630> there<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.170> there's<00:01:22.380> hay<00:01:22.740> back

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
over there and then there's hay back

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.330 
over there and then there's hay back
there<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.270> I'll<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.780> cover<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.170> back<00:01:25.470> up<00:01:25.740> I

trim<00:02:32.470> for<00:02:32.860> quite<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.099> while<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:33.880> all

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
trim for quite a while so this is all

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.970 
trim for quite a while so this is all
new<00:02:34.150> trim<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:36.000> he<00:02:37.000> also<00:02:37.180> cocked<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.800> right

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980

there<00:02:39.190> is<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.670> caulk<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.440> he<00:02:41.440> did<00:02:41.620> that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
there is the caulk and he did that

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.100 
there is the caulk and he did that
because<00:02:41.980> if<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:43.150> Rabbids<00:02:43.540> ever<00:02:43.750> had<00:02:43.989> an

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
because if the Rabbids ever had an

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.220 
because if the Rabbids ever had an
accident<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.890> would<00:02:45.069> leak<00:02:45.370> through<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.230> go

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
accident it would leak through and go

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.370 
accident it would leak through and go
onto<00:02:47.620> our<00:02:48.310> floor<00:02:48.580> which<00:02:49.569> wasn't<00:02:49.930> good<00:02:50.170> because

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
onto our floor which wasn't good because

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.290 
onto our floor which wasn't good because
we<00:02:50.830> wouldn't<00:02:51.010> find<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.430> right<00:02:51.550> away<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:52.090> then

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
we wouldn't find it right away and then

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.740 
we wouldn't find it right away and then
our<00:02:52.660> floor<00:02:53.050> bubbles<00:02:53.620> if<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.160> don't<00:02:54.720> clean<00:02:55.720> up

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
our floor bubbles if you don't clean up

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.970 
our floor bubbles if you don't clean up
any<00:02:56.019> water<00:02:56.260> right<00:02:56.530> away<00:02:56.709> so<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:58.620> cocked<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.830> so

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
any water right away so we cocked it so

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.789 
any water right away so we cocked it so
that<00:03:00.100> wouldn't<00:03:00.280> happen<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.910> then<00:03:01.299> also<00:03:02.170> hey

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
that wouldn't happen and then also hey

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.690 
that wouldn't happen and then also hey
would<00:03:03.010> always<00:03:03.160> get<00:03:03.459> stuck<00:03:03.610> in<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.510> trim<00:03:04.750> so

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
would always get stuck in the trim so

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.059 
would always get stuck in the trim so
that's<00:03:06.700> really<00:03:06.880> good<00:03:07.120> now<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.830> won't

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
that's really good now that it won't

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.610 
that's really good now that it won't
happen<00:03:09.250> anymore<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.870> top<00:03:11.080> level<00:03:11.319> we

over here is something new as well it's

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.520 
over here is something new as well it's
just<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.829> little<00:03:48.510> loft<00:03:49.510> area<00:03:49.930> for<00:03:50.140> them<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.380> go

just a little loft area for them to go

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.500 
just a little loft area for them to go
on<00:03:50.560> I'm<00:03:51.310> not<00:03:51.489> sure<00:03:51.670> if<00:03:51.760> they'll<00:03:51.940> use<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.239> or<00:03:52.480> not

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
on I'm not sure if they'll use it or not

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.229 
on I'm not sure if they'll use it or not
because<00:03:53.100> they<00:03:54.100> tend<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.430> like<00:03:54.609> to<00:03:54.640> sleep<00:03:54.970> under

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
because they tend to like to sleep under

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.979 
because they tend to like to sleep under
it<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:56.609> well<00:03:57.609> that's<00:03:57.730> okay<00:03:58.090> but<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.720> thought<00:03:58.870> it

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
it so well that's okay but I thought it

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.780 
it so well that's okay but I thought it
was<00:03:59.079> really<00:03:59.200> cute<00:03:59.530> with<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.829> tilted<00:04:00.250> roof<00:04:00.489> and

was really cute with the tilted roof and

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.289 
was really cute with the tilted roof and
