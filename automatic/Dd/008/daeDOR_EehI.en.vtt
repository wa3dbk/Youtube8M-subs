00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.409 
same way I feel with the original six I
wish<00:04:40.599> they<00:04:40.930> would<00:04:41.139> have<00:04:41.259> made<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:41.949> a<00:04:42.759> different

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
wish they would have made it a different

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:44.520 
wish they would have made it a different
application<00:04:43.569> like<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.110> doe<00:04:44.319> foot<00:04:44.470> applicator

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
application like a doe foot applicator

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.589 
application like a doe foot applicator
that<00:04:44.979> way<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:45.490> can<00:04:45.669> control<00:04:46.180> how<00:04:46.389> much<00:04:46.449> you

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
that way you can control how much you

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:50.999 
that way you can control how much you
use<00:04:46.990> because<00:04:47.979> when<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:49.930> know<00:04:50.009> dispense

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
use because when you you know dispense

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.170 
use because when you you know dispense
it<00:04:51.190> out<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:52.210> does<00:04:52.539> come<00:04:52.960> out<00:04:53.250> why<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.669> bit<00:04:54.940> more

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
it out it does come out why a bit more

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.230 
it out it does come out why a bit more
than<00:04:55.570> you<00:04:56.110> tend<00:04:56.440> on<00:04:56.650> using<00:04:57.310> so<00:04:57.610> I<00:04:57.639> would<00:04:58.030> say

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
than you tend on using so I would say

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.020 
than you tend on using so I would say
you<00:04:58.840> know<00:04:58.990> in<00:04:59.259> the<00:04:59.349> future<00:04:59.530> they<00:05:00.340> need<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:00.849> use

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
you know in the future they need to use

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.570 
you know in the future they need to use
different<00:05:01.479> packaging<00:05:02.349> this<00:05:02.590> is<00:05:02.860> not<00:05:03.220> good

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
different packaging this is not good

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.249

they<00:05:03.880> should<00:05:03.910> have<00:05:04.330> did<00:05:04.570> a<00:05:04.750> dose<00:05:04.960> up<00:05:05.139> for

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
they should have did a dose up for

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.550 
they should have did a dose up for
dinner<00:05:05.410> because<00:05:06.009> you<00:05:06.460> can<00:05:07.349> control<00:05:08.349> how<00:05:08.530> much

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
dinner because you can control how much

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.580
