00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
lot easier and it looks a lot better to

mistaken a lot of music like rock and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.309 
mistaken a lot of music like rock and
like<00:02:41.160> dubstep<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.060> lot<00:02:42.360> easier<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.750> edit<00:02:42.989> to

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319
