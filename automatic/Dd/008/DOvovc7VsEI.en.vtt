00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.760
 the following guys I'm here to 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.980
 my clothes ready 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.830
 I bought this microphone here ó 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.820
 computer lennon microphone 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.950
 pedestal because he is p2 to enter 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.290
 Money, I'll make the adjustment. 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.680
 Nothing, I'll use it here, I 'll use it alone. 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.060
 It's okay, I'll cut it in the head. 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.860
 I'll use the wire 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.470
 I'll do the verification, it's my line. 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.230
 blog here is the drill in the hand 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.730
 I'll punch in here, I'll mark it. 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.980
 a little pen marks here 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.989
 I also never had a black one. 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.190
 well here asked for proof to make a 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.719
 straight drill 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.460
 I 'll do the adaptation of the 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.129
 Microphone, I'm going to cut this piece here. 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.870
 and leave only the tip I'll take part 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.030
 inside the microphone here 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.460
 and that here will stay within 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.910
 helmet here 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.879
 It's very simple and quiet. I paid 6 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.290
 90 this microphone here any shop 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.420
 computers and have not had this 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.870
 long is there anyone who is in são paulo 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.900
 at the entrance had little fireplace 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.760
 normal earphone is this adaptation 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.290
 How do I do here? I'm not going to everybody. 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.120
 then you'll soon see yourself 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.430
 there was also a hole only then to do 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.680
 here the second part was done what the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.590
 china go pro I marked with the pen 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.280
 also the world little hole node that I will 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.920
 make calculation here ó all microphone 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.490
 it is very simple neighbor also in the calculation 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.020
 that I'm going to do two trying a building 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.070
 because if you try to stick directly 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.650
 searcher 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.360
 the plastic can slip the drill right 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.370
 so it's really ideal to give a 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.040
 with something that had 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.920
 connected torch here 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.140
 I only play to make a 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.390
 a little marquee for brock 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.720
 enter do not slip right then the staff 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.550
 a nail or a nail 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.140
 anything of the kind that is thin 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.240
 Just to give you a little rest here. 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.920
 make a mark to block 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.789
 then she does not go skating there and 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.110
 It's quite simple for here again. 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.860
 we are going to continue to 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.980
 either the steps of the schematic or it 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.230
 will make a mark here 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.909
 just a little piece of cake just for you too 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.310
 new one made a marquinha can only leave already 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:33.349
 a pre hole right here to obviously power 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.180
 with own dinho rett not slip 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.519
 live here is really the drill there 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.150
 really the direct exchange the name they go 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:45.440
 for very thick sell but will go home 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:56.930
 who is going to roll Mexican food did not know 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:03:00.549
 do negative marketing strength as well 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.549
 sometimes it slips a little 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.680
 he cured to speak 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.299
 branquinho redondinho will take here O 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.330
 eleven employees inside 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:31.250
 I took it, please, it was ready, here it is. 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.650
 Boy, what's the hole in there? 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.780
 Dark here is better also in the 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:42.440
 round hole made that is where 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:43.909
 will fit in if there is already the third 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.569
 It's inside here. 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.400
 You'll see right there it hurts just to make 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.519
 proof already shows you her connected 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.200
 beauty hug 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.609
 then it's the following 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.000
 I finished working here with helinho 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:03.019
 I bought a microphone pedestal is not this 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.579
 here was that tube the tube was already 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.250
 I do not know, we 'll cut the 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.879
 also small pieces were not left 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.620
 Just a microphone and a little wire, too. 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.720
 I notice is that we will use 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.209
 I would give even to cut here the goal had 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.620
 until cut here and leave only this 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.900
 you want to take out the microphone 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.460
 from inside that professional but I go 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.380
 pass the tape I do not think so either 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.770
 putting on and taking the risk of 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.039
 Breaking the microphone here is better, huh? 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.240
 We made the hole in the hood of GoPro 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.000
 here on the side 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:42.380
 we leave here also in the right hole 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.700
 here it is and it fits right what goes 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.800
 enter here 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.470
 this little bit of everything here and there 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.590
 also will not fit here and 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.419
 right at the side of the pope 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.680
 he will come in and do things with a 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:59.599
 hand only gives it will get full here o 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.330
 It fit right and place and I go 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:05.990
 put the camera, that's it 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.510
 A little dog, you're not 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:13.490
 You need to buy a new hood, right? 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:18.110
 and ready the microphone of gopro spent 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.300
 $ 6 on the microphone pedestal this here nothing 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.120
 from under I'm going to use all that rubbish 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.520
 I do not know just six reais also 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.520
 say the person trying to buy 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.250
 iaa the installation and does not work 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.780
 I'm a lot of money, not just six reais 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.490
 it 's only six reais and that's it. 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.789
 this is the tip of who wants to put the 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.580
 microphone in your own personal people 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:46.490
 First of all, sorry for the mess, right? 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.250
 here the final part is from here even two 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.259
 helmets is the one I use the goal in 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.990
 But I use it's up there in the 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:56.150
 of the helmet is that I made an adaptation and 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.400
 here is the end result 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.880
 given the microphone holder I made is 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.349
 of the pc microphone adaptation is how it is 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.960
 I learned and I did not fit either. 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.940
 Right plug and right here right. 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.150
 and I'll show you guys inside then 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.220
 to get down here how did it get 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.680
 I did not even think about my son, either. 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.000
 do not learn on the stand here 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.220
 You can hold your day. 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.419

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.150
 Do not look here. 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:41.620
 Let's see if I find the point of light

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:58.250
 wind in the walnut also taking in the 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.630
 even light because to erase the shadow of my 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.789
 Where are you, brother?
