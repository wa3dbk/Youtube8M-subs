with Promethean vision so we're going to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.080 
with Promethean vision so we're going to
take<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.890> into<00:00:50.129> some<00:00:50.370> basic<00:00:50.910> team

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
I died but I took you with me that was a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.420 
I died but I took you with me that was a
pretty<00:01:55.409> good<00:01:55.619> little<00:01:55.710> spree<00:01:56.009> starting<00:01:56.340> off

pretty good little spree starting off

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.920 
pretty good little spree starting off
they're<00:01:56.579> using<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> needler<00:01:57.180> neither<00:01:57.689> aren't

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
they're using the needler neither aren't

they're using the needler neither aren't
Promethean<00:01:58.320> vigils<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.680> pretty<00:01:58.890> good

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
Promethean vigils a pretty good

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.280 
Promethean vigils a pretty good
combination<00:01:59.729> it<00:02:00.420> really<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.869> there's<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.140> lot

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
combination it really is there's a lot

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.870 
combination it really is there's a lot
of<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.590> good<00:02:01.680> combinations<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.729> can

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
of really good combinations that you can

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.459 
of really good combinations that you can
get<00:02:03.030> done<00:02:03.180> using<00:02:03.390> Promethean<00:02:04.020> vision<00:02:04.290> because

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
get done using Promethean vision because

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.039 
get done using Promethean vision because
it's<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.680> really<00:02:05.070> really<00:02:05.820> effective<00:02:06.450> ability<00:02:06.899> I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
it's a really really effective ability I

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.839 
it's a really really effective ability I
mean<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.500> does<00:02:07.680> kind<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.489> limited

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
mean it does kind of have a limited

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.760 
mean it does kind of have a limited
usefulness<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.989> motion<00:02:10.289> sensor<00:02:10.619> itself

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
usefulness like the motion sensor itself

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.900 
usefulness like the motion sensor itself
can<00:02:11.190> kind<00:02:11.520> of

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
can kind of

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.020 
can kind of
stand<00:02:13.300> in<00:02:13.450> its<00:02:13.570> place<00:02:13.960> but<00:02:14.700> Promethean<00:02:15.700> vision

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
stand in its place but Promethean vision

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.000 
stand in its place but Promethean vision
can<00:02:16.240> let<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:16.780> land<00:02:17.020> shots<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.890> you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
can let you land shots that you

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.910 
can let you land shots that you
shouldn't<00:02:18.550> really<00:02:18.910> be<00:02:19.270> able<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.930> without<00:02:20.860> a

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
shouldn't really be able to without a

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.030 
shouldn't really be able to without a
hint<00:02:21.460> of<00:02:21.610> luck<00:02:22.120> otherwise<00:02:22.860> okay<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.920> should

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
hint of luck otherwise okay you should

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.770 
hint of luck otherwise okay you should
take<00:02:24.340> him<00:02:24.490> down<00:02:24.670> because<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:25.030> yeah<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.510> was<00:02:25.660> gonna

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
take him down because I yeah I was gonna

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.270

say<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:25.960> shot<00:02:26.290> him<00:02:26.410> once<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:29.440> don't<00:02:29.980> know<00:02:30.130> how

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
say I shot him once you don't know how

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.960 
say I shot him once you don't know how
to<00:02:30.310> strafe<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.360> that's<00:02:31.630> good<00:02:31.900> for<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.880> go

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
to strafe so that's good for you to go

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.050 
to strafe so that's good for you to go
ahead<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.180> get<00:02:34.240> back<00:02:34.420> up<00:02:34.450> top<00:02:34.840> I<00:02:35.970> don't<00:02:36.970> know

ahead and get back up top I don't know

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.550 
ahead and get back up top I don't know
when<00:02:37.210> Rockets<00:02:37.660> are<00:02:37.780> coming<00:02:38.020> back<00:02:38.200> but<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.410> want

needler that's a taste of my own

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.710 
needler that's a taste of my own
medicine<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:42.250> couldn't<00:02:42.910> even<00:02:43.030> strafe<00:02:43.480> away

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
medicine I couldn't even strafe away

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.820 
medicine I couldn't even strafe away
from<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:43.990> quick<00:02:44.140> enough<00:02:44.230> that's<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.620> really

good time when you want to have a

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.580 
good time when you want to have a
thruster<00:02:46.210> pack<00:02:46.390> not<00:02:46.690> Promethean<00:02:47.230> vision

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
thruster pack not Promethean vision

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.560 
thruster pack not Promethean vision
that's<00:02:48.520> when<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.880> want<00:02:49.090> something<00:02:49.300> different

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
which means though if he has that

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.490 
which means though if he has that
Kneedler<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.310> Kneedler<00:02:51.790> has<00:02:52.030> respond<00:02:52.750> which

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
Kneedler this Kneedler has respond which

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.140 
Kneedler this Kneedler has respond which
is<00:02:53.680> what<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.040> means<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.490> let's<00:02:54.760> take<00:02:54.970> this

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
is what that means so let's take this

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.400 
is what that means so let's take this
Kneedler<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.660> see<00:02:55.810> if<00:02:55.870> we<00:02:55.960> need<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.110> our<00:02:56.230> own

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
Kneedler and see if we need to our own

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:05.670 
Kneedler and see if we need to our own
work<00:02:56.710> with<00:02:57.250> our<00:02:57.430> own<00:02:57.610> Kneedler<00:03:01.020> okay<00:03:04.680> they're

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
work with our own Kneedler okay they're

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.290 
work with our own Kneedler okay they're
all<00:03:05.860> gonna<00:03:06.040> be<00:03:06.250> this<00:03:06.430> way<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.640> bet<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.180> they're

maybe if I had landed all of them I

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.320 
maybe if I had landed all of them I
might<00:03:19.959> have<00:03:20.140> but<00:03:20.470> not<00:03:21.090> enough<00:03:22.090> for<00:03:22.240> the

might have but not enough for the

might have but not enough for the
accuracy<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:22.990> had<00:03:23.260> there<00:03:23.500> not<00:03:23.680> enough<00:03:24.400> for

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
accuracy that I had there not enough for

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.020 
accuracy that I had there not enough for
that<00:03:24.700> what<00:03:25.660> are<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:25.900> just<00:03:26.170> what<00:03:26.800> are<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:27.030> what

are you doing what was that jetpack for

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.870 
are you doing what was that jetpack for
