that you saw on the bar video but now

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.870 
that you saw on the bar video but now
you<00:00:22.450> get<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:22.780> see<00:00:22.930> what<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.260> DPS<00:00:23.740> I<00:00:24.310> guess

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
you get to see what the DPS I guess

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.140 
you get to see what the DPS I guess
ratio<00:00:25.300> pretty<00:00:25.780> much<00:00:25.960> looks<00:00:26.200> like<00:00:26.410> on<00:00:27.150> demon

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
ratio pretty much looks like on demon

hunter<00:00:28.449> wielding<00:00:29.320> two<00:00:29.820> 35.1<00:00:32.039> crossbows<00:00:33.039> here

hunter wielding two 35.1 crossbows here
so<00:00:33.460> uh<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:34.570> thing<00:00:34.600> is<00:00:34.780> I<00:00:35.230> think<00:00:36.100> they<00:00:36.399> could

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
so uh the thing is I think they could

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:37.710 
so uh the thing is I think they could
get<00:00:36.640> buffered<00:00:37.060> because<00:00:37.390> they<00:00:37.510> don't<00:00:37.660> have

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
get buffered because they don't have

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.350 
get buffered because they don't have
critical<00:00:38.230> hit<00:00:38.440> damage<00:00:38.470> on<00:00:38.950> them<00:00:39.130> but<00:00:39.790> still<00:00:40.180> I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
critical hit damage on them but still I

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.810 
critical hit damage on them but still I
mean<00:00:40.860> it'll<00:00:41.860> be<00:00:42.010> interesting<00:00:42.220> to<00:00:42.430> see<00:00:42.520> what

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820

beta the chest is nine attack even

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.930 
beta the chest is nine attack even
though<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:44.740> can<00:01:44.860> go<00:01:44.950> up<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.190> like<00:01:45.310> 11<00:01:45.670> attack

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
though it can go up to like 11 attack

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.320 
though it can go up to like 11 attack
but<00:01:46.149> not<00:01:46.390> attack<00:01:46.960> with<00:01:47.170> precision<00:01:48.330> pretty

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
but not attack with precision pretty

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.960 
but not attack with precision pretty
much<00:01:49.479> calculates<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.550> remember<00:01:51.550> I<00:01:51.580> did<00:01:51.880> the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
much calculates to remember I did the

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.730 
much calculates to remember I did the
math<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.240> was<00:01:52.330> like<00:01:52.479> three<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.990> four<00:01:53.229> position

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
math it was like three to four position

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.330 
math it was like three to four position
equals<00:01:53.890> one<00:01:54.250> attack<00:01:54.550> so<00:01:54.789> it<00:01:55.090> does<00:01:55.390> equal<00:01:55.659> light

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
equals one attack so it does equal light

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.249 
equals one attack so it does equal light
plus<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.550> want<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.759> see<00:01:57.909> close<00:01:58.479> close<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.990> plus

and<00:02:26.350> this<00:02:26.440> is<00:02:26.500> compared<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.070> say<00:02:27.820> if<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:27.970> were

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
and this is compared to say if you were

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.449 
and this is compared to say if you were
to<00:02:28.239> slap<00:02:28.420> on<00:02:28.600> like<00:02:28.750> plus<00:02:28.989> 21<00:02:29.680> or<00:02:29.829> plus<00:02:30.010> 22

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
to slap on like plus 21 or plus 22

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.850 
to slap on like plus 21 or plus 22
attack<00:02:30.790> pants<00:02:31.660> these<00:02:32.290> would<00:02:32.560> still<00:02:32.769> be

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
attack pants these would still be

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.580 
attack pants these would still be
buffered<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:34.600> i<00:02:34.660> believe<00:02:35.109> it's<00:02:35.260> by<00:02:35.380> like<00:02:35.410> a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
buffered so and i believe it's by like a

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.729 
buffered so and i believe it's by like a
a<00:02:35.799> point<00:02:36.370> point<00:02:37.030> 0<00:02:37.390> 1<00:02:37.690> 2<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.200> is<00:02:38.320> buffer<00:02:38.620> than

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
a point point 0 1 2 that is buffer than

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.789 
a point point 0 1 2 that is buffer than
a<00:02:38.799> plus<00:02:39.040> 22<00:02:39.489> but<00:02:39.730> plus<00:02:40.359> 22<00:02:40.720> is<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.440> highest<00:02:41.739> i

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
a plus 22 but plus 22 is the highest i

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.319 
a plus 22 but plus 22 is the highest i
was<00:02:41.950> able<00:02:42.070> to<00:02:42.160> get<00:02:42.310> thus<00:02:42.549> far<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:42.880> patch<00:02:43.060> nine

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
was able to get thus far in patch nine

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.509 
was able to get thus far in patch nine
so<00:02:43.570> we're<00:02:43.900> sticking<00:02:44.109> with<00:02:44.230> these<00:02:44.440> pants<00:02:44.769> shoes

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
so we're sticking with these pants shoes

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.440 
so we're sticking with these pants shoes
at<00:02:45.880> +<00:02:46.209> 21<00:02:46.600> attack<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:47.140> must<00:02:47.859> have<00:02:47.920> done<00:02:48.329> like<00:02:49.329> I

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
at + 21 attack I must have done like I

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.270 
at + 21 attack I must have done like I
probably<00:02:49.900> had<00:02:50.109> crafting<00:02:50.680> materials<00:02:51.040> for

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
probably had crafting materials for

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.360 
probably had crafting materials for
enough<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.180> craft<00:02:52.420> out<00:02:52.829> 50<00:02:53.829> somewhere<00:02:54.250> between

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
enough to craft out 50 somewhere between

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.180 
enough to craft out 50 somewhere between

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
50 to 60 shoes and these were the high

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.280 
50 to 60 shoes and these were the high
issues<00:02:57.579> i<00:02:57.730> got<00:02:57.910> i<00:02:58.090> mean<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.359> next<00:02:58.660> highest

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290

attack<00:02:59.829> shoes<00:03:00.400> from<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.790> crafting<00:03:01.209> session

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
attack shoes from that crafting session

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.199 
attack shoes from that crafting session
was<00:03:01.750> like<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.989> plus<00:03:02.320> 3<00:03:02.829> year<00:03:02.980> plus<00:03:03.280> for<00:03:03.670> suddenly

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
was like a plus 3 year plus for suddenly

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.479 
was like a plus 3 year plus for suddenly
is<00:03:04.390> ridiculous<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.109> i<00:03:05.290> got<00:03:05.769> lucky<00:03:06.070> this<00:03:06.220> is<00:03:06.340> one

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
is ridiculous so i got lucky this is one

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.130 
is ridiculous so i got lucky this is one
of<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.670> final<00:03:06.940> perhaps<00:03:07.150> two<00:03:07.390> on<00:03:07.600> that<00:03:07.810> stretch

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
of the final perhaps two on that stretch

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.610 
of the final perhaps two on that stretch
so<00:03:08.380> here<00:03:08.980> are<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.130> bose<00:03:09.340> 35.1<00:03:10.320> only<00:03:11.320> this<00:03:11.440> one

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
so here are the bose 35.1 only this one

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.500 
so here are the bose 35.1 only this one
does<00:03:11.799> have<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.070> crit<00:03:12.280> hit<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:13.030> i<00:03:13.269> mean<00:03:13.450> its

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
does have the crit hit so i mean its

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.319 
does have the crit hit so i mean its
overall<00:03:14.230> very<00:03:14.620> godly<00:03:15.010> sets<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.549> i<00:03:15.819> would<00:03:16.180> think

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
overall very godly sets I i would think

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.699 
overall very godly sets I i would think
I<00:03:16.569> think<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:16.989> crate<00:03:17.140> hit<00:03:17.290> could<00:03:17.410> be<00:03:17.530> higher

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
I think the crate hit could be higher

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.979 
I think the crate hit could be higher
five<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.489> 13<00:03:18.819> is<00:03:18.910> basic<00:03:19.269> basically<00:03:19.870> the

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
five to 13 is basic basically the

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.319 
five to 13 is basic basically the
benchmark<00:03:20.500> in<00:03:20.620> terms<00:03:20.829> of<00:03:20.980> what<00:03:21.579> needs<00:03:21.819> to<00:03:22.180> be

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
benchmark in terms of what needs to be

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.559 
benchmark in terms of what needs to be
considered<00:03:22.510> for<00:03:22.840> 35.1<00:03:23.799> really<00:03:24.609> it's<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.760> 55

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
considered for 35.1 really it's the 55

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.990 
considered for 35.1 really it's the 55
to<00:03:25.690> 13th<00:03:26.049> damage<00:03:26.769> what<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.340> seven<00:03:27.609> percent

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
to 13th damage what the seven percent

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.510 
to 13th damage what the seven percent
everything<00:03:28.690> else<00:03:28.840> is<00:03:28.989> just<00:03:29.019> gravy

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
everything else is just gravy

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.390 
everything else is just gravy
and<00:03:30.790> then<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.200> 35<00:03:32.200> here<00:03:32.500> 5<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:32.980> 13<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.370> see

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
and then the 35 here 5 to 13 you see

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.220 
and then the 35 here 5 to 13 you see

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:05:15.469 

ah

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.589 

so<00:05:16.949> demon<00:05:17.949> hunter<00:05:18.159> is<00:05:18.219> pretty<00:05:18.400> buffed<00:05:18.639> out<00:05:18.819> I'm

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
so demon hunter is pretty buffed out I'm

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.359 
so demon hunter is pretty buffed out I'm
very<00:05:20.080> curious<00:05:20.259> to<00:05:20.409> see<00:05:20.589> what<00:05:20.740> actually<00:05:20.889> impel

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:21.369 
very curious to see what actually impel

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:22.529 
very curious to see what actually impel
does<00:05:21.610> so<00:05:21.759> I'll<00:05:21.849> probably<00:05:21.969> do<00:05:22.210> that<00:05:22.360> on<00:05:22.509> a

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
does so I'll probably do that on a

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.959 
does so I'll probably do that on a
separate<00:05:22.869> run<00:05:23.050> if<00:05:23.409> it's<00:05:23.979> interesting<00:05:24.490> then

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
separate run if it's interesting then

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:27.629 
separate run if it's interesting then
I'll<00:05:25.149> slap<00:05:25.839> it<00:05:25.990> on<00:05:26.080> to<00:05:26.439> the<00:05:27.009> tail<00:05:27.189> end<00:05:27.430> of<00:05:27.550> this

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
I'll slap it on to the tail end of this
