00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
this is like a bracket kind of an

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.640 
this is like a bracket kind of an
adapter<00:02:20.950> kind<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.780> thing<00:02:22.780> here<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.290> then<00:02:23.500> you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
adapter kind of thing here and then you

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.160 
adapter kind of thing here and then you
actually<00:02:23.860> get<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:25.480> drive<00:02:26.230> bait<00:02:27.720> cover<00:02:28.720> here<00:02:29.020> or

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
actually get a drive bait cover here or

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.950 
actually get a drive bait cover here or
adapter<00:02:29.710> as<00:02:30.400> well<00:02:30.460> to<00:02:30.940> slide<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.840> can

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
adapter as well to slide it you can

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.170 
adapter as well to slide it you can
mount<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.890> slide<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.130> in<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:34.150> a

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
mount this on this and slide it in to a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.340 
mount this on this and slide it in to a
desktop<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.730> get<00:02:36.940> everything<00:02:37.840> you're

install it in a computer right away I'm

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.340 
install it in a computer right away I'm
actually<00:03:21.850> going<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.209> use<00:03:22.300> this<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.810> test<00:03:23.110> some

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
actually going to use this to test some

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.260 
actually going to use this to test some
say<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.560> USB<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:27.760> all<00:03:27.940> sorts<00:03:28.180> of<00:03:28.209> different

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
say to to USB and all sorts of different

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.180 
say to to USB and all sorts of different
adapters<00:03:28.900> with<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:29.290> check<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.860> read<00:03:30.010> and

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
adapters with this check the read and

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.830 
adapters with this check the read and
write<00:03:30.280> speeds<00:03:30.459> of<00:03:30.820> some<00:03:30.940> new<00:03:31.060> cables<00:03:31.510> new

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
write speeds of some new cables new

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.820 
write speeds of some new cables new
adapters<00:03:32.850> stuff<00:03:33.850> like<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:35.050> then<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:35.680> will

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
adapters stuff like that and then I will

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.400 
adapters stuff like that and then I will
probably<00:03:36.100> go<00:03:36.850> ahead<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.090> install<00:03:37.300> this<00:03:37.720> in<00:03:38.050> a

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
probably go ahead and install this in a

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.000 
probably go ahead and install this in a
desktop<00:03:38.860> or<00:03:39.070> a<00:03:39.130> laptop<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.610> i<00:03:39.820> have<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:41.010> get

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
desktop or a laptop that i have and get

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.870 
desktop or a laptop that i have and get
great<00:03:42.459> boot<00:03:42.760> speeds<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.450> os<00:03:43.750> performance

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
great boot speeds and os performance

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.060 
great boot speeds and os performance
with<00:03:45.880> this<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.660> if<00:03:47.320> you<00:03:47.530> haven't<00:03:47.890> done

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
with this and if you haven't done

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.530 
with this and if you haven't done
solid-state<00:03:48.820> before<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:50.080> is<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:51.220> whole<00:03:52.090> lot

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
solid-state before it is a whole lot

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.900 
solid-state before it is a whole lot
quicker<00:03:52.780> than<00:03:53.050> those<00:03:53.230> regular<00:03:53.800> old<00:03:53.980> say<00:03:54.850> two
