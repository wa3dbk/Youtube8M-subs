00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
audio taper which is the same as what

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.910 
audio taper which is the same as what
was<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> original<00:00:44.940> circuit<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.500> Epiphone

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
was in the original circuit the Epiphone

used alpha brand there was sort of a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.170 
used alpha brand there was sort of a

J<00:00:51.510> s<00:00:51.780> which<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.470> sure<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
J s which I'm not sure what that is and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.240 
J s which I'm not sure what that is and
one<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.360> couldn't<00:00:54.630> identify<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.739> those

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
one that I couldn't identify but those

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.680 
one that I couldn't identify but those
are<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.520> also<00:00:56.820> 500k<00:00:57.690> audio<00:00:57.989> taper<00:00:58.399> now<00:00:59.690> first

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
are all also 500k audio taper now first

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.979 
are all also 500k audio taper now first
up<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.500> new<00:01:01.800> pots<00:01:02.040> feel<00:01:02.430> pretty<00:01:02.700> different

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
up the new pots feel pretty different

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.420 
up the new pots feel pretty different
I've<00:01:03.989> heard<00:01:04.170> great<00:01:04.320> things<00:01:04.409> about<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.949> CTS

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
I've heard great things about the CTS

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.100 
I've heard great things about the CTS
I'm<00:01:05.939> pretty<00:01:06.119> confident<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.600> their<00:01:06.720> quality

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
I'm pretty confident in their quality

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.440 
I'm pretty confident in their quality
and<00:01:07.729> looking<00:01:08.729> forward<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> hearing<00:01:09.240> what<00:01:09.359> they

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and looking forward to hearing what they

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.989 
and looking forward to hearing what they
sound<00:01:09.719> like<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.409> borns<00:01:10.859> doesn't<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:11.939> too

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:11.999 
sound like the borns doesn't know too

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:14.029 
sound like the borns doesn't know too
much<00:01:12.210> about<00:01:12.389> them<00:01:12.749> they<00:01:13.200> feel<00:01:13.439> completely

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
much about them they feel completely

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.080 
much about them they feel completely
different<00:01:14.399> I<00:01:14.520> don't<00:01:14.609> know<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:14.819> you'll<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.030> able

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
different I don't know if you'll be able

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.289 
different I don't know if you'll be able
to<00:01:15.240> hear<00:01:15.359> this<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.520> bit<00:01:17.670> faint<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.119> when<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
to hear this it's a bit faint but when I

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.419 
to hear this it's a bit faint but when I
turn<00:01:18.600> them<00:01:18.810> they<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:19.139> a<00:01:19.170> faint<00:01:19.469> sound<00:01:19.859> just

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
turn them they have a faint sound just

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:22.129 
turn them they have a faint sound just
mechanically<00:01:21.149> that's<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.630> little<00:01:21.810> scratching

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:22.139 
mechanically that's a little scratching

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:23.840 
mechanically that's a little scratching
us<00:01:22.439> too<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.709> they're<00:01:22.799> very<00:01:23.069> easy<00:01:23.429> to<00:01:23.670> turn

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
us too and they're very easy to turn

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.510 
us too and they're very easy to turn
very<00:01:23.909> low<00:01:24.359> torque<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.319> CTS<00:01:25.799> when<00:01:26.039> I<00:01:26.069> turn<00:01:26.340> them

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
very low torque the CTS when I turn them

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.059 
very low torque the CTS when I turn them
they're<00:01:27.240> very<00:01:27.270> very<00:01:28.049> hard<00:01:28.469> to<00:01:28.619> turn<00:01:28.770> very

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
they're very very hard to turn very

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.699 
they're very very hard to turn very
stiff<00:01:29.450> it's<00:01:30.450> probably<00:01:30.899> easier<00:01:31.200> once<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.530> put

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:31.709 
stiff it's probably easier once you put

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.999 
stiff it's probably easier once you put
a<00:01:31.859> knob<00:01:32.459> on<00:01:32.789> the<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:34.200> width<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.499> the<00:01:34.619> knob<00:01:34.799> will

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
a knob on the the width of the knob will

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.319 
a knob on the the width of the knob will
add<00:01:35.189> some<00:01:35.429> torque<00:01:35.700> when<00:01:35.880> you're<00:01:35.999> turning<00:01:36.240> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
add some torque when you're turning it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.199 
add some torque when you're turning it
will<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.539> little<00:01:36.659> easier<00:01:37.459> but<00:01:38.459> the<00:01:38.609> CTS<00:01:38.999> is

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
will be a little easier but the CTS is

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:40.999 
will be a little easier but the CTS is
stiffer<00:01:39.450> even<00:01:39.779> then<00:01:40.109> the<00:01:40.319> the<00:01:40.619> knobs<00:01:40.829> that

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
stiffer even then the the knobs that

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.300 
stiffer even then the the knobs that
came<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.459> with<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.299> Epiphone<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:44.009> aside

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
came with it with the Epiphone so aside

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.899 
came with it with the Epiphone so aside
from<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> feel<00:01:44.969> they're<00:01:45.899> all<00:01:46.049> audio<00:01:46.409> taper

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
from the feel they're all audio taper

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.519 
from the feel they're all audio taper
meaning<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.509> speed<00:01:48.840> at<00:01:48.990> which<00:01:49.139> the<00:01:49.409> volume

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:49.529 
meaning the speed at which the volume

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:51.980 
meaning the speed at which the volume
changes<00:01:50.099> as<00:01:50.249> you<00:01:50.369> turn<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.880> matches<00:01:51.810> what

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
changes as you turn it up matches what

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.190 
changes as you turn it up matches what
your<00:01:52.200> ear<00:01:52.349> expects<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.099> audio<00:01:53.670> volume<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.899> in

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
your ear expects for audio volume the in

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.410 
your ear expects for audio volume the in
contrast<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> linear<00:01:56.159> taper<00:01:56.819> plot<00:01:57.149> which

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
contrast to a linear taper plot which

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.029 
contrast to a linear taper plot which
wouldn't<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.049> appropriate<00:01:58.289> for<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.799> volume

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
wouldn't be appropriate for a volume

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.429 
wouldn't be appropriate for a volume
application<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.969> would<00:02:00.389> sound<00:02:00.929> wrong<00:02:01.259> as

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
application it would sound wrong as

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.999 
application it would sound wrong as
you're<00:02:01.590> turning<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.919> up<00:02:02.539> so<00:02:03.539> in<00:02:04.200> any<00:02:04.349> case<00:02:04.499> all

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
you're turning it up so in any case all

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.300 
you're turning it up so in any case all
of<00:02:05.549> those<00:02:05.729> factors<00:02:06.270> aside<00:02:07.160> what<00:02:08.160> I'm

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
of those factors aside what I'm

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.319 
of those factors aside what I'm
interested<00:02:08.550> today<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:10.310> do<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.580> pots<00:02:11.819> actually

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
interested today is do the pots actually

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.630 
interested today is do the pots actually
change<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:13.019> sound<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.709> guitar<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.280> there

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
change the sound of the guitar is there

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.100 
change the sound of the guitar is there
something<00:02:14.909> about<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.329> the<00:02:15.599> quality<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:16.019> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
something about the the quality of the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.690 
something about the the quality of the
pot<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.439> here

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
pot in here

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.360 
pot in here
they<00:02:16.819> change<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.300> sound<00:02:17.599> so<00:02:18.379> first<00:02:18.920> up<00:02:19.160> I'm

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
they change the sound so first up I'm

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.130 
they change the sound so first up I'm
going<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.640> play<00:02:19.819> through<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:21.019> original

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
bit and listen for brightness clarity

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.080 
bit and listen for brightness clarity
punchiness<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.830> I'm<00:02:43.610> just<00:02:43.790> playing<00:02:43.970> through

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
punchiness and I'm just playing through

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.970 
punchiness and I'm just playing through
a<00:02:44.150> clean<00:02:44.390> channel<00:02:44.780> on<00:02:44.870> my<00:02:45.019> box<00:02:45.200> fee<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.560> 30<00:02:45.769> amp

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
a clean channel on my box fee to 30 amp

00:02:45.980 --> 00:03:21.599 
a clean channel on my box fee to 30 amp
so<00:02:46.489> let's<00:02:46.849> see<00:02:46.970> what<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.150> sounds<00:02:47.269> like

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.800 

okay<00:03:22.609> so<00:03:22.670> I've<00:03:22.880> rewired<00:03:23.150> everything<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.690> be

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
okay so I've rewired everything to be

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.490 
okay so I've rewired everything to be
connected<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.260> these<00:03:24.350> cts<00:03:24.859> pots<00:03:25.160> now<00:03:26.500> the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
connected to these cts pots now the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.229 
connected to these cts pots now the
alligator<00:03:27.889> clips<00:03:28.190> are<00:03:28.340> long<00:03:28.609> and<00:03:28.910> unshielded

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
alligator clips are long and unshielded

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.569 
alligator clips are long and unshielded
and<00:03:29.600> we're<00:03:29.690> picking<00:03:29.870> up<00:03:30.019> some<00:03:30.230> noise<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.829> hope

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
and we're picking up some noise I hope

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.670 
and we're picking up some noise I hope
that's<00:03:31.819> not<00:03:31.940> too<00:03:32.239> distracting<00:03:32.900> it<00:03:33.440> should<00:03:33.590> be

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
that's not too distracting it should be

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.099 
that's not too distracting it should be
okay<00:03:33.920> for<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.160> purposes<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.670> this<00:03:34.790> test<00:03:35.109> once

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
okay for the purposes of this test once

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.390 
okay for the purposes of this test once
everything's<00:03:36.440> back<00:03:36.650> in<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.950> guitar<00:03:37.250> of

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
everything's back in the guitar of

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.009 
everything's back in the guitar of
course<00:03:37.459> there'll<00:03:37.819> be<00:03:37.850> really<00:03:38.120> short<00:03:38.359> runs<00:03:38.690> of

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
course there'll be really short runs of

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.569 
course there'll be really short runs of
shielded<00:03:39.620> cable<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.069> I'll<00:03:40.160> sound<00:03:40.310> a<00:03:40.489> lot

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
shielded cable and I'll sound a lot

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.349 
shielded cable and I'll sound a lot
better<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:42.280> for<00:03:43.280> this<00:03:43.400> test<00:03:43.609> once<00:03:43.910> again<00:03:44.180> I'm

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
better so for this test once again I'm

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.759 
better so for this test once again I'm
playing<00:03:44.540> through<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.810> bridge<00:03:44.989> pickup<00:03:45.200> volume

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
playing through the bridge pickup volume

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.830 
playing through the bridge pickup volume
all<00:03:45.889> the<00:03:45.920> way<00:03:46.040> up<00:03:46.130> no<00:03:46.819> tone<00:03:47.060> capacitor<00:03:47.660> and

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
all the way up no tone capacitor and

00:03:47.840 --> 00:04:12.910 
all the way up no tone capacitor and
these<00:03:48.590> are<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.799> CTS<00:03:49.190> box<00:03:49.430> now

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.430 

okay<00:04:13.920> these<00:04:14.129> are<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.370> born<00:04:14.849> spots<00:04:15.180> now<00:04:15.450> same

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
okay these are the born spots now same

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:42.620 
okay these are the born spots now same
set<00:04:16.650> up<00:04:40.699> all<00:04:41.699> right<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:41.880> any<00:04:42.180> differences

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
set up all right so any differences

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.879 
set up all right so any differences
there<00:04:42.810> may<00:04:42.960> have<00:04:43.050> been<00:04:43.110> between<00:04:43.229> these<00:04:43.710> are

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
there may have been between these are

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.890 
there may have been between these are
too<00:04:44.039> subtle<00:04:44.250> for<00:04:44.370> me<00:04:44.580> to<00:04:44.699> have<00:04:44.820> noticed<00:04:45.750> while

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
too subtle for me to have noticed while

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.810 
too subtle for me to have noticed while
I<00:04:45.930> was<00:04:46.050> playing<00:04:46.260> them<00:04:46.590> they<00:04:47.550> all<00:04:47.639> basically

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
I was playing them they all basically

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.210 
I was playing them they all basically
sound<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.389> same<00:04:48.539> to<00:04:48.720> me<00:04:48.840> but<00:04:49.229> what<00:04:50.070> I'm<00:04:50.130> going

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
sound the same to me but what I'm going

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.250 
sound the same to me but what I'm going
to<00:04:50.280> do<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.699> edit<00:04:51.300> them<00:04:51.600> in<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:51.870> video<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.199> be

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
to do is edit them in the video to be

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.570 
to do is edit them in the video to be
side-by-side<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.010> we'll<00:04:53.130> see<00:04:53.280> if<00:04:53.370> there's

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
side-by-side and we'll see if there's

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:10.520 
side-by-side and we'll see if there's
any<00:04:54.180> difference<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.660> be<00:04:54.750> heard

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.839 

so<00:05:11.530> after<00:05:11.800> listening<00:05:12.160> to<00:05:12.220> those<00:05:12.340> recordings

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
so after listening to those recordings

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.279 
so after listening to those recordings
I'm<00:05:13.030> just<00:05:13.240> not<00:05:13.389> convinced<00:05:13.900> that<00:05:13.960> I'm<00:05:14.080> hearing

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
I'm just not convinced that I'm hearing

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.920 
I'm just not convinced that I'm hearing
any<00:05:14.470> difference<00:05:14.830> between<00:05:14.949> these<00:05:15.250> BOTS<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:16.509> also

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
any difference between these BOTS I also

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.900 
any difference between these BOTS I also
did<00:05:17.169> some<00:05:17.199> other<00:05:17.410> recordings<00:05:17.979> directing<00:05:18.849> to

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
did some other recordings directing to

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.700 
did some other recordings directing to
my<00:05:19.030> firewire<00:05:19.449> interface<00:05:19.630> and<00:05:20.199> spent<00:05:20.560> a<00:05:20.590> long

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
my firewire interface and spent a long

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.680 
my firewire interface and spent a long
time<00:05:20.740> listening<00:05:21.310> in<00:05:21.400> headphones<00:05:21.699> for<00:05:22.449> a<00:05:22.509> while

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
time listening in headphones for a while

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.050 
time listening in headphones for a while
there<00:05:22.960> I<00:05:22.990> thought<00:05:23.289> I<00:05:23.319> might<00:05:23.740> be<00:05:24.039> hearing<00:05:24.550> some

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
there I thought I might be hearing some

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.520 
there I thought I might be hearing some
more<00:05:25.210> brightness<00:05:25.569> out<00:05:25.660> of<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:25.840> CTS<00:05:26.259> pots

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
more brightness out of the CTS pots

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.499 
more brightness out of the CTS pots
compared<00:05:26.979> to<00:05:27.039> the<00:05:27.160> others<00:05:27.430> in<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:28.270> end<00:05:28.389> I

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
compared to the others in the end I

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.510 
compared to the others in the end I
think<00:05:28.569> I've<00:05:28.780> concluded<00:05:29.050> that<00:05:29.410> you<00:05:29.650> know<00:05:29.770> the

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
think I've concluded that you know the

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.920 
think I've concluded that you know the
differences<00:05:30.970> are<00:05:31.120> so<00:05:31.210> subtle<00:05:31.449> that<00:05:31.690> it<00:05:31.810> could

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
differences are so subtle that it could

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.240 
differences are so subtle that it could
have<00:05:32.020> just<00:05:32.050> been<00:05:32.259> I<00:05:32.380> was<00:05:32.500> holding<00:05:32.770> my<00:05:32.889> pic<00:05:33.069> in<00:05:33.190> a

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
have just been I was holding my pic in a

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.950 
have just been I was holding my pic in a
slightly<00:05:33.490> different<00:05:33.580> place<00:05:33.970> or<00:05:34.360> strumming<00:05:34.900> a

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
slightly different place or strumming a

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.050 
slightly different place or strumming a
little<00:05:35.169> harder<00:05:35.500> so<00:05:36.810> in<00:05:38.220> short<00:05:39.220> I<00:05:39.490> don't<00:05:39.849> think

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
little harder so in short I don't think

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.339 
little harder so in short I don't think
you're<00:05:40.210> going<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.360> get<00:05:40.479> any<00:05:40.659> kind<00:05:40.810> of<00:05:40.900> miracle

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
you're going to get any kind of miracle

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.870 
you're going to get any kind of miracle
improvement<00:05:41.860> in<00:05:42.009> your<00:05:42.220> sound<00:05:42.460> just<00:05:42.819> by

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
improvement in your sound just by

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.950 
improvement in your sound just by
replacing<00:05:43.240> the<00:05:43.539> pots

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
replacing the pots

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.170 
replacing the pots
unless<00:05:44.650> you've<00:05:45.460> just<00:05:45.699> got<00:05:45.819> some<00:05:45.940> really

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
unless you've just got some really

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.790 
unless you've just got some really
crappy<00:05:46.330> pots<00:05:46.690> to<00:05:46.870> begin<00:05:47.080> with<00:05:47.259> if<00:05:47.440> your<00:05:47.590> pots

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
crappy pots to begin with if your pots

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.430 
crappy pots to begin with if your pots
are<00:05:47.979> defective<00:05:48.490> corroded<00:05:49.210> oxidize<00:05:49.960> you<00:05:50.319> know

then chaining out your pots may make a

then chaining out your pots may make a

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
big difference other reasons you might

big difference other reasons you might
want<00:05:55.479> to<00:05:55.509> change<00:05:55.659> the<00:05:55.840> pots<00:05:56.050> if<00:05:56.319> you<00:05:56.409> don't

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
want to change the pots if you don't

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.080 
want to change the pots if you don't
like<00:05:56.710> the<00:05:56.830> feel<00:05:57.099> if<00:05:57.430> they're<00:05:57.580> too<00:05:57.699> hard<00:05:57.940> to

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
like the feel if they're too hard to

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.820 
like the feel if they're too hard to
turn<00:05:58.270> or<00:05:58.479> too<00:05:58.599> easy<00:05:58.840> to<00:05:59.050> turn<00:05:59.259> or<00:05:59.530> if<00:05:59.590> you<00:05:59.680> don't

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
turn or too easy to turn or if you don't

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.210 
turn or too easy to turn or if you don't
like<00:05:59.949> the<00:06:00.069> taper<00:06:00.900> another<00:06:01.900> thing<00:06:02.139> that<00:06:02.319> you

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
like the taper another thing that you

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.710 
like the taper another thing that you
can<00:06:03.370> do<00:06:03.520> is<00:06:03.699> change<00:06:03.940> the<00:06:04.060> resistance<00:06:04.479> of<00:06:04.630> the

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
can do is change the resistance of the

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.659 
can do is change the resistance of the
pots<00:06:04.930> now<00:06:05.349> if<00:06:05.680> you<00:06:05.860> if<00:06:06.159> you've<00:06:06.340> got<00:06:06.490> really

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
pots now if you if you've got really

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.300 
pots now if you if you've got really
bright<00:06:06.940> pickups<00:06:07.419> lowering<00:06:08.349> the<00:06:08.440> resistance

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
bright pickups lowering the resistance

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.860 
bright pickups lowering the resistance
of<00:06:09.400> your<00:06:09.430> pots<00:06:09.699> can<00:06:10.000> roll<00:06:10.240> off<00:06:10.419> some<00:06:10.690> of<00:06:10.719> the

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
of your pots can roll off some of the

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.589 
of your pots can roll off some of the
high<00:06:11.020> end<00:06:11.370> like<00:06:12.370> if<00:06:12.490> you<00:06:12.580> go<00:06:12.669> from<00:06:12.849> 500<00:06:13.330> K<00:06:13.449> on

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
high end like if you go from 500 K on

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.959 
high end like if you go from 500 K on
pots<00:06:13.870> to<00:06:14.199> 250<00:06:14.830> K<00:06:14.979> on<00:06:15.130> pots<00:06:15.370> for<00:06:15.550> your<00:06:15.639> volume

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969 
pots to 250 K on pots for your volume

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:17.909 
pots to 250 K on pots for your volume
you<00:06:16.690> will<00:06:16.870> lose<00:06:17.050> a<00:06:17.080> little<00:06:17.259> of<00:06:17.469> the<00:06:17.560> high<00:06:17.680> end

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
you will lose a little of the high end

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.529 
you will lose a little of the high end
and<00:06:18.219> that<00:06:18.430> could<00:06:18.580> be<00:06:18.699> a<00:06:18.880> good<00:06:19.090> thing<00:06:19.270> if<00:06:19.389> your

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
and that could be a good thing if your

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:22.010 
and that could be a good thing if your
pickups<00:06:19.810> are<00:06:19.960> too<00:06:20.080> bright<00:06:20.259> these<00:06:21.219> pickups<00:06:21.699> are

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
pickups are too bright these pickups are

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.189 
pickups are too bright these pickups are
not<00:06:23.020> bright<00:06:23.320> enough<00:06:23.349> and<00:06:25.110> increasing<00:06:26.110> the

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 
not bright enough and increasing the

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:28.170 
not bright enough and increasing the
resistance<00:06:26.650> will<00:06:26.919> allow<00:06:27.159> higher<00:06:27.430> more<00:06:28.030> high

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
resistance will allow higher more high

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.390 
resistance will allow higher more high
frequencies<00:06:28.659> to<00:06:28.780> get<00:06:28.900> through<00:06:29.280> because<00:06:30.280> it

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
frequencies to get through because it

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.430 
frequencies to get through because it
changes<00:06:30.669> the<00:06:30.729> load<00:06:31.060> of<00:06:31.240> the<00:06:31.330> circuit

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
changes the load of the circuit

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.740 
changes the load of the circuit
I<00:06:32.500> could<00:06:33.069> increase<00:06:33.340> these<00:06:33.580> from<00:06:33.729> 500<00:06:34.150> km<00:06:34.449> to<00:06:34.599> 1

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
I could increase these from 500 km to 1

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.559 
I could increase these from 500 km to 1
megohm<00:06:35.199> pots<00:06:36.009> but<00:06:36.969> I'm<00:06:37.090> not<00:06:37.210> going<00:06:37.360> to<00:06:37.419> bother

megohm pots but I'm not going to bother

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:40.740 
megohm pots but I'm not going to bother
because<00:06:38.130> I<00:06:39.130> just<00:06:39.699> don't<00:06:39.849> think<00:06:40.060> there's<00:06:40.509> any

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
because I just don't think there's any

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.209 
because I just don't think there's any
more<00:06:40.990> high<00:06:41.169> frequencies<00:06:41.620> in<00:06:41.650> these<00:06:41.830> pickups

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:42.219 
more high frequencies in these pickups

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:44.969 
more high frequencies in these pickups
to<00:06:42.340> get<00:06:42.490> through<00:06:42.900> maybe<00:06:43.900> maybe<00:06:44.530> a<00:06:44.620> little<00:06:44.800> bit

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
to get through maybe maybe a little bit

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.459 
to get through maybe maybe a little bit
but<00:06:45.250> not<00:06:45.430> much<00:06:45.780> what<00:06:46.780> will<00:06:46.960> really<00:06:47.169> make<00:06:47.409> a

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:47.469 
but not much what will really make a

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:49.170 
but not much what will really make a
difference<00:06:47.590> is<00:06:48.370> changing<00:06:48.819> the<00:06:48.880> pickups

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
difference is changing the pickups

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.089 
difference is changing the pickups
themselves<00:06:49.719> and<00:06:49.900> you<00:06:50.169> can<00:06:50.289> see<00:06:50.440> I've<00:06:50.590> started
