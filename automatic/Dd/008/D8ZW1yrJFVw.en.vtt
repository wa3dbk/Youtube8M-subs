00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
year like I think they're 10 or 15 times

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.789 
year like I think they're 10 or 15 times
more<00:02:27.549> than<00:02:28.090> last<00:02:28.269> year<00:02:28.599> for<00:02:28.780> sure<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.769> I

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
more than last year for sure so I

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.099

to other people and then that's why I
did<00:03:34.299> in<00:03:34.389> the<00:03:34.449> beginning<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.900> then<00:03:35.739> he<00:03:36.069> patched

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
did in the beginning and then he patched

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.920 
did in the beginning and then he patched
the<00:03:37.750> method<00:03:38.169> you<00:03:38.979> can't<00:03:39.310> share<00:03:39.699> NHL<00:03:40.689> 14

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
the method you can't share NHL 14

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.039 
the method you can't share NHL 14
collections<00:03:41.590> with<00:03:42.030> silver<00:03:43.030> accounts<00:03:43.419> now<00:03:43.569> I'm

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
collections with silver accounts now I'm

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.499 
collections with silver accounts now I'm
not<00:03:44.829> sure<00:03:44.859> for<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.400> fact<00:03:45.669> i'm<00:03:45.879> not<00:03:46.060> sure<00:03:46.269> if

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:46.509 
not sure for a fact i'm not sure if

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:49.589 
not sure for a fact i'm not sure if
there's<00:03:47.259> a<00:03:47.349> way<00:03:47.769> around<00:03:47.919> it<00:03:48.310> but<00:03:49.000> if<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.329> make

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
there's a way around it but if you make

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.780 
there's a way around it but if you make
a<00:03:49.659> new<00:03:49.870> account<00:03:50.019> right<00:03:50.590> now<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:50.979> then<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.579> try

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
a new account right now and then you try

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.399 
a new account right now and then you try
transferring<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.359> collection<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:53.019> new<00:03:53.229> one

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
transferring a collection to a new one

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.129 
transferring a collection to a new one
it<00:03:53.620> will<00:03:53.979> not<00:03:54.220> work<00:03:54.540> I've<00:03:55.540> already<00:03:55.720> tried<00:03:56.019> it

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
it will not work I've already tried it

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.069 
it will not work I've already tried it
and<00:03:56.439> does<00:03:56.829> not<00:03:56.949> work<00:03:57.419> but<00:03:58.419> that's<00:03:58.659> basically

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
and does not work but that's basically

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.259 
and does not work but that's basically
why<00:03:59.470> i<00:03:59.500> want<00:03:59.829> to<00:04:00.099> post<00:04:00.579> up<00:04:00.669> this<00:04:00.819> video<00:04:01.090> as<00:04:01.239> well

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
why i want to post up this video as well

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.229 
why i want to post up this video as well
just<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:02.079> clear<00:04:02.319> up<00:04:02.349> that<00:04:02.560> there<00:04:02.799> is<00:04:02.949> no

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
just to clear up that there is no

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.670 
just to clear up that there is no
collection<00:04:04.239> glitch<00:04:04.509> they<00:04:04.989> actually<00:04:05.319> packed

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
collection glitch they actually packed

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.159 
collection glitch they actually packed
it<00:04:05.919> in<00:04:05.949> my<00:04:06.310> opinion<00:04:06.609> i<00:04:06.879> think<00:04:07.180> it's<00:04:07.599> one<00:04:07.870> per

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
it in my opinion i think it's one per

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.189 
it in my opinion i think it's one per
day<00:04:08.199> on<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:08.799> gold<00:04:09.159> account<00:04:09.569> so<00:04:10.569> I'm<00:04:10.870> just<00:04:11.019> want

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
day on a gold account so I'm just want

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.140 
day on a gold account so I'm just want
to<00:04:11.259> clear<00:04:11.439> that<00:04:11.560> up<00:04:11.620> for<00:04:12.129> you<00:04:12.220> guys<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:12.939> there

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
to clear that up for you guys that there

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.789 
to clear that up for you guys that there
is<00:04:13.329> no<00:04:13.659> collection<00:04:14.109> glitch<00:04:14.319> i<00:04:14.409> keep<00:04:14.620> saying

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
is no collection glitch i keep saying

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.330 
is no collection glitch i keep saying
that<00:04:14.979> but<00:04:15.269> hopefully<00:04:16.269> that<00:04:16.599> clears<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.930> up

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
that but hopefully that clears it up
