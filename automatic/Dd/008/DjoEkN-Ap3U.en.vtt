so<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.230> first<00:00:07.740> thing<00:00:07.950> you'll<00:00:08.429> need<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:09.830> be

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
so the first thing you'll need to be

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.709 
so the first thing you'll need to be
able<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.099> solve<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.730> complete<00:00:12.120> side<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.630> the

anti<00:00:28.260> soon<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.680> also<00:00:29.220> called<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.580> fish

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
anti soon is also called the fish

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.590 
anti soon is also called the fish
pattern<00:00:30.869> or<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> fish<00:00:31.439> algorithm<00:00:32.030> because<00:00:33.030> this

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
pattern or a fish algorithm because this

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.959 
pattern or a fish algorithm because this
pattern<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.469> yellow<00:00:34.829> pieces<00:00:35.399> here<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.790> looks

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
pattern the yellow pieces here it looks

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.330 
pattern the yellow pieces here it looks
like<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> fish

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
like a fish

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.270 
like a fish
according<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:39.050> pretty<00:00:40.050> much<00:00:40.200> everyone<00:00:42.410> so<00:00:43.410> for

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
according to pretty much everyone so for

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.910 
according to pretty much everyone so for
the<00:00:44.430> regular<00:00:44.879> seen<00:00:45.090> case<00:00:45.329> you'll<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.930> box

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the regular seen case you'll have a box

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.139 
the regular seen case you'll have a box
here<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.430> block<00:00:49.160> at<00:00:50.160> your<00:00:50.370> bottom<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
here or block at your bottom here and

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.080 
here or block at your bottom here and
you'll<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.199> one<00:00:52.590> yellow<00:00:53.190> piece<00:00:53.579> at<00:00:53.850> your

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you'll have one yellow piece at your

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.830 
you'll have one yellow piece at your
right<00:00:54.270> facing<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:56.329> when<00:00:57.329> we're<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
right facing you so when we're going to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
right facing you so when we're going to
perform<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.379> algorithm<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:59.100> won't<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
perform the algorithm we won't have the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.479 
perform the algorithm we won't have the
block<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> bottom<00:01:01.170> left<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.680> yellow

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
piece on right facing us so the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:14.090 
piece on right facing us so the
algorithm<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:06.090> R<00:01:07.610> u<00:01:08.610> R<00:01:09.420> prime<00:01:09.930> u<00:01:10.770> R<00:01:11.780> u2<00:01:12.780> R<00:01:13.320> prime

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
that solves the other side but it does

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.440 
that solves the other side but it does

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
what it doesn't doesn't do is solving

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.640 
what it doesn't doesn't do is solving
the<00:01:21.659> these<00:01:22.020> pieces<00:01:22.409> around<00:01:24.140> sometimes<00:01:25.140> you'll

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the these pieces around sometimes you'll

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.510 
the these pieces around sometimes you'll
get<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.100> PLL<00:01:26.700> skip<00:01:27.330> as<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.960> called<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.650> it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
get on PLL skip as it's called and on it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.260 
get on PLL skip as it's called and on it
will<00:01:30.390> became<00:01:30.689> solved<00:01:31.140> completely<00:01:31.909> but<00:01:32.909> that

will became solved completely but that

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.200 
will became solved completely but that

doesn't have front of them but we'll do

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.859 
doesn't have front of them but we'll do
it<00:01:36.240> again<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:37.310> block<00:01:38.310> at<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> bottom<00:01:39.030> left<00:01:39.299> on

still outside and of course you can do

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.910 
still outside and of course you can do
this<00:01:57.000> with<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:58.969> new<00:01:59.969> song<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.509> Q<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.799> do

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
this with a new song and Q you can do

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.889 
this with a new song and Q you can do
this<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.460> any<00:02:03.119> side<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:03.810> your<00:02:04.939> top<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.689> can

this with any side as your top you can

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.010 
this with any side as your top you can
do<00:02:07.380> around<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.190> want<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:09.450> still<00:02:09.780> the

do around if you want to it's still the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.480 
do around if you want to it's still the
same<00:02:10.200> algorithm

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
same algorithm

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.480 
same algorithm
for<00:02:11.730> dance<00:02:12.120> as<00:02:12.360> soon<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.930> have<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.010> case<00:02:14.190> here

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
for dance as soon we have the case here

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.750 
for dance as soon we have the case here
it<00:02:15.300> looks<00:02:15.990> almost<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.530> same<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.700> only

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
it looks almost the same the only

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.690 
it looks almost the same the only
difference<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.390> instead<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.170> having<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:20.490> loop

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
difference is instead of having a loop

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.840 
difference is instead of having a loop

address in case with m.tyson algorithm
we'll<00:02:31.350> need<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.680> turn<00:02:32.600> flip<00:02:33.600> whatever<00:02:34.380> you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
we'll need to turn flip whatever you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.580 
we'll need to turn flip whatever you
want<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.710> call<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.160> cube<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.690> at

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
want to call it to cube like this so at

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.890 
want to call it to cube like this so at
our<00:02:37.800> upper<00:02:38.310> right<00:02:38.490> here<00:02:38.790> we<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.750> block

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
our upper right here we have the block

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.730 
our upper right here we have the block
instead<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.620> bottom<00:02:41.520> left<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.810> we'll<00:02:43.560> have

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
instead of bottom left so we'll have

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.920 
instead of bottom left so we'll have
them<00:02:44.430> up<00:02:45.860> right<00:02:46.860> here<00:02:47.580> we<00:02:48.000> have<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.510> block

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
them up right here we have a block

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.340 
them up right here we have a block
yellow<00:02:49.800> block<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.420> left<00:02:51.660> side<00:02:51.870> this

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
yellow block and on a left side this

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.740 
yellow block and on a left side this
time<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:52.890> will<00:02:53.040> have<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> yellow<00:02:54.060> piece<00:02:54.330> facing

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
time we will have a yellow piece facing

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.260 
time we will have a yellow piece facing
us<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.860> algorithm<00:02:56.490> is<00:02:56.580> R<00:02:57.200> u2<00:02:58.200> R<00:02:58.710> prime<00:02:59.640> u

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
us so the algorithm is R u2 R prime u

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.850 
us so the algorithm is R u2 R prime u
prime<00:03:00.300> or<00:03:01.280> u<00:03:02.280> prime<00:03:02.550> R<00:03:03.060> prime<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.410> will

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
prime or u prime R prime and that will

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.540 
prime or u prime R prime and that will
solve<00:03:05.100> yellow<00:03:05.760> side<00:03:06.150> but<00:03:06.720> as<00:03:07.440> with<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.100> zoo<00:03:08.430> in

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
solve yellow side but as with the zoo in

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.020 
solve yellow side but as with the zoo in
case<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:09.660> won't<00:03:10.290> song<00:03:10.680> these<00:03:11.220> pieces<00:03:11.610> around

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
case it won't song these pieces around

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.990 
case it won't song these pieces around
at<00:03:12.900> least<00:03:13.140> on<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.410> in<00:03:13.500> most<00:03:13.650> cases<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.670> let's<00:03:14.850> do

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
at least on it in most cases so let's do

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.020 
at least on it in most cases so let's do
