00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.210 
come back to 15 on the juice of the B
string<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.820> then<00:03:11.940> 12<00:03:12.180> again<00:03:12.450> 10<00:03:13.140> 14<00:03:13.560> problem<00:03:13.950> G

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
string and then 12 again 10 14 problem G

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.200 
string and then 12 again 10 14 problem G
and<00:03:15.740> then<00:03:16.740> into<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.310> 14th<00:03:17.700> on<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.090> D<00:03:18.270> string

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
and then into the 14th on the D string

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.030 
and then into the 14th on the D string
and<00:03:21.210> do<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.780> same<00:03:21.960> thing<00:03:22.140> in<00:03:24.800> same<00:03:25.800> lick
