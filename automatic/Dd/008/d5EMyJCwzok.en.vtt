00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.170 

and<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.960> has<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.140> code<00:03:01.620> for<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.690> knock<00:03:03.690> sensor

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
and it has a code for a knock sensor

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.700 
and it has a code for a knock sensor
normally<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.300> check<00:03:06.510> engine<00:03:06.720> lights<00:03:07.050> on<00:03:07.320> but

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
normally the check engine lights on but

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.210 
normally the check engine lights on but
I<00:03:08.720> scanned<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.870> myself<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.770> came<00:03:10.920> up<00:03:11.100> with

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
I scanned it myself and it came up with

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.240 
I scanned it myself and it came up with
a<00:03:11.250> knock<00:03:11.490> sensor<00:03:12.030> and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
a knock sensor and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.100 
a knock sensor and
there<00:03:14.460> was<00:03:14.580> one<00:03:14.790> other<00:03:14.910> code<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.660> think<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:15.990> was

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
there was one other code I think it was

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.290 
there was one other code I think it was
code<00:03:16.320> 24<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.610> after<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.730> runs<00:03:20.880> for<00:03:21.210> about

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
code 24 and it after it runs for about

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.050 
code 24 and it after it runs for about
20<00:03:21.720> minutes<00:03:21.900> or<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.470> overheats<00:03:23.060> so

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.600 

I<00:03:28.120> don't<00:03:28.750> know<00:03:28.989> enough<00:03:29.800> about<00:03:29.980> these<00:03:30.280> V<00:03:30.550> sixes

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
I don't know enough about these V sixes

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:41.790 
I don't know enough about these V sixes
and<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.150> don't<00:03:33.210> have<00:03:33.540> time<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:34.020> fix<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.590> need<00:03:34.770> a

oh and the armrest cover this is an

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.250 
oh and the armrest cover this is an
extra<00:05:09.830> dome<00:05:10.040> light<00:05:10.310> because<00:05:10.580> this<00:05:10.730> one's<00:05:11.260> the
