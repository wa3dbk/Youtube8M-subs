00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
apply to one eye at a time just because

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.670 
apply to one eye at a time just because
you<00:01:53.030> don't<00:01:53.240> want<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.450> dry<00:01:53.630> in<00:01:53.869> between<00:01:53.899> coats<00:01:54.380> I

like now the thing about this brush is

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.610

I love rubber brushes they just always

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.620 
I love rubber brushes they just always
worked<00:02:32.250> really<00:02:32.430> well<00:02:32.550> for<00:02:32.700> my<00:02:32.910> eyelash<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.450> I

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
worked really well for my eyelash and I

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.059 
worked really well for my eyelash and I
find<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.050> adds<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.410> little<00:02:34.530> bit<00:02:34.680> more<00:02:34.890> volume

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
find that adds a little bit more volume

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.880 
find that adds a little bit more volume
than<00:02:35.280> an<00:02:35.580> original<00:02:36.060> bristle<00:02:36.450> brush<00:02:36.890> mascara

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890

it the opening would open up that's kind
of<00:03:05.069> what<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.340> reminds<00:03:05.700> me<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.819> I<00:03:06.030> have<00:03:06.150> no<00:03:06.450> idea

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
why that's kind of what it reminds me of

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.729 
why that's kind of what it reminds me of
I<00:03:08.610> know<00:03:08.670> that's<00:03:09.060> not<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:09.660> I'm<00:03:10.019> kind<00:03:10.650> of

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.680 
I know that's not it but I'm kind of
that<00:03:10.890> idea<00:03:11.250> now<00:03:11.519> here<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:11.819> an<00:03:12.030> illustration<00:03:12.120> of

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
that idea now here is an illustration of

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.890 
that idea now here is an illustration of
what<00:03:12.930> they're<00:03:13.110> talking<00:03:13.590> about<00:03:14.780> hopefully<00:03:15.780> you

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
guys can see that well enough because I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.550 
guys can see that well enough because I
can't<00:03:17.670> actually<00:03:17.880> show<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.329> in<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.110> bottle

can't actually show you in the bottle

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.379 
can't actually show you in the bottle
itself<00:03:19.680> because<00:03:20.160> not<00:03:20.310> even<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.700> can<00:03:20.790> see<00:03:21.090> it

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
itself because not even I can see it

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.720 
itself because not even I can see it
okay<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:21.810> my<00:03:22.139> overall<00:03:22.319> opinion<00:03:22.709> this<00:03:23.340> mascara

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
best way to do this well like I said I

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.120 
best way to do this well like I said I
do<00:04:47.030> two<00:04:47.300> coats<00:04:47.509> two<00:04:47.870> coats<00:04:48.110> one<00:04:48.410> coat<00:04:48.650> one<00:04:48.889> coat

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
do two coats two coats one coat one coat

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.830 
do two coats two coats one coat one coat
and<00:04:49.340> then<00:04:49.430> I'm<00:04:49.550> done<00:04:49.789> this<00:04:49.940> is<00:04:50.150> very<00:04:50.479> buildable

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
and then I'm done this is very buildable

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.570 
and then I'm done this is very buildable
and<00:04:51.020> it<00:04:51.169> will<00:04:51.289> not<00:04:51.530> clump<00:04:51.830> either<00:04:52.130> so<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:52.490> hope

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
and it will not clump either so I hope
