00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
I'm like I said it is alcohol-free so my

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.379 
I'm like I said it is alcohol-free so my
skin<00:03:20.489> is<00:03:20.639> still<00:03:20.849> very<00:03:21.030> comfortable

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.659

refined<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.290> texture<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.829> little<00:03:25.980> bit<00:03:26.220> I'm

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
refined the texture a little bit I'm

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.690 
refined the texture a little bit I'm
noticing<00:03:27.209> after<00:03:27.720> maybe<00:03:28.109> a<00:03:28.230> week<00:03:28.560> or<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.190> use

with the I've been happy with the

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.920 
with the I've been happy with the
improved<00:03:38.819> texture<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.299> my<00:03:39.419> skin<00:03:39.450> from<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
improved texture of my skin from the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.289 
improved texture of my skin from the
retin-a<00:03:40.410> but<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.280> actually<00:03:41.819> seemed<00:03:42.090> to

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
retin-a but this actually seemed to

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.330 
retin-a but this actually seemed to
improve<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.959> little<00:03:43.199> bit<00:03:43.379> more<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:44.160> while

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
improve it a little bit more so while

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.220 
improve it a little bit more so while
I'm<00:03:44.519> not<00:03:44.669> seeing<00:03:45.000> any<00:03:45.120> additional<00:03:45.660> glowing

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
I'm not seeing any additional glowing

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.439 
I'm not seeing any additional glowing
effects<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.829> skin<00:03:47.129> I<00:03:47.310> do<00:03:47.430> think<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.419> has

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
effects in the skin I do think it has

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.539 
effects in the skin I do think it has
refined<00:03:49.139> it<00:03:49.349> as<00:03:49.560> far<00:03:49.859> as<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.099> texture<00:03:50.519> a

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
refined it as far as the texture a

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.800 
refined it as far as the texture a
little<00:03:51.090> bit<00:03:51.209> more<00:03:51.480> um<00:03:52.129> so<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.489> pros<00:03:54.419> to<00:03:54.690> this

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
little bit more um so the pros to this

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.659 
little bit more um so the pros to this
cut<00:03:55.109> to<00:03:55.440> this<00:03:55.680> product<00:03:56.069> would<00:03:56.190> be<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.549> it's

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
cut to this product would be that it's

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.150 
cut to this product would be that it's
not<00:03:56.879> dry<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.599> is<00:03:57.720> oil<00:03:57.989> free<00:03:58.109> that<00:03:59.010> it

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
not dry that it is oil free that it

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.280 
not dry that it is oil free that it
improves<00:03:59.579> my<00:03:59.699> skin's<00:04:00.120> texture<00:04:00.599> I<00:04:00.900> think<00:04:01.199> if

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
improves my skin's texture I think if

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.289 
improves my skin's texture I think if
you're<00:04:01.440> not<00:04:01.470> using<00:04:02.099> a<00:04:02.310> retina<00:04:02.639> type<00:04:02.879> product

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
you're not using a retina type product

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.080 
you're not using a retina type product
it<00:04:03.449> would<00:04:03.720> improve<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.769> appearance<00:04:05.549> as<00:04:05.910> far

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
it would improve the appearance as far

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.390 
it would improve the appearance as far
as<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.299> glowing<00:04:06.569> us<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.900> your<00:04:06.989> skin<00:04:07.400> because

as the glowing us of your skin because

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.420 
as the glowing us of your skin because
for<00:04:08.849> me<00:04:09.000> are<00:04:09.329> several<00:04:10.049> one<00:04:10.319> would<00:04:10.530> be<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:11.069> you

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
for me are several one would be that you

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.369 
for me are several one would be that you
can't<00:04:11.849> get<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.419> it<00:04:12.540> readily<00:04:12.870> it's<00:04:13.199> only

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
can't get to it readily it's only

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.020 
can't get to it readily it's only

the<00:04:15.989> other<00:04:16.109> would<00:04:16.320> be<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.560> fragrance<00:04:17.070> because

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
the other would be the fragrance because

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.330 
the other would be the fragrance because
it<00:04:17.579> is<00:04:17.729> heavily<00:04:18.090> fragrant<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.049> price<00:04:20.039> at

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
it is heavily fragrant and the price at

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.390 
it is heavily fragrant and the price at
$29<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.479> is<00:04:21.719> a<00:04:21.750> little<00:04:22.229> bit<00:04:22.349> more<00:04:22.500> expensive

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
$29 it is a little bit more expensive

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.640 
$29 it is a little bit more expensive
on<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.639> toner<00:04:23.910> side<00:04:24.210> of<00:04:24.360> things<00:04:24.600> but<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.620> think

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
on the toner side of things but I think

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.310 
on the toner side of things but I think
that<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.430> benefits<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.270> it<00:04:27.479> for<00:04:27.750> me<00:04:27.960> probably

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
that the benefits of it for me probably

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.700 
that the benefits of it for me probably
make<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:28.889> worthwhile<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.669> I<00:04:30.510> think<00:04:30.810> um<00:04:31.050> it

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
make it worthwhile and I think um it

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.290 
make it worthwhile and I think um it
probably<00:04:31.770> would<00:04:32.430> last<00:04:32.639> a<00:04:32.850> long<00:04:33.000> time

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
probably would last a long time

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.000 
probably would last a long time
I've<00:04:33.630> been<00:04:33.960> using<00:04:34.169> this<00:04:34.380> like<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.620> said<00:04:34.800> for<00:04:34.919> a

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
I've been using this like I said for a

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.280 
I've been using this like I said for a
little<00:04:35.220> over<00:04:35.400> two<00:04:35.610> weeks<00:04:35.639> and<00:04:36.120> I've<00:04:36.690> used<00:04:36.930> just

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
little over two weeks and I've used just

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.409 
little over two weeks and I've used just
this<00:04:38.160> little<00:04:38.520> bit<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.699> product<00:04:39.120> so<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.300> think

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
this little bit of product so I think

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.420 
this little bit of product so I think
this<00:04:39.750> would<00:04:39.990> last<00:04:40.199> me<00:04:40.470> at<00:04:40.560> least<00:04:40.740> six<00:04:41.010> months

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
this would last me at least six months

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.530 
this would last me at least six months
so<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.660> products<00:04:43.530> life<00:04:43.860> span<00:04:44.760> for<00:04:44.790> me<00:04:45.270> is<00:04:45.479> a

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
so a products life span for me is a

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.629 
so a products life span for me is a
little<00:04:46.050> bit<00:04:46.139> more<00:04:46.290> of<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.440> deciding<00:04:47.190> factor

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
little bit more of a deciding factor

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.920 
little bit more of a deciding factor
when<00:04:47.790> I'm<00:04:47.940> deciding<00:04:48.210> whether<00:04:48.540> or<00:04:48.660> not<00:04:48.720> I'll

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
when I'm deciding whether or not I'll

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.080 
when I'm deciding whether or not I'll
spend<00:04:49.229> more<00:04:49.470> or<00:04:49.650> less<00:04:49.830> on<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.190> if<00:04:50.340> it's<00:04:50.940> the

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
spend more or less on it if it's the

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.550 
spend more or less on it if it's the
product<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.510> think<00:04:51.570> it's<00:04:51.900> going<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.110> last<00:04:52.260> me<00:04:52.530> a

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
product I think it's going to last me a

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.290 
product I think it's going to last me a
long<00:04:52.740> time<00:04:53.070> I'm<00:04:53.430> willing<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:53.850> spend<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.210> little

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
long time I'm willing to spend a little

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.600 
long time I'm willing to spend a little
bit<00:04:54.449> more<00:04:54.750> than<00:04:55.350> something<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:56.160> would<00:04:56.370> go

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
bit more than something I would go

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.490 
bit more than something I would go
through<00:04:57.030> really<00:04:57.449> really<00:04:57.660> quickly<00:04:57.930> like<00:04:58.260> maybe

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
through really really quickly like maybe

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.560 
through really really quickly like maybe
saying<00:04:58.830> eye<00:04:59.039> makeup<00:04:59.430> remover<00:04:59.910> mascara<00:05:00.449> or

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
saying eye makeup remover mascara or

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.020 
saying eye makeup remover mascara or
something<00:05:00.900> like<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:01.220> so<00:05:02.220> give<00:05:02.820> it<00:05:02.940> the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
something like that so give it the

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.909 
something like that so give it the
benefits<00:05:03.479> of<00:05:03.630> this<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.169> longevity<00:05:04.350> of<00:05:04.740> it

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
benefits of this and the longevity of it

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.529 
benefits of this and the longevity of it
I<00:05:05.039> think<00:05:05.100> it<00:05:05.430> is<00:05:05.550> something<00:05:05.789> I<00:05:06.000> would<00:05:06.060> invest

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
I think it is something I would invest

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.300 
I think it is something I would invest
in<00:05:06.810> but<00:05:07.530> if<00:05:07.680> you're<00:05:07.860> someone<00:05:08.280> that's

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
in but if you're someone that's

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.950 
in but if you're someone that's
sensitive<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:08.910> fragrance<00:05:09.360> you're<00:05:09.660> definitely

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
sensitive to fragrance you're definitely

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.680 
sensitive to fragrance you're definitely
going<00:05:10.229> to<00:05:10.289> want<00:05:10.440> to<00:05:10.470> stay<00:05:10.680> away<00:05:10.889> from<00:05:11.070> this<00:05:11.220> um

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
going to want to stay away from this um

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.480 
going to want to stay away from this um
one<00:05:12.690> other<00:05:12.720> thing<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.229> should<00:05:13.260> mention<00:05:13.500> is<00:05:14.220> I<00:05:14.400> do

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
one other thing I should mention is I do

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.330

really<00:05:42.810> unusual<00:05:43.410> for<00:05:43.620> me<00:05:43.770> so<00:05:44.340> that<00:05:44.669> would

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
really unusual for me so that would

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.469 
really unusual for me so that would
definitely<00:05:45.090> be<00:05:45.419> on<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.260> pros<00:05:46.530> for<00:05:46.860> me<00:05:47.010> um<00:05:47.479> so

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
cons but for me the pros definitely

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:53.900 
cons but for me the pros definitely
outweigh<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:52.650> cons<00:05:52.860> on<00:05:53.070> this<00:05:53.190> product<00:05:53.639> and<00:05:53.820> it

been somewhat mysterious for us here in
the<00:06:00.930> u.s.<00:06:01.199> because<00:06:01.380> it<00:06:01.620> hasn't<00:06:01.800> been

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
the u.s. because it hasn't been

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.520 
the u.s. because it hasn't been
available<00:06:02.449> like<00:06:03.449> I<00:06:03.570> mentioned<00:06:04.020> it's<00:06:04.139> only

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530

right<00:06:06.690> now<00:06:06.870> I'm<00:06:07.080> kind<00:06:07.320> of<00:06:07.349> hoping<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:07.770> Target

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
right now I'm kind of hoping the Target

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.800 
right now I'm kind of hoping the Target
stores<00:06:08.430> will<00:06:08.550> have<00:06:08.580> it<00:06:08.849> eventually<00:06:09.120> so<00:06:09.599> maybe

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
stores will have it eventually so maybe

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.050 
stores will have it eventually so maybe
that<00:06:10.050> will<00:06:10.169> eliminate<00:06:10.830> one<00:06:11.250> of<00:06:11.370> my<00:06:11.460> cons<00:06:11.760> about

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
that will eliminate one of my cons about

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.089 
that will eliminate one of my cons about
it<00:06:12.270> not<00:06:12.419> being<00:06:12.599> easily<00:06:12.870> accessible<00:06:13.650> so<00:06:13.889> I

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099 
it not being easily accessible so I

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.820 
it not being easily accessible so I
