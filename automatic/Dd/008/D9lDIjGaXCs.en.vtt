00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.890 
lot of great concepts and lines I mean
literally<00:04:24.520> there's<00:04:24.789> a<00:04:24.849> whole<00:04:25.060> bunch<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.419> licks

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
literally there's a whole bunch of licks

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.570 
literally there's a whole bunch of licks
but<00:04:26.260> they<00:04:26.349> don't<00:04:26.530> sound<00:04:26.800> like<00:04:26.979> licks

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
but they don't sound like licks

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.459 
but they don't sound like licks
there's<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.090> whole<00:04:28.270> bunch<00:04:28.450> you<00:04:28.990> can<00:04:29.140> break<00:04:29.349> them

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:29.469 
there's a whole bunch you can break them

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.500 
there's a whole bunch you can break them
down<00:04:29.530> into<00:04:29.710> little<00:04:30.340> phrases<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:31.180> that's<00:04:31.300> what

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
down into little phrases and that's what

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.480 
down into little phrases and that's what
do<00:04:31.720> we<00:04:31.900> break<00:04:32.110> each<00:04:32.320> one<00:04:32.560> down<00:04:32.740> in<00:04:33.040> like<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.220> to

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
do we break each one down in like a to

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.760 
do we break each one down in like a to
measure<00:04:33.730> phrase<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.480> he<00:04:34.810> talks<00:04:35.080> about<00:04:35.260> the

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
measure phrase and he talks about the

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.980 
measure phrase and he talks about the
technique<00:04:36.190> he's<00:04:36.370> using<00:04:36.700> there<00:04:36.940> and<00:04:37.180> then<00:04:37.630> we

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
technique he's using there and then we

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.630 
technique he's using there and then we
go<00:04:38.170> into<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.440> little<00:04:38.620> legato<00:04:39.040> section<00:04:39.550> he

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
go into a little legato section he

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.370 
go into a little legato section he
starts<00:04:39.910> talking<00:04:40.060> about<00:04:40.270> legato<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:40.960> breaking

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
starts talking about legato and breaking

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.190 
starts talking about legato and breaking
down<00:04:41.560> his<00:04:41.830> thought<00:04:42.190> process<00:04:43.000> on<00:04:43.210> how<00:04:43.900> he<00:04:43.960> goes

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
down his thought process on how he goes

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.840 
down his thought process on how he goes
about<00:04:44.230> legato<00:04:44.920> and<00:04:45.130> he's<00:04:45.220> pretty<00:04:45.460> well<00:04:45.640> known
