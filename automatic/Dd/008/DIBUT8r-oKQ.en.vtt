00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.510
 antioquia the most educated 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.160
 us in antioquia the most educated of 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.200
 made from Medellin the most educated 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.360
 since we entered politics we 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.280
 we set a purpose to make the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.560
 education understood in terms 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.660
 general its means education the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.000
 school science technology system 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.489
 innovation entrepreneurship culture 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.419
 expressions where people 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.910
 they develop their talent and their abilities 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.550
 we set out to make education the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.340
 engine of social transformation 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.129
 they are a lot of activities that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 we develop to achieve the 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.520
 political task that we set ourselves 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.700
 since we started participating in 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.410
 politics 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.750
 within all that amount of 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.150
 activities, naturally, we 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.250
 We take to educational institutions 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.560
 to the school system and they talk about the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.140
 quality of education and we have to 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.730
 arrive after starting at the level 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.640
 highest going through all the levels 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.440
 to the classroom inside everything 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.020
 the world within all that amount of 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.650
 activities that we have there is a very 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:09.360
 special for me the cutest subject of 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:13.780
 all the mathematics we have 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.850
 as a political challenge in the world of 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.460
 education improve the condition 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.790
 mathematics of our students of 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.770
 our students because they are 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.990
 many times people ask about 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.490
 what math mathematics for 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.400
 the vast majority the person means 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.050
 Problem obstacle difficulty 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.080
 suffering because we have to 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.119
 incorporate those conditions within the 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.710
 formation of people a very reason 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.530
 simple 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.770
 in very general terms the universe is 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.390
 expresses in mathematical terms many 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.310
 of the phenomena of things that 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.240
 occur around us has a 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.650
 underlying mathematical formulation and if 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.810
 we want to be part of this 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.390
 world understand this world well it's better 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.880
 that we know at least approach the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.590
 language of the universe in many ways 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.829
 possible 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.349
 besides the mathematics in all this 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.420
 context have a condition that all 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.370
 we know but many times we 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.019
 they forget mathematics they have a 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.120
 condition that helps us understand 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.940
 understand the problems understand 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.920
 situation be able to establish 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.129
 relationships between different components 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.920
 of problems being able to express 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.739
 that we understand those phenomena that 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.470
 we are discovering to express them in that 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.120
 mathematical language in a few words and 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.400
 taking a monumental leap the 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.709
 Mathematics are fundamental to making 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.180
 citizens and be citizens as well as 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.970
 I'm saying citizens or 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.010
 citizens have that luggage that is 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.129
 need to unwrap in our 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.280
 society we say one and another day 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.049
 education is fundamental to be 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.390
 free and inside the baggage 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.829
 education do not have the slightest doubt that what 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.079
 that mathematics gives us 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.540
 ability to understand reason conclude 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.310
 argue are a component 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.870
 fundamental to be citizens and 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.459
 citizens in the 21st century 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.080
 we are seeing a million things we have 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.450
 the math network we know all the 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.239
 problems we know the difficulties that 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.310
 is part of a challenge that Colombia has 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.590
 as a society in particular we in 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.680
 antioquia one of the things that we are 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.720
 doing is guess what to deliver 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.420
 problems we are delivering 100 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.190
 problems that everything to chiller should 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.379
 understand and resolve what it is that 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.239
 we want with these problems 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.980
 we make a compilation of the 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.040
 fundamental concepts of mathematics 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.569
 that are developed through school 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.040
 since we entered the school going on 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.680
 by arithmetic for all that amount 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.030
 of concepts until the broth arrives 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.250
 we are able to identify them 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.410
 we know where the difficulties are with 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.700
 some of those fundamental concepts 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.030
 and what we are doing here then 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.840
 is proposing 100 problems that are a 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.700
 excuse to work math not with 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.870
 very few exceptions there are some people 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.430
 with supernatural conditions that 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.650
 they do not have to make effort but the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.269
 mathematics if they learn by working and 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.130
 working in mathematics means 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.050
 making problems and this collection that 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.430
 We are delivering problems here 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.470
 we are going to deliver it to all 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.790
 students all students of 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.260
 antioquia tenth and 11 and in fact 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.670
 anyone in colombia in 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.010
 any place on the planet can 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.420
 take use because this is a 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.550
 knowledge that we do 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.900
 public so that when they are in that 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.850
 process of finishing the baccalaureate 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.040
 let's always go over to work 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.440
 with the teachers the teachers review 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.450
 concepts work together solve 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.160
 problems preparing for college 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.289
 in short is what we are doing 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.499
 us with these 100 problems 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.599
 we present them and deliver them safely 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:47.990
 that you can have fun but are for 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:49.610
 work them so that we force ourselves to 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.279
 review the concepts that we can 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.379
 have been a little confused that no 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:56.330
 we never understood them and this is a 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:58.189
 opportunity that we are doing everything 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.960
 this is part of our work in 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:01.699
 the maths network how do we do 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.020
 of component mathematics 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.999
 of the quality of the 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.589
 education and how we make quality 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.669
 of fundamental component education 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.860
 of the transformation of our society 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:13.399
 we have many more books for example 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.409
 this do not miss it is arithmetic 

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:17.349
 geometry all you should know about 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.300
 geometry arithmetic explained very well 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:22.399
 with all the care all this have done 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.899
 people who know math that they 

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:25.999
 they like the mathematics that they have the 

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:27.020
 sensitivity to explain to audiences 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:28.789
 very varied 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.659
 we have utility geometry here is 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.909
 to work for the general bengal 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:37.219
 Precalculus what trigonometry needs 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.779
 and analytical geometry we have everything and 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:40.879
 everything is available to all 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:42.680
 people in antioquia in colombia in 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:44.360
 anywhere in the world we have 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.740
 learned in many parts of many 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.470
 people of many people all over 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.849
 but in the end the goal of all this is 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.319
 the mathematics partly the 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.020
 social transformation and these 100 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.400
 Problems are delivering for 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.099
 that serve as an excuse for 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.680
 think to understand to solve and 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.280
 to enjoy antioquia mathematics 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.280
 in the most educated
