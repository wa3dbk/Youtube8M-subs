00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.220
 female destiny 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.220
 like the quadrilateral 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.870
 like a musical storm arrives 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.750
 she uses her voice to inspire but this 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.970
 night will use it to eliminate the 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.970
 america vÃ¡squez competition 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.859
 comes with two missions to win and show 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.210
 the power of women in the mariachi 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.210
 soto rain 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.280
 let the battle begin 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.500
 everywhere 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.100
 one thing that does not 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.160
 memory 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.360
 a thing that 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.590
 very well natalia I know what awaits you 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.960
 another decision quite difficult 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.060
 but I'm very proud of the three the 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.600
 you have done phenomenally tonight 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.600
 happiness 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.790
 and haiti what do you think 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:21.120
 number 1 I congratulate you very good 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.640
 presentation I loved how america is 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.710
 directed towards the validity and area list me 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.950
 they really like your tuning they have a 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.950
 tuning 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:36.819
 at first I did not understand much 

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:37.929
 pronunciation but half the subject 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.479
 onwards 

00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:44.129
 You were able to retake again and you did it 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.129
 as a champion thank you 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.030
 The truth is that I really liked how 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.940
 there were problems there with the 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.250
 tuning slightly but in the end I 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.340
 it seems that good they managed to get ahead 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.630
 all three very well the decision 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.340
 obviously your coach has it 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.980
 natalia the difficult moment arrived 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.840
 we want to know who will win 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.840
 and I want you at 36 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.100
 you already know what is a 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.919
 competition and here this is for the team 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.960
 that seems to me that there have been moments 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.300
 in which you were going a little bit of time 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.220
 if you go a little bit tuning and this 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.190
 goes by three it's not just for one 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.220
 then I in this battle I will 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.900
 choose who I know maybe 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.630
 in the live shows he's going to give me a better 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.100
 direct 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.100
 and that person 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.639
 is 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.639
 America 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.230
 and specials 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.949
 and they want to say goodbye to their cars 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:23.289
 natalia I'm leaving happy because I 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.680
 I had the opportunity to be in your 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.680
 team 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:36.090
 and I'm leaving so happy 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.449
 but it can be a chore forever my 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.449
 love 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.170
 a lot of luck adds to the rain and what 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.210
 the world's best for them in their career 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.240
 musical 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.699
 and I'm very grateful to be here 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.729
 Well, even if it does not happen, I'll continue with my 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.729
 career 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:07.660
 I feel a little sad because I do not 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:11.080
 I'm going to two finals but this was 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.590
 only one step be closer to me 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.590
 dream 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:24.379
 America in the end I decided to go with America 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.750
 because america I think that of the three was 

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:28.400
 the one that did it better even though the three of them 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.370
 they did very well but I feel that she 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.879
 it gave me a little more fun 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:36.770
 wow I almost got my heart out but 

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:40.220
 I knew that I could have a chance to 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:43.280
 win for all his dedication that I 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.490
 He looked at putting you and does not deserve the 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.490
 true
