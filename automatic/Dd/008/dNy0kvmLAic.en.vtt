00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
you probably don't want to do it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.130 
you probably don't want to do it
yourself<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.430> eventually<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.600> got<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.020> this

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
yourself but eventually I got to this

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.990 
yourself but eventually I got to this
point<00:01:07.350> where<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:08.390> realized<00:01:09.390> again<00:01:10.580> this<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
point where I realized again this is a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.330 
point where I realized again this is a
tow<00:01:12.330> truck<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:14.010> hook<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> back<00:01:14.850> works

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
tow truck and the hook on the back works

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.330 
tow truck and the hook on the back works
