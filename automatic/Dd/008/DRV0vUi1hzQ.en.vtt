00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.939
 today we talk about braids the braids are 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.980
 a natural evolution of the coasts like 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.140
 you can see from these two examples in 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.050
 effects are worked in stockinette stitch 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:18.339
 straight on a stockinette background 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.380
 upside down and also from the reverse of work 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:22.869
 they are coasts of fact that yes 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.869
 intertwine between them are performed 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.820
 normally on an even number of points 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.429
 because these points are then divided a 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.240
 half and two halves exchange between each other 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.830
 they can be exchanged for one 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.010
 direction going to the right as in 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.900
 this case or to the left for 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.600
 get the braid turned from the other 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.630
 mud then we see how to do 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.430
 they work in the same way whether you are 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.570
 use the index method with the method with 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.510
 dignity 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.180
 a clarification is essential to have 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.100
 1 auxiliary iron that can have one 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.770
 so you find these in commerce 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.409
 most commonly these in metal I 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.780
 I prefer to use the hook because I am 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.490
 allows you to hook up goods here 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:16.929
 points and don't let them fall start mine 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.749
 I work that I have created an edge 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:23.259
 first with straight stocking stitch then 

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:26.380
 he started working on the starting points 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.920
 my braid is on eight points so me 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.799
 I'll have to take the first four get them 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.329
 get off the iron and position them up 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.509
 what is called iron 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.369
 auxiliary having to twist 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.490
 to the right 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.249
 my first points go to the back of 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.859
 work pay attention to up to the trust must 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:51.790
 stay in this job position i 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:56.080
 following four points 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:00.460
 and then I have to put back on the iron 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.150
 the ones I passed then we see them 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.150
 get back 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.780
 paused left in this way 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:17.120
 and there work again he is entitled to 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.569
 made points 12 34 have become i 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.489
 points 5 6 7 8 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.489
 I continue with my work 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.580
 when I have to change direction like 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.520
 in this other case 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:44.350
 we live in the braid that goes from the other 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.880
 points on the auxiliary iron 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.880
 they will go to work instead of them 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.880
 we find 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.870
 I always take the first 4 points and the 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:14.569
 braid points here also on 8 position 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:18.519
 front number 5 6 7 and 8 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:21.760
 what time you change position and then 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.760
 I start working again 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.200
 the other four I had on the iron 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.200
 auxiliary 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.080
 and I completed it but braided it
