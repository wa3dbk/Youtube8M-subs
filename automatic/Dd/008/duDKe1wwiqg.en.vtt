dough you've got to roll it out you take

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.779 
dough you've got to roll it out you take
your<00:01:10.020> rolling<00:01:10.380> pin<00:01:10.409> roll<00:01:10.590> out<00:01:11.039> any<00:01:11.159> highs<00:01:11.490> or

massage feels great there's a reason why
we<00:01:59.609> like<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.789> be<00:01:59.969> touched<00:02:00.210> because<00:02:00.539> our<00:02:00.780> nerves

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
we like to be touched because our nerves

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.870 
we like to be touched because our nerves
have<00:02:01.920> touch<00:02:02.670> receptors<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.780> our<00:02:04.170> our<00:02:05.130> muscles

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
have touch receptors in our our muscles

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.750 
have touch receptors in our our muscles
in<00:02:06.090> our<00:02:06.210> tent

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
in our tent

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.790 
in our tent
so<00:02:07.390> after<00:02:07.630> we<00:02:07.750> have<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.050> good<00:02:08.260> massage<00:02:08.560> were

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
so after we have a good massage were

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.740 
so after we have a good massage were
like<00:02:08.920> wow<00:02:09.160> we<00:02:09.340> feel<00:02:09.610> nice<00:02:09.790> in<00:02:09.820> our<00:02:10.030> life<00:02:10.210> the

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
like wow we feel nice in our life the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.660 
like wow we feel nice in our life the
same<00:02:10.900> thing<00:02:11.080> with<00:02:11.200> volleyball<00:02:11.680> right<00:02:11.950> we<00:02:12.460> take

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
same thing with volleyball right we take

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.490 
same thing with volleyball right we take
the<00:02:12.790> foam<00:02:12.970> roller<00:02:13.210> wakes<00:02:13.720> up<00:02:13.900> nerve<00:02:14.080> endings

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
the foam roller wakes up nerve endings

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.320 
the foam roller wakes up nerve endings
sends<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.160> signal<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.670> brain<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.970> brain

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
sends a signal to the brain a brain

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.300 
sends a signal to the brain a brain
comes<00:02:16.600> back<00:02:16.840> saying<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.860> good<00:02:18.100> thing

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
I'm going to send positive feedback to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.420 
I'm going to send positive feedback to
the<00:02:20.950> muscle<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.520> increase<00:02:21.940> alertness<00:02:23.430> start

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
the muscle to increase alertness start

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.570 
the muscle to increase alertness start
activating<00:02:24.820> more<00:02:25.090> muscles<00:02:25.480> in<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.720> area

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
activating more muscles in the area

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.500 
activating more muscles in the area

great<00:03:03.430> way<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.610> increase<00:03:04.380> muscle<00:03:05.380> temperature

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
great way to increase muscle temperature

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.760 
great way to increase muscle temperature
and<00:03:06.340> also<00:03:06.820> muscle<00:03:07.300> awareness<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.380> once<00:03:08.620> we

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770

blood<00:03:16.030> more<00:03:16.600> oxygen<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.860> area<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.340> the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
blood more oxygen to that area of the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.000 
blood more oxygen to that area of the
body<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:18.850> increase<00:03:19.000> blood<00:03:19.870> flow<00:03:19.930> we<00:03:20.709> all<00:03:20.860> know

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010

body to increase blood flow we all know
blood<00:03:21.280> flow<00:03:21.490> is<00:03:21.700> good<00:03:21.910> muscle<00:03:22.600> repair<00:03:22.720> so

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
blood flow is good muscle repair so
