00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hi to all this is the room in this 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.509
 video let's talk about chris edwards so 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.189
 this man is dead he is there he is in 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.900
 gta 5 he has always been there in the game 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.410
 with us but few people have it 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.780
 cross 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.219
 we are going to meet him then 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.949
 before that I wanted to come back to the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.600
 yesterday's video about the gta 5 demon 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.970
 there are quite a few people who have had 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.590
 scared especially in the end others have not 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.390
 dared to watch the video at night they have 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.800
 favorite wait until the next morning 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.779
 so what you need to know is that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.699
 in gt5 everything is a fiction we are 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.560
 in a game even if a lot of events 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.880
 refer to real life such 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.780
 that they are represented in the game that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.210
 remains a fiction 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.559
 so there is no reason to be scared I 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.980
 give you an example the city of los 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.390
 santos 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.550
 she represents the city of los angeles 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.739
 in the United States if you destroy 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.870
 benches in the santos no bench will be 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.539
 destroyed by your fault in los angeles 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.190
 fiction so she should have no 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.840
 impact with real life 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.879
 another example in my video on the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.770
 killer of the infinite at one point I 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.570
 passes an extract of the nursery rhyme 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.280
 freddy krueger view which is a reference 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.920
 to this one on the rocks of blaine 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.019
 county and we mean 7.8 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.250
 he is hidden under his bed so there is 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.450
 a lot of people who were afraid of a 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.770
 cost of what they had under their bed 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.330
 but there is no reason to be afraid 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.860
 some chills I want but 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.510
 rest assured there will be nobody under 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.950
 your bed then to go back to the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.780
 yesterday's video when I did the editing 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.850
 and we see the girl being shot 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.320
 by the legs in the end I was afraid that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.900
 you thought it was ridiculous so I 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.250
 tried to synchronize that with the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.840
 images they are for that you 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.909
 please except that I realized 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.409
 that a lot of people did not have the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.710
 same look as me on the end of the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.860
 video 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.880
 and they saw a screamer 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.659
 personally for - screamer it's 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.130
 not that 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.900
 if I had put a screamer everyone 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.280
 would have jumped at mail to a lot of people 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.350
 told me that it did not do anything 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.970
 I do not even like fencers 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.860
 of that I find it ridiculous so it was 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.299
 really not the goal if you saw there 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.560
 register dying really sorry I 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.540
 just wanted to make you feel 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.220
 a little stress and a lot of fear 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.140
 to put you right in 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.700
 the mood of the subject of the video but to 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.290
 no time I wanted you on 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.450
 go elsewhere when we look at it 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.040
 well we see nothing scary the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.840
 silhouette on fire is not shocking 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.100
 visually and the girl at the end of the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.350
 video either she is quite 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.990
 normal this said even if I failed 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.099
 at 100% to convey the feeling that 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.840
 I wanted to make you feel 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.640
 I still hope that the idea has you 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.860
 more and that the video too 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.930
 so now we'll go to chris 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.610
 edwards and there you go pinball there you 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.810
 are going to have the fear of your life and there 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.520
 I advise all those who are 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.930
 fragile to leave and not to 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.930
 go further in the video 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.890
 well, there's still someone in the video 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.219
 who was not scared and who is still 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.109
 present chris edwards people do not you 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:44.319
 do not know how to arrive 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:46.030
 knowledge makes us good flipper good 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.530
 I reassure you I was joking 1 he 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.090
 remains more than the seemingly brave 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.139
 on the video so you 're not going to have 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.969
 afraid at all huh I'm just going 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.920
 you introduce a man who worked 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:56.109
 for rockstar and who died it was 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.639
 really an indispensable element at 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.799
 rockstar without whom the game would have been 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.930
 completely different then chris 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.099
 edwards for you to see a little bit of 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.109
 who I speak I give you a few 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.909
 examples of what he did he has 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.739
 worked on the graphics of max 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.470
 payne 3 and blacks and blacks 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.810
 complete edition gta chinatown wars 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.030
 I was at liberty city stories midnight 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.219
 club 3 the lion king the family addams 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.900
 still prefers plenty of other games he has 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:23.019
 summer designer in the liberty city 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.629
 stories and especially he worked on the 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.459
 programming and realization of gta 5 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.739
 so that's a huge thing they were 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.659
 among other fans of alien whose why 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.639
 it is well represented in gta 5 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.549
 aliens he always hoped to see a 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.169
 alien an alien a UFO with the 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.090
 telescope that you see here 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.010
 so that's why it was scop 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.989
 here is it's not for nothing that is 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.120
 precisely for him because he has 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.099
 always wanted to perceive something 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.560
 so did he see one day 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.049
 we do not really know UFOs without 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.569
 doubt aliens maybe not this guy there 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.669
 he had a lot of imagination and gta 5 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.199
 owes a lot to this guy especially at the level 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.540
 of all this story that turns 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.310
 around the aliens in gta 5 then 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.259
 rockstar gave him a little tribute he 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.120
 in merit is perhaps a bigger one 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:09.069
 can not count on his genius for a 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.780
 future gta we still hope he 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.489
 taught them a lot at rockstar 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.310
 I prefer that he be on a plate 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.879
 rather than his road spirit near this 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.829
 graveyard 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:21.419
 that's all for this video and I 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.419
 tell you just now ciao
