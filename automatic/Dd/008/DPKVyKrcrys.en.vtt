spool you're spinning reel without

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.310 
spool you're spinning reel without
creating<00:00:22.350> line<00:00:22.590> twists<00:00:23.750> to<00:00:24.750> do<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.019> we're

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
creating line twists to do this we're

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.540 
creating line twists to do this we're
going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.470> need<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.619> few<00:00:25.859> items<00:00:26.090> align<00:00:27.090> snips

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
going to need a few items align snips

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.999 
going to need a few items align snips
the<00:00:29.550> line<00:00:29.760> you've<00:00:29.910> chosen<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:31.009> obviously

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the line you've chosen and obviously

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.450 
the line you've chosen and obviously
your<00:00:32.460> rod<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.669> reel<00:00:33.710> there's<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.800> few<00:00:35.010> steps<00:00:35.250> in

your rod and reel there's a few steps in
the<00:00:35.520> properly<00:00:35.969> doing<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.989> first<00:00:37.230> step

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the properly doing this the first step

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.530 
the properly doing this the first step
is<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> take<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.489> line<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.910> select<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
is to take the line you select it and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.119 
is to take the line you select it and
create<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> loop<00:00:40.170> knot<00:00:40.969> pull<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> line<00:00:42.329> dollars

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
create a loop knot pull the line dollars

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.889 
create a loop knot pull the line dollars
double<00:00:44.129> your<00:00:44.489> line<00:00:44.700> over<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> loop

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
double your line over and have a loop

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.279 
double your line over and have a loop
that's<00:00:46.110> about<00:00:46.440> six<00:00:46.739> inches<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.250> life<00:00:48.170> with<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
that's about six inches in life with the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.130 
that's about six inches in life with the
loop<00:00:49.500> wrap<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.489> around<00:00:50.670> your<00:00:51.030> finger<00:00:51.390> to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
loop wrap it around your finger to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.430 
loop wrap it around your finger to
create<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> second<00:00:52.980> loop<00:00:53.750> pull<00:00:54.750> your<00:00:54.989> initial

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
create a second loop pull your initial

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.369 
create a second loop pull your initial
loop<00:00:55.649> through<00:00:56.219> your<00:00:56.370> second<00:00:56.789> loop<00:00:57.050> to<00:00:58.050> create

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
loop through your second loop to create

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.219 
loop through your second loop to create
a<00:00:58.410> knot<00:01:01.250> with<00:01:02.250> your<00:01:02.280> line<00:01:02.640> nips<00:01:03.140> nipple<00:01:04.140> off

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.929 

you<00:01:12.240> now<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.960> complete<00:01:13.470> loop<00:01:13.790> create<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
you now have a complete loop create the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.260 
you now have a complete loop create the
loop<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.950> place<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.250> fishing<00:01:17.610> line<00:01:17.640> through

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
loop not place the fishing line through

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.590 
loop not place the fishing line through
the<00:01:18.390> loop<00:01:18.570> you've<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:18.990> created<00:01:23.479> once<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the loop you've just created once you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.030 
the loop you've just created once you
pull<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.899> fishing<00:01:25.200> line<00:01:25.229> through<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> loop

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
pull the fishing line through the loop

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.430 
pull the fishing line through the loop
you've<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:26.790> created<00:01:27.090> an<00:01:27.390> adjustable<00:01:28.170> glue

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
you've now created an adjustable glue

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.330 
you've now created an adjustable glue
not<00:01:29.960> after<00:01:30.960> creating<00:01:31.140> our<00:01:31.350> loot<00:01:31.500> not<00:01:31.710> I'd<00:01:32.159> like

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
not after creating our loot not I'd like

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.130 
not after creating our loot not I'd like
to<00:01:32.490> identify<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.000> direction<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.690> bail<00:01:33.899> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
to identify the direction the bail the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.620 
to identify the direction the bail the
reels<00:01:34.350> spinning<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.610> direction<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
reels spinning and the direction the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:47.200 
reels spinning and the direction the
line<00:01:36.869> comes<00:01:37.170> off<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.350> spool

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.630 

in<00:01:47.720> this<00:01:47.900> instance<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.560> bail<00:01:48.920> spins

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
in this instance the bail spins

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.359 
in this instance the bail spins
counterclockwise<00:01:50.350> we'd<00:01:51.350> like<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.710> school<00:01:51.950> of

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
counterclockwise we'd like the school of

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.560 
counterclockwise we'd like the school of
wine<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:53.119> match<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:53.330> as<00:01:53.750> well<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:55.570> properly

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
wine to match that as well I properly

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.690 
wine to match that as well I properly
set<00:01:56.750> up<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.930> school<00:01:57.200> now<00:01:57.380> so<00:01:57.740> there's<00:01:57.950> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
set up the school now so there's the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.950 
set up the school now so there's the
lines<00:01:58.940> coming<00:01:59.210> off<00:01:59.390> in<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.659> counterclockwise
