00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello youtube friends has absentee me 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.330
 a little but I already came back and this time 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.730
 I bring a powerful program that 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.500
 complements with the requiem pro that is the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.290
 program that I showed you in my first 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.660
 tutorial well this program is called 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.300
 advanced system optimizer and has many 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.430
 varieties of use this program like 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.289
 that the recreate pro fixes errors but 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.240
 this makes a deeper search 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.430
 detecting errors different from those 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.680
 detects the recre in pro eye the two 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.750
 programs are necessary since each one 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.059
 It specializes in different branches of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.070
 search but without a doubt this is a 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.640
 complete program that should not be missing in 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.829
 your pc 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.930
 the program repairs pc errors to a 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.750
 level deeper than the recre and pro 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.300
 repairs the PC at the level of clean software 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.760
 unwanted data frees up space in the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.030
 disk updates the drivers of the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.030
 pc defragment disk optimizes disk 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.010
 analyze and clean stewart optimizes games 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.680
 so that they do not get lost or slow down 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.770
 optimizes memory for the PC to run 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.030
 faster recover deleted data 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.220
 accidentally and many other 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.480
 more things I will let you 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.580
 discover 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.440
 I will give you in quick analysis since the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.660
 program takes a bit looking for the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.460
 problems as we can see in the 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.010
 program in the main part we see 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.740
 three modules the first one takes care of the 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.990
 security the second of cleaning and the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.970
 third to optimize we see that in the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.490
 bottom left of the program in 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.870
 green color says registered version 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.550
 remember that I will leave you in the 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.140
 description of the video the link of the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.450
 program and serial 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.190
 pause the video because really the 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.190
 program takes a little time to analyze 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.550
 look how many errors there are on my pc 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.290
 drivers are updated since 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.270
 before recording the tutorial this 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.270
 program was commissioned to update them 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.070
 well now we give in optimize 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.130
 as we already see the program I repair and 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.170
 optimized the pc then the program you 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.750
 will ask you to restart the pc to be able 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.590
 apply the changes very well friends that 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.450
 that's it 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.850
 remember that the program has many 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.010
 functions and when we give in start 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.410
 Smart PC care does not apply 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.420
 all the functions of the program but 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.760
 that applies the most important thing that are the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.220
 three modules security cleaning and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.110
 optimization this function that is the most 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.510
 important can be applied three 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.880
 different ways that is it has three 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.470
 types of analysis the fast the detailed 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.420
 and the customized 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.370
 As I told you, you can use 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.500
 the functions you want as per 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.540
 example recover data or optimize 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.510
 some game among many functions more 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.030
 that is part of you remember 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.519
 enter the serial I say goodbye until a 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.040
 new tutorial do not forget to comment and 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.120
 subscribe remember that the links are 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.120
