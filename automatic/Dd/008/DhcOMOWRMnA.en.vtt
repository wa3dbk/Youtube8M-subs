just<00:01:55.390> tried<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.320> oculus<00:01:56.740> prototype<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.580> it

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
just tried the oculus prototype and it

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.880 
just tried the oculus prototype and it
was<00:01:57.850> such<00:01:58.090> an<00:01:58.390> immersive<00:01:58.720> amazing<00:01:59.410> experience

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
was such an immersive amazing experience

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.280 
was such an immersive amazing experience
that<00:02:00.670> we<00:02:00.850> pretty<00:02:01.240> quickly<00:02:01.330> like<00:02:01.750> within<00:02:01.930> an

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
that we pretty quickly like within an

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.950 
that we pretty quickly like within an
hour<00:02:02.440> decided<00:02:03.010> to<00:02:03.070> get<00:02:03.190> behind<00:02:03.370> I<00:02:04.360> got<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.870> meet

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
hour decided to get behind I got to meet

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.840 
hour decided to get behind I got to meet
Palmer<00:02:05.260> Luckey<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.860> try<00:02:06.130> out<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.400> oculus

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
Palmer Luckey and try out the oculus

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.550 
Palmer Luckey and try out the oculus
rift<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.660> I<00:02:07.750> have<00:02:07.870> to<00:02:07.990> say<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.230> was<00:02:08.320> a<00:02:08.380> very

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
rift and I have to say it was a very

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.930 
rift and I have to say it was a very
exciting<00:02:08.860> moment<00:02:09.070> it<00:02:09.520> could<00:02:09.640> be<00:02:09.820> the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
exciting moment it could be the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.640 
exciting moment it could be the
beginning<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.420> whole<00:02:10.570> new<00:02:10.630> industry<00:02:10.929> that

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
beginning of a whole new industry that

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.530 
beginning of a whole new industry that
leads<00:02:12.070> us<00:02:12.250> eventually<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.850> having<00:02:13.330> true

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
leads us eventually to having true

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.640 
leads us eventually to having true
augmentations

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
augmentations

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.460 
augmentations
all<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.130> time<00:02:15.340> every<00:02:15.370> place<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.750> I'm<00:02:17.230> really

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
all the time every place and I'm really

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.870 
all the time every place and I'm really
looking<00:02:17.800> forward<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.190> getting<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.520> chance<00:02:18.730> to

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
looking forward to getting a chance to

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.270 
looking forward to getting a chance to
program<00:02:19.510> with<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.110> see<00:02:20.710> what<00:02:20.740> we<00:02:20.980> can<00:02:21.130> do

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
program with it and see what we can do

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.550 
program with it and see what we can do
it<00:02:21.610> looks<00:02:21.790> incredibly<00:02:22.690> exciting<00:02:23.320> if

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
it looks incredibly exciting if

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.620 
it looks incredibly exciting if
anybody's<00:02:24.070> gonna<00:02:24.280> tackle<00:02:24.610> these<00:02:25.000> set<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:25.420> hard

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
anybody's gonna tackle these set of hard

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.050 
anybody's gonna tackle these set of hard
problems<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.920> think<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.280> Palmer's<00:02:27.670> gonna<00:02:27.850> do

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
problems we think that Palmer's gonna do

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.410 
problems we think that Palmer's gonna do
it

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
it

this<00:02:30.970> big<00:02:31.209> starter<00:02:31.630> in<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.440> past<00:02:32.680> I've<00:02:32.950> looked

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
this big starter in the past I've looked

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.040 
this big starter in the past I've looked
at<00:02:33.280> these<00:02:33.400> VR<00:02:33.910> headsets<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.570> head<00:02:34.750> mounted

at these VR headsets and head mounted

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.470 
at these VR headsets and head mounted
displays<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.100> this<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.910> first<00:02:37.120> one<00:02:37.330> that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
displays and this is the first one that

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.850 
displays and this is the first one that
I've<00:02:37.630> seen<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.110> was<00:02:38.380> truly<00:02:38.650> impressed

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
I've seen that I was truly impressed

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.920 
I've seen that I was truly impressed
with<00:02:39.430> there's<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.180> lot<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.390> great<00:02:40.510> head<00:02:40.690> mounted

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
displays out there but they're all

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.479

you put it on your eyes and that just

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.780 
you put it on your eyes and that just

biggest problems with virtual reality up

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.430 
biggest problems with virtual reality up
to<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:20.680> point<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.220> latency<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.959> benefit<00:03:23.350> of

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
to this point is latency the benefit of

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.840 
to this point is latency the benefit of
the<00:03:23.530> rift<00:03:23.739> is<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.100> it's<00:03:24.220> designed<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.700> be

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
the rift is that it's designed to be

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.660 
the rift is that it's designed to be
really<00:03:25.360> really<00:03:25.750> low<00:03:25.990> latency<00:03:26.200> so<00:03:26.980> rather<00:03:27.370> than

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
really really low latency so rather than

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.420 
really really low latency so rather than
looking<00:03:28.570> like<00:03:28.840> this<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.680> turn<00:03:29.950> your<00:03:30.160> head

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
looking like this and you turn your head

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.830 
looking like this and you turn your head
and<00:03:30.640> then<00:03:30.760> it<00:03:30.880> follows

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
and then it follows

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.199 
and then it follows
it<00:03:32.050> actually<00:03:32.230> follows<00:03:32.860> with<00:03:33.160> your<00:03:33.400> view<00:03:33.700> no

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
it actually follows with your view no

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.360 
it actually follows with your view no
matter<00:03:34.239> what<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:34.810> do<00:03:34.989> there<00:03:35.739> are<00:03:35.769> two<00:03:35.980> reasons

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
matter what you do there are two reasons

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.089 
matter what you do there are two reasons
why<00:03:36.580> this<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.120> possible<00:03:37.750> now<00:03:37.930> with<00:03:38.379> oculus<00:03:38.890> is

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
why this is possible now with oculus is

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.070 
why this is possible now with oculus is
that<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.580> displays<00:03:39.970> are<00:03:40.180> very<00:03:40.390> high<00:03:40.569> density

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
that the displays are very high density

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.470 
that the displays are very high density
and<00:03:41.230> very<00:03:41.560> lightweight<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:42.459> are<00:03:42.940> very<00:03:43.090> small

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
and very lightweight and are very small

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.229 
and very lightweight and are very small
and<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.500> sensors<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:45.400> sense<00:03:45.790> your<00:03:46.090> head

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
and the sensors that sense your head

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.490 
and the sensors that sense your head
position<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.900> you're<00:03:47.019> turning<00:03:47.379> in<00:03:47.470> your

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
position and you're turning in your

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.440 
position and you're turning in your
virtual<00:03:47.830> environment<00:03:48.160> also<00:03:48.849> very<00:03:49.090> low<00:03:49.209> cost

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
virtual environment also very low cost

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.539 
virtual environment also very low cost
the<00:03:50.170> reason<00:03:50.379> we're<00:03:50.500> using<00:03:50.530> Kickstarter<00:03:50.890> is<00:03:51.400> so

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
the reason we're using Kickstarter is so

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.430 
the reason we're using Kickstarter is so
that<00:03:51.670> we<00:03:51.760> can<00:03:51.910> get<00:03:52.120> these<00:03:52.299> dev<00:03:52.569> kits<00:03:52.930> into<00:03:53.290> the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
that we can get these dev kits into the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.410 
that we can get these dev kits into the
hands<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:53.830> developers<00:03:53.920> as<00:03:54.459> fast<00:03:54.760> as<00:03:54.970> possible

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
hands of developers as fast as possible

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.360 
hands of developers as fast as possible
that<00:03:55.959> way<00:03:56.049> they<00:03:56.170> can<00:03:56.319> try<00:03:56.500> for<00:03:56.739> themselves<00:03:57.099> and

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
that way they can try for themselves and

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.160 
that way they can try for themselves and
start<00:03:58.030> integrating<00:03:58.209> support<00:03:58.810> into<00:03:59.049> their

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
start integrating support into their

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.229 
start integrating support into their
games<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.620> engines<00:03:59.950> we<00:04:00.819> really<00:04:01.090> need

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
games and engines we really need

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.119 
games and engines we really need
developer<00:04:01.750> feedback<00:04:02.170> so<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.650> we<00:04:02.739> can<00:04:02.950> make

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
developer feedback so that we can make

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.220 
developer feedback so that we can make
the<00:04:03.280> consumer<00:04:03.610> version<00:04:04.060> of<00:04:04.180> this<00:04:04.360> even<00:04:04.959> more

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
the consumer version of this even more

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.650 
the consumer version of this even more
incredible<00:04:05.799> than<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.130> already<00:04:06.250> is<00:04:06.459> I<00:04:06.910> mean<00:04:07.569> the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
incredible than it already is I mean the

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.729 
incredible than it already is I mean the
greatest<00:04:08.019> decay<00:04:08.440> is<00:04:08.739> simply<00:04:09.430> about<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:10.090> great

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
greatest decay is simply about a great

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.620 
greatest decay is simply about a great
developer<00:04:11.739> experience<00:04:11.849> where<00:04:12.849> and<00:04:13.329> they<00:04:13.480> get

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
developer experience where and they get

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.150 
developer experience where and they get
a<00:04:13.660> really<00:04:13.930> functional<00:04:14.260> piece<00:04:14.590> of<00:04:14.739> software

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
a really functional piece of software

a really functional piece of software
which<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.730> efficient<00:04:16.269> and<00:04:16.389> scales<00:04:16.780> with<00:04:16.959> a

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
which is efficient and scales with a
