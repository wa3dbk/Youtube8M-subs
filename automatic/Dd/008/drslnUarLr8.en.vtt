00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.910 
packs into and the weight of all that
together<00:00:22.300> is<00:00:22.630> about<00:00:22.720> a<00:00:22.840> thousand<00:00:23.350> grams<00:00:23.560> so

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
together is about a thousand grams so

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.230

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
hoop type pole so the first thing to do

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.310 
hoop type pole so the first thing to do
is<00:00:31.810> to<00:00:31.930> fit<00:00:32.200> that<00:00:32.439> to<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:34.030> retainers<00:00:34.600> at

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
is to fit that to the retainers at

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:43.770 
is to fit that to the retainers at
either<00:00:35.589> end<00:00:35.949> and<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:43.059> good<00:00:43.210> question<00:00:43.420> then

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
either end and it's a good question then

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.759 
either end and it's a good question then
of<00:00:44.079> fitting<00:00:44.440> these<00:00:44.589> clips<00:00:44.949> which<00:00:45.879> you<00:00:46.030> notice

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
of fitting these clips which you notice

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.860 
of fitting these clips which you notice
click<00:00:47.769> on<00:00:47.980> and<00:00:48.429> they<00:00:49.120> have<00:00:49.239> a<00:00:49.269> locking<00:00:49.570> action

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
click on and they have a locking action

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.160 
click on and they have a locking action
as<00:00:50.199> well<00:00:50.379> which<00:00:50.589> I've<00:00:51.359> not<00:00:52.359> seen<00:00:52.629> before<00:00:52.749> on<00:00:53.109> a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
as well which I've not seen before on a

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:17.550 
as well which I've not seen before on a
tent

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.230 

and<00:01:18.040> then<00:01:18.280> go<00:01:18.430> back<00:01:18.900> make<00:01:19.900> sure<00:01:20.820> there's<00:01:21.820> a<00:01:21.940> lot

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
and then go back make sure there's a lot

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.050 
and then go back make sure there's a lot
in<00:01:22.450> place

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.630 

there's<00:01:29.659> then<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:29.900> little<00:01:30.080> mini<00:01:30.350> poll<00:01:30.680> at<00:01:31.280> each

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
there's then a little mini poll at each

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.570 
there's then a little mini poll at each
end<00:01:31.940> of<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.090> tent<00:01:32.650> and<00:01:33.650> that's<00:01:33.860> a<00:01:33.979> key<00:01:34.159> part<00:01:34.369> of

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
end of the tent and that's a key part of

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.130 
end of the tent and that's a key part of
design<00:01:34.909> because<00:01:35.060> what<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.360> means<00:01:35.510> is<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.780> the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
design because what it means is that the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.100 
design because what it means is that the
the<00:01:36.409> ends<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.830> tent<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.600> have<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.630> sensible

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
the ends of the tent and have a sensible

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.530 
the ends of the tent and have a sensible
height<00:01:39.380> at<00:01:40.009> each<00:01:40.159> end<00:01:40.460> which<00:01:40.729> is<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:40.909> common

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
height at each end which is a common

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:50.109 
height at each end which is a common
fault<00:01:41.840> with<00:01:42.130> tents<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.250> this<00:01:43.369> type

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.690 

one<00:01:50.840> end<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:53.090> we<00:01:53.179> need<00:01:53.329> to<00:01:53.450> fit<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.630> other<00:01:53.750> one

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
one end and we need to fit the other one

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.490 
one end and we need to fit the other one
there's<00:01:55.700> then<00:01:55.969> an<00:01:56.179> identical<00:01:56.750> pole<00:01:56.960> that

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
there's then an identical pole that

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.830 
there's then an identical pole that
needs<00:01:57.679> to<00:01:57.740> be<00:01:57.770> fitted<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:59.329> other<00:01:59.479> end<00:01:59.689> of<00:01:59.750> the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
needs to be fitted the other end of the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.120 
needs to be fitted the other end of the
tent

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.830 

and<00:02:07.130> once<00:02:07.310> these<00:02:07.520> are<00:02:07.579> in<00:02:07.759> place<00:02:07.969> we<00:02:08.660> can<00:02:08.780> then

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
and once these are in place we can then

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.580 
and once these are in place we can then
move<00:02:09.080> on<00:02:09.319> to<00:02:09.349> erecting<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.129> tent<00:02:10.369> itself<00:02:11.590> now

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
move on to erecting the tent itself now

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.839 
move on to erecting the tent itself now
these<00:02:12.739> are<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.920> tent<00:02:13.160> pegs<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.549> come<00:02:13.700> with

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
these are the tent pegs that come with

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.670 
these are the tent pegs that come with
this<00:02:13.970> tent<00:02:14.239> we<00:02:14.959> often<00:02:15.260> sell<00:02:15.500> replacement

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
this tent we often sell replacement

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.190 
this tent we often sell replacement
titanium<00:02:16.519> tent<00:02:16.970> pegs<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.360> go<00:02:17.450> with<00:02:17.629> tents<00:02:17.930> but

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
titanium tent pegs to go with tents but

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.869 
titanium tent pegs to go with tents but
it's<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.799> first<00:02:18.920> time<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.340> I've<00:02:19.400> seen<00:02:19.700> where

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
it's the first time that I've seen where

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:20.860 
it's the first time that I've seen where
I<00:02:19.910> don't<00:02:20.120> think<00:02:20.239> we<00:02:20.360> doing<00:02:20.599> that<00:02:20.720> because

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
I don't think we doing that because

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.960 
I don't think we doing that because
that's<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.349> really<00:02:21.739> sensible<00:02:22.099> titanium<00:02:22.700> tent

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
that's a really sensible titanium tent

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.699 
that's a really sensible titanium tent
peg<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.390> no<00:02:24.200> need<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.440> replace<00:02:24.620> that

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
peg and no need to replace that

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.539 
peg and no need to replace that
whatsoever<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:26.150> basically<00:02:26.510> we<00:02:26.870> start<00:02:27.200> by

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
whatsoever so basically we start by

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.150 
whatsoever so basically we start by
staking<00:02:28.549> out<00:02:28.670> one<00:02:28.880> into<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.209> tent<00:02:30.160> through

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
staking out one into the tent through

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.839 
staking out one into the tent through
this<00:02:31.780> ring<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:34.069> then<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:34.340> can<00:02:34.519> move<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.760> the

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
this ring and then I can move to the

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.390 
this ring and then I can move to the
other<00:02:34.970> end<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.329> tent<00:02:35.599> and<00:02:36.010> PEG<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.220> one

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
other end of the tent and PEG that one

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.470 
other end of the tent and PEG that one
out

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:58.300 

at<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.630> stage<00:02:45.959> they

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.789
