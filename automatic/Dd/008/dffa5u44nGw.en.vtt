hi<00:00:05.790> everyone<00:00:05.970> in<00:00:06.210> last<00:00:06.359> video<00:00:06.600> we<00:00:06.750> talked<00:00:06.930> a

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
hi everyone in last video we talked a

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.690 
hi everyone in last video we talked a
little<00:00:07.080> bit<00:00:07.259> about<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.799> general<00:00:07.980> handling<00:00:08.490> of

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
little bit about the general handling of

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.430 
little bit about the general handling of
a<00:00:08.790> car<00:00:08.970> in<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.389> video<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.690> want<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.019> focus<00:00:10.139> more

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
a car in this video I want to focus more

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.490 
a car in this video I want to focus more
on<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.860> springs<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.610> shocks<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.150> car<00:00:12.500> one

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
on the springs and the shocks of car one

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.870 
on the springs and the shocks of car one
thing<00:00:13.650> though<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.980> forgot<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.580> mention<00:00:14.639> in

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
thing though that I forgot to mention in

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.609 
thing though that I forgot to mention in
the<00:00:14.940> first<00:00:15.089> video<00:00:15.210> I'll<00:00:16.080> actually<00:00:16.199> just<00:00:16.410> show

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
the first video I'll actually just show

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.570 
the first video I'll actually just show
you<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.100> hit<00:00:17.250> play<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.810> I<00:00:18.810> hit<00:00:19.199> f10<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.859> can

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
you so I hit play and I hit f10 I can

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.519 
you so I hit play and I hit f10 I can
actually<00:00:20.880> move<00:00:21.210> around<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.410> see

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
actually move around and you can see

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.740 
actually move around and you can see
that<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> tires<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.250> car<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:23.730> going<00:00:24.600> into

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
that the tires of the car are going into

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.359 
that the tires of the car are going into
the<00:00:24.900> ground<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.199> little<00:00:25.289> bit<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.160> reason

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
the ground a little bit and the reason

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.560 
the ground a little bit and the reason
for<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:27.210> haven't<00:00:27.359> actually

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
for this is that we haven't actually

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.859 
for this is that we haven't actually
specified<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:29.400> radius<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.880> tires<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.570> if

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
specified the radius of the tires so if

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.080 
specified the radius of the tires so if
you<00:00:31.349> bring<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.679> your<00:00:31.859> your<00:00:32.550> front<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.030> back

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
you bring up your your front and back

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.440 
you bring up your your front and back
wheel<00:00:33.860> you<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:34.890> see<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.340> there's<00:00:35.550> under

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
wheel you can see that there's under

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.610 
wheel you can see that there's under
under<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> wheel<00:00:37.079> there's<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.350> bunch<00:00:37.500> of

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
under the wheel there's a bunch of

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.229 
under the wheel there's a bunch of
properties<00:00:38.219> which<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.640> won't<00:00:38.790> really<00:00:38.879> get<00:00:39.059> into

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
properties which I won't really get into

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.319 
properties which I won't really get into
but<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.780> shape<00:00:40.110> radius<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:42.090> main<00:00:42.210> thing

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
but the shape radius is the main thing

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
but the shape radius is the main thing
that<00:00:42.450> we're<00:00:42.570> looking<00:00:42.629> at<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.520> you

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that we're looking at so if you if you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
that we're looking at so if you if you
find<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> blueprint<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.420> car<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.469> you

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
find the blueprint of your car and you

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.770 
find the blueprint of your car and you
drag<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.100> into<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.700> world<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.629> actually

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
drag it into the world you can actually

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.369 
drag it into the world you can actually
go<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:51.030> front<00:00:51.449> view<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:53.390> if<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.660> click

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
go to the front view and if you click

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.189 
go to the front view and if you click
and<00:00:55.500> drag<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.949> middle<00:00:56.160> mouse<00:00:56.399> button<00:00:57.199> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and drag the middle mouse button you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.889 
and drag the middle mouse button you
will<00:00:58.289> actually<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.949> measurement<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
will actually get a measurement of the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.560 
will actually get a measurement of the
radius<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.469> I'm<00:01:01.920> getting<00:01:02.219> 40<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.239> you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
radius so I'm getting 40 here but you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.420 
radius so I'm getting 40 here but you
can<00:01:03.690> see<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:03.960> snapping<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.439> grid<00:01:04.530> so

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
can see it's snapping to the grid so

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.620 
can see it's snapping to the grid so
it's<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.729> little<00:01:05.820> bit<00:01:06.000> less<00:01:06.090> than<00:01:06.240> 40<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.510> I'm

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
it's a little bit less than 40 so I'm

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.690 
it's a little bit less than 40 so I'm
just<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> call<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.140> 35

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
just going to call it 35

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.219 
just going to call it 35
so<00:01:08.700> I'll<00:01:09.270> set<00:01:09.630> 35<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> radius<00:01:11.990> for<00:01:12.990> both

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
so I'll set 35 to be the radius for both

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.700 
so I'll set 35 to be the radius for both
the<00:01:13.380> front<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.710> back<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:15.229> now<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.590> go

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the front in the back and now if I go

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.080 
the front in the back and now if I go
back<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.340> need<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.530> play<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
back here I need this if I play and I

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.570 
back here I need this if I play and I
hit<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> 10<00:01:21.930> now<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:23.009> see<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
hit a 10 now you can see if I go to the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.300 
hit a 10 now you can see if I go to the
side<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.479> car<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.799> tires<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.220> not

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
side the car the tires are not

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.830 
side the car the tires are not
penetrating<00:01:26.640> anymore<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.509> looks<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.780> lot

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
penetrating anymore so it looks a lot

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.990 
penetrating anymore so it looks a lot
better<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.710> that's<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.100> something<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.610> wanted

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
better so that's just something I wanted

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.690 
better so that's just something I wanted
to<00:01:30.119> mention<00:01:30.240> another<00:01:30.780> thing<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:32.189> between

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
to mention another thing is in between

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.550 
to mention another thing is in between
the<00:01:32.909> toriel<00:01:33.689> videos<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.229> added<00:01:34.380> this

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the toriel videos I just added this

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.910 
the toriel videos I just added this
little<00:01:34.710> ramp<00:01:35.070> here<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.560> BSP

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
little ramp here so this is just a BSP

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.340 
little ramp here so this is just a BSP
box<00:01:38.130> which<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.610> 2,000<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.450> X<00:01:39.600> 500<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
box which is 2,000 and the X 500 and the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.149 
box which is 2,000 and the X 500 and the
Y<00:01:40.549> and<00:01:41.570> rotated<00:01:42.570> 10<00:01:42.780> degrees<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.890> we'll<00:01:44.040> get

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
Y and rotated 10 degrees but we'll get

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.859 
Y and rotated 10 degrees but we'll get
to<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.640> bit<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.689> first

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
to that in a little bit so the first

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.740 
to that in a little bit so the first
thing<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:45.990> wanna<00:01:46.110> look<00:01:46.200> at<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.430> shocks<00:01:47.790> so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
thing I wanna look at is the shocks so

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.649 
thing I wanna look at is the shocks so
to<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.009> I'm<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> take<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.060> player

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
to do this I'm going to take the player

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.300 
to do this I'm going to take the player
start<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.350> set<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> Z<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.210> 500<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:56.070> now<00:01:56.159> if<00:01:56.219> I

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
start and set the Z to 500 so now if I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.249 
start and set the Z to 500 so now if I
play<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.270> see<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.420> car<00:01:57.600> falls<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
play you can see the car falls to the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.109 
play you can see the car falls to the
ground<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.770> doesn't<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.490> bounce<00:01:59.790> or

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
ground and doesn't really bounce or

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.459 
ground and doesn't really bounce or
anything<00:02:00.270> which<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.229> would<00:02:01.320> expect

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
anything which is what I would expect

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.270 
anything which is what I would expect
from<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.549> normal<00:02:03.200> regularly<00:02:04.200> tuned<00:02:04.439> car<00:02:04.680> but

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
from a normal regularly tuned car but

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.709 
from a normal regularly tuned car but
let's<00:02:05.460> make<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> little<00:02:06.329> bit<00:02:06.479> more

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
let's make this a little bit more

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.240 
let's make this a little bit more
exaggerated<00:02:07.140> if<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.770> go<00:02:07.860> into<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.129> V

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
exaggerated if if you go into the V

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.460 
exaggerated if if you go into the V
tires<00:02:08.580> under<00:02:09.420> suspension<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.080> can<00:02:10.229> actually

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
tires under suspension you can actually

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.540 
tires under suspension you can actually
see<00:02:10.649> there's<00:02:10.920> this

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
see there's this

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.610 
see there's this
suspension<00:02:11.970> max<00:02:12.180> drop<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:13.020> wettest<00:02:13.230> works<00:02:13.410> is

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
suspension max drop the wettest works is

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.330 
suspension max drop the wettest works is
it's<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.840> distance<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:17.070> tire

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
it's the it's the distance that the tire

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.820 
it's the it's the distance that the tire
can<00:02:17.580> drop<00:02:17.820> past<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:19.050> resting<00:02:19.440> point<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.770> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
can drop past the resting point of the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.830 
can drop past the resting point of the
resting<00:02:20.070> point<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.400> tire<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.850> just<00:02:21.210> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
resting point of the tire is just the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.050 
resting point of the tire is just the
skeleton<00:02:22.290> position<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.430> tire<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:23.820> it

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
skeleton position of the tire so it

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.540 
skeleton position of the tire so it
might<00:02:24.780> be<00:02:24.840> easier<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.380> see<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.100> set

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
might be easier to see if I just set

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.410 
might be easier to see if I just set
this<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.790> something<00:02:26.970> like<00:02:27.180> 100<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:29.180> 100<00:02:30.180> for

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
this to something like 100 and 100 for

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.110 
this to something like 100 and 100 for
both<00:02:30.630> from<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.960> back<00:02:31.110> now<00:02:31.650> if<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.860> hit<00:02:31.980> play<00:02:32.250> you

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
both from the back now if I hit play you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.850 
both from the back now if I hit play you
can<00:02:33.270> see<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.690> tires<00:02:33.960> actually<00:02:34.440> extend

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
can see that the tires actually extend

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.580 
can see that the tires actually extend
100<00:02:35.310> centimeters<00:02:35.880> below<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.290> resting

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
100 centimeters below the the resting

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.550 
100 centimeters below the the resting
position<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.450> another<00:02:39.720> thing<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.960> can<00:02:40.290> see<00:02:40.410> is

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
position so another thing you can see is

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.560 
position so another thing you can see is
that<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.070> car<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:42.030> spring<00:02:42.300> it

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
that the the car the spring it

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.190 
that the the car the spring it
compresses<00:02:43.110> quite<00:02:43.410> gradually<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:45.020> we<00:02:46.020> can

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
compresses quite gradually but we can

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.230 
compresses quite gradually but we can
actually<00:02:46.320> change<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.010> if<00:02:47.820> we<00:02:47.910> go<00:02:48.060> and

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
actually change this so if we go and

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.700 
actually change this so if we go and
look<00:02:48.330> at<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.570> suspension<00:02:48.900> damping<00:02:49.440> ratio

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
look at the suspension damping ratio

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.320 
look at the suspension damping ratio
this<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:50.070> gives<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.340> how<00:02:50.790> much<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.090> spring

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
this just gives you how much the spring

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.900 
this just gives you how much the spring
is<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.750> going<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.140> damp<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:52.560> if<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:53.160> if<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.670> make<00:02:53.820> it

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
is is going to damp so if I if I make it

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.780 
is is going to damp so if I if I make it
a<00:02:53.970> smaller<00:02:54.330> value<00:02:54.570> like<00:02:54.870> 0.5<00:02:56.750> then<00:02:58.670> they'll<00:02:59.670> be

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
a smaller value like 0.5 then they'll be

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.610 
a smaller value like 0.5 then they'll be
much<00:02:59.940> less<00:03:00.150> damping<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:01.260> can<00:03:01.410> see<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
much less damping and you can see the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.750 
much less damping and you can see the
car<00:03:01.860> Falls<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:02.910> bit<00:03:03.150> faster<00:03:04.310> similarly<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.520> if

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
car Falls a bit faster similarly if I if

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.920 
car Falls a bit faster similarly if I if
I<00:03:05.850> make<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.150> very<00:03:07.110> big<00:03:10.010> now<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:12.600> compresses

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
I make this very big now it compresses

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.310 
I make this very big now it compresses
you<00:03:13.140> more<00:03:13.380> gradually<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:15.000> next<00:03:15.240> let's<00:03:16.200> just

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
you more gradually the next let's just

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.900 
you more gradually the next let's just
set<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.470> back<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.680> one<00:03:16.890> note<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.580> next<00:03:17.670> thing

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
set this back to one note the next thing

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.570 
set this back to one note the next thing
that<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.060> want<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:18.300> look<00:03:18.390> at<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.580> suspension

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
that I want to look at is the suspension

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.310 
that I want to look at is the suspension
max<00:03:20.880> rate<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:21.330> is<00:03:21.450> pretty<00:03:22.050> much<00:03:22.170> exactly

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
max rate so this is pretty much exactly

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.170 
max rate so this is pretty much exactly
the<00:03:22.620> same<00:03:22.709> as<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.160> max<00:03:23.340> drop<00:03:23.550> except<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
the same as the max drop except in the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.020 
the same as the max drop except in the
opposite<00:03:24.390> direction<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.800> how<00:03:25.980> far<00:03:26.280> up

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
opposite direction so this is how far up

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.630 
opposite direction so this is how far up
the<00:03:27.810> tire<00:03:27.990> can<00:03:28.170> go<00:03:28.260> past<00:03:28.560> its<00:03:29.100> resting<00:03:29.520> point

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
the tire can go past its resting point

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.230 
the tire can go past its resting point
so<00:03:29.850> if<00:03:29.910> we<00:03:30.000> make<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.270> 100<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:33.150> 100<00:03:35.240> hit

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
so if we make this 100 and this 100 hit

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.180 
so if we make this 100 and this 100 hit
play<00:03:36.540> now<00:03:39.080> actually<00:03:40.080> to<00:03:40.530> really<00:03:40.890> be<00:03:41.010> able<00:03:41.070> to

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
play now actually to really be able to

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.740 
play now actually to really be able to
see<00:03:41.310> this<00:03:41.400> we<00:03:41.520> need<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.760> reduce<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.450> damping

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
see this we need to reduce the damping

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.990 
see this we need to reduce the damping
rate<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:42.990> let's<00:03:43.140> set<00:03:43.320> this<00:03:43.410> back<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.740> 0.55<00:03:47.000> so

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
rate so let's set this back to 0.55 so

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.679 
rate so let's set this back to 0.55 so
now

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:49.689 
now

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.600 
now
the<00:03:50.049> problem<00:03:50.349> now<00:03:50.530> is<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.310> body<00:03:51.489> of

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
the problem now is that the the body of

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.679 
the problem now is that the the body of
the<00:03:51.670> car<00:03:51.849> is<00:03:51.879> actually<00:03:52.060> hitting<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.480> ground

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:52.689 
the car is actually hitting the ground

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.259 
the car is actually hitting the ground
so<00:03:53.079> to<00:03:53.110> fix<00:03:53.439> that<00:03:53.560> I'm<00:03:54.489> just<00:03:54.909> going<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.060> bring

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
so to fix that I'm just going to bring

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.149 
so to fix that I'm just going to bring
up<00:03:55.420> my<00:03:55.859> physics<00:03:56.859> asset<00:03:57.219> car<00:03:57.879> and<00:03:58.920> just<00:03:59.920> for<00:04:00.069> now

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
up my physics asset car and just for now

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.559 
up my physics asset car and just for now
so<00:04:00.400> that<00:04:00.459> we<00:04:00.609> can<00:04:00.760> see<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.299> little<00:04:01.420> bit

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
so that we can see this a little bit

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.380 
so that we can see this a little bit
better<00:04:02.069> I'm<00:04:03.069> just<00:04:03.370> going<00:04:03.609> to<00:04:03.640> uh<00:04:03.700> just<00:04:03.909> hit<00:04:04.030> W

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
better I'm just going to uh just hit W

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.509 
better I'm just going to uh just hit W
there<00:04:04.569> I'm<00:04:04.689> just<00:04:04.780> going<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.019> bring<00:04:05.200> up<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:06.129> the

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
there I'm just going to bring up the the

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.360 
there I'm just going to bring up the the
body<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.090> that<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.989> car<00:04:08.200> can<00:04:08.470> drop<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.099> little

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
body so that the car can drop a little

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.860 
body so that the car can drop a little
bit<00:04:09.489> more<00:04:09.670> so<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.060> can<00:04:10.120> actually<00:04:10.269> see<00:04:10.599> the

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
bit more so you can actually see the

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.569 
bit more so you can actually see the
tires<00:04:11.170> going<00:04:11.560> through<00:04:12.099> through<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.090> measure

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
tires going through through the measure

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.909 
tires going through through the measure
so<00:04:15.579> the<00:04:16.389> other<00:04:16.750> thing<00:04:16.989> is<00:04:17.289> you<00:04:17.620> have<00:04:17.650> this

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
so the other thing is you have this

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.259 
so the other thing is you have this
natural<00:04:18.310> frequency<00:04:18.850> which<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.000> can<00:04:19.150> play

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
natural frequency which you can play

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.230 
natural frequency which you can play
with<00:04:19.389> so<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:20.139> higher<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.350> number<00:04:21.039> the<00:04:21.240> sort

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
with so the higher the number the sort

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.580 
with so the higher the number the sort
of<00:04:22.270> faster<00:04:22.810> this<00:04:23.080> spring<00:04:23.320> is<00:04:23.410> going<00:04:23.470> to

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
of faster this spring is going to

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.719 
of faster this spring is going to
oscillate<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.550> if<00:04:24.669> I<00:04:24.759> make<00:04:24.880> this<00:04:24.910> fifteen<00:04:26.729> you

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
oscillate so if I make this fifteen you

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.700 
oscillate so if I make this fifteen you
can<00:04:27.849> see<00:04:28.000> it's<00:04:28.180> it's<00:04:28.539> much<00:04:28.750> faster<00:04:28.960> if<00:04:29.440> I<00:04:29.560> make

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
can see it's it's much faster if I make

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.730 
can see it's it's much faster if I make
it<00:04:29.830> very<00:04:29.889> low<00:04:30.990> actually<00:04:31.990> just<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:32.380> see<00:04:32.620> what

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
it very low actually just to see what

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.589 
it very low actually just to see what
happens<00:04:32.979> you<00:04:33.430> can<00:04:33.580> also<00:04:33.669> play<00:04:33.910> with<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.539> know

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
happens you can also play with you know

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:35.580 
happens you can also play with you know
the<00:04:34.690> front<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:34.960> back<00:04:35.050> they<00:04:35.229> don't<00:04:35.289> have<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.500> be

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
the front the back they don't have to be

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.670 
the front the back they don't have to be
the<00:04:35.680> same<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:36.009> if<00:04:36.580> I<00:04:36.669> make<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.910> front<00:04:37.349> very<00:04:38.349> low

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
the same so if I make the front very low

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.129 
the same so if I make the front very low
and<00:04:38.919> in<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.580> back<00:04:39.759> very<00:04:39.970> high<00:04:40.180> you'll<00:04:40.720> see

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
and in the back very high you'll see

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.909 
and in the back very high you'll see
some<00:04:41.380> interesting<00:04:42.280> effect<00:04:42.729> yeah<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:43.919> anyway

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
some interesting effect yeah so anyway

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:45.870 
some interesting effect yeah so anyway
so<00:04:44.979> that's<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:45.460> can<00:04:45.580> play<00:04:45.699> with<00:04:45.820> all

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
so that's that you can play with all

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.850 
so that's that you can play with all
these<00:04:45.970> values<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:46.509> see<00:04:47.349> what<00:04:47.440> you<00:04:47.500> like<00:04:47.530> I'm

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
these values and see what you like I'm

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.100 
these values and see what you like I'm
just<00:04:48.009> going<00:04:48.130> to<00:04:48.389> bring<00:04:49.389> these<00:04:49.539> all<00:04:49.690> back<00:04:49.870> down

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
just going to bring these all back down

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.730 
just going to bring these all back down
to<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.380> way<00:04:50.470> they<00:04:50.560> work<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:51.990> I've<00:04:52.990> also<00:04:53.259> I've

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
to the way they work and I've also I've

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.760 
to the way they work and I've also I've
also<00:04:53.919> changed<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.760> I'll<00:04:55.300> be<00:04:55.599> back<00:04:56.139> to<00:04:56.380> the

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
also changed the I'll be back to the

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.860 
also changed the I'll be back to the
default<00:04:57.099> values<00:04:57.370> just<00:04:57.639> in<00:04:57.970> case<00:04:58.180> from<00:04:58.659> last

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
default values just in case from last

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.740 
default values just in case from last
video<00:04:59.139> you<00:04:59.199> still<00:04:59.530> have<00:04:59.620> some<00:05:00.389> strings<00:05:01.389> up<00:05:01.570> and

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
video you still have some strings up and

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.420 
video you still have some strings up and
let<00:05:02.199> me<00:05:02.289> actually<00:05:02.409> reset<00:05:03.310> this<00:05:03.460> so<00:05:03.880> Oh<00:05:05.430> pick

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
let me actually reset this so Oh pick

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.900 
let me actually reset this so Oh pick
box

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
box

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.540 
box
okay<00:05:09.540> so<00:05:09.780> now<00:05:09.930> we<00:05:10.020> are<00:05:10.320> back<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.950> our<00:05:11.310> normal

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
okay so now we are back to our normal

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.270 
okay so now we are back to our normal
card<00:05:11.990> now<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.680> next<00:05:13.890> thing<00:05:13.950> I<00:05:14.040> want<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.190> talk

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
card now the next thing I want to talk

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.910 
card now the next thing I want to talk
about<00:05:14.520> is<00:05:14.760> the<00:05:15.030> moment<00:05:15.540> of<00:05:15.630> inertia<00:05:15.810> so<00:05:16.200> if<00:05:16.800> I

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
about is the moment of inertia so if I

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.280 
about is the moment of inertia so if I
go<00:05:17.070> off<00:05:17.160> this<00:05:17.310> ramp<00:05:17.780> you<00:05:18.780> can<00:05:18.900> see<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.080> car

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
go off this ramp you can see the car

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.160 
go off this ramp you can see the car
kind<00:05:19.650> of<00:05:19.770> tilts<00:05:20.100> forward<00:05:20.310> a<00:05:20.490> little<00:05:20.640> bit<00:05:21.170> and

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
kind of tilts forward a little bit and

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.110 
kind of tilts forward a little bit and
you<00:05:22.800> know<00:05:22.830> in<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:23.400> lot<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.550> racing<00:05:23.850> games<00:05:23.880> you

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
you know in a lot of racing games you

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.400 
you know in a lot of racing games you
don't<00:05:24.210> want<00:05:24.420> that<00:05:24.510> you<00:05:24.570> want<00:05:24.810> to<00:05:24.870> have<00:05:24.960> a<00:05:24.990> nice

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
don't want that you want to have a nice

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.780 
don't want that you want to have a nice
sort<00:05:26.160> of<00:05:26.190> arc<00:05:26.490> so<00:05:27.330> one<00:05:27.780> way<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:27.930> fix<00:05:28.110> that<00:05:28.290> is<00:05:28.500> to

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
sort of arc so one way to fix that is to

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.420 
sort of arc so one way to fix that is to
bring<00:05:29.790> up<00:05:29.940> your<00:05:30.090> car<00:05:30.500> go<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.560> defaults<00:05:32.010> and<00:05:32.190> if

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
bring up your car go to defaults and if

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.300 
bring up your car go to defaults and if
you<00:05:32.520> search<00:05:32.670> for<00:05:32.700> inertia<00:05:33.890> you<00:05:34.890> can<00:05:35.040> see<00:05:35.190> this

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
you search for inertia you can see this

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.800 
you search for inertia you can see this
so<00:05:35.490> we<00:05:35.580> talked<00:05:35.760> about<00:05:35.940> this<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.300> little<00:05:36.450> bit<00:05:36.660> in

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
so we talked about this a little bit in

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.320 
so we talked about this a little bit in
previous<00:05:37.230> video<00:05:37.440> but<00:05:37.620> just<00:05:37.650> to<00:05:37.890> recap<00:05:38.330> this

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
previous video but just to recap this

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.880 
previous video but just to recap this
just<00:05:39.540> represents<00:05:39.630> how<00:05:40.200> hard<00:05:40.440> it<00:05:40.530> is<00:05:40.590> to<00:05:40.650> rotate

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
just represents how hard it is to rotate

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.060 
just represents how hard it is to rotate
along<00:05:41.340> each<00:05:41.550> axis<00:05:41.730> so<00:05:42.270> the<00:05:43.080> y-axis<00:05:43.620> if<00:05:43.860> you

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
along each axis so the y-axis if you

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.260 
along each axis so the y-axis if you
look<00:05:44.670> at<00:05:44.760> component<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:47.250> Z<00:05:47.430> the<00:05:47.730> sardis

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
look at component the Z the sardis

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.690 
look at component the Z the sardis
x-axis<00:05:49.230> is<00:05:49.380> going<00:05:49.410> forward<00:05:49.890> the<00:05:50.100> z<00:05:50.280> axis<00:05:50.520> going

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
x-axis is going forward the z axis going

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.050 
x-axis is going forward the z axis going
up<00:05:50.850> and<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.390> y-axis<00:05:51.660> is<00:05:52.050> sort<00:05:52.470> of<00:05:52.550> going<00:05:53.550> this

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
up and the y-axis is sort of going this

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.420 
up and the y-axis is sort of going this
way<00:05:54.240> so<00:05:54.810> what<00:05:55.620> would<00:05:55.680> be<00:05:55.740> nice<00:05:55.890> is<00:05:55.950> if<00:05:56.100> we<00:05:56.280> made

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
way so what would be nice is if we made

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.210 
way so what would be nice is if we made
it<00:05:56.550> hard<00:05:56.730> for<00:05:56.790> the<00:05:56.970> car<00:05:57.090> to<00:05:57.210> rotate<00:05:57.540> this<00:05:57.900> way

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
it hard for the car to rotate this way

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.970 
it hard for the car to rotate this way
it<00:05:59.220> would<00:05:59.370> make<00:05:59.520> it<00:06:00.030> would<00:06:00.120> make<00:06:00.240> it<00:06:00.830> give<00:06:01.830> us<00:06:01.860> a

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
it would make it would make it give us a

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.590 
it would make it would make it give us a
cogniser<00:06:02.250> arc<00:06:02.520> so<00:06:02.760> we<00:06:03.300> said<00:06:03.450> this<00:06:03.540> is

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
cogniser arc so we said this is

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.140 
cogniser arc so we said this is
something<00:06:03.840> like<00:06:04.020> five<00:06:04.350> and<00:06:05.390> now<00:06:06.390> we<00:06:06.450> start<00:06:08.150> now

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
something like five and now we start now

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.070 
something like five and now we start now
if<00:06:09.540> I<00:06:09.630> go<00:06:09.750> off<00:06:09.870> this<00:06:09.960> ramp

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.010 

you<00:06:15.590> can<00:06:15.710> see<00:06:15.830> the<00:06:15.949> car<00:06:16.720> rotates<00:06:17.720> a<00:06:17.780> little<00:06:17.930> bit

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
you can see the car rotates a little bit

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.869 
you can see the car rotates a little bit
differently<00:06:18.259> I<00:06:18.439> mean<00:06:18.740> you<00:06:19.039> you<00:06:19.460> can<00:06:19.610> also<00:06:19.699> see

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:19.879 
differently I mean you you can also see

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.670 
differently I mean you you can also see
the<00:06:20.060> side<00:06:20.419> effect<00:06:20.659> which<00:06:20.810> is<00:06:20.840> that<00:06:21.169> when<00:06:21.560> it

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
the side effect which is that when it

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.230 
the side effect which is that when it
tilts<00:06:22.009> forward<00:06:22.189> and<00:06:22.460> then<00:06:22.550> takes<00:06:22.729> longer<00:06:23.090> for

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
tilts forward and then takes longer for

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.700 
tilts forward and then takes longer for
it<00:06:23.270> to<00:06:23.360> tilt<00:06:23.599> backwards<00:06:23.810> so<00:06:24.110> you<00:06:24.349> obviously

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
it to tilt backwards so you obviously

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.140 
it to tilt backwards so you obviously
want<00:06:25.069> to<00:06:25.129> player<00:06:25.550> on<00:06:25.669> with<00:06:25.759> these<00:06:25.849> settings

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
want to player on with these settings

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.309 
want to player on with these settings
but<00:06:26.710> it's<00:06:27.710> still<00:06:28.580> very<00:06:28.819> powerful<00:06:28.939> and<00:06:29.479> will

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 
but it's still very powerful and will

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:32.110 
but it's still very powerful and will
allow<00:06:30.830> you<00:06:30.889> to<00:06:31.039> get<00:06:31.189> any<00:06:31.430> sort<00:06:31.639> of<00:06:31.699> effect<00:06:32.000> that

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
allow you to get any sort of effect that

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.540 
allow you to get any sort of effect that
your<00:06:32.389> you're<00:06:32.870> going<00:06:33.050> so<00:06:33.830> that's<00:06:34.280> it<00:06:34.400> for

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
your you're going so that's it for

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.790 
your you're going so that's it for
shocks<00:06:34.969> and<00:06:35.120> springs<00:06:35.180> and<00:06:35.569> I<00:06:36.229> think<00:06:36.680> this

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
shocks and springs and I think this

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.679 
shocks and springs and I think this
actually<00:06:36.919> will<00:06:37.189> wrap<00:06:37.400> up<00:06:37.430> these<00:06:38.090> car<00:06:38.389> videos

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:38.689 
actually will wrap up these car videos

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:40.360 
actually will wrap up these car videos
for<00:06:38.870> now<00:06:38.990> if<00:06:39.259> you<00:06:39.319> have<00:06:39.530> any<00:06:39.830> more<00:06:39.979> questions

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
for now if you have any more questions

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.700 
for now if you have any more questions
