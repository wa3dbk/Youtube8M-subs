in the news however the second phase
which<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.689> about<00:02:04.110> where<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> came<00:02:04.560> into<00:02:05.009> the

which is about where I came into the
picture<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:06.270> remember<00:02:06.960> Mike<00:02:07.140> Maloney<00:02:07.500> putting

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
picture I remember Mike Maloney putting

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.050 
picture I remember Mike Maloney putting
out<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> video<00:02:08.099> he<00:02:08.429> said<00:02:08.640> yeah<00:02:08.819> we've

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
out a video he said yeah we've

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.350 
out a video he said yeah we've
officially<00:02:09.750> ended<00:02:10.289> phase<00:02:10.500> 1<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:12.090> are<00:02:12.180> now

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
officially ended phase 1 and we are now

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.610 
officially ended phase 1 and we are now
in<00:02:12.540> phase<00:02:12.780> 2<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.379> he

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
in phase 2 and he

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.020 
in phase 2 and he
was<00:02:13.709> saying<00:02:13.920> how<00:02:14.159> he<00:02:14.220> wished<00:02:14.549> it<00:02:14.700> was<00:02:14.760> still

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
was saying how he wished it was still

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.740 
was saying how he wished it was still
faced<00:02:15.239> one<00:02:15.569> so<00:02:15.750> he<00:02:15.840> could<00:02:15.989> buy<00:02:16.110> more<00:02:16.349> metal

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
faced one so he could buy more metal

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.059 
faced one so he could buy more metal
that's<00:02:18.750> typically<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.409> second<00:02:19.890> phase<00:02:20.040> is

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
that's typically the second phase is

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.550 
that's typically the second phase is
typically<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.879> longest<00:02:21.450> phase<00:02:21.659> and<00:02:22.049> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
typically the longest phase and the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.809 
typically the longest phase and the
phase<00:02:22.799> where<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.129> going<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.430> your<00:02:23.489> most

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
phase where you going to get your most

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.630 
phase where you going to get your most
gains<00:02:24.150> then<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:24.989> have<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> third<00:02:25.560> phase<00:02:25.920> so

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
gains then you have the third phase so

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.610 
gains then you have the third phase so
you're<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.269> your<00:02:27.480> you're<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:27.900> your<00:02:28.110> first

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599

it's<00:02:30.840> brick<00:02:31.049> it<00:02:31.200> breaks<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.739> trend<00:02:32.040> line<00:02:32.250> and

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
it's brick it breaks that trend line and

it's<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.650> weird<00:02:43.650> thing<00:02:43.890> there<00:02:44.269> so<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:46.079> have

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it's a weird thing there so you have

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.180 
it's a weird thing there so you have
quite<00:02:46.410> accumulation<00:02:48.319> you<00:02:49.319> have<00:02:49.500> second<00:02:50.040> phase

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
quite accumulation you have second phase

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.949 
quite accumulation you have second phase
works<00:02:50.549> which<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.060> usually<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.420> longest<00:02:51.810> and

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
works which is usually the longest and

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.720

most<00:02:51.989> gross<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.620> growth<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.129> then<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.549> have

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
most gross the growth and then you have

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.759 
most gross the growth and then you have
the<00:02:53.849> third<00:02:54.060> phase<00:02:54.359> where<00:02:55.109> most<00:02:55.319> of<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.500> sheep

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
the third phase where most of the sheep

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.220 
the third phase where most of the sheep
will<00:02:55.950> get<00:02:56.099> in<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.519> they've<00:02:57.329> gotten<00:02:57.720> into<00:02:57.989> late

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
will get in and they've gotten into late

real<00:03:35.639> unusual<00:03:35.849> for<00:03:36.389> me<00:03:36.480> because<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:36.840> knew<00:03:36.959> what

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
real unusual for me because I knew what

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.990 
real unusual for me because I knew what
the<00:03:37.169> market<00:03:37.500> would<00:03:37.560> hold<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.220> whatnot

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
the market would hold and and whatnot

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.520 
the market would hold and and whatnot
and<00:03:39.090> these<00:03:39.209> weren't<00:03:39.419> high<00:03:39.660> end<00:03:39.870> cars<00:03:40.139> by<00:03:40.319> any

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
and these weren't high end cars by any

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.780 
and these weren't high end cars by any
means<00:03:40.709> these<00:03:40.859> were<00:03:40.980> just<00:03:41.099> cars<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.549> you<00:03:41.669> know

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
means these were just cars that you know

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.150 
means these were just cars that you know
their<00:03:42.000> average<00:03:42.569> Joe<00:03:42.750> would<00:03:42.900> drive<00:03:43.109> but<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:44.129> I

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
their average Joe would drive but so I

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.180 
their average Joe would drive but so I
guess<00:03:44.430> today's<00:03:44.940> video<00:03:45.239> is<00:03:45.329> this<00:03:46.010> I've<00:03:47.010> already

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
guess today's video is this I've already

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.530 
guess today's video is this I've already
made<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.430> few<00:03:47.609> phone<00:03:47.819> calls<00:03:47.879> with<00:03:48.239> people<00:03:48.480> that

that I would have doubled it I wish I
would<00:04:15.569> have<00:04:15.599> doubled<00:04:15.840> down<00:04:16.039> it's<00:04:17.039> just<00:04:17.160> not<00:04:17.459> in

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
would have doubled down it's just not in

would have doubled down it's just not in
the<00:04:17.609> cards<00:04:17.760> for<00:04:17.970> me<00:04:18.120> right<00:04:18.359> now<00:04:19.579> it<00:04:20.579> may<00:04:20.789> be<00:04:20.849> in

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
the cards for me right now it may be in

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.909 
the cards for me right now it may be in
the<00:04:21.090> future<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.479> some<00:04:21.659> changes<00:04:22.140> but<00:04:22.169> right<00:04:22.680> now

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
the future of some changes but right now

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.760 
the future of some changes but right now
I'm<00:04:23.280> thinking<00:04:23.969> that<00:04:24.360> it's<00:04:24.539> you<00:04:25.440> know<00:04:25.469> we're

I'm thinking that it's you know we're

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.370 
I'm thinking that it's you know we're
we're

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
we're

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.300 
we're
we're<00:04:26.470> probably<00:04:26.650> going<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:26.920> hit<00:04:27.040> somewhere

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
we're probably going to hit somewhere

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.950 
we're probably going to hit somewhere
around<00:04:27.400> 30<00:04:27.790> bucks<00:04:28.030> before<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.570> first<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:28.870> the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
around 30 bucks before the first of the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.670 
around 30 bucks before the first of the
year<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:31.080> we'll<00:04:32.080> just<00:04:32.140> have<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.410> see<00:04:32.440> what

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
year and we'll just have to see what

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.620 
year and we'll just have to see what
happens<00:04:32.980> from<00:04:33.010> there<00:04:33.160> but<00:04:33.640> I'm<00:04:34.090> telling<00:04:34.270> you

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630
