00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 this place is very feared by many and it is 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.290
 the most terrible place we have ever been 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.320
 we have imagined I am talking about the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.410
 hell so here I show you 20 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.020
 strange curiosities of hell the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.880
 hell according to the Catholic religion is 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.949
 the place where is satan with two 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.039
 demons that were expelled from 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.529
 paradise according to the Catholic religion the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.050
 going to hell you get it when doing 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.449
 bad things in your life and for the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.210
 otherwise, if you do good, you go to 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.370
 paradise although they do not create it according to the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.260
 Catholic religion when you die 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.480
 soul does not go directly to heaven or to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.520
 hell if you do not go to a place where 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.370
 they were waiting for the coming of 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.420
 Jesus Christ to know where 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.670
 they have to go to heaven or hell according to 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.379
 the descriptions of dante hell 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 It is made up of nine circles 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.000
 concentric that are shrinking and 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.250
 burying more deeply in 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.500
 direction to the center of the earth the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.080
 condemnation in each of them will depend 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.480
 of the sins that have been committed with 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.240
 circles dedicated to buttons 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.250
 the heretics to the scammers and so on 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.350
 the modern version of hell is 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.020
 probably the legacy of the English poet 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.270
 john milton that in paradise lost 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.150
 describes hell as a big furnace 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.850
 whose flames do not offer any light but 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.340
 rather a visible darkness the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.020
 hell is fixed penalty but the fruit of 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.140
 the bad decisions made during 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.670
 our lives in the middle ages' the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.160
 people thought that hell was 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.230
 underground and there were legends of travelers 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.260
 who claimed to have seen smoke through 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.880
 of soil holes currently 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.220
 people believe that hell is in 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.680
 the earth and it is not since it is in a 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.820
 dimensional plane ordered the next 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.920
 earth hell way and sky all 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.500
 prayer of a believer goes through the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.230
 hell to get to heaven and this is 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.410
 does when it's in good faith and with a lot 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.680
 for him according to hell 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.740

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.899

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.010
 has a river of blood boiling for 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.769
 the people guilty of spill 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.349
 of blood tombs of fire for the 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.760
 heretics and a desert where it rains 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:24.220
 of fire on blasphemous usurers and 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.530
 homosexuals according to dante they claim that 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.799
 for the devil hell is always a 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.260

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.780
 have bought the episcopal office of 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.989
 according to dante hell is full 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.659
 of creatures of pagan mythology 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.450
 Dante sees centaurs and squirrels in 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:52.329
 minotaur and beer the three dog 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.099
 heads et cetera in hell there 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.379
 someone who is waiting to get to 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.260
 our world to make us believe that he 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.079
 is god and this is the antichrist the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.000
 pandemonium word that means all 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.400
 the demons it is a word 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.019
 invented by john milton a poet 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.750
 English to refer to the city 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.609
 capital of hell where satan and 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.430
 his followers gather in a 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.450
 infernal parliament milito also minted 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.270
 the phrase 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.090
 it unleashed the hell he was not referring 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.090
 originally to noisy chaos but to the 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.000
 demons that fled in paradise lost 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.340
 a poem by john milton says that in the 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.860
 hell there are nine doors three of 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.470

 sin death and the dogs of 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.599
 hell according to the Christians the bible 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.790
 it refers to hell and its fire but 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.310
 many of the details are from dante and 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.830
 have been drawn from the Greek myths and 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.250
 Romans in the Bible of the Evangelicals 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.709
 there are 15 verses in which they speak of 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.930
 hell and ended with a video in the 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.030
 which can be heard the cries of the 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.280
 people who are in hell and what 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.790
 they knew and they recorded investigators 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.000
 Russians if you want to hear it below you have the
