coming<00:01:43.439> up

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
coming up

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.120 
coming up
take<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> block<00:01:45.780> would<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.679> see<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:47.009> have

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
take the block would you see I do have

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.249 
take the block would you see I do have
this<00:01:47.369> rent<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> stand<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.539> it<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> strapped

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
this rent on a stand and it is strapped

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.559 
this rent on a stand and it is strapped
down<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.069> stand<00:01:50.429> in<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> car<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> lot

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
down to the stand in the car it's a lot

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:52.910 
down to the stand in the car it's a lot
easier<00:01:51.899> because<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.200> isn't<00:01:52.319> going<00:01:52.469> to<00:01:52.560> jump<00:01:52.770> on

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
easier because it isn't going to jump on

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.219 
easier because it isn't going to jump on

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:04.270 
you so I take the block of wood and I
place<00:01:55.469> it<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.799> them<00:01:56.100> pushing<00:01:58.130> one<00:01:59.130> wall<00:01:59.429> to<00:02:00.259> boy

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.229 

3c<00:02:06.319> much<00:02:07.319> closer<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.519> seated<00:02:09.090> to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
3c much closer here that it is seated to

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.360 
3c much closer here that it is seated to
the<00:02:09.269> first<00:02:09.660> flange<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> bushing<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.130> is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
the first flange on the bushing that is

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.960 
the first flange on the bushing that is
fully<00:02:11.819> inserted<00:02:13.130> then<00:02:14.130> you'll<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.519> wipe<00:02:14.730> up

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
fully inserted then you'll just wipe up

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.250
