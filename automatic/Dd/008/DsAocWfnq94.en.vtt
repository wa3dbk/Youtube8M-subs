00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.840
 only promotes such music but 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.120

 dance and here at arsen it turned out 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:05:00.070

 live music is played by the orchestra 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.750

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.000

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.390
 the words here are the only things I have 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.310

 you nod at the thing here is gregory 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.190
 Now we need to be very subtle about the importance 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.040
 of the moment because now we stand on 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.510
 the threshold of the final 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:35.000
 what we worked on turned out 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:38.690

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.180

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.100
 wanted anise 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.670

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.190
 of course we are smoothed by our team 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:52.280

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.870
 which is now turned but because 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.840

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:01.720
