00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:19.160
 simple and proportions he has such 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:22.450

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.230
 cups currants 3 cups sugar 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:30.559
 currants need to sort and wash 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.780
 pour the currants with a glass of cold 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:37.890
