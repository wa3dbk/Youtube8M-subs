00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.660
 perhaps the physical trainer and 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.639
 coaching 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.059
 trained in physical education in 2009 I 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.620
 I felt a dream to help the greatest 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.610
 number of people through the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.160
 message 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.779
 so it's no work at the gym 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.050
 I started as it is already when I was 21 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.730
 years and I had to quit the job I 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.730
 had a store as a winning vendor 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.800
 thousand reais a month to earn 200 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.710
 real in a gym as interns and 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.140
 When I got to my mother, I said 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.350
 I was going to leave, she said she was 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.030
 a little because it 's in the shop had 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.070
 wallet and the photo could 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.719
 prosper and this was very difficult 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.090
 against her because I lost my father with 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.160
 four years and she had to be a 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.960
 Father, time is so long, do not you think? 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.120
 a lonely woman caring for a child 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.149
 says that physical education passing on 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.969
 mother's head started as an intern and 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.859
 Then I started to study hard to study 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.239
 very much the training part and then I went 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.579
 to another gym in this gym 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.019
 I became her coordinator and that's enough. 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.180
 the moment of my life that I open a 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.090
 gym and I went to the gym with 12 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.330
 students and after 22 years in this 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.869
 gym, I arrived 150 years ago 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.250
 so I had 150 students, do not you comment on me? 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.320
 only I worked 12 13 hours per day 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.759
 day I got super good but I did not 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.570
 I was happy because I did not have time to 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.710
 train 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.229
 I did not have time to make a 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.799
 Saturday meal until one day I had 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.650
 the first student was at six in the morning and 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.450
 I got home about 11 so I 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.340
 nor take bath as a business and sleeping 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.710
 around midnight an hour a day 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.259
 next wake up at 5 o'clock no sleep 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.370
 so four or five hours a night and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.800
 there was a day 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.230
 that for some reason the alarm clock rang 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.900
 and I could not wake up and then my mother 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.450
 up to the door and played the fado on me 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.180
 time to get up and when it was 7 o'clock 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.930
 morning and I thought to myself of our 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.010
 I left a year waiting and then I 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.030
 I sat on the bed 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.160
 I put my hand on my face and I see 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.110
 desperate to start meeting the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.610
 other students I sat down to reason 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.130
 I thought to myself 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.370
 so do not give more I gain and gain only 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.200
 that I need to do something to get me 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.700
 Give me more time to take care of myself. 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.330
 have more quality of life for me 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.270
 and then I started to get some 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.000
 information on the internet and I 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.650
 list of social academy at the time and 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.620
 when I joined the list I started 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.870
 receive and means it is also social and 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.510
 of these e-mails in indication for the video 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.820
 of ego rock and I started watching 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.400
 every word every minute he watched 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.050
 became more glazed and started to create 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.580
 a great desire to have 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.739
 that methodology that he was 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.660
 talking with me 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.030
 That's when I heard that he is 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.400
 really open seats for the class of fr 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.860
 of launching form and then I finished 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.720
 investing way of launching and I 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.660
 I started to study grandson entered the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.060

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.530
 release internal release environment 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.709
 only one but for which the budget 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.020
 You should start and then the live event and 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.690
 event live there in March and April that 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.030
 eric began to show opportunities for 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.490
 business to personal trainers and then there 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.650
 that I came back from 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.430
 the live event decided that some 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.200
 effect is enough of theory in two or three 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.520
 weekends wrote the ebook one 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.550
 60-page e-book 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.160
 I put it to sell. 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.030
 using the forum strategy in 25 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.490
 days 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.950
 the book is a feast served him 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.090
 it had become one more day in Brazil 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.940
 in the training area for 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.820
 in two months I already had 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.220
 returned five years and works as a 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.550
 personal owner of the academy as a gym 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.500
 and I started playing 100% is a business 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.990
 online I started totally alone 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.690
 I just did the support and I did everything 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.640

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.990
 had not had no recognition before 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.540
 the authority had nothing 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.780
 I had to learn to move in tools 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.820
 I did not even know it existed until a few have 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.250
 My videos that we recorded in mono 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.500
 Neither is the person who has the sound box 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.540
 the left side is 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.180
 because he did not know how to 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.830
 stereo audio and I made uniform and 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.900
 that's the way it worked out that way 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.480

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.880
 sold in 10 months the program version 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.430
 2.0 which should be a more 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.710
 professional relationship with the producer is 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.260
 the most systematized sequence and I 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.180
 I threw in 8 hours it was taken more 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.770

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.230
