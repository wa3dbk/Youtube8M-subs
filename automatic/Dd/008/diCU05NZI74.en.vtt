are like scalpers and stores and stuff
but<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:50.890> probably<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.250> first<00:02:51.430> one<00:02:51.550> that

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
but this probably the first one that

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.940 
but this probably the first one that
I've<00:02:51.760> tried<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.210> massage<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.470> like<00:02:53.740> you<00:02:53.860> know

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
I've tried that massage is like you know

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.370 
I've tried that massage is like you know
it<00:02:54.130> vibrates<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.910> honestly<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.810> think<00:02:56.050> it

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
it vibrates and honestly I think it

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.110 
it vibrates and honestly I think it
makes<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.709> difference<00:02:56.740> because<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.670> have

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
makes a difference because I have

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.240 
makes a difference because I have
another<00:02:58.420> one<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.930> does<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.200> vibrate<00:02:59.380> and<00:02:59.920> I

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
another one that does it vibrate and I

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.830 
another one that does it vibrate and I
was<00:03:00.370> just<00:03:00.550> do<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:00.700> manually<00:03:01.090> like<00:03:01.240> this<00:03:01.600> but<00:03:01.810> I

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
was just do it manually like this but I

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.600 
was just do it manually like this but I
I<00:03:01.930> think<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.590> there's<00:03:03.010> definitely<00:03:03.070> more

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
I think that there's definitely more

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.730 
I think that there's definitely more
benefit<00:03:04.030> for<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.360> fact<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.840> vibrates<00:03:05.050> it

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
benefit for the fact that it vibrates it

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.410 
benefit for the fact that it vibrates it
like<00:03:05.920> shakes<00:03:06.370> out<00:03:06.670> there<00:03:06.880> extra<00:03:07.209> dirt

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
like shakes out there extra dirt

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.710
