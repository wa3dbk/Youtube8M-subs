it's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.510> good<00:00:51.750> shot<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.230> arm<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.800> keep<00:00:53.520> my

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it's a good shot in the arm to keep my

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.319 
it's a good shot in the arm to keep my
practice<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.449> my<00:00:54.510> sanity<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.030> guess

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
practice and my sanity I was I guess

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.119 
practice and my sanity I was I guess
born<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.199> discovered<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.070> my<00:00:59.219> teens

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
born with but discovered in my teens

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.590 
born with but discovered in my teens
spondylolisthesis<00:01:02.129> all-over<00:01:03.120> ligament

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
spondylolisthesis all-over ligament

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.570 
spondylolisthesis all-over ligament
laxity<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> vertebra<00:01:04.920> were<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.100> over<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
laxity so the vertebra were all over the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.990 
laxity so the vertebra were all over the
place<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.090> over<00:01:06.299> time<00:01:07.310> they've<00:01:08.310> been<00:01:08.340> fused

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
place and over time they've been fused

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.840 
place and over time they've been fused
and<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.840> I'm<00:01:10.080> pretty<00:01:10.229> much<00:01:10.350> fused<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.610> many

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
and so I'm pretty much fused in many

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.300 
and so I'm pretty much fused in many
parts<00:01:12.240> most<00:01:13.020> parts<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.470> my<00:01:13.590> back<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:16.310> also

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
parts most parts of my back and and also

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.560 
parts most parts of my back and and also
an<00:01:18.140> autoimmune<00:01:19.640> syndrome<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.450> know

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
an autoimmune syndrome that you know

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.130 
an autoimmune syndrome that you know
gets<00:01:22.140> my<00:01:22.380> eyes<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:23.130> well<00:01:23.430> my<00:01:23.700> vision<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.420> well

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
gets my eyes as well my vision as well

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
gets my eyes as well my vision as well
as<00:01:25.530> my<00:01:25.890> body<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.970> there<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.720> times<00:01:27.960> when<00:01:29.090> when

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
as my body so there are times when when

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.300 
as my body so there are times when when
when<00:01:30.479> my<00:01:30.509> body<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.290> health<00:01:31.500> crisis<00:01:32.009> that

when my body is in health crisis that

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.090 
when my body is in health crisis that
you<00:01:32.610> know<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.720> hard<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.619> go<00:01:34.920> in

could<00:01:38.700> say<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.320> give<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
could say that you know I give in to it

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.810 
could say that you know I give in to it
sometimes<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:42.049> Taichi<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.890> keeps<00:01:44.280> me<00:01:44.579> going

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
sometimes but Taichi it keeps me going

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.149 
sometimes but Taichi it keeps me going
through<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.329> crisis<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.380> then<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> come

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
through that crisis and then when I come

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.969 
through that crisis and then when I come
out<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.670> other<00:01:47.700> side<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
strength and the balance and the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.080 
strength and the balance and the
flexibility<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.159> didn't<00:01:53.520> let<00:01:53.610> go<00:01:53.880> of
