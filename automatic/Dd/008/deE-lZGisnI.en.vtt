try to tiptoe around the sidelines and
you<00:02:37.040> know<00:02:37.130> if<00:02:37.220> they're<00:02:37.340> about<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.580> catch<00:02:37.730> a

you know if they're about to catch a
ball<00:02:38.050> they'll<00:02:39.050> actually<00:02:39.200> try<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.500> keep<00:02:39.709> their

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
ball they'll actually try to keep their

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.530 
ball they'll actually try to keep their
feet<00:02:40.130> in<00:02:40.340> bounds<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.239> have<00:02:41.360> just

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
feet in bounds that have just

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.970 
feet in bounds that have just
immediately<00:02:41.930> jumping<00:02:42.260> out<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.500> bounds<00:02:42.769> for<00:02:42.920> a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
immediately jumping out of bounds for a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.650 
immediately jumping out of bounds for a
catch<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.550> all<00:02:43.910> this<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.239> going<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.420> be<00:02:44.510> based

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
catch and all this is going to be based

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.050 
catch and all this is going to be based
on<00:02:44.959> their<00:02:45.560> ratings<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.519> if<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.790> have

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
on their ratings so that if you have

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.910 
on their ratings so that if you have
receiver<00:02:47.959> who's<00:02:48.200> really<00:02:48.440> good<00:02:48.560> like<00:02:48.739> Chad

receiver who's really good like Chad

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.590 
receiver who's really good like Chad
Johnson<00:02:49.400> he's<00:02:49.970> gonna<00:02:50.090> have<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.300> lot<00:02:50.450> better

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
Johnson he's gonna have a lot better

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600 
Johnson he's gonna have a lot better
chance<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:51.080> actually<00:02:51.260> staying<00:02:51.920> in<00:02:52.190> bounds<00:02:52.340> to

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
chance of actually staying in bounds to

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.600 
chance of actually staying in bounds to
make<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:52.940> catch<00:02:53.180> than<00:02:53.900> somebody<00:02:54.410> else<00:02:54.610> also

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.890 
tackle but now you actually have a
choice<00:03:24.859> between<00:03:25.130> doing<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.239> high-tech<00:03:26.660> or<00:03:26.870> a

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
choice between doing a high-tech or a

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.620 
choice between doing a high-tech or a
low<00:03:27.109> tackle<00:03:27.650> no<00:03:28.130> tackles<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.640> cut<00:03:29.090> tackle<00:03:29.390> going

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
low tackle no tackles a cut tackle going

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.780 
low tackle no tackles a cut tackle going
at<00:03:29.750> somebody's<00:03:30.140> legs<00:03:30.380> which<00:03:31.340> can<00:03:31.519> be<00:03:31.579> a<00:03:31.609> good

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
at somebody's legs which can be a good

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.210 
at somebody's legs which can be a good
way<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:32.079> get<00:03:33.079> down<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.230> running<00:03:33.530> back<00:03:33.769> but<00:03:34.100> at

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
way to get down a running back but at

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.400 
way to get down a running back but at
the<00:03:34.310> same<00:03:34.459> time<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:35.810> know<00:03:35.930> if<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.170> miss

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
the same time you know if you miss

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.080 
the same time you know if you miss
they're<00:03:36.890> gonna<00:03:36.980> jump<00:03:37.250> over<00:03:37.549> you<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:37.880> they

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
they're gonna jump over you and they

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.600 
they're gonna jump over you and they
could<00:03:38.239> go<00:03:38.359> for

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
could go for

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.700 
could go for
so<00:03:39.270> it's<00:03:39.840> kind<00:03:39.990> of<00:03:40.050> cool<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.260> there's<00:03:40.620> a

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
so it's kind of cool that there's a

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.620 
so it's kind of cool that there's a
dynamic<00:03:41.490> now<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.940> system<00:03:42.300> where<00:03:42.480> there

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
dynamic now to the system where there

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.840 
dynamic now to the system where there
wasn't<00:03:42.810> one<00:03:43.020> before<00:03:43.050> so<00:03:43.860> while<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.460> lot<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.790> the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
wasn't one before so while a lot of the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.400 
wasn't one before so while a lot of the
gameplay<00:03:45.270> has<00:03:45.390> improved<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.960> certainly<00:03:46.260> at

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
gameplay has improved and certainly at

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.350 
gameplay has improved and certainly at
the<00:03:46.680> animations<00:03:47.220> look<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.460> lot<00:03:47.550> better<00:03:47.760> there's

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
the animations look a lot better there's

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.150 
the animations look a lot better there's
still<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.660> lot<00:03:48.960> of<00:03:48.990> problems<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.530> man<00:03:49.800> has<00:03:50.010> had

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
still a lot of problems that man has had

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.000 
still a lot of problems that man has had
for<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.430> long<00:03:50.460> time<00:03:50.880> that<00:03:50.960> persists<00:03:52.010> you're

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
for a long time that persists you're

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.190 
for a long time that persists you're
gonna<00:03:53.100> see<00:03:53.370> with<00:03:53.580> almost<00:03:53.790> any<00:03:54.270> kicker<00:03:54.690> if<00:03:54.900> you

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
gonna see with almost any kicker if you

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.680 
gonna see with almost any kicker if you
get<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> perfectly<00:03:56.430> powered<00:03:56.760> kick<00:03:57.090> it's<00:03:57.450> gonna

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
get a perfectly powered kick it's gonna

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.090 
get a perfectly powered kick it's gonna
go<00:03:57.960> almost<00:03:58.230> at<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.530> back<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.710> the<00:03:58.830> end<00:03:59.010> zone

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
go almost at the back of the end zone

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.730 
go almost at the back of the end zone
and<00:03:59.250> if<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.120> watch<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.450> NFL<00:04:00.660> there's<00:04:01.560> not<00:04:01.680> a

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
and if you watch the NFL there's not a

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.920 
and if you watch the NFL there's not a
lot<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.070> touchbacks<00:04:02.670> anymore<00:04:03.210> but<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.630> happens

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
lot of touchbacks anymore but it happens

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.330 
lot of touchbacks anymore but it happens
all<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.200> time<00:04:04.350> in<00:04:04.680> matte<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.010> it's<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.160> little

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
all the time in matte and it's a little

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.250 
all the time in matte and it's a little
bit<00:04:05.459> ridiculous<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:06.300> you<00:04:06.540> know<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.959> still

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
bit ridiculous and you know you still

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.640 
bit ridiculous and you know you still
can't<00:04:07.470> call<00:04:07.740> any<00:04:08.160> kind<00:04:08.610> of<00:04:08.700> plays<00:04:09.320> on<00:04:10.320> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
can't call any kind of plays on the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.380 
can't call any kind of plays on the
receiving<00:04:11.070> team<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.430> can't<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.880> know<00:04:12.000> say<00:04:12.360> I

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
receiving team you can't you know say I

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.000 
receiving team you can't you know say I
want<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.810> do<00:04:12.900> reverse<00:04:13.290> or<00:04:13.590> anything<00:04:13.800> like<00:04:13.890> that

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
want to do reverse or anything like that

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.039 
want to do reverse or anything like that
so<00:04:14.220> it's<00:04:14.520> still<00:04:14.700> very<00:04:14.850> archaic<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.630> you<00:04:15.750> think

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
so it's still very archaic and you think

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.890 
so it's still very archaic and you think
by<00:04:16.590> now<00:04:16.910> EA<00:04:17.910> would<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:18.299> actually<00:04:18.450> got<00:04:18.750> its

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
by now EA would have actually got its

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.390 
by now EA would have actually got its
act<00:04:19.019> together<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.620> done<00:04:19.980> something<00:04:20.310> with

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
act together and done something with

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.670 
act together and done something with
special<00:04:20.820> teams<00:04:21.000> so<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.329> actually<00:04:21.510> was<00:04:21.989> like<00:04:22.530> it

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
special teams so it actually was like it

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.920 
special teams so it actually was like it
is<00:04:22.770> in<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:22.980> NFL<00:04:23.660> unfortunately<00:04:24.660> there's<00:04:24.840> a

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
is in the NFL unfortunately there's a

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.140 
is in the NFL unfortunately there's a
lot<00:04:25.080> more<00:04:25.110> good<00:04:25.620> than<00:04:25.950> bad<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.640> Madden<00:04:27.000> this

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
lot more good than bad and Madden this

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.670 
lot more good than bad and Madden this
year<00:04:27.419> one<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.020> cool<00:04:28.200> things<00:04:28.230> that<00:04:28.530> they've

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
year one of the cool things that they've

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.010 
year one of the cool things that they've
added<00:04:29.040> is<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.310> weapons<00:04:29.760> feature<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.330> what<00:04:30.870> that

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
added is a weapons feature and what that

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.010 
added is a weapons feature and what that
is<00:04:31.169> basically<00:04:31.680> any<00:04:32.100> player<00:04:32.550> who<00:04:32.790> has<00:04:32.940> over<00:04:33.570> 90

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
is basically any player who has over 90

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.409 
is basically any player who has over 90
rating<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.710> specific<00:04:35.220> abilities<00:04:35.640> will<00:04:36.000> get<00:04:36.210> a

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
rating and specific abilities will get a

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.260 
rating and specific abilities will get a
weapons<00:04:36.990> classification<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.010> so<00:04:38.820> you<00:04:39.240> know

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
weapons classification and so you know

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.970 
weapons classification and so you know
you'll<00:04:39.540> have<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.750> smart<00:04:40.200> quarterback<00:04:40.410> for

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
you'll have a smart quarterback for

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.620 
you'll have a smart quarterback for
Peyton<00:04:41.400> Manning<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:41.910> that<00:04:42.030> means<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.360> if

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
Peyton Manning and that means that if

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.690 
Peyton Manning and that means that if
the<00:04:42.990> defense<00:04:43.350> keeps<00:04:43.560> calling<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.280> same<00:04:44.460> plays

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
the defense keeps calling the same plays

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.700 
the defense keeps calling the same plays
over<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.240> over<00:04:45.360> again<00:04:45.540> he'll<00:04:46.350> be<00:04:46.470> able<00:04:46.560> to

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
over and over again he'll be able to

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.110 
over and over again he'll be able to
actually<00:04:46.890> read<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.370> defense<00:04:47.520> figure<00:04:48.000> out

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
actually read the defense figure out

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.310 
actually read the defense figure out
what<00:04:48.360> play<00:04:48.570> they're<00:04:48.780> doing<00:04:49.020> you'll<00:04:49.169> actually

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
what play they're doing you'll actually

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.530 
what play they're doing you'll actually
see<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.860> play<00:04:50.070> on<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.430> field<00:04:50.880> so<00:04:51.060> you<00:04:51.240> can

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
see the play on the field so you can

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.090 
see the play on the field so you can
counter<00:04:52.229> it<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:52.560> of<00:04:52.680> course<00:04:52.890> you<00:04:52.979> know

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
counter it and of course you know

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.500 
counter it and of course you know
Peyton's<00:04:53.400> great<00:04:53.550> at<00:04:53.700> doing<00:04:53.820> those<00:04:54.000> audibles

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
Peyton's great at doing those audibles

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.080

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
future a little bit more so in that way

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.390 
future a little bit more so in that way
it's<00:05:56.419> more<00:05:56.510> of<00:05:56.780> like<00:05:56.810> a<00:05:56.960> GM<00:05:57.380> mode<00:05:57.560> but<00:05:57.919> but<00:05:58.310> it

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
works pretty well so that the promise of

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.990 
works pretty well so that the promise of
sort<00:06:00.620> of<00:06:00.650> an<00:06:00.770> ownership<00:06:01.010> mode<00:06:01.340> maybe<00:06:01.580> wasn't

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000
