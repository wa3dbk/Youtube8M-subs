00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.180
 the v since the hat series on rights 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.590
 of man includes a general movie is 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.670
 a movie for each of the three 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.650
 dimensions of human rights 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.150
 each dimension is equally important 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.490
 in the human rights system 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.840
 the films presents among others the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.070
 genesis of human rights the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.630
 violations they are subject to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.400
 currently as well as 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.050
 women and the role of non-governmental 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.509
 like amnesty 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.399
 international film number 3 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.200
 concern the third dimension to 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.000
 know collective rights 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.530
 it is also about 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.970
 development of the human rights system 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.310
 the man and the great work undertaken 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.630
 in this field of the 70s the world has 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.980
 change a lot 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.560
 many old colonies have 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.720
 gained their independence to the joy of 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.220
 this recovered freedom succeed 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.770
 quickly in many countries 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.420
 disenchantment a lot of 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.010
 these countries having to deal with 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.260
 massive development problems 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.579
 the causes of this phenomenon are often 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.229
 transnational or even global 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.970
 impacts of climate change 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.860
 for example world trade is 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.650
 inequitable 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.870
 its consequences are the war of 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.040
 underdevelopment corruption and the 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.810
 destruction of the environment 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.070
 most of the time from developing countries 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.410
 concerned can not 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.150
 solve alone his psy problems for 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.500
 remedy this situation as the countries 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.700
 under development have brought in 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.200
 the rights of the third dimension 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.880
 in the debate on human rights 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.130
 among these rights is the right to 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.290
 peace the right to a clean environment 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.520
 the right to the free disposal of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.010
 national deposits of materials 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.220
 first is very important the right to 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.220
 development 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.820
 these rights being distinguished two points of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.509
 those of the first and the second 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.580
 dimension 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.320
 it is not just about protecting 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.210
 individuals but whole groups 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.040
 as peoples or the name of rights 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.479
 collective 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.920
 it is not two countries concerned that is 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.640
 the leader in the first place their 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.250
 Implementation 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.960
 but the international community these 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 rights lies from a point of view 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.990
 concept of solidarity between 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.070
 country 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.290
 that's why collective rights 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.290
 are sometimes called right of solidarity 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.400
 the third dimension is more 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.080
 controversial that the first two a 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.459
 critical argument and that the rights of 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.500
 man are by definition rights 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.870
 individual and can not therefore 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.970
 concern only a few individuals 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.500
 experts also consider that 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.450
 rights of the third dimension 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.880
 can never reach nor on the plane 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.650
 legal nor politically the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.340
 same class as those of the first and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.349
 of the second dimension 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.390
 the principle of indivisibility of rights 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.069
 of the man are therefore likely to be shaken 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.290
 and the whole protection system 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.209
 human rights weakened the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.280
 most of the industrialized countries have 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.480
 first of all refused to recognize this 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.690
 third dimension of human rights 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.519
 the man 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.680
 they fear that the countries of 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.120
 development can not deduce from the 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.590
 to the development of claims 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.970
 financial since the conference 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.370
 World Conference on Human Rights 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.290
 1993 most of the countries 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.489
 industrialized countries nevertheless support the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.840
 third dimension of human rights 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.060
 the man despite the critics 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.650
 today there is consensus on the fact 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.019
 that the rights of the third dimension 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.530
 an integral part of the system of 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.540
 human rights 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.860
 the third dimension of human rights 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.900
 the man shows well that if these rights 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.000
 are universal some rights are 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.440
 nevertheless alienable and that new 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.420
 rights can be added 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.310
 this may be necessary because 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.040
 the evolution of technologies for example 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.170
 the discovery of genetic engineering or 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.940
 cloning and it is also possible that 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.780
 political upheavals end 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.670
 to the same result 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.890
 in the case of the third dimension of 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.760
 is mainly about decolonization and 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.069
 globalization 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.299
 over time a new aspect of this 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.260
 kind can bring together a consensus 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.480
 international 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.010
 that does not mean that 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.810
 all countries must stick to it 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.299
 what would be the case if there was a 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.859
 binding international character or 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.780
 that we can take legal action to 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.579
 assert his rights so that this 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.109
 it is possible that these rights 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.389
 be fixed by a treaty 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.220
 International Convention on the Rights of 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.380
 first dimension this treaty and the pact 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.959
 civilian and for those of the second 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.160
 dimension is the social pact 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.630
 the adoption of new conventions 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.430
 united nations can also make 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.120
 certain rights binding in law 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.919
 international 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.660
 this is the case for example of the 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.220
 convention on the elimination of all 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.169
 forms of discrimination against 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.910
 women and the related convention 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.370
 the rights of people with disabilities 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.860
 the next step is justiciability 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.479
 what can legally be done 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.860
 who considers that these rights of 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.410
 the man is not respected 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.389
 an international treaty obliges 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.729
 signatory countries to adapt their 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.169
 national legislation the victims of 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.040
 violations of these rights can then 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.320
 to sue in the eure 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.600
 i of origin to assume that a person 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.310
 bring a motion before all 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.150
 the instances without being able to do 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.220
 claim his right 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.250
 in this case he has two left 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.930
 possibilities first possibility this 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.180
 nobody introduces what's called 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.980
 an individual petition before the 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.950
 convention committees 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.300
 after which the committee renders a decision 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.950
 although this decision is not 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.570
 binding for the country of origin of the 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.530
 petitioner 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.600
 experience shows that such 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.070
 public decision can have a weight 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.560
 considerable policy 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.300
 no country has particular pressure 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.120
 to be presented to the public 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.070
 as violent human rights this 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.350
 important instrument exists for the 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.780
 first and second dimension as well 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.880
 that for the conventions on the other hand 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.780
 does not exist so far for the 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.450
 third dimension 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.280
 second possibility this person 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.960
 lodge an application with one of the 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.470
 regional protection systems 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.870
 human rights 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.610
 the European system and the most elaborate 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.910
 with the European Court of Human Rights 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.100
 the man 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.990
 he has a jurisdiction that is very 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.960
 often seized each year she receives 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.640
 more than 50000 individual requests in 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.060
 from member countries of the Council of 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.620
 europe 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.880
 other regional systems of 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.950
 protection of human rights are at 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.660
 this day significantly less evolved it offers 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.350
 few alternatives to the rights system 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.350
 of the united nations man 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.170
 the international protection system 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.990
 human rights is developing 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.060
 obviously permanently acquired 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.390
 are numerous but there is still a lot to 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.460
 make 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.080
 here are some of the big building sites 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.760
 ongoing in this area of ​​systems 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.170
 regional rights protection 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.540
 African and American man in 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.639
 particular need to be strengthened in 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.530
 the regions of the world like Asia 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.840
 the near east it exists to this day 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.219
 no regional system for the protection of 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.460
 human rights these systems 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:26.810
 remains to be created the different countries and the 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.090
 international community must 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.319
 multiply their efforts to prevent 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.569
 human rights violations 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:34.969
 not emanating from states but committed 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.770
 for example by multinational 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:39.189
 rebel groups or media circles 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.539
 organized crime 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:44.419
 the international criminal court of the hague 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:46.099
 must be developed and strengthened 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.270
 skills for very violations 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:50.740
 serious human rights issues such as 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:53.360
 genocide or crimes against humanity 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.490
 as the past has shown even though the 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.539
 path is sometimes difficult to system 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.669
 human rights perhaps 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:03.379
 improve and develop other films 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:06.520
 of the series v this innovator informs 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:06.520
 also on human rights
