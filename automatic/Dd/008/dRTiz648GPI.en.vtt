00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.209
 militiamen at polytechnic in the 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.290
 part of his program a big school 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.210
 why not me 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.580
 the prestigious engineering school 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.300
 accompanies high school students from the second to 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.210
 high school senior year 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.290
 the goal prepare them to succeed their 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.330
 graduate studies 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.029
 the essouriau high school is one of the 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.630
 three high schools partners of the operation 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.490
 polytechnic report the prestigious 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.869
 school of the plateau of saclay the 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.269
 engineers welcomes the new 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.499
 high school students of the program a big school 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.689
 why not me 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.399
 up to their baccalaureate they will benefit 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.460
 a particular follow-up 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.649
 one of the things that this program allows 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.930
 it is to help young girls 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.980
 young boys to understand how far they 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.149
 can go all they can 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.609
 hope what they can do 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.199
 and then also maybe more 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.750
 specifically the message to the 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.399
 girls that scientific studies the 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.260
 engineering professions it's trades 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.760
 extremely varied and fit 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.309
 and that can be super interesting 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.379
 exciting exciting thirty students 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.480
 of 2de integrates the program this year 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.220
 they were chosen according to 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.619
 social criteria of their potential 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.390
 and their motivation for 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.670
 high school students as for their parents it's 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.259
 the beginning of a three-year adventure from 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.360
 that I learned that there was this 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.490
 program in high school down I was all 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.950
 immediately motivated I wanted every month 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.030
 by a great pride yes quite the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.159
 purpose if open to them other horizons 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.810
 nafa see that I'm in 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.460
 crafts are not just crafts 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.140
 which counts we can also make 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.509
 big researches we can advance in 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 huge backgrounds that these gigantic 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.780
 after that it's unimaginable 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.010
 every Wednesday afternoon 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.070
 high school students find their guardians 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.930
 Polytechnic on the campus of the school 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.610
 assembly of projects expression workshops 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.470
 cultural outings or visits 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.350
 businesses are 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.840
 multiple in fact the principle is to 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.720
 arouse curiosity to open them to 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.880
 domains they do not have access to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.830
 without this program then the culture at 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.470
 broad sense the goal is to give them 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.840
 in palaces a very wide panel of 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.840
 choice and opening topics for that 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.610
 can move afterwards at the level of 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.080
 graduate studies in fields 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.570
 which he would not have had access to without 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.250
 the program about twenty terminale 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.940
 of the essouriau high school participate in 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.980
 the operation 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.560
 they feel better armed for the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.060
 graduate studies why program I 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.400
 can have allowed me to have a better 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.980
 but the reasons this to the oral and to me 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.810
 feel much more comfortable and not 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.160
 not be afraid of my interlocutors 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.170
 it's important to be able to 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.180
 revalorize and be able to explain 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.950
 that we can all integrate a great 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.200
 school if we work enough 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.030
 I personally make myself more 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.200
 do journalism in 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.340
 the international I would like to do 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.230
 report from the essouriau high school for 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.209
 extend tutoring zachary a 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.100
 polytechnician is permanently in 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.019
 the establishment they provide support 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.799
 school of all students one 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.870
 more according to the turn the students of the 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.459
 program me me call me by my 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.500
 last name is not at all the same 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.180
 relationship that could have with a 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.470
 teacher and it's also often enough 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.600
 useful because I can serve 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.400
 intermediary between the professors and 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.560
 the students circulate teacher you me 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.820
 prevent if for example who finds that 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.130
 something wrong with a student 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.180
 that these results fall down or whatever 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.239
 it is and me the power to go see 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.340
 with the pupil precisely will be no longer at 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.900
 even to discuss it with me it will be 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.370
 less stressful for him it will be more 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.190
 natural to talk to me about it sometimes 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.650
 with teachers for catherine 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.250
 ricard the high school cpe the presence of 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.850
 polytechnicians is a real plus 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.099
 our students feel better more 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.900
 performing at most 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:40.739
 because the polytechnic school comes 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.030
 with us it is symbolic it is possible 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.170
 not really explain it more than that 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.120
 but it has an impact 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.680
 students see that these young people 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.640
 who have done brilliant studies that 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.310
 are at the highest level of the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.340
 republic can propose are like them 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.870
 I like everyone and that's 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.180
 almost one thing is more important than 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.610
 students understand that with 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.190
 working with listening at the end of 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.030
 account they can arrive or even at 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.950
 same place the link between the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.840
 and polytechnic exists since six years 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.579
 all students who participated in 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.480
 the operation a great school why 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.829
 not me 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.829
 have completed higher education
