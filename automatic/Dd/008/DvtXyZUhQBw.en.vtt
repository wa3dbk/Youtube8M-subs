job in giving everybody their size and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.720 
job in giving everybody their size and
scope<00:02:42.140> especially<00:02:43.100> considering<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.550> fact

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
scope especially considering the fact

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.250 
scope especially considering the fact
that<00:02:43.820> they<00:02:43.940> make<00:02:44.120> Susan<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.600> main<00:02:44.750> character

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
so you can get a lot of fun angles with

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.060 
so you can get a lot of fun angles with
height<00:02:47.150> size<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.780> way<00:02:47.930> so<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.920> whole
