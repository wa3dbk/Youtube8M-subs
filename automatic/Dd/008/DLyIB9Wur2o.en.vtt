00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.820
 are faced with the situation that even 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.859
 these experienced agents will last for a long time 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.480
 keep up 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.770
 I'll keep you baked things 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.810

 Cycle path for lane to see here see 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.610
 how the bikes barely get themselves into 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.199

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.500
 well, striking driving behavior 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.370
 these control 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.370
 that is how it is generated 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.800
 interest and he decides to stop 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.629
 to make 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.239
 at first sight the old eye seems to be 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.170
 but when the agents stop car 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.970
 approached 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.000
 look at these to completely different plans 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.000
 to have 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.760
 it consequences 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.990
 I follow howling siren on high 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.010
 speed 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.899
 where the agent 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.980
 about sailing must add to the red 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.500
 to keep it at 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.270
 very loud when the invigilators 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.630
 trying to catch up with the old ones 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.360
 the driver 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.120
 to aggressively cut off a police car 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.650
 although about 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.330

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.800
 pursuit itself 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.270
 involving the driver of a wheel 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.790
