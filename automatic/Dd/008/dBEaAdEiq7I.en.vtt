00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:03.024
(upbeat music)

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.480
- Hey everyone, it's Natasha
of natashaskitchen.com.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.800
Today we're gonna make a pasta

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.970
that takes just 30 minutes to make.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.310
It has shrimp, it has
a tomato creamy sauce

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.920
that's creamy but light at the same time.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.340
It's awesome, you guys are gonna love it.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.070
So let's get started.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.060
First, you'll need about
three quarters pound of pasta.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.580
One pound of shrimp that's been peeled,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.500
medium to large shrimp is fine.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.300
Couple tablespoons of olive oil.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.610
Then for this amazing
sauce, we're gonna need

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.930
some white wine, and you want
that to be a drier white wine.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.810
Then some butter, about
six medium tomatoes,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.080
some red pepper flakes to
give it that extra zing,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.590
some green onion, fresh green onion,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.890
and then some fresh basil,
and you can also use

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.690
a little bit of dry basil instead

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.120
if you don't have the fresh.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.880
And then one clove of garlic.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.220
We're gonna use just a
half a cup of heavy cream,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.330
and it's so creamy and
good, it's unbelievable

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.930
that there's only half a cup in here.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.960
And then we're gonna
garnish with some cheese.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.630
We're gonna start with cooking our pasta,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.670
so bring a large pot of water to a boil,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.050
and once it's at a boil
add some salt to the water.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.070
We've got about a half a tablespoon there.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.510
And then drizzle the top with about

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.140
a tablespoon of olive oil.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.100
And this really helps the pasta,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.723
keeps it from sticking together.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.770
So we're dumping about three quarters

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.610
of a pound of pasta in, and you can use

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.910
any kind of pasta you like.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.790
You can use fettuccine,
you can use spaghetti,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.390
I like angel hair the most
so that's what I'm using.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.880
So just cook that according
to the package instructions.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.710
When it's done, you're
gonna drain the pasta,

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.100
give it a quick rinse,
and just set it aside

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.550
until you're ready to use it.

00:01:48.463 --> 00:01:50.440
(sprayer running)

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.850
Let's get started on the shrimp.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.740
This part's really quick and easy.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.830
So, first you wanna preheat
a large heavy-bottom skillet

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.260
over medium heat.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.840
Then we're gonna season our shrimp

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.690
with a little bit of salt and pepper.

00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:05.358
(salt shaking)

00:02:06.914 --> 00:02:09.747
(pepper grinding)

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.850
Add two tablespoons of
oil to your hot skillet.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.570
Then add the shrimp and put those

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.310
in a single layer across
the bottom of the pan.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.070
Now shrimp are quick to make.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.960
They only take about three minutes,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.550
so you don't wanna overcook the shrimp

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.950
or they'll turn rubbery.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.860
So toss the shrimp at
least once in between,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.090
and it should be done
in about three minutes.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.620
Once the shrimp are cooked,
take them out of the pan

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.883
and set them aside.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.840
Now let's move on to
the creamy tomato sauce.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.460
So start out by chopping your tomatoes.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.843
We're gonna chop these into about dice.

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.382
(upbeat music)

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.493
Now we're gonna chop the
basil and the green onion.

00:02:59.187 --> 00:03:01.437
(chopping)

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.430
Now we're gonna add all
the sauce ingredients,

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.000
except for the heavy cream,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.080
just right into that hot skillet.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.840
Start with four tablespoons of butter,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.860
your chopped tomatoes,
green onions, your basil.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.680
Then we're gonna add in
one pressed garlic clove,

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.300
your red pepper flakes, and
your one cup of white wine.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.550
And we're gonna cook that
down 'til you have about

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.213
a fourth of a cup of
liquid left in the pan.

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:35.027
(simmering)

00:03:35.027 --> 00:03:37.610
(upbeat music)

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:49.300
Alright, you can see the
liquid is almost evaporated.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.000
Our tomatoes are nice and soft.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.493
Now we can add the half
a cup of heavy cream.

00:03:55.087 --> 00:03:57.420
(simmering)

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.883
And stir in your cooked shrimp.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.910
Now toss in your cooked pasta,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.083
and just stir everything to combine.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.900
Season with a little more
salt and pepper if needed,

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.913
and then serve with some Parmesan.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.710
Alright, and this is best
hot, so serve it right away.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.050
Oh goodness, this looks so good.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.100
And I'm hungry, baby's hungry.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.249
This little lady loves
pasta, I already know it.

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:35.949
If she's anything like her mother.

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:39.649
(upbeat music)

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.123
'Kay, we wanna add lots of shrimp.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.233
This is, after all, shrimp pasta.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.820
And then we're gonna top
it with tons of cheese.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.440
I like to get it on there
while the pasta's still hot

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.590
so the cheese can melt onto there.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.700
Then maybe some fresh
tomatoes for garnish.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.323
Add some fresh basil just to
pretty it up a little bit.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.653
And that's it.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.613
Now the taste test.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.620
Alright, we're gonna start
with a little bit of pasta.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.363
Mm.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.973
Creamy but light.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.710
And then the shrimp.

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:27.543
Oh, it's wonderful.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.060
The white wine just really
brings everything together.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.040
You guys are gonna love this pasta.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.160
It's no wonder it's one of the

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.183
most pinned recipes on my site.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.533
Mm.

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:51.352
(laughs)

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.600
Course I had to include one of those.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.418
Otherwise this video would be
a little dry, huh? (laughs)

00:05:59.418 --> 00:06:00.251
Mm.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.140
Alright, I'm gonna go enjoy this.
