in the ground I have a piece of paper

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.410 
in the ground I have a piece of paper
that<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.269> plan<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> write<00:00:28.170> my<00:00:28.380> intention<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.010> I

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
that I plan to write my intention on I

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.729 
that I plan to write my intention on I
have<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:31.880> already<00:00:32.880> had<00:00:33.149> started<00:00:33.690> some<00:00:33.870> seeds<00:00:34.290> so

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
have I already had started some seeds so

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.990 
have I already had started some seeds so
I<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:35.100> some<00:00:35.540> seedlings<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:37.579> have<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> soil

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
I have some seedlings I have the soil

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.639 
I have some seedlings I have the soil
that<00:00:39.239> I'm<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.600> put<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:39.870> top<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:40.410> bowl

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
that I'm going to put on top on my bowl

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.260 
that I'm going to put on top on my bowl
I<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.010> my<00:00:41.190> bold<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.640> I'm<00:00:41.700> going<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.940> plant

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
I have my bold and I'm going to plant

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.720 
I have my bold and I'm going to plant
and<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.680> obviously<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.460> plant

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and now you can obviously just plant

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.310 
and now you can obviously just plant
this<00:00:44.910> right<00:00:45.300> outside<00:00:45.480> your<00:00:45.719> garden<00:00:46.969> but<00:00:48.110> in<00:00:49.110> my

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
this right outside your garden but in my

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.600 
this right outside your garden but in my
kitchen<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.890> am<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.449> using<00:00:51.989> this

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
kitchen I am going to be using this

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.970 
kitchen I am going to be using this
planter<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.020> there<00:00:55.020> are<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.350> many<00:00:55.440> people<00:00:55.710> who

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
planter and there are so many people who

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.560 
planter and there are so many people who
live<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.160> apartments<00:00:56.850> who<00:00:56.969> don't<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
live in apartments who don't have a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.330 
live in apartments who don't have a
place<00:00:57.870> where<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.620> garden<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.190> they

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
place where they have garden that they

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.990 
place where they have garden that they
can<00:00:59.520> plant<00:00:59.879> their<00:01:00.210> intention<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:02.000> planter

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
can plant their intention so a planter

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.039 
can plant their intention so a planter
is<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:04.019> fine<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.880> I<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.180> some<00:01:06.390> stones<00:01:06.720> with

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
is just fine and I have some stones with

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.560 
is just fine and I have some stones with
me<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.830> citrine<00:01:08.250> which<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
me I have citrine which is the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.050 
me I have citrine which is the
manifesting<00:01:10.290> stone<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.580> crystal

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
manifesting stone and I have crystal

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.539 
manifesting stone and I have crystal
quartz<00:01:12.390> crystal<00:01:13.200> quartz<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.770> an<00:01:13.979> amplifier

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
quartz crystal quartz is an amplifier

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.399 
quartz crystal quartz is an amplifier
this<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.270> put<00:01:15.630> crystal<00:01:15.990> quartz<00:01:16.229> with

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
this I put crystal quartz with

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.950 
this I put crystal quartz with
everything<00:01:17.009> because<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.640> amplifies<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
everything because it just amplifies the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.219 
everything because it just amplifies the
energy<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.680> whatever<00:01:20.070> its<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:21.080> they're<00:01:22.080> not

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
energy of whatever its with they're not

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.890 
energy of whatever its with they're not
very<00:01:22.470> expensive<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.430> well<00:01:24.210> they're<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
very expensive and well they're going to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.109 
very expensive and well they're going to
be<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.470> there<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:27.030> also<00:01:27.720> wrote<00:01:28.200> down

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
be going in there so I also wrote down

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.910 
be going in there so I also wrote down
what<00:01:30.119> I'm<00:01:30.210> going<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.540> say<00:01:30.840> already<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.590> I'm

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
what I'm going to say already and I'm

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.340 
what I'm going to say already and I'm
going<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.250> print<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.759> out<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.270> I'm<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.259> to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
going to print it out and I'm going to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.350 
going to print it out and I'm going to
have<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.500> below<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.579> available<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
have it below so it's available for you

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.810 
have it below so it's available for you
to<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:36.900> reference<00:01:37.409> by<00:01:38.009> no<00:01:38.100> means<00:01:38.369> anything

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
to use as reference by no means anything

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.100 
to use as reference by no means anything
i<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:40.520> not<00:01:41.520> written<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.060> stone<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.689> can

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
i do is not written in stone so you can

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.580 
i do is not written in stone so you can
change<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.920> do<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.340> however<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:45.119> want<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
change it and do it however you want to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.469 
change it and do it however you want to
so<00:01:46.610> whenever<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.880> work<00:01:48.180> with<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.450> angels<00:01:48.810> I

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
so whenever I work with the angels I

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.960 
so whenever I work with the angels I
like<00:01:51.479> ritual<00:01:51.899> that's<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.409> who<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.680> am<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.430> when

pendulum or I'm sitting meditating oral
definitely<00:02:08.340> automatic<00:02:08.910> writing<00:02:09.120> I<00:02:09.710> saw<00:02:10.710> with

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
definitely automatic writing I saw with

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.850 
definitely automatic writing I saw with
a<00:02:10.920> candle<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.490> that<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.630> my<00:02:12.930> signal<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.740> the
