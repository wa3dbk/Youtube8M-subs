00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.610
 today our program for Brazil face and make no mistake that it is not geography 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.610
 that we're going to say more than 40 rounds 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.820
 I questioned why this is what fuels the suspicion of possible 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.429
 expected outcome paulo 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.769
 this also has to do with the law that guarantees the right to food 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.629
 association and the defense to open today has everything to do with a 

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:26.249
 nature preservation 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.989
 and it has gained much greater sense related conduct 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.670
 sustainable food is the food that in addition to being produced using 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.719
 natural resources to reduce the environmental impact caused by aquaculture 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:38.780
 40ºc to 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.070
 It is also here that you value the food in the basket 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.650
 offered by the producers in your region 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.990
 just remember how things were once the time when everything was 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.840
 bought from family farming ' 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.950
 I remember the josé grocery store very well and you should have known 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.960
 someone like this to get there early from the athletes giving everything fresh themselves 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.010
 because when you buy directly from local producers you are 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.990
 buying fresh food without dyes and preservatives also has the 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.270
 The fact that they are closer is less 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.740
 generate a much lower environmental impact 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.759
 and it has something more sustainable than encouraging local production 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.900
 when you consume regional foods you value what your region has 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.670
 of the best 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.240
 The food is just the same as the region has its north become more 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.500
 fish while here 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.630
 in the south the best request is a song and video 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.230
 in minas gerais' the tutu of bean with light cabbage in the northeast the famous brand 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.080
 of beer one of them 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.890
 I want the committee to judge that almost every day 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.890
 while the paulista preferred the carioca beans 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.149
 each region became a specialist 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.310
 the production of food used for their typical dishes 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.189
 for this reason the valuation of the regional food crops brings the 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.820
 producers is essential to keep the identity of each state alive. 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.900
 The most important thing for you to always have your table the most healthy food this is 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.380
 a right of yours the cultural patrimony of the people
