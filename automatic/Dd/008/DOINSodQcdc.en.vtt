this of course would be flush in and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.699 
this of course would be flush in and
there'd<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.670> little<00:02:33.300> rectangular<00:02:33.870> chisel

and<00:03:06.590> when<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.680> put<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.070> in<00:03:08.340> it'll<00:03:08.880> be<00:03:09.000> fairly

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
and when you put this in it'll be fairly

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.259 
and when you put this in it'll be fairly
obvious<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:10.350> know<00:03:10.470> if<00:03:10.709> if<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.489> isn't<00:03:11.970> great

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
obvious you know if if this isn't great

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.190 
obvious you know if if this isn't great
in<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.780> center<00:03:14.330> then<00:03:15.330> you'll<00:03:15.540> you'll<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:16.050> to

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
in the center then you'll you'll have to

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:24.070 
in the center then you'll you'll have to
move<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.530> up<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.739> bit

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.630 

so<00:03:25.080> for<00:03:25.320> this<00:03:25.410> installation<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.220> brand-new

there<00:04:16.250> this<00:04:17.250> is<00:04:18.140> obviously<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.290> backside<00:04:23.120> in

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
there this is obviously the backside in

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.870 
there this is obviously the backside in
there<00:04:24.680> before<00:04:25.680> I<00:04:25.710> go<00:04:25.919> too<00:04:25.980> far<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.430> want<00:04:26.669> to<00:04:26.760> make

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
there before I go too far I want to make

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.510 
there before I go too far I want to make
sure<00:04:27.120> that<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:28.350> locking<00:04:28.590> mechanism<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.430> the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
sure that the locking mechanism of the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.980 
sure that the locking mechanism of the
door<00:04:29.730> work<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.270> don't<00:04:30.450> put<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:30.720> all<00:04:30.810> together

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
door work so I don't put it all together

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.720 
door work so I don't put it all together
and<00:04:31.230> find<00:04:31.530> out<00:04:31.710> that<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:31.980> doesn't<00:04:32.280> work<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.610> it

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
and find out that it doesn't work and it

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.880 
and find out that it doesn't work and it
works<00:04:32.940> just<00:04:33.240> fine

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
works just fine

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.290 
works just fine
sometimes<00:04:34.890> one<00:04:35.100> of<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.280> trickiest<00:04:35.669> parts<00:04:36.150> is

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
sometimes one of the trickiest parts is

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.560 
sometimes one of the trickiest parts is
getting<00:04:36.840> these<00:04:37.020> screws<00:04:38.000> started<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.210> pull

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
getting these screws started to pull

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.260 
getting these screws started to pull
that<00:04:39.720> out<00:04:39.930> a<00:04:40.220> little<00:04:41.220> ways<00:04:41.490> so<00:04:41.729> I<00:04:41.790> can<00:04:42.030> see

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
that out a little ways so I can see

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.440 
that out a little ways so I can see
where<00:04:42.510> I'm<00:04:42.630> going<00:04:43.310> get<00:04:44.310> it<00:04:44.430> in<00:04:44.640> and<00:04:44.880> just<00:04:44.910> get

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
where I'm going get it in and just get

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.340 
where I'm going get it in and just get
it<00:04:45.570> caught<00:04:45.840> on<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.140> first<00:04:46.410> few<00:04:46.860> threads<00:04:48.350> move

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
it caught on the first few threads move

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:58.250 
it caught on the first few threads move
outside<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:52.490> then<00:04:53.960> try<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:54.990> do<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.320> same<00:04:57.260> on

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
outside and then try to do the same on

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:06.650 
outside and then try to do the same on
the<00:04:58.380> other<00:04:58.590> side

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.129 

okay<00:05:07.660> I<00:05:08.020> know<00:05:08.259> that's<00:05:08.530> it<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.039> that'll<00:05:09.220> be<00:05:09.400> fine

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
okay I know that's it so that'll be fine

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.270 
okay I know that's it so that'll be fine
sometimes<00:05:11.139> what<00:05:11.530> happens<00:05:11.889> is<00:05:12.099> we<00:05:13.030> can't<00:05:13.270> get

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
sometimes what happens is we can't get

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.129 
sometimes what happens is we can't get
the<00:05:15.280> angle<00:05:15.310> getting<00:05:15.970> in<00:05:16.090> there<00:05:16.300> is<00:05:16.419> too<00:05:16.690> too

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
the angle getting in there is too too

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.680 
the angle getting in there is too too
much<00:05:17.349> for<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.710> screwdriver<00:05:18.220> to<00:05:18.280> get<00:05:18.460> in<00:05:18.690> so

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
much for the screwdriver to get in so

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.550 
much for the screwdriver to get in so
you<00:05:20.139> hold<00:05:20.379> deep<00:05:21.030> back<00:05:22.030> like<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.569> pull<00:05:23.349> this

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
you hold deep back like that pull this

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.580 
you hold deep back like that pull this
out<00:05:23.770> so<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.729> screws<00:05:25.060> are<00:05:25.240> are<00:05:25.720> further<00:05:26.229> away

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
out so the screws are are further away

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.659 
out so the screws are are further away
from<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:26.889> handle<00:05:27.280> and<00:05:27.550> you<00:05:28.449> can<00:05:29.520> screw<00:05:30.520> them

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
from the handle and you can screw them

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:36.589 
from the handle and you can screw them
in<00:05:31.710> and<00:05:33.750> you<00:05:34.750> have<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:34.930> go<00:05:35.110> back<00:05:35.349> and<00:05:35.620> forth

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
in and you have to go back and forth

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.200 
in and you have to go back and forth
because<00:05:37.599> if<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:37.870> screw<00:05:38.139> one<00:05:38.380> in<00:05:38.530> all<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.710> way

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
because if you screw one in all the way

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:53.670 
because if you screw one in all the way
the<00:05:40.210> other<00:05:40.240> one<00:05:40.630> will<00:05:40.750> be<00:05:40.870> too<00:05:41.050> far<00:05:41.080> up<00:05:52.680> okay

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
the other one will be too far up okay

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.420 
the other one will be too far up okay
all<00:05:54.310> right<00:05:54.930> so<00:05:55.930> that's<00:05:56.050> our<00:05:56.229> door<00:05:56.440> time<00:05:56.650> this

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
all right so that's our door time this

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.800 
all right so that's our door time this
is<00:05:57.610> a<00:05:57.639> strike<00:05:57.940> plate<00:05:58.150> these<00:05:58.419> are<00:05:58.569> pretty<00:05:58.690> much

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
is a strike plate these are pretty much

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.869 
is a strike plate these are pretty much
standard<00:05:59.250> for<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.310> last<00:06:00.490> 30<00:06:01.419> 40<00:06:01.750> 50<00:06:02.080> years<00:06:02.879> if

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:03.879 
standard for the last 30 40 50 years if

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:05.279 
standard for the last 30 40 50 years if
it's<00:06:04.090> an<00:06:04.180> older<00:06:04.449> door<00:06:04.629> it'll<00:06:04.810> have<00:06:04.930> something

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
it's an older door it'll have something

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.360 
it's an older door it'll have something
similar<00:06:05.530> to<00:06:05.770> this<00:06:05.889> and<00:06:06.990> it'll<00:06:07.990> up<00:06:08.440> the<00:06:08.979> screws

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
similar to this and it'll up the screws

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.740 
similar to this and it'll up the screws
will<00:06:09.639> be<00:06:10.289> pretty<00:06:11.289> standard<00:06:12.009> now<00:06:12.789> what<00:06:13.509> might

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
will be pretty standard now what might

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.330 
will be pretty standard now what might
have<00:06:13.930> happened<00:06:13.960> is<00:06:14.409> your<00:06:14.560> dorm<00:06:14.800> it'sh<00:06:15.069> may

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
have happened is your dorm it'sh may

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.649 
have happened is your dorm it'sh may
have<00:06:15.460> shifted<00:06:15.610> over<00:06:15.880> the<00:06:16.150> years<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:16.539> people

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
have shifted over the years and people

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.870 
have shifted over the years and people
may<00:06:16.930> have<00:06:17.080> made<00:06:17.949> some<00:06:18.190> kind<00:06:18.370> of<00:06:18.520> repairs

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
may have made some kind of repairs

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.969 
may have made some kind of repairs
moving<00:06:19.300> this<00:06:19.419> up<00:06:19.599> or<00:06:19.840> down<00:06:19.990> slightly<00:06:20.590> or<00:06:20.710> in<00:06:20.830> or

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
moving this up or down slightly or in or

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.260 
moving this up or down slightly or in or
out<00:06:22.349> so<00:06:23.349> hopefully<00:06:24.039> your<00:06:24.430> door<00:06:24.639> closes<00:06:24.940> to

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
out so hopefully your door closes to

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.519 
out so hopefully your door closes to
begin<00:06:25.569> with

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:26.529 
begin with

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:27.990 
begin with
and<00:06:26.860> if<00:06:27.009> that's<00:06:27.159> the<00:06:27.370> case<00:06:27.550> you<00:06:27.789> can<00:06:27.819> just

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
and if that's the case you can just

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.930 
and if that's the case you can just
replace<00:06:28.389> your<00:06:28.690> existing<00:06:29.169> strike<00:06:29.440> plate<00:06:29.940> if

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
replace your existing strike plate if

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.939 
replace your existing strike plate if
you<00:06:31.360> have<00:06:31.479> a<00:06:31.509> door<00:06:31.840> on<00:06:32.139> a<00:06:32.229> house<00:06:32.469> of<00:06:32.680> your<00:06:32.710> house

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
you have a door on a house of your house

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:37.589 
you have a door on a house of your house
is<00:06:33.190> older<00:06:33.490> than<00:06:33.639> 30<00:06:34.330> 40<00:06:34.690> 40<00:06:35.469> 50<00:06:35.800> years<00:06:36.599> you're

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
is older than 30 40 40 50 years you're

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:39.059 
is older than 30 40 40 50 years you're
going<00:06:37.690> to<00:06:37.779> likely<00:06:38.020> have<00:06:38.259> a<00:06:38.289> completely

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:39.069 
going to likely have a completely

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.490 
going to likely have a completely
different<00:06:39.250> latch<00:06:39.940> mechanism<00:06:40.210> which<00:06:40.990> is<00:06:41.020> going

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
different latch mechanism which is going

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.629 
different latch mechanism which is going
to<00:06:41.650> be<00:06:43.020> we're<00:06:44.020> in<00:06:44.139> quite<00:06:44.380> require<00:06:45.279> more<00:06:45.610> than

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 
to be we're in quite require more than

00:06:45.639 --> 00:07:01.580 
to be we're in quite require more than
just<00:06:45.849> a<00:06:46.150> simple<00:06:46.509> swap<00:06:46.810> out<00:06:47.080> of<00:06:47.819> of<00:06:48.819> a<00:06:48.969> doorknob

and<00:07:02.370> there<00:07:02.520> you<00:07:02.610> have<00:07:02.669> it<00:07:03.260> let's<00:07:04.260> see<00:07:04.500> how

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
and there you have it let's see how
