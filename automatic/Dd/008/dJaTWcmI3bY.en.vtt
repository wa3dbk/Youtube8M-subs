00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 Well now I'm whole and we're going to 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.969
 bring the solution to this puzzle 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.969
 second puzzle in this case of mercal 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.179
 let's start 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.770
 here as always you already know the 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.780
 reward that are the same as the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.330
 from experience 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.020
 and we are going to play against the stands 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.360
 let's start the puzzle 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.550
 and good as in the previous puzzle 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.680
 you have to take a good look at the situation in 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.680
 table in the charts that we can use 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.940
 we see that the hero has 7 life 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.380
 so we need to hit him 7 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.490
 only creature that we have access 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.110
 direct to hit the age of 3 we see that 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.740
 we have a creature to be able to move it 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.050
 his creature and another that moves us the 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.900
 ours and exchanged the position of 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.220
 wing exchanged the position between two 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.450
 our creatures 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.840
 good in this case this creature that 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.600
 move alone would serve 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.880
 for this bug because on the other line 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.350
 nothing ribera below there is a double line with 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.149
 which we are always going to stay one 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.429
 creature blocking so the two 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.120
 lines where we can interact go to 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.550
 dine the middle children 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.160
 we see that this creature the good exam 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.280
 he also has honor 1 with which if 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.820
 to be given a creature is going 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.900
 to dope the well then we're going to 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.880
 use here we're going to use the 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.950
 the spell that exchanges position with 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.650
 our creatures and our creature 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.990
 that is going to move yours for that 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.620
 first I need to have the two creatures 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.740
 in the middle line 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.990
 having access to attack if I moved is 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.810
 here he would lose the possibility of attacking 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.549
 With which 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.470
 what I'm going to do is exchange the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.570
 with another one that I can put here so 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.200
 first let's take this logo and what 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:09.330
 we went up here to him with the spell 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.979
 exchange it for the good moment that 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.030
 we got with this because the screenwriter 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.880
 can hit me and turn from the honor 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.640
 one to the creature below 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.330
 so the creature below can already 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.330
 paste from 4 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.780
 and as in the middle line was the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.540
 only we had the possibility of 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.930
 move this creature let's use this 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.310
 to move from your goalkeeper and we're going to 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.500
 finish with the glove hitting him 3 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.150
 As you can see, it was not very difficult the only thing 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.090
 that you had to realize is that the 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.090
 logo had to move first before 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.400
 this is the second puzzle was 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.400
 we will continue with the test
