00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 all 13 miners' files for there though 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:10.469
 not brand new video this game 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:21.619
 is the mind that is a genius that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:25.859
 schools to questions we will think of one by one 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.510
 game that is bob 777 welcome to a 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.939
 chi network 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.579
 yes right inside him inaki network 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.230
 then this this game this site 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.520
 something you will know it all 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.430
 so many of us are practically one 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.280
 character he he doubts the black gene 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.050
 this is the name of the web called door 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.300
 where he admits our age 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.460
 then let's play then then who 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.480
 we think we start thinking 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.390
 let's see start with carlo its account 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.489
 character of Italian nationality 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.899
 he of color 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.780
 his character is real the stories 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.820
 they say no but I have seen it intel 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.600
 then the real his character to that 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.790
 dealing with music is a black then or the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.670
 basketball player or is a musician 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.119
 so probably his character 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.710
 he died his character did not die 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:29.200
 a citizen of the united states 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:31.329
 Well well, Italian is not an African American 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.920
 there are united states is a 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.270
 character currently works in 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.219
 television 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.020
 no he doesn't work he does the filter in 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.310
 television and on characters a musician 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.840
 not yet 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.780
 his character has never been in 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.299
 I think that any prison as a black is respected 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.670
 the state has ever killed humans is 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.640
 because in prison if not he is the head of a 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.579
 group of people and falls his gang is 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.299
 a criminal bad to dark skin 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.460
 has dark skin has dark skin 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.450
 his character really exists 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:08.319
 We really see stanley tucci 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.610

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.000

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:54.370
 after centuries I thought we will look 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.740
 roberto carlino that I don't know who he is 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.570
 however it does that the advertising it does 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.310
 word of roberto carlino so now 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.200
 it is not but trying to do with the world 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.010
 I don't know about sport because I don't know who 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.820
 both 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:09.190
 I searched and clicked roberto carlos 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:14.110
 here it is this great echo to no one knows 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:17.380
 but who is boh is famous of ugly a 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.550

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.790
 90 is a father 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.680
 I do not know is an actor is a great actor 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.070
 why have that facial expression for 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.140
 make word of roberto carlino must 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.780
 be talented actors its 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.460
 character protagonist of a trilogy 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.620
 of an advertising trilogy 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.690
 all three beautiful so if his 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.790
 character plays bad roles 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.810
 in one or more films, I think it is ivan 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:49.400
 dragon nanni moretti and his character 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:53.940
 you pour yourself make-up in a strange way 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:57.390
 the phone will have a papa question but 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:04.770
 roberto carlino is put on in a strange way 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:07.170

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.320

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.380
 made a scale of humans for 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.930

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.500
