comes out lifting this lever and that is

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.570 
comes out lifting this lever and that is
the<00:02:44.270> actual<00:02:44.660> bobbin<00:02:45.170> itself<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.130> bobbin

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
the actual bobbin itself so the bobbin

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.460 
the actual bobbin itself so the bobbin
goes<00:02:47.480> into<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.470> casing<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:50.300> unit<00:02:50.840> goes

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
goes into the casing and that unit goes

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.730 
goes into the casing and that unit goes
into<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.370> housing<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.150> gets<00:02:53.900> closed<00:02:54.290> back<00:02:54.650> up

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.770 

so<00:02:57.740> I<00:02:57.770> mentioned<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.520> feed<00:02:58.790> dogs<00:02:59.150> when<00:02:59.540> this

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
so I mentioned the feed dogs when this

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.990 
so I mentioned the feed dogs when this
dial<00:03:00.140> is<00:03:00.650> pointed<00:03:01.450> turned<00:03:02.450> over<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.930> this<00:03:04.000> icon

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
dial is pointed turned over to this icon

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.650 
dial is pointed turned over to this icon
what<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:06.020> governs<00:03:06.590> is<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.760> feed<00:03:08.060> dogs<00:03:08.360> I'm

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
what that governs is the feed dogs I'm

over<00:05:33.800> here<00:05:34.340> I'm<00:05:34.550> turning<00:05:35.120> the<00:05:35.240> dial<00:05:35.510> to<00:05:35.990> the

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
over here I'm turning the dial to the

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.010 
over here I'm turning the dial to the
left<00:05:36.400> which<00:05:37.400> changes<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.240> position<00:05:38.420> to<00:05:38.900> the

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
left which changes the position to the

left coming back that's centered and

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.890 
left coming back that's centered and
then<00:05:42.890> it<00:05:43.040> goes<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:43.520> right<00:05:43.900> generally

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900

position in the center which means the

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.130 
position in the center which means the
this<00:05:50.660> dial<00:05:51.050> would<00:05:51.440> be<00:05:51.590> straight<00:05:51.950> up<00:05:51.980> and<00:05:52.220> down

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
this dial would be straight up and down

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.050 
this dial would be straight up and down
the<00:05:54.140> second<00:05:54.620> dial<00:05:54.920> is<00:05:55.280> the<00:05:55.520> buttonhole
