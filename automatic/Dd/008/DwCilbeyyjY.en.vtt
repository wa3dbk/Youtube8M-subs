00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.280 
envelope like this and just put my label
on<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.759> protects<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.329> plus<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.200> gives

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
on it and that protects it plus it gives

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
on it and that protects it plus it gives
us<00:02:01.439> something<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:01.950> me<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.130> put<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
us something that for me to put the

us something that for me to put the
label<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.630> that's<00:02:03.990> pretty<00:02:04.350> much<00:02:04.439> simply

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
label on so that's pretty much simply

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.319 
label on so that's pretty much simply
how<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.100> done<00:02:05.219> like<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.610> was<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> laser

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
how it's done like this was a laser

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.789 
how it's done like this was a laser
level<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.869> showed<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.229> video<00:02:07.439> earlier

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
level that I showed the video earlier

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.400 
level that I showed the video earlier
and<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:09.030> put<00:02:09.179> in

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
and I just put in

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.100 
and I just put in
his<00:02:09.650> padded<00:02:10.010> envelope<00:02:10.880> there's<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.660> dozen<00:02:11.840> golf

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
his padded envelope there's a dozen golf

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.460 
his padded envelope there's a dozen golf
balls<00:02:12.410> frigging<00:02:12.980> envelope<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.900> know<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.290> so

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
balls frigging envelope you know and so

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.130 
balls frigging envelope you know and so
on<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:15.890> hopefully<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:16.820> see<00:02:16.970> how<00:02:17.000> that's<00:02:17.300> done

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
on so hopefully you see how that's done

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.430 
on so hopefully you see how that's done

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.900 
it all I try to find a box that's just
the<00:02:50.720> right<00:02:50.900> size<00:02:51.140> for<00:02:51.700> everything<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:52.820> I'm

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
the right size for everything that I'm

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.160 
the right size for everything that I'm
shipping<00:02:53.120> but<00:02:53.450> sometimes<00:02:53.750> it's<00:02:53.900> guesswork

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
shipping but sometimes it's guesswork

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.200 
shipping but sometimes it's guesswork
but<00:02:54.560> anyway<00:02:55.190> I<00:02:55.220> put<00:02:55.400> all<00:02:55.520> my<00:02:55.550> big<00:02:55.790> items<00:02:56.090> in

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
but anyway I put all my big items in

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.990 
but anyway I put all my big items in
first<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.860> Wii<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.430> some<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.820> bigger

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
first the Wii and some of the bigger

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.490 
first the Wii and some of the bigger
boxes<00:02:59.300> that<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.540> prepackaged<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.260> put<00:03:00.350> all<00:03:00.470> that

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
boxes that I prepackaged to put all that

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.560 
boxes that I prepackaged to put all that
in<00:03:00.740> first<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.340> now<00:03:01.820> I'll<00:03:01.970> try<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.210> fill<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.510> in

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
in first and now I'll try to fill it in

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.390 
in first and now I'll try to fill it in
with<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.960> smaller<00:03:03.710> stuff<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.160> hopefully

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
with the smaller stuff and hopefully

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.080 
with the smaller stuff and hopefully
it'll<00:03:04.610> be<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.790> right<00:03:04.910> sized<00:03:05.120> box<00:03:06.970> all<00:03:07.970> right

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
it'll be the right sized box all right

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.090 
it'll be the right sized box all right
you<00:03:08.150> can<00:03:08.300> see<00:03:08.510> now<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:09.080> I've<00:03:09.230> kind<00:03:09.710> of<00:03:09.800> filled

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
you can see now that I've kind of filled

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.660 
you can see now that I've kind of filled
in<00:03:11.530> with<00:03:12.530> all<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:12.800> stuff<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.220> connected<00:03:13.580> with

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
in with all the stuff and connected with

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.490 
in with all the stuff and connected with
some<00:03:13.820> padded<00:03:14.600> envelopes<00:03:14.900> on<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.110> very<00:03:15.290> top

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
some padded envelopes on the very top

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.949 
some padded envelopes on the very top
and<00:03:15.530> I'm<00:03:15.800> almost<00:03:16.220> flush<00:03:16.490> to<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.760> top<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.750> it

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
and I'm almost flush to the top and it

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.230 
and I'm almost flush to the top and it
should<00:03:17.990> be<00:03:18.459> pretty<00:03:19.459> good<00:03:19.550> I<00:03:19.730> might<00:03:19.940> go<00:03:20.150> ahead

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
should be pretty good I might go ahead

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.330 
should be pretty good I might go ahead
and<00:03:20.420> put<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.570> little<00:03:20.750> bit<00:03:20.870> of<00:03:21.020> both<00:03:21.170> at<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.130> very

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
and put a little bit of both at the very

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.630 
and put a little bit of both at the very
top<00:03:22.580> there<00:03:22.990> but<00:03:23.990> it<00:03:24.709> should<00:03:24.890> be<00:03:25.010> ready<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.310> go

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
top there but it should be ready to go

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.060 
top there but it should be ready to go

and now I'll just weigh that and this

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
and now I'll just weigh that and this
huge<00:03:28.400> box<00:03:28.610> probably<00:03:29.150> weighs<00:03:29.330> about<00:03:29.890> 50<00:03:30.890> pounds

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.030 
huge box probably weighs about 50 pounds
typically<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.180> ship<00:03:32.390> this<00:03:32.650> somewhere<00:03:33.650> it

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
typically to ship this somewhere it

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.750 
typically to ship this somewhere it
would<00:03:34.160> be<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:34.750> don't<00:03:35.750> know<00:03:35.870> at<00:03:36.830> least<00:03:37.010> 30<00:03:37.370> or<00:03:37.520> 40

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
would be I don't know at least 30 or 40

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.880 
would be I don't know at least 30 or 40
bucks<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.209> it's<00:03:38.870> going<00:03:39.050> to<00:03:39.110> be<00:03:39.260> in<00:03:39.470> probably

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.860 
bucks and it's going to be in probably
the<00:03:40.010> mid<00:03:40.220> teens<00:03:40.520> I<00:03:40.790> would<00:03:40.940> say<00:03:41.120> it's<00:03:41.690> going<00:03:41.810> to

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
the mid teens I would say it's going to

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.210 
the mid teens I would say it's going to
be<00:03:41.930> about<00:03:42.080> 16<00:03:42.500> dollars<00:03:42.830> because<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.070> get

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
be about 16 dollars because I get

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.760 
be about 16 dollars because I get
amazon's<00:03:43.640> rapes<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.750> will<00:03:44.870> shipped<00:03:45.230> 41

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
items so that ends up being less than 50

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.170 
items so that ends up being less than 50
cents<00:03:47.690> per<00:03:47.870> item<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:49.070> now<00:03:49.489> Amazon's<00:03:49.970> going<00:03:50.120> to
