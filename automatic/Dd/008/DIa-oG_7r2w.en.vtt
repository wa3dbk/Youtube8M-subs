00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
well with that at our backs let's talk

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.190 
well with that at our backs let's talk
about<00:00:06.660> notebooks<00:00:07.760> now<00:00:08.760> before<00:00:09.480> we<00:00:09.870> get<00:00:09.990> into

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
about notebooks now before we get into

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.190 
about notebooks now before we get into
the<00:00:10.290> actual<00:00:10.710> notebooks<00:00:11.219> themselves<00:00:11.940> we<00:00:12.900> want

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the actual notebooks themselves we want

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.169 
the actual notebooks themselves we want
to<00:00:13.320> talk<00:00:13.530> about<00:00:13.710> some<00:00:14.099> technologies<00:00:14.880> and

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
to talk about some technologies and

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.170 
to talk about some technologies and
discoveries<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.839> we've<00:00:16.199> made<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:17.060> let<00:00:18.060> us

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
discoveries that we've made that let us

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.450 
discoveries that we've made that let us
look<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.630> build<00:00:18.900> notebooks<00:00:19.439> look<00:00:20.070> at<00:00:20.250> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
look and build notebooks look at and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.029 
look and build notebooks look at and
build<00:00:20.670> notebooks<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.270> some<00:00:21.449> new<00:00:21.660> ways<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039

first thing I'd like to talk about is
some<00:00:25.800> new<00:00:25.949> ways<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.369> build<00:00:26.550> notebooks<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
some new ways to build notebooks and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.689 
some new ways to build notebooks and
I've<00:00:27.900> asked<00:00:28.410> i'd<00:00:28.619> like<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> ask<00:00:29.010> Johnny<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.429> of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
now that one of the most significant

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.149 
now that one of the most significant
challenges<00:01:27.470> when<00:01:28.470> you're<00:01:28.619> designing<00:01:28.799> a

challenges when you're designing a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.510 
challenges when you're designing a

palmrest which is also made from a thin

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.530 
palmrest which is also made from a thin
piece<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.290> aluminium<00:02:31.700> requires<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.240> same

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
piece of aluminium requires the same

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.860 
piece of aluminium requires the same
sort<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.110> internal<00:02:34.620> structure<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:36.480> there's<00:02:36.780> a

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
sort of internal structure so there's a

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.810 
sort of internal structure so there's a
series<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.320> stiffening<00:02:37.920> plates<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.960> internal

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
series of stiffening plates and internal

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.850 
series of stiffening plates and internal
structural<00:02:41.820> frames<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:43.560> are<00:02:43.620> actually

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
structural frames that are actually

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.100 
structural frames that are actually
welded<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.090> underside<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.840> palmrest

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
welded to the underside of the palmrest

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.500 
welded to the underside of the palmrest
and<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:47.460> can<00:02:47.610> see<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.790> these<00:02:48.000> internal

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
and you can see that these internal

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.140 
and you can see that these internal
frames<00:02:48.750> also<00:02:49.410> provide<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.010> support<00:02:50.520> for<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
frames also provide the support for the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.520 
frames also provide the support for the
trackpad<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.870> for<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.890> keyboard<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:54.530> then

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
trackpad and for the keyboard and then

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.220 
trackpad and for the keyboard and then
finally<00:02:56.130> we<00:02:56.910> had<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.180> plastic<00:02:57.660> gasket<00:02:58.080> and

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
finally we had this plastic gasket and

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.540 
finally we had this plastic gasket and
that<00:02:58.350> helps<00:02:58.740> us<00:02:58.920> control<00:02:59.520> the<00:03:00.480> reveal<00:03:01.280> all<00:03:02.280> of

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
a new way of solving these problems and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.510 
a new way of solving these problems and
for<00:03:27.750> years<00:03:28.170> we've<00:03:28.890> been<00:03:29.040> looking<00:03:29.340> for<00:03:29.370> a

for years we've been looking for a

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.230 
for years we've been looking for a
better<00:03:29.940> way<00:03:30.240> of<00:03:30.480> building<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.260> notebook<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:32.240> we

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
better way of building a notebook and we

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.800 
better way of building a notebook and we
think<00:03:33.480> we<00:03:33.600> found<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:34.160> we<00:03:35.160> had<00:03:35.520> a<00:03:35.820> really

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
think we found it we had a really

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.490 
think we found it we had a really
significant<00:03:37.680> breakthrough<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:39.780> culminated

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
significant breakthrough that culminated

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
very thin piece of aluminium and then

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.490 
very thin piece of aluminium and then
add<00:04:14.070> multiple<00:04:14.970> multiple<00:04:15.120> parts<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:15.930> internal

add multiple multiple parts of internal
structure<00:04:17.690> we<00:04:18.690> discovered<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:20.310> if<00:04:20.459> we

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
structure we discovered that if we

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.340 
structure we discovered that if we
started<00:04:21.299> with<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.479> thick<00:04:21.810> piece<00:04:21.989> of<00:04:22.169> aluminium

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
started with a thick piece of aluminium

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.670 
started with a thick piece of aluminium
and<00:04:22.940> actually<00:04:23.940> removed<00:04:24.390> material<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.470> create

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
and actually removed material to create

mechanical

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.110 
mechanical
features<00:04:26.939> in<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.180> structure<00:04:28.639> we<00:04:29.639> discovered

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
features in the structure we discovered

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.629 
features in the structure we discovered
we<00:04:30.240> could<00:04:30.419> make<00:04:30.599> a<00:04:30.840> much<00:04:31.409> lighter<00:04:32.069> but

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
we could make a much lighter but

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.879 
we could make a much lighter but
importantly<00:04:33.360> much<00:04:33.629> stronger<00:04:34.229> part<00:04:34.500> and

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
importantly much stronger part and

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.249 
importantly much stronger part and
that's<00:04:35.849> exactly<00:04:36.030> how<00:04:36.539> we<00:04:36.599> make<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.840> palmrest

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
that's exactly how we make the palmrest

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.809 
that's exactly how we make the palmrest
for<00:04:38.069> the<00:04:38.129> macbook<00:04:38.340> air<00:04:40.340> so<00:04:41.340> we<00:04:41.460> make<00:04:41.639> the

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
for the macbook air so we make the

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.450 
for the macbook air so we make the
palmrest<00:04:42.439> actually<00:04:43.439> from<00:04:43.650> this<00:04:43.800> solid<00:04:44.250> piece

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
palmrest actually from this solid piece

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.610 
palmrest actually from this solid piece
of<00:04:44.610> aluminium<00:04:44.960> this<00:04:45.960> is<00:04:46.139> an<00:04:46.439> aluminium

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
of aluminium this is an aluminium

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.490 
of aluminium this is an aluminium
extrusion<00:04:47.550> that's<00:04:47.699> been<00:04:47.849> blanked<00:04:48.419> and<00:04:48.629> then

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
extrusion that's been blanked and then

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.890 
extrusion that's been blanked and then
goes<00:04:49.680> through<00:04:49.710> multiple<00:04:50.580> multiple<00:04:51.300> stages

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
goes through multiple multiple stages

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.429 
goes through multiple multiple stages
that<00:04:52.379> that<00:04:53.129> include<00:04:53.550> laser<00:04:53.849> scanning<00:04:54.509> laser

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:55.439 
that that include laser scanning laser

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.459 
that that include laser scanning laser
piercing<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.490> then<00:04:57.210> cnc<00:04:57.750> machining<00:04:58.289> that's

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:58.469 
piercing and then cnc machining that's

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:00.350 
piercing and then cnc machining that's
that's<00:04:58.740> computer<00:04:59.400> numerically<00:05:00.360> controlled

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
that's computer numerically controlled

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.089 
that's computer numerically controlled
machining<00:05:01.289> now<00:05:01.500> I'm<00:05:01.560> just<00:05:01.650> going<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:01.889> show<00:05:02.039> you

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
machining now I'm just going to show you

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.119 
machining now I'm just going to show you
a<00:05:02.189> few<00:05:02.430> of<00:05:02.490> those<00:05:02.699> stages<00:05:03.229> now<00:05:04.229> we<00:05:04.379> start<00:05:04.860> off

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
a few of those stages now we start off

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.369 
a few of those stages now we start off
by<00:05:05.370> creating<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:06.090> locating<00:05:06.689> features<00:05:07.139> now

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 
by creating the locating features now

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.290 
by creating the locating features now
these<00:05:07.500> are<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.740> features<00:05:08.129> that<00:05:08.340> are<00:05:08.669> constant

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
these are the features that are constant

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.730 
these are the features that are constant
width<00:05:09.419> apart<00:05:09.569> that<00:05:10.050> follow<00:05:10.259> it<00:05:10.409> all<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.620> way

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
width apart that follow it all the way

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.850 
width apart that follow it all the way
through<00:05:11.099> the<00:05:11.219> process<00:05:12.500> then<00:05:13.500> we<00:05:13.590> then<00:05:13.740> go

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
through the process then we then go

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.490 
through the process then we then go
through<00:05:14.099> a<00:05:14.129> very<00:05:14.430> noisy<00:05:14.689> survey<00:05:15.689> noisy<00:05:16.199> stage

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
through a very noisy survey noisy stage

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.830 
through a very noisy survey noisy stage
which<00:05:16.800> we<00:05:16.949> call<00:05:17.159> rough<00:05:17.400> cutting<00:05:17.699> where<00:05:18.629> we're

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
which we call rough cutting where we're

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.080 
which we call rough cutting where we're
removing<00:05:19.139> large<00:05:19.860> amounts<00:05:20.279> of<00:05:20.340> material<00:05:20.460> very

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
removing large amounts of material very

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.529 
removing large amounts of material very
quickly<00:05:22.250> we<00:05:23.250> create<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.759> holes<00:05:24.000> for<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.300> key

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
quickly we create the holes for the key

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.740 
quickly we create the holes for the key
caps<00:05:24.870> and<00:05:25.580> then<00:05:26.580> machine<00:05:26.909> the<00:05:27.029> perimeter<00:05:27.569> and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
caps and then machine the perimeter and

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.570 
caps and then machine the perimeter and
at<00:05:27.990> this<00:05:28.139> stage<00:05:28.409> we<00:05:28.439> also<00:05:28.710> create<00:05:29.219> some<00:05:29.400> of<00:05:29.430> the

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
at this stage we also create some of the

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.339 
at this stage we also create some of the
mechanical<00:05:30.150> features<00:05:30.389> like<00:05:30.930> some<00:05:31.139> of<00:05:31.259> the

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
mechanical features like some of the

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.129 
mechanical features like some of the
screw<00:05:31.620> bosses<00:05:32.069> and<00:05:32.300> then<00:05:33.300> towards<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:33.750> end<00:05:33.839> we

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
screw bosses and then towards the end we

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.219 
screw bosses and then towards the end we
finally<00:05:34.620> beat<00:05:34.889> blast<00:05:35.190> apart<00:05:35.699> and<00:05:36.029> an<00:05:36.810> anodized

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
finally beat blast apart and an anodized

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.200 
finally beat blast apart and an anodized
ER<00:05:38.210> now<00:05:39.620> one<00:05:40.620> of<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:40.860> fantastic<00:05:41.099> things<00:05:41.940> about

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
ER now one of the fantastic things about

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.529 
ER now one of the fantastic things about
aluminium<00:05:42.810> is<00:05:43.110> how<00:05:43.319> recyclable<00:05:44.099> it<00:05:44.190> is<00:05:44.539> so

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
aluminium is how recyclable it is so

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.779 
aluminium is how recyclable it is so
that<00:05:45.690> at<00:05:45.779> each<00:05:46.050> of<00:05:46.440> these<00:05:46.650> distinct<00:05:47.520> stages

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
that at each of these distinct stages

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:49.999 
that at each of these distinct stages
we're<00:05:48.659> continually<00:05:49.289> collecting<00:05:49.889> the

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
we're continually collecting the

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.730 
we're continually collecting the
material<00:05:50.610> and<00:05:50.900> cleaning<00:05:51.900> it<00:05:52.020> and<00:05:52.139> then

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
material and cleaning it and then

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.790 
material and cleaning it and then
recycling<00:05:53.400> it<00:05:55.009> so<00:05:56.009> we<00:05:56.849> started<00:05:57.539> with<00:05:58.349> a<00:05:58.379> solid

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
recycling it so we started with a solid

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.360 
recycling it so we started with a solid
slab<00:05:59.219> of<00:05:59.279> aluminium<00:05:59.669> high<00:06:00.389> grade<00:06:00.750> aluminium

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
slab of aluminium high grade aluminium

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.860 
slab of aluminium high grade aluminium
that<00:06:02.370> weighed<00:06:02.610> over<00:06:02.789> two<00:06:03.150> and<00:06:03.300> a<00:06:03.360> half<00:06:03.539> pounds

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
that weighed over two and a half pounds

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.839 
that weighed over two and a half pounds
and<00:06:05.089> we<00:06:06.089> end<00:06:06.330> with<00:06:06.719> this<00:06:07.469> remarkably<00:06:08.400> precise

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
and we end with this remarkably precise

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.659 
and we end with this remarkably precise
part<00:06:09.240> that<00:06:10.229> now<00:06:10.409> only<00:06:10.620> weighs<00:06:10.889> a<00:06:10.919> quarter<00:06:11.310> of<00:06:11.490> a

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
part that now only weighs a quarter of a

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.490 
part that now only weighs a quarter of a
pound<00:06:11.849> and<00:06:12.680> it's<00:06:13.680> not<00:06:13.889> only<00:06:14.039> incredibly<00:06:14.789> light

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
pound and it's not only incredibly light

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.269 
pound and it's not only incredibly light
it's<00:06:16.500> very<00:06:17.009> very<00:06:17.310> strong<00:06:17.699> that<00:06:18.210> one<00:06:18.569> part<00:06:19.279> just

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:20.279 
it's very very strong that one part just

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:23.659 
it's very very strong that one part just
that<00:06:20.490> single<00:06:20.789> part<00:06:21.240> forms<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.259> structure<00:06:22.949> for

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
that single part forms the structure for

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.529 
that single part forms the structure for
the<00:06:23.699> macbook<00:06:23.939> air<00:06:25.460> now<00:06:26.460> it<00:06:26.639> really<00:06:26.969> is<00:06:27.210> this

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
the macbook air now it really is this

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.899 
the macbook air now it really is this
highly<00:06:28.259> precise<00:06:28.740> aluminium<00:06:29.610> unibody

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
highly precise aluminium unibody

highly precise aluminium unibody
enclosure<00:06:30.569> that<00:06:31.409> made<00:06:31.620> this<00:06:31.860> product

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
enclosure that made this product

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.189 
enclosure that made this product
possible<00:06:34.459> so<00:06:35.459> this<00:06:35.669> this<00:06:36.149> new<00:06:36.599> way<00:06:36.870> of

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 
possible so this this new way of

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.500 
possible so this this new way of
building<00:06:38.159> a<00:06:38.399> notebook

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
building a notebook

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.160 
building a notebook
that<00:06:39.750> we<00:06:39.870> pioneered<00:06:40.500> here<00:06:40.980> I<00:06:41.990> obviously<00:06:42.990> has<00:06:43.140> a

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.170 
that we pioneered here I obviously has a

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.730 
that we pioneered here I obviously has a
relevance<00:06:43.530> beyond<00:06:44.190> the<00:06:44.430> macbook<00:06:44.790> air<00:06:45.000> and

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
relevance beyond the macbook air and

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.130 
relevance beyond the macbook air and
we've<00:06:46.740> been<00:06:46.950> working<00:06:47.130> super<00:06:47.850> hard<00:06:48.060> on<00:06:48.750> trying

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
we've been working super hard on trying

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.280 
we've been working super hard on trying
to<00:06:49.320> design<00:06:49.650> some<00:06:50.220> new<00:06:50.550> unibody<00:06:51.450> enclosures
