 in, among other things, Poland is spring 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.980
 america is of course always a good team on my diary, among other things 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.609
 notice here 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.210
 and the sweden the year 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.359
 that can also be achieved by making a roomkeeper with 2 0 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.710
 Max Sin and especially with Terneuzen as Hammar which is in good shape after China 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.159
 is 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.460
 in the Netherlands 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.560
 the job 2 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.560
 start swimmer for the Netherlands

 dekker the butterfly stroke specialist there was a fourth in 50 meters 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.190

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.960
 today and 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 Dekker is going to look great 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.180
 halfway through 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.830
 already in first place 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.020
 followed by america and sweden 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.080
 Americans have South Korea in the water with a 5 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.820
 a job 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.370
 the australian mitchell a rients month dekker goes the outstanding on the 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.350
 guidance now and not just a little too 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.070
 this is a beautiful city 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.490
 Dutch formation and such a step is important that gives confidence 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.710
 gives energy 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.050
 50 52 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.020
 100 meters that is a personal record 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.290
 for indoor over the first 100 meters 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.920
 for the Netherlands in the water retailers ago 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.920
 who seems to be getting better at this tournament 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.770
 slowly but sliding and sweden 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.210
 in lane 6 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.170
 the ways alshammar in the water sweden in a second position but still 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.130
 a 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.820
 wide lead for sweden and the netherlands 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.240
 America dropped to third place and what is Australia about? 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.260
 has it here internally 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.250
 where are you 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.310
 australia in lane five america bases sweden but still in the lead 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.780
 hinkelien schreuder 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.780
 that has been unleashed 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.529
 Alshammar is now approaching 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:18.009
 in lane 6, but that difference is still in favor of the Netherlands 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.769
 about six tenths of a second 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.769
 chantal large is the second swimmer for 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.799
 Schreuder clocked in excellent 53 63 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.819
 for sweden that does second place lies in lane 6 third of upper arms 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.859
 karim kämmerling 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.629
 there is kämmerling 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.239
 the butterfly specialist can also be very good about the freestyle from the 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.269
 feet and she is getting closer 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.739
 animal head start of the netherlands australia is now in third place america 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.049
 collapsed completely 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.719
 and what are the Chinese who come out of the play for nothing? 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:59.549
 the fight therefore defends a hovel and kämmerling major with hand and tooth after one 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.519
 leading position it seems that coming left has given something too much 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.899
 the first fifty meters although it is their fault there is virtually nil 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.699
 why the fight 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.659
 these people at matsson 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.449
 Marleen Veldhuis and Veldhuis 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:20.089
 what's wrong she has set up the outboard motor 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.689
 what is this going terribly fast in the meantime is also very promising 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:29.870
 look after the world record that stands at three 34 55 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.299
 was swum in a 97 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.459
 through china a doping in the pit and the Netherlands is under it and not such 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.249
 bit also field house for the last fifty meters the gold I will certainly 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:46.890
 live the lead is huge the battle for the silver between australia 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.969
 and sweden but it is about the battle between field house 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.339
 the clock 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:54.749
 once again 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:56.569
 34 35 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.699
 was the world record he now sees 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.299
 who declare the world record schedule and stay at home far ahead 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:07.969
 for the Netherlands 3 33 32 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.159
 and a new world record 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.209
 this team also set a world record in the four times 50 meters freestyle 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.259
 During the EK final round, March first sets a record 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.259
 that state 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.879
 this makes a great impression 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:32.969
 Of course the lack of 2009 allows the union no idea how to do everything 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:37.149
 we are making marleen Veldhuis together with chantal big shopkeepers ago 

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:38.460
 tenth decks 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.979
 they write you anyway 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.979
 little sport history 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.200
 great the last hundred meters for men in field houses 52 17 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.200
 had swum the third fastest time ever 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:02.299
 and not to touch a great thinker enschede 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:11.239
 ronse in athens during the olympic games fourth place in the langbaan world cup 

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:14.239
 in the final minute the gold 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.339
 ruud vormer 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.339
 By the Ministry must pass the Chinese waters 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.580
 Are you not a real if a crazy job starts like crazy? 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.580
 to bring attention 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.789
 After that I was more than satisfied 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.789
 but we are all there 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.779
 I went to the sweden that goes towards the opponent in the beginning 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:45.999
 I must honestly say that I have not seen anything at banks 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.999
 what well i disagree with that 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:51.589
 after i year 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.439
 still der staaij 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.490
 but yes kept there with his own name 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.250
 that is a windfall of being opposed to are you also people who are this 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.250
 it is my last term on the water side 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.300
 an EBITDA of C1000 in the lead especially the first notification that there is still 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.229
 this cabinet period 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.389
 we even have my way
