00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.350 

okay<00:00:01.079> what<00:00:01.230> I'm<00:00:01.319> going<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.469> show<00:00:01.589> you<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.770> three

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:02.360 
okay what I'm going to show you a three

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.999 
okay what I'm going to show you a three
Steadicam<00:00:03.360> techniques<00:00:03.899> or<00:00:04.200> ways<00:00:04.470> you're

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
Steadicam techniques or ways you're

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.530 
Steadicam techniques or ways you're
using<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.400> tripod<00:00:05.850> so<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.060> get<00:00:06.180> smoother

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
using a tripod so you get smoother

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.780 
using a tripod so you get smoother
footage<00:00:07.160> there's<00:00:08.160> always<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.340> problem<00:00:08.580> with

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
footage there's always a problem with

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.030 
footage there's always a problem with
particularly<00:00:09.719> when<00:00:09.900> film<00:00:10.139> with<00:00:10.290> DSLRs<00:00:10.889> when

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
particularly when film with DSLRs when

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.350 
particularly when film with DSLRs when
you're<00:00:11.130> holding<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.460> camera<00:00:11.700> like<00:00:12.000> this<00:00:12.150> you

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
you're holding the camera like this you

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.209 
you're holding the camera like this you
try<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.599> tuck<00:00:12.780> your<00:00:12.929> arms<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.559> make<00:00:14.070> it

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
try and tuck your arms in to make it

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.369 
try and tuck your arms in to make it
that<00:00:14.340> more<00:00:14.519> slip<00:00:14.790> much<00:00:15.000> more<00:00:15.210> stable<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:16.139> you

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
that more slip much more stable but you

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.710 
that more slip much more stable but you
still<00:00:16.650> end<00:00:16.890> up<00:00:17.039> getting<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.520> shake<00:00:17.880> from

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
still end up getting that shake from

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.880 
still end up getting that shake from
your<00:00:18.840> hands<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.140> it's<00:00:19.320> really<00:00:19.500> difficult<00:00:19.619> to

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
your hands and it's really difficult to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.390 
your hands and it's really difficult to
get<00:00:19.980> rid<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:21.859> dslr's<00:00:22.859> are<00:00:23.039> particularly

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
get rid of and dslr's are particularly

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.650 
get rid of and dslr's are particularly
bad<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.910> because<00:00:24.029> they're<00:00:24.180> quite<00:00:24.359> light

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
bad for that because they're quite light

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.460 
bad for that because they're quite light
cameras<00:00:25.199> but<00:00:26.130> also<00:00:26.630> you<00:00:27.630> know<00:00:27.750> TV<00:00:28.050> cameras

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
cameras but also you know TV cameras

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.550 
cameras but also you know TV cameras
have<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.890> image<00:00:29.189> stabilization<00:00:29.550> built<00:00:30.090> in

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
have that image stabilization built in

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.139 
have that image stabilization built in
the<00:00:31.560> DSLRs<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.219> ever<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> lens<00:00:32.790> but

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the DSLRs do ever on the lens but

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.510 
the DSLRs do ever on the lens but
they're<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:33.420> quite<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:34.320> good<00:00:34.620> as<00:00:34.800> TV<00:00:35.100> cameras

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
they're not quite as good as TV cameras

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.660 
they're not quite as good as TV cameras
for<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.800> good<00:00:38.340> image

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
for that so how do we get good image

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.220 
for that so how do we get good image
stabilization<00:00:39.090> well<00:00:39.510> there's<00:00:39.660> one<00:00:39.809> technique

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
stabilization well there's one technique

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.139 
stabilization well there's one technique
very<00:00:40.890> simple<00:00:41.309> technique<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.730> place<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
very simple technique you place the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.760 
very simple technique you place the
camera<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.510> top<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.870> your<00:00:42.960> tripod<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.559> this

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
camera on top of your tripod like this

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.029 
camera on top of your tripod like this
the<00:00:44.640> extra<00:00:45.030> weight<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:46.530> bit<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the extra weight and a bit of a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.190 
the extra weight and a bit of a
counterbalance<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.910> bottom<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.570> mean

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
counterbalance at the bottom here mean

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.650 
counterbalance at the bottom here mean
that<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.739> get<00:00:49.950> rid<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> shake<00:00:50.850> as

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
that you can get rid of the shake as

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.029 
that you can get rid of the shake as
long<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.960> don't<00:00:52.050> grip<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.649> hold<00:00:52.890> it

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
long as you don't grip it you hold it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.729 
long as you don't grip it you hold it
loosely<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> simply<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.530> that

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
loosely like this so simply like that

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.029 
loosely like this so simply like that
and<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.460> try<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.670> keep<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.120> steady<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.829> sort

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and you try and keep it steady and sort

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.849 
and you try and keep it steady and sort
of<00:00:59.100> move<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> around<00:00:59.460> like<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.649> it<00:01:01.649> works

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
of move it around like this it works

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.789 
of move it around like this it works
reasonably<00:01:02.430> well<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.879> not<00:01:03.030> amazing

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
reasonably well it's not amazing

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.200 
reasonably well it's not amazing
particularly<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.010> comes<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.820> sort

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
particularly when it comes to this sort

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.899 
particularly when it comes to this sort
of<00:01:06.240> movement<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.979> even<00:01:08.250> hold<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.640> but

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
of movement it can even hold this but

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.399 
of movement it can even hold this but
you<00:01:09.000> mustn't<00:01:09.210> grab<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.930> otherwise<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
you mustn't grab like that otherwise it

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.899 
you mustn't grab like that otherwise it
transfers<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> shake<00:01:11.220> into<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.700> tripod

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
transfers the shake into the tripod

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.170 
transfers the shake into the tripod
again<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.400> movement<00:01:14.850> here

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
again so it's this this movement here

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.149 
again so it's this this movement here
that<00:01:15.689> ends<00:01:15.810> up<00:01:15.930> looking<00:01:16.110> shaky<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.040> when

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that ends up looking shaky so when

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.340 
that ends up looking shaky so when
you're<00:01:17.280> trying<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.520> pan<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.990> instead<00:01:19.290> of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
you're trying to pan so instead of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.320 
you're trying to pan so instead of
panning<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> sort<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.340> move<00:01:21.000> around

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
panning you have to sort of move around

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.140 
panning you have to sort of move around
like<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.470> okay<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.340> slowly<00:01:23.580> move<00:01:23.759> around

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
like this okay so you slowly move around

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.770 
like this okay so you slowly move around
and<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.170> still<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.460> bit<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> bit<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
and it is still it's a bit of a bit of

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.870 
and it is still it's a bit of a bit of
an<00:01:27.930> art<00:01:28.080> still<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.159> does<00:01:29.340> take<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> bit<00:01:29.850> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
an art still and it does take a bit of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.550 
an art still and it does take a bit of
practice

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
practice

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.929 
practice
the<00:01:31.560> other<00:01:31.680> technique<00:01:31.920> which<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.700> probably

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the other technique which is probably

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.429 
the other technique which is probably
slightly<00:01:33.150> better<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> bit<00:01:34.110> more<00:01:34.259> awkward

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
slightly better but a bit more awkward

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:48.459 
slightly better but a bit more awkward
is<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.369> extend<00:01:35.700> all<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.850> legs<00:01:36.119> out

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.300 

okay<00:01:49.469> and<00:01:49.859> then<00:01:50.280> bring<00:01:50.850> your<00:01:50.880> tripod<00:01:51.299> head

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
okay and then bring your tripod head

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.270 
okay and then bring your tripod head
down<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.700> level<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.929> and<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
down so it's level like this and the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.340 
down so it's level like this and the
reason<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.609> this<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.539> probably<00:01:58.170> won't

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
reason for this is I probably won't

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.559 
reason for this is I probably won't
display<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> legs<00:01:58.950> at<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.280> much<00:01:59.520> is<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.390> try

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
display the legs at that much is to try

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.830 
display the legs at that much is to try
and<00:02:00.719> find<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.079> middle<00:02:01.259> point<00:02:02.299> just<00:02:03.299> about

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and find the middle point just about

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.219 
and find the middle point just about
there<00:02:05.329> okay<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.129> this<00:02:08.129> will<00:02:08.340> keep<00:02:09.049> is<00:02:10.049> it

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
there okay and this will keep is it

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.750 
there okay and this will keep is it
works<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.590> as<00:02:10.709> counterbalance<00:02:11.310> again<00:02:11.549> you've

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
works is as counterbalance again you've

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.280 
works is as counterbalance again you've
got<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.940> front<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.540> back<00:02:12.720> with<00:02:13.049> the<00:02:13.140> same

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
got the front and the back with the same

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.020 
got the front and the back with the same
weight<00:02:13.590> obviously<00:02:14.129> I'll<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.610> camera<00:02:14.940> on

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
weight obviously I'll have a camera on

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.100 
weight obviously I'll have a camera on
the<00:02:15.120> end<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.330> cameras<00:02:15.660> there<00:02:15.840> at<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.019> moment

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
the end the cameras there at the moment

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.720 
the end the cameras there at the moment
sitting<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.739> end<00:02:16.829> and<00:02:17.099> you'll<00:02:17.640> probably

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
sitting on the end and you'll probably

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.430 
sitting on the end and you'll probably
need<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.120> come<00:02:18.269> this<00:02:18.450> way<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:18.660> bit<00:02:18.840> more<00:02:19.019> because

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
need to come this way a bit more because

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.319 
need to come this way a bit more because
they'll<00:02:19.680> have<00:02:19.829> more<00:02:20.040> weight<00:02:20.220> on<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.489> end<00:02:20.519> so

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
they'll have more weight on the end so

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.670 
they'll have more weight on the end so
your<00:02:21.480> counterbalance<00:02:22.019> will<00:02:22.110> be<00:02:22.170> closer<00:02:22.440> up

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
your counterbalance will be closer up

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.300 
your counterbalance will be closer up
you<00:02:23.220> can<00:02:23.370> always<00:02:23.519> extend<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.480> end<00:02:24.629> as<00:02:24.840> well

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
you can always extend the end as well

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.119 
you can always extend the end as well
using<00:02:26.310> your<00:02:27.590> really<00:02:28.590> bit<00:02:28.739> here<00:02:28.980> and

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
using your really bit here and

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.839 
using your really bit here and
whatsoever<00:02:30.530> okay<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.340> you're<00:02:32.459> trying<00:02:32.579> to<00:02:32.700> find

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
whatsoever okay so you're trying to find

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.690 
whatsoever okay so you're trying to find
the<00:02:32.940> counterbalance<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.280> then<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.400> can<00:02:35.519> move

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
the counterbalance and then you can move

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.759 
the counterbalance and then you can move
that<00:02:35.879> around<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.510> I'll<00:02:37.319> show<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.590> some

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
that around and I'll show you some

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.580 
that around and I'll show you some
footage<00:02:37.920> like<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.879> in<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.060> second<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.440> your

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
footage like that in a second and your

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.680 
footage like that in a second and your
aim<00:02:40.799> this<00:02:41.310> that's<00:02:41.760> one<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.269> problems<00:02:42.569> with

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
aim this that's one of the problems with

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.360 
aim this that's one of the problems with
this<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:43.079> that<00:02:43.319> you've<00:02:43.440> got<00:02:43.650> these<00:02:43.769> huge<00:02:44.129> legs

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
this is that you've got these huge legs

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.979 
this is that you've got these huge legs
sticking<00:02:44.730> out<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.030> back<00:02:45.180> depending<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
sticking out the back depending on the

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.809 
sticking out the back depending on the
weight<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.290> camera<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.129> they<00:02:47.639> might

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
weight of the camera and they might

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.430 
weight of the camera and they might
knock<00:02:48.239> against<00:02:48.599> things<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.170> will<00:02:49.290> ruin

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
knock against things and that will ruin

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.559 
knock against things and that will ruin
your<00:02:49.650> shot<00:02:50.810> but<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.319> does<00:02:52.829> work<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:54.450> other

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
your shot but it does work the other

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.259 
your shot but it does work the other
thing<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.900> note<00:02:55.079> about<00:02:55.109> it<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:56.120> don't<00:02:57.120> just

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
thing to note about it is don't just

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.599 
thing to note about it is don't just
stand<00:02:57.420> upright<00:02:57.690> I'll<00:02:58.620> move<00:02:58.859> around<00:02:59.099> and<00:02:59.430> move

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
stand upright I'll move around and move

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.849 
stand upright I'll move around and move
your<00:02:59.760> arm<00:02:59.940> up<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.269> down<00:03:00.359> like<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:00.870> try<00:03:01.739> and

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
your arm up and down like this try and

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.039 
your arm up and down like this try and
keep<00:03:01.950> all<00:03:02.160> this<00:03:02.430> level<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.540> bend<00:03:03.750> your<00:03:03.840> knees

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
keep all this level so bend your knees

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.920 
keep all this level so bend your knees
and<00:03:04.700> walk<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.760> little<00:03:05.880> bit<00:03:06.030> weirdly<00:03:06.359> but<00:03:06.750> sort

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
and walk a little bit weirdly but sort

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.170 
and walk a little bit weirdly but sort
of<00:03:06.959> flat-footed<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.370> try<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:08.910> get<00:03:09.090> that

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
of flat-footed so to try and get that

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.330 
of flat-footed so to try and get that
smooth<00:03:09.540> shot<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.709> see<00:03:10.859> that<00:03:11.040> should

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
smooth shot and can you see that should

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.270 
smooth shot and can you see that should
be<00:03:11.489> fairly<00:03:12.030> stable<00:03:12.769> just<00:03:13.769> trying<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.130> keep

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
be fairly stable just trying to keep

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.849 
be fairly stable just trying to keep
that<00:03:14.459> in<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> same<00:03:15.030> position<00:03:15.480> as<00:03:16.079> you<00:03:16.560> move

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
that in the same position as you move

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.890 
that in the same position as you move
around<00:03:17.099> a<00:03:17.370> little<00:03:18.329> bit<00:03:18.419> tricky<00:03:18.750> because

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
around a little bit tricky because

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.720 
around a little bit tricky because
you're<00:03:19.709> trying<00:03:19.889> to<00:03:19.950> look<00:03:20.069> at<00:03:20.190> your<00:03:20.310> if<00:03:20.609> you

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
you're trying to look at your if you

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.300 
you're trying to look at your if you
find<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.269> look<00:03:22.169> at<00:03:22.319> maybe<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.680> action<00:03:23.040> as<00:03:23.160> well

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
find a look at maybe the action as well

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.580 
find a look at maybe the action as well
and<00:03:23.730> trying<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.180> not<00:03:24.630> bump<00:03:24.930> into<00:03:25.079> things<00:03:25.380> with

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
and trying to not bump into things with

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.559 
and trying to not bump into things with
the<00:03:25.680> back<00:03:25.859> there<00:03:26.130> but<00:03:26.940> I'll<00:03:27.030> show<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.269> some

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
the back there but I'll show you some

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.110 
the back there but I'll show you some
footage<00:03:28.169> of<00:03:28.410> what<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.650> looks<00:03:28.889> like<00:03:29.030> in<00:03:30.030> a

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
footage of what that looks like in a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.020 
footage of what that looks like in a
second<00:03:31.430> lastly<00:03:32.430> it's<00:03:32.579> not<00:03:32.730> an<00:03:32.819> image

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
second lastly it's not an image

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.670 
second lastly it's not an image
stabilization<00:03:33.419> technique<00:03:34.079> but<00:03:34.290> it's<00:03:34.410> quite

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
stabilization technique but it's quite

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.449 
stabilization technique but it's quite
handy<00:03:35.250> one<00:03:36.620> for<00:03:37.620> trying<00:03:37.889> to<00:03:37.950> get<00:03:38.069> this<00:03:38.190> sort<00:03:38.430> of

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
handy one for trying to get this sort of

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.589 
handy one for trying to get this sort of
professional<00:03:39.269> looking<00:03:39.480> jib<00:03:40.319> shot<00:03:41.299> you<00:03:42.299> change

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
professional looking jib shot you change

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.180 
professional looking jib shot you change
your<00:03:42.780> tripod<00:03:43.169> into<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.950> monopod<00:03:44.730> with<00:03:45.540> one<00:03:46.109> leg

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
your tripod into a monopod with one leg

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.300 
your tripod into a monopod with one leg
you<00:03:49.150> get<00:03:49.360> your<00:03:51.240> you<00:03:52.240> can<00:03:52.390> loosen<00:03:52.960> this<00:03:53.170> off<00:03:53.380> and

you get your you can loosen this off and

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.000 
you get your you can loosen this off and
then<00:03:54.640> you<00:03:54.730> can<00:03:54.910> move<00:03:55.120> in<00:03:56.080> with<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.680> sort<00:03:56.980> of

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
then you can move in with a sort of

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.470 
then you can move in with a sort of
tracking<00:03:57.720> chip<00:03:58.720> shot<00:03:59.250> into<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.280> camera<00:04:00.850> and

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
tracking chip shot into the camera and

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.310 
tracking chip shot into the camera and
you<00:04:01.630> can<00:04:01.810> move<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:01.990> across<00:04:03.750> like<00:04:04.750> this<00:04:04.930> as<00:04:05.140> well

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
you can move it across like this as well

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.750 
you can move it across like this as well
so<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.680> get<00:04:05.860> this<00:04:05.950> sort<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.690> track<00:04:07.690> shot<00:04:08.380> again

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
so you get this sort of track shot again

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.400 
so you get this sort of track shot again
okay<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:09.820> moving<00:04:10.270> it<00:04:10.420> around<00:04:10.510> like<00:04:11.020> this<00:04:11.140> the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
okay so moving it around like this the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.830 
okay so moving it around like this the
only<00:04:11.440> problem<00:04:11.890> is<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.070> can't<00:04:12.420> go<00:04:13.420> like<00:04:13.570> that

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
only problem is you can't go like that

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.440 
only problem is you can't go like that
because<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.680> turns<00:04:15.130> your<00:04:15.310> camera<00:04:15.670> so<00:04:15.970> it's

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
because it turns your camera so it's

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.160 
because it turns your camera so it's
sort<00:04:16.600> of<00:04:16.660> basically<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.170> and<00:04:17.410> in<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.400> out<00:04:18.459> one

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
sort of basically it and in and out one

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.370 
sort of basically it and in and out one
but<00:04:20.170> quite<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.470> nice<00:04:20.680> option<00:04:22.320> okay<00:04:23.320> so

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
but quite a nice option okay so

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.200 
but quite a nice option okay so
hopefully<00:04:23.740> those<00:04:24.010> three<00:04:24.280> techniques<00:04:24.640> should

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
hopefully those three techniques should

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.450 
hopefully those three techniques should
