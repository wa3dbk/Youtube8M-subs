that<00:00:33.559> makes<00:00:33.860> a<00:00:33.980> very<00:00:34.160> interesting<00:00:34.550> microphone

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
that makes a very interesting microphone

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.150 
that makes a very interesting microphone
because<00:00:35.210> it<00:00:35.510> has<00:00:35.720> processing<00:00:36.500> built<00:00:36.710> into<00:00:37.040> it

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
because it has processing built into it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.939 
because it has processing built into it
phantom<00:00:37.850> powered<00:00:38.120> electronics<00:00:38.690> so<00:00:39.470> what<00:00:39.830> do

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
phantom powered electronics so what do

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.590 
phantom powered electronics so what do
we<00:00:40.010> actually<00:00:40.070> need<00:00:40.460> in<00:00:40.670> a<00:00:40.730> microphone<00:00:41.120> this<00:00:41.480> is

and it knows exactly what kind of
performance<00:01:30.170> they're<00:01:30.500> going<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.710> do<00:01:30.829> so<00:01:31.820> how

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
performance they're going to do so how

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.550 
performance they're going to do so how
do<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.149> reprogram<00:01:32.420> this<00:01:32.810> thing<00:01:33.020> looks<00:01:33.229> inside

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
do you reprogram this thing looks inside

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.289 
do you reprogram this thing looks inside
the<00:01:33.710> microphone<00:01:34.130> well<00:01:34.609> the<00:01:34.729> programming<00:01:35.210> is

the electronics yeah the electronics it

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.429 
the electronics yeah the electronics it
is<00:01:54.939> removed<00:01:55.299> from<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.659> microphone<00:01:55.960> through

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
is removed from the microphone through

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.120 
is removed from the microphone through
the<00:01:56.560> end<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:58.710> reprogramming<00:01:59.710> is<00:01:59.920> done

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
the end and reprogramming is done

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.090 
the end and reprogramming is done
through<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.399> series<00:02:00.640> of<00:02:01.380> shuns<00:02:02.380> on<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.710> end<00:02:02.890> and

through a series of shuns on the end and

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.700 
through a series of shuns on the end and
the<00:02:03.880> online<00:02:04.479> programming<00:02:04.960> tool<00:02:05.200> tells<00:02:05.530> you

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
the online programming tool tells you

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.339 
the online programming tool tells you
how<00:02:05.799> to<00:02:05.860> set<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.159> up<00:02:06.569> it's<00:02:07.569> not<00:02:07.780> quite<00:02:08.170> as

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
how to set that up it's not quite as

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.589 
how to set that up it's not quite as
easy<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.739> program<00:02:09.069> as<00:02:09.519> perhaps<00:02:09.729> with<00:02:10.090> external

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
easy to program as perhaps with external

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.390 
easy to program as perhaps with external
switches<00:02:11.080> on<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.260> microphone<00:02:11.560> but<00:02:12.220> that's

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
switches on the microphone but that's

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.759 
switches on the microphone but that's
for<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.610> reason<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:13.660> primary<00:02:13.930> reason<00:02:14.140> being<00:02:14.590> is
