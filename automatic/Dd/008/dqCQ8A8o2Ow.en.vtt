00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
brothers in a family of systems what I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.670 
brothers in a family of systems what I
went<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.329> say<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.480> iOS<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.289> Android<00:00:49.350> had

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
went on to say that iOS and Android had

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.080 
went on to say that iOS and Android had
been<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.010> inspirations<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
been kind of inspirations for this and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.700 
been kind of inspirations for this and
pointed<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> idea<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.780> having<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.620> know

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
pointed the idea of having a you know

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.500 
pointed the idea of having a you know
one<00:00:52.890> platform<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.520> multiple<00:00:53.879> devices<00:00:54.120> can

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
one platform that multiple devices can

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.779 
one platform that multiple devices can
access<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.559> interesting<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.070> if

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
access this is interesting because if

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.099 
access this is interesting because if
you<00:00:56.940> look<00:00:57.030> at<00:00:57.149> previous<00:00:57.300> Nintendo<00:00:57.780> hardware

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
you look at previous Nintendo hardware

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.959 
you look at previous Nintendo hardware
excluding<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> wii<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.370> Gamecube<00:00:59.850> which

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
excluding the wii and the Gamecube which

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.130 
excluding the wii and the Gamecube which
working<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.359> kind<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.629> similar<00:01:00.870> architecture

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
working on kind of similar architecture

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.260 
working on kind of similar architecture
pretty<00:01:02.039> much<00:01:02.160> everything<00:01:02.430> before<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.030> had

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
pretty much everything before that had

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.230 
pretty much everything before that had
been<00:01:03.439> untoten<00:01:04.610> different<00:01:05.610> designs<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.119> mean

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
been untoten different designs I mean

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.370 
been untoten different designs I mean
you<00:01:06.299> look<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.540> difference<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> n64

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
you look at the difference to the n64

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.679 
you look at the difference to the n64
and<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.189> Super<00:01:08.430> Nintendo<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> NES<00:01:09.510> they

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and the Super Nintendo and the NES they

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.000 
and the Super Nintendo and the NES they
were<00:01:09.750> kind<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.990> always<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.500> what<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:10.950> we

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
were kind of always just like what if we

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.710 
were kind of always just like what if we
try<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.430> about<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.090> what<00:01:12.570> could<00:01:12.689> go

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
try this what about this what could go

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.240 
try this what about this what could go
wrong<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.560> course<00:01:13.619> with<00:01:13.860> third-party

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
wrong but of course with third-party

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.890 
wrong but of course with third-party
development<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.700> could<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.909> more<00:01:15.240> tricky<00:01:15.659> so

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
development that could be more tricky so

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.940 
development that could be more tricky so
they're<00:01:16.229> trying<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.500> make<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.799> more

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
they're trying to make it more

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.530 
they're trying to make it more
accessible<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.430> developers<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.330> course

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
accessible to developers and of course

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.020 
accessible to developers and of course
also<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.990> people<00:01:19.439> who<00:01:19.500> own<00:01:19.650> two<00:01:20.159> systems<00:01:20.549> with

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
also to people who own two systems with

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.700 
also to people who own two systems with
this<00:01:21.150> mean<00:01:21.299> cross-play<00:01:21.840> sharing<00:01:22.320> cross

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
this mean cross-play sharing cross

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.440 
this mean cross-play sharing cross
buying<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.250> don't<00:01:23.520> know<00:01:23.580> remains<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.240> seen

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
buying I don't know remains to be seen

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.690 
buying I don't know remains to be seen
so<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.409> might<00:01:25.590> recall<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> game<00:01:26.189> murdered

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
so you might recall the game murdered

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.490 
so you might recall the game murdered
