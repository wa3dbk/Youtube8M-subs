00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.630
 is not a huge dilemma because it is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.640
 exactly that there and there are several things 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.410
 interconnected then meritocracy is 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.630
 you get the right people and you have 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.560
 the cost cut is you have a lot of 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.900
 thing together 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.670
 You only get a business, Agent. 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.590
 orange saw so much company almost not that the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.470
 people here we follow the model should 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.420
 realism account to me how you want is not the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.910
 The following clear goal has a 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.210
 asks for her okay then goals 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.890
 You define when you press 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.719
 squeeze tightens and you discover that by 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.129
 example imagine that we are in the year of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.829
 2014, right? 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.270
 and there are people who will have the goal defined in 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.530
 September 2014 are understanding for the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.170
 current year 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.090
 so it's cool to even make a mistake 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.800
 is following the method is the model must 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.899
 beauty only the following is no use 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.460
 you set goal in September because the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.840
 that the person did the other seven months 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.390
 previous eight months 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.820
 understood yesterday there is no game and there it is 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.439
 silly is the way the person is 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.840
 cheating on the company is not yet 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.700
 following the model, nothing is more 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.049
 young company was that way later 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.450
 say that they make us follow a model 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.400
 light no but have bonuses have good people 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.840
 best point is that the point that I have 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.799
 worked eight months without knowing what 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.400
 to do 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.259
 This is it, I do not even think I have ooo. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.600
 company contract 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.520
 now when you talk to work 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.070
 People are going to set the situation right now. 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.930
 the journey 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.620
 the third moment the brand change 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.240
 have no faith or organization that does not 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.740
 just so be we will implement the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.570
 meritocracy now because the first 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.180
 thing when you arrive by generation and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.159
 or xpa any generation he will not 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.619
 having this year's cake competes for 10 years 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.140
 sold bonds saw Meruoca being will 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.970
 It's still not cool then. 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.509
 How do we fit this too? 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:05.280
 nor was it an organizational structure and 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:07.440
 345 the single currency does not people me 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.670
 play when in bonuses when she does not 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.220
 wins the ball left to be a drug 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.070
 understood that this is that he was not the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.020
 number grew exactly also has the 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:22.500
 two sides is delivery time can not 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.300
 proving clear is rare in the world but then 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.130
 It's there, but these people who do not 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.930
 nobody gets caught by surprise, right? 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.820
 everybody time you already were too 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.290
 there were those cash management 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.940
 stay there everybody is beating 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.070
 method that is not 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.040
 danielle is just like the other day I had 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.830
 thirst there for the teapot bule here buy one 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.080
 had already finished book released the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.820
 book such but as a little obsessed 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.190
 I was going to Miami, I'm going to fill the bag. 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.510
 president there to see if he received and then I 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.730
 I went to know thirst what I wanted to see 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.870
 if he had already changed everything understood until 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.299
 to see you buy the company 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.450
 How long does it take for her? 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.769
 so it is not surprising now 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.060
 also the following companies have a lot of 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.000
 company that thinks legitimate business through the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.190
 crash but bitch put management in sight 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.790
 It's so annoying but who's down there? 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:14.340
 You think go right does some 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:17.250
 thing that is very connected as song is 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.310
 which is delivery of the result itself is 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.590
 fully turned on but he missed and I think 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.880
 which they consider to be more 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.970
 behavioral management of them then not only 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.030
 ooo matter the end but how you 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.540
 delivered or not, but it is not so 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.600
 You have to follow the rules is not a 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.340
 I do not report that, too. 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.840
 why was it there over the years? 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.070
 time being adjusted so that when 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.760
 You talk like this, companies want to. 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.380
 copy this type you can not copy and I went 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.060
 it works 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.060
 why this model of them 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.260
 40 year old people a perfect business side 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.230
 so for example when I did this 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.400
 matter is the following for the guy to win 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.950
 a bonus 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.590
 the black of the tbb side must then give 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.620
 this training becomes a business that is 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.670
 soon then, no matter how you fight with 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.750
 Your competitor is fighting here. 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.010
 inside ok 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.600
 after a while he realized that he did not 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.500
 we will change a little bit these rules 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.300
 goal 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.630
 it means having to have goals that 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.170
 for the whole team understood why 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.390
 so if the team can not a face of 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.770
 a team can not sabotage the face that the 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.110
 my team then you have to 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.320
 make goals that are collective that 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.640
 prevent from having sabotaged internal 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.990
 business has been improving 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.120
 so who is going to put the 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.680
 goal now speaks port putting goal 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.290
 but not having the same result but not 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.770
 It's really a process, it 's not a day to 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.770
 night right
