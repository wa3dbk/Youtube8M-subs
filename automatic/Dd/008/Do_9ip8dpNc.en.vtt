something way more ergonomic so how

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.499 
something way more ergonomic so how
we've<00:01:47.520> designed<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.119> software<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:50.509> basically

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
we've designed the software is basically

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.499 
we've designed the software is basically
you<00:01:51.960> could<00:01:52.189> program<00:01:53.630> any<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.840> these<00:01:55.020> keys<00:01:55.439> into

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
you could program any of these keys into

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.060 
you could program any of these keys into
any<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:58.049> these<00:01:59.299> sliders<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.590> anything<00:02:02.040> that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
any of these sliders so anything that

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.109 
any of these sliders so anything that
you<00:02:02.219> see<00:02:02.399> here<00:02:02.990> temperature<00:02:03.990> 10<00:02:04.350> exposure

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
you see here temperature 10 exposure

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.430 
you see here temperature 10 exposure
recovery<00:02:06.119> fill<00:02:06.810> light<00:02:07.110> blacks

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
recovery fill light blacks

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.820 
recovery fill light blacks
everything<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:10.370> could<00:02:10.520> read<00:02:11.710> you<00:02:12.710> know

these two top buttons right here is
going<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.020> be<00:02:36.170> my<00:02:36.350> temperature<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.850> if<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.480> can

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
going to be my temperature so if you can

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.660 
going to be my temperature so if you can
see<00:02:39.370> my<00:02:40.370> tap<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.320> button<00:02:42.320> 1<00:02:42.530> i'm<00:02:43.400> going<00:02:43.460> to

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
see my tap and button 1 i'm going to

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.640 
see my tap and button 1 i'm going to
make<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:44.360> thing<00:02:44.630> warmer<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:46.670> see<00:02:46.880> that

and<00:02:50.330> we're<00:02:51.260> going<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.490> make<00:02:52.490> it<00:02:52.730> lower<00:02:53.680> ok

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
and we're going to make it lower ok

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.890 
and we're going to make it lower ok
higher<00:02:56.150> lower<00:02:57.970> so<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.030> can<00:02:59.270> kind<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.540> see<00:02:59.720> it

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
higher lower so you can kind of see it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.400 
higher lower so you can kind of see it
like<00:03:00.350> moving<00:03:00.980> up<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.640> down<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.870> can<00:03:03.050> see<00:03:03.230> the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
like moving up and down you can see the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.090 
like moving up and down you can see the
number<00:03:05.500> going<00:03:06.500> up<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.280> going<00:03:07.390> down<00:03:08.830> same<00:03:09.830> here

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
number going up and going down same here

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
number going up and going down same here
with<00:03:10.460> brightness<00:03:10.700> ok<00:03:12.880> brightness<00:03:13.880> up

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
with brightness ok brightness up

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.920 
with brightness ok brightness up
brightness<00:03:14.780> down<00:03:16.000> let's<00:03:17.000> see<00:03:17.270> if<00:03:17.480> we<00:03:17.750> could

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
brightness down let's see if we could

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.600 
brightness down let's see if we could
show<00:03:18.800> you<00:03:18.860> guys<00:03:19.100> both<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.180> same<00:03:20.420> screen

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
show you guys both and the same screen

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.840 
show you guys both and the same screen
brightness<00:03:22.610> up<00:03:23.290> brightness<00:03:24.290> down<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:27.700> let<00:03:28.700> me

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
brightness up brightness down so let me

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.110 
brightness up brightness down so let me
put<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.630> camera<00:03:30.320> down<00:03:30.350> real<00:03:30.860> quick<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.760> I'm

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
put the camera down real quick and I'm

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.370 
put the camera down real quick and I'm
going<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:32.390> try<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.630> show<00:03:32.990> you<00:03:33.830> guys<00:03:38.290> all<00:03:39.290> right

going to try to show you guys all right
you<00:03:39.650> guys<00:03:39.890> can<00:03:40.580> you<00:03:40.700> see<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.270> controller<00:03:41.750> all

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
you guys can you see the controller all

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.980 
you guys can you see the controller all
right<00:03:42.730> check<00:03:43.730> this<00:03:43.850> out<00:03:45.820> temperature<00:03:46.820> up<00:03:47.060> you

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
right check this out temperature up you

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:55.480 
right check this out temperature up you
see<00:03:48.170> it<00:03:49.150> dude<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:51.380> could<00:03:51.590> see<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:54.490> photo

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
see it dude you could see the photo

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.480 
see it dude you could see the photo
getting<00:03:56.480> way<00:03:56.720> warmer<00:03:57.080> and<00:03:57.410> then<00:03:57.830> I<00:03:58.070> can

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
getting way warmer and then I can

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.570 
getting way warmer and then I can
actually<00:03:58.730> go<00:03:59.180> ahead<00:03:59.240> and<00:03:59.330> pull<00:03:59.600> it<00:03:59.630> down<00:04:00.580> way

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
actually go ahead and pull it down way

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.860 
actually go ahead and pull it down way
way<00:04:01.610> down<00:04:02.590> way<00:04:03.590> way<00:04:03.620> down<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.790> way<00:04:05.390> way<00:04:05.420> down

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
way down way way down and way way down

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.830 
way down way way down and way way down
or<00:04:06.680> we<00:04:07.580> could<00:04:07.730> do<00:04:08.260> brightness<00:04:09.260> up<00:04:10.840> brightness

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
or we could do brightness up brightness

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.599 
or we could do brightness up brightness
down<00:04:12.310> write<00:04:13.310> this<00:04:13.490> up<00:04:14.080> write<00:04:15.080> this<00:04:15.350> down<00:04:15.710> you

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
down write this up write this down you

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:17.569 
down write this up write this down you
see<00:04:16.760> that

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
see that

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.809 
see that
so<00:04:18.150> these<00:04:18.389> guys<00:04:18.689> right<00:04:19.169> here<00:04:19.229> I<00:04:19.650> program<00:04:20.430> these

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:20.819 
so these guys right here I program these

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:28.010 
so these guys right here I program these
to<00:04:21.239> be<00:04:21.389> my<00:04:21.569> vibrates<00:04:22.849> vibrates<00:04:24.439> so<00:04:25.439> I<00:04:26.030> can<00:04:27.030> make

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
to be my vibrates vibrates so I can make

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.749 
to be my vibrates vibrates so I can make
this<00:04:28.729> very<00:04:29.729> bright<00:04:30.240> vibrant<00:04:30.919> very<00:04:31.919> vibrancy

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
this very bright vibrant very vibrancy

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:38.719 
this very bright vibrant very vibrancy
or<00:04:32.969> very<00:04:33.870> less<00:04:34.169> vibrancy<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.990> see<00:04:37.169> that<00:04:37.729> all

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
or very less vibrancy you see that all

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.689 
or very less vibrancy you see that all
right<00:04:38.879> these<00:04:39.780> guys<00:04:40.110> right<00:04:40.530> here<00:04:40.590> are<00:04:41.219> my

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
right these guys right here are my

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:49.640 
right these guys right here are my
blacks<00:04:44.810> way<00:04:45.810> way<00:04:46.409> way<00:04:46.919> black<00:04:47.960> black<00:04:48.960> into<00:04:49.349> time

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
blacks way way way black black into time

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.839 
blacks way way way black black into time
and<00:04:50.870> way<00:04:51.870> way<00:04:52.580> less<00:04:53.580> black<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:55.110> basically<00:04:55.849> you

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
and way way less black so basically you

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.270 
and way way less black so basically you
can<00:04:57.030> see<00:04:57.270> mmm<00:04:58.370> that<00:04:59.370> we<00:05:00.270> can<00:05:00.449> totally<00:05:00.690> edit

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
start off with the jumping photos all

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.820 
start off with the jumping photos all
right<00:05:27.389> I'm<00:05:27.840> going<00:05:27.990> to<00:05:28.110> make<00:05:28.199> it<00:05:28.349> a<00:05:28.560> little

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
right I'm going to make it a little

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.230 
right I'm going to make it a little
warmer<00:05:29.520> tab<00:05:30.120> or<00:05:30.449> a<00:05:30.810> little<00:05:31.440> brighter<00:05:31.740> ok<00:05:32.580> next

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
warmer tab or a little brighter ok next

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.610 
warmer tab or a little brighter ok next
one<00:05:33.599> same<00:05:34.229> thing<00:05:34.620> a<00:05:34.949> little<00:05:35.639> bright<00:05:36.270> and<00:05:36.900> then

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
one same thing a little bright and then

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.390 
one same thing a little bright and then
increase<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.490> fibroids<00:05:39.120> there<00:05:39.900> you<00:05:40.080> go

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
increase the fibroids there you go

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.260 
increase the fibroids there you go
increase<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.550> vibrance<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.839> little<00:05:43.620> less

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
increase the vibrance a little less

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:51.140 
increase the vibrance a little less
right<00:05:46.639> to<00:05:47.639> it<00:05:47.699> all<00:05:48.629> right<00:05:49.250> see<00:05:50.250> now<00:05:50.669> I<00:05:50.699> need<00:05:51.029> to

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
right to it all right see now I need to

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.409 
right to it all right see now I need to
get<00:05:51.270> a<00:05:51.330> faster<00:05:51.719> computer<00:05:51.900> because<00:05:53.419> I'm

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
get a faster computer because I'm

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.110 
get a faster computer because I'm
actually<00:05:54.710> able<00:05:55.710> to<00:05:56.009> work<00:05:56.159> way<00:05:56.520> faster<00:05:57.089> than

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
actually able to work way faster than

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.600 
actually able to work way faster than
the<00:05:57.419> computer<00:05:57.839> now<00:05:58.849> they're<00:05:59.900> more<00:06:00.900> a<00:06:01.610> little

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
the computer now they're more a little

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:09.200 
the computer now they're more a little
higher<00:06:02.819> and<00:06:04.370> next<00:06:05.779> little<00:06:07.550> let's<00:06:08.550> make<00:06:08.849> it<00:06:08.879> a

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
higher and next little let's make it a

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.309 
higher and next little let's make it a
little<00:06:09.389> brighter<00:06:09.779> okay<00:06:10.469> next<00:06:11.900> so<00:06:12.900> basically

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
little brighter okay next so basically

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:19.439 
little brighter okay next so basically
you<00:06:13.889> can<00:06:14.099> actually<00:06:14.250> see<00:06:14.520> how

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.920
