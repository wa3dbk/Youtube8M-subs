00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
is it doesn't have to be a eight and a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.740 
is it doesn't have to be a eight and a
half

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.940 

a<00:02:02.810> triangle<00:02:03.590> sheet<00:02:04.130> paper<00:02:04.430> like<00:02:04.760> this<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:06.110> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
a triangle sheet paper like this and the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.969 
a triangle sheet paper like this and the
effect<00:02:07.340> is<00:02:07.550> still<00:02:07.700> pretty<00:02:08.270> much<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.509> same<00:02:08.979> you

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
effect is still pretty much the same you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.510 
effect is still pretty much the same you
can<00:02:10.250> use<00:02:10.610> an<00:02:10.970> old<00:02:11.330> receipts<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:12.320> I<00:02:12.440> got<00:02:12.650> from

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
can use an old receipts that I got from

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.170 
can use an old receipts that I got from
Michaels<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:18.290> can<00:02:18.530> use<00:02:18.940> colored<00:02:19.940> index

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
Michaels and you can use colored index

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.940 
Michaels and you can use colored index
cards<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:23.660> would<00:02:23.870> actually<00:02:24.260> using<00:02:24.860> an

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
cards and this would actually using an

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.490 
cards and this would actually using an
index<00:02:25.220> card<00:02:25.490> is<00:02:25.670> really<00:02:25.820> great<00:02:26.120> because<00:02:26.500> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
index card is really great because the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.440 
index card is really great because the
