 destroy enemies 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.079
 and here we are suddenly forced to think 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.989
 the authors claim that the idea originated 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.360
 almost by chance during experiments with 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.750
 various devices in development 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.750

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.200
 mobile mines

 All these puzzles will be about 120 and 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.390
 passing only the main part of these 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.970
 puzzles should take the player not to 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.040
 less than a day as a reward for deciding 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.299
 puzzles we will get with you

 figures that are keys to other worlds 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.680
 for solving puzzles we will 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.960
 various devices are available for example 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.119
 using a deactivator and will 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.929
 open energy barriers and 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.390
 deactivate the turrets and 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.120
 nina accumulating figures we gradually 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.939
 we will get access to the rest 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.230
 device to such as for example 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.719
 connector that is used in 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.420
 most puzzles are by the way and us 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:28.209
 familiar cube from the portal which also 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.420
 will definitely need to press buttons 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.730

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.950
 even access to the terminal for recording 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.349
 own copy allowing in 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.139
 literally split apart as 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.950
 the hero and his whole au pair of 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:47.439
 cubes and connectors conclusion I will say 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.889
 that the game is worth the money given that 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:53.200
 the price is surprisingly cheap and that's 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:55.930
 not just a puzzle game like here 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.659
 there is a serious plot containing references 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.450
 to many moral and philosophical 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.060
 problems so i sincerely recommend 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.579
 you do not download the game from torrents 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.799
 purely buy it and thank them 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.299
