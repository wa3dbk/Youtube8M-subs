00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
biggest difference is just you know the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
biggest difference is just you know the
speed<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.649> know<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.520> why<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> say<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
speed you know with and why I say the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.630 
speed you know with and why I say the
speed<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.110> necessarily<00:01:31.679> not<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.280> how<00:01:32.429> fast

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
speed it's necessarily not just how fast

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.999 
speed it's necessarily not just how fast
guys<00:01:32.940> are<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.660> there<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.470> fast<00:01:34.740> they<00:01:34.950> can

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
guys are it's there so fast they can

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.529 
guys are it's there so fast they can
disguise<00:01:35.459> things<00:01:35.789> longer<00:01:36.149> you<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.420> they

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
disguise things longer you know they

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.419 
disguise things longer you know they
don't<00:01:36.660> have<00:01:36.899> to<00:01:37.050> you<00:01:37.649> know<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:38.099> over<00:01:38.310> there

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
don't have to you know get over there

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:39.499 
don't have to you know get over there
because<00:01:38.610> they<00:01:38.729> can't<00:01:38.940> get<00:01:39.090> there<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:39.330> of

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
because they can't get there because of

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.300 
because they can't get there because of
their<00:01:39.630> speed<00:01:39.899> you<00:01:40.349> know<00:01:40.410> they<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.590> stay<00:01:40.979> here

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
their speed you know they can stay here

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.100 
their speed you know they can stay here
make<00:01:41.910> it<00:01:42.030> look<00:01:42.149> like<00:01:42.330> something<00:01:42.509> else<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:43.020> at

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
make it look like something else then at

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.300 
make it look like something else then at
the<00:01:43.229> snap<00:01:43.440> go<00:01:43.709> ahead<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.069> over<00:01:44.190> there

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the snap go ahead and get over there

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.969 
the snap go ahead and get over there
because<00:01:44.520> they're<00:01:44.759> fast<00:01:45.030> enough<00:01:45.800> but<00:01:46.800> at<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
because they're fast enough but at the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.490 
because they're fast enough but at the
same<00:01:47.160> time<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.640> know<00:01:48.050> at<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.170> beginning<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
same time you know at the beginning that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.660 
same time you know at the beginning that
was<00:01:49.679> the<00:01:49.740> hardest<00:01:49.890> part<00:01:49.979> through<00:01:50.280> OTAs<00:01:50.550> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
was the hardest part through OTAs and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.639 
was the hardest part through OTAs and
minicamp<00:01:51.209> tells<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.539> hardest<00:01:51.810> part<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.500> when

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
minicamp tells the hardest part now when

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.380 
minicamp tells the hardest part now when
i<00:01:52.679> get<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:52.890> here<00:01:53.099> it's<00:01:53.250> know<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> speed<00:01:54.209> of

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
i get out here it's know the speed of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.270 
i get out here it's know the speed of
the<00:01:54.420> game<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.470> sense<00:01:55.770> obviously

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the game you know in a sense obviously

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.400 
the game you know in a sense obviously
there's<00:01:56.459> a<00:01:56.520> long<00:01:56.670> way<00:01:56.819> to<00:01:56.880> go<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> sense

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
there's a long way to go but in a sense

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.960 
there's a long way to go but in a sense
has<00:01:58.619> slowed<00:01:58.890> down<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.399> where<00:01:59.520> i<00:01:59.550> can<00:01:59.759> just<00:01:59.789> go

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
has slowed down to where i can just go

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.270 
has slowed down to where i can just go
out<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.060> play<00:02:00.330> now<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:01.319> drop<00:02:01.800> back<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.130> like

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
out and play now not drop back in like

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.790 
out and play now not drop back in like
where<00:02:02.610> did<00:02:02.849> they<00:02:02.970> just<00:02:03.239> go<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.720> know<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.739> know

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
where did they just go you know you know
