the top of the car and a trick that we

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.939 
the top of the car and a trick that we
learned<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.420> hold<00:00:21.600> these<00:00:21.810> tubes<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.260> place<00:00:22.320> is

rail<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.970> decided<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.750> them<00:01:48.899> end<00:01:49.170> right

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
to do this rather than just start with a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
it and hope you get it right we used

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.699 
it and hope you get it right we used
some<00:02:07.890> quarter<00:02:08.789> inch<00:02:08.910> pencil<00:02:09.360> rod<00:02:09.539> which<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.679> a

some quarter inch pencil rod which is a

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.089 
some quarter inch pencil rod which is a
lot<00:02:10.979> cheaper<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.550> easier<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
lot cheaper and easier to

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.849 
lot cheaper and easier to
with<00:02:12.370> making<00:02:13.150> sure<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.989> we<00:02:14.109> had<00:02:14.349> enough

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
with making sure that we had enough

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.739 
with making sure that we had enough
space<00:02:15.159> to<00:02:15.400> accommodate<00:02:15.579> the<00:02:16.450> one<00:02:16.629> in

three-quarter inch tube of the actual
cage<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.180> once<00:02:19.989> we<00:02:20.109> mocked<00:02:20.379> up<00:02:20.650> where<00:02:21.040> we

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
cage and once we mocked up where we

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.819 
cage and once we mocked up where we
wanted<00:02:21.519> all<00:02:21.639> that<00:02:21.760> stuff<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.150> go<00:02:22.349> we<00:02:23.349> use<00:02:23.799> a

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
wanted all that stuff to go we use a

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.759 
wanted all that stuff to go we use a
tubing<00:02:24.340> bender<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.969> bend<00:02:25.329> the<00:02:25.870> one<00:02:26.620> and

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
tubing bender to bend the one and

tubing bender to bend the one and
three-quarter<00:02:27.189> inch<00:02:27.340> tube<00:02:27.579> and<00:02:27.909> create<00:02:28.659> those

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
three-quarter inch tube and create those

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.129 
three-quarter inch tube and create those
bars<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.650> they<00:02:30.489> don't<00:02:30.670> just<00:02:31.060> Bend<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:31.780> one

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:32.139 
bars and they don't just Bend in one

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.160 
bars and they don't just Bend in one
direction<00:02:32.670> downward<00:02:33.670> they<00:02:34.299> also<00:02:34.540> kick<00:02:34.780> inward

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
direction downward they also kick inward

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.780 
direction downward they also kick inward
a<00:02:35.260> little<00:02:35.439> bit<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.739> clear<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.069> wheel<00:02:36.189> tubs<00:02:36.519> and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
a little bit to clear the wheel tubs and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.539 
a little bit to clear the wheel tubs and
again<00:02:37.480> our<00:02:37.659> goal<00:02:37.689> was<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.260> conceal<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.250> cage

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
again our goal was to conceal this cage

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.970 
again our goal was to conceal this cage
as<00:02:39.879> much<00:02:40.150> as<00:02:40.329> possible<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:41.260> we<00:02:41.469> put<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.769> little

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
as much as possible so we put a little

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.339 
as much as possible so we put a little
extra<00:02:42.340> time<00:02:42.609> into<00:02:42.849> making<00:02:43.030> sure<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.689> fit<00:02:44.109> as

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
extra time into making sure it fit as

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.470 
extra time into making sure it fit as
tightly<00:02:44.620> as<00:02:44.769> it<00:02:44.980> could<00:02:45.189> by<00:02:45.879> this<00:02:45.939> point<00:02:46.239> the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
tightly as it could by this point the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.780 
tightly as it could by this point the
design<00:02:46.810> was<00:02:47.109> set<00:02:47.409> all<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:48.040> pieces<00:02:48.250> would<00:02:48.549> tack

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
design was set all the pieces would tack

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.759 
design was set all the pieces would tack
weld<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.180> together<00:02:49.329> and<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.959> was<00:02:50.049> time<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.590> do

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
weld it together and it was time to do

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.709 
weld it together and it was time to do
the<00:02:50.889> finish<00:02:51.189> welding<00:02:51.549> and<00:02:51.790> another<00:02:52.449> trick

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:52.719 
the finish welding and another trick

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:56.220 
the finish welding and another trick
that<00:02:52.870> we<00:02:52.959> learned<00:02:53.199> is<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:54.129> keep<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.419> base<00:02:55.870> of

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
that we learned is to keep the base of

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.300 
that we learned is to keep the base of
the<00:02:56.530> roll<00:02:56.709> cage<00:02:57.540> removable<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:59.040> drop<00:03:00.040> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
the roll cage removable and drop the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.280 
the roll cage removable and drop the
whole<00:03:00.430> cage<00:03:00.699> down<00:03:01.000> in<00:03:01.389> the<00:03:01.569> holes<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.169> the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
whole cage down in the holes and the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.399 
whole cage down in the holes and the
rocker<00:03:02.500> panels<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.849> give<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.150> access<00:03:04.419> to<00:03:05.260> get

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
rocker panels to give you access to get

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.050 
rocker panels to give you access to get
your<00:03:05.560> welding<00:03:05.889> torch<00:03:06.129> around<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.639> because

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
your welding torch around it because

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.339 
your welding torch around it because
once<00:03:07.239> this<00:03:07.389> thing's<00:03:07.599> in<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.840> car<00:03:08.049> it's<00:03:08.260> not

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
once this thing's in the car it's not

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.189 
once this thing's in the car it's not
like<00:03:08.620> it's<00:03:08.769> ever<00:03:08.919> coming<00:03:09.250> out<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:10.359> we<00:03:10.870> used<00:03:11.049> a

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:11.199 
like it's ever coming out so we used a

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.220 
like it's ever coming out so we used a
small<00:03:11.560> TIG<00:03:11.949> torch<00:03:12.219> and<00:03:12.659> slid<00:03:13.659> those<00:03:13.840> feet<00:03:14.079> out

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
small TIG torch and slid those feet out

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.289 
small TIG torch and slid those feet out
of<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.379> way<00:03:14.530> lowered<00:03:15.159> the<00:03:15.280> cage<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.879> did<00:03:16.180> all

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
of the way lowered the cage and did all

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.749 
of the way lowered the cage and did all
the<00:03:16.329> final<00:03:16.780> welding<00:03:17.109> around<00:03:17.349> all<00:03:17.859> of<00:03:17.919> the<00:03:18.370> main

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:18.759 
the final welding around all of the main

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.479 
the final welding around all of the main
tubes<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.449> then<00:03:20.109> lifted<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.739> cage<00:03:20.949> back<00:03:21.250> up

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
tubes and then lifted the cage back up

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.050 
tubes and then lifted the cage back up
again

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
again

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.719 
again
put<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.079> feet<00:03:23.319> back<00:03:23.650> over<00:03:23.949> the<00:03:24.040> rockers<00:03:24.489> and

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:24.729 
put the feet back over the rockers and

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:27.179 
put the feet back over the rockers and
weld<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.269> all<00:03:25.359> that<00:03:25.540> stuff<00:03:25.810> solid<00:03:26.259> we<00:03:26.889> MIG

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:27.189 
weld it all that stuff solid we MIG

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.569 
weld it all that stuff solid we MIG
welded<00:03:27.579> those<00:03:27.759> feet<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.689> rocker<00:03:28.900> panels

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
welded those feet to the rocker panels

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.849 
welded those feet to the rocker panels
because<00:03:30.579> we<00:03:30.879> had<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.120> do<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.269> higher<00:03:31.870> fill<00:03:32.470> rate

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
because we had to do a higher fill rate

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.759 
because we had to do a higher fill rate
than<00:03:33.159> a<00:03:33.459> simple<00:03:33.790> TIG<00:03:34.030> rod<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:35.199> was<00:03:35.319> easier

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
than a simple TIG rod and it was easier

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.110 
than a simple TIG rod and it was easier
and<00:03:35.799> faster<00:03:36.099> to<00:03:36.459> deal<00:03:36.609> with<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.819> MIG<00:03:37.090> welder

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120

that's<00:03:37.569> build<00:03:37.750> up<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.930> lot<00:03:38.079> of<00:03:38.109> TIG<00:03:38.519> when<00:03:39.519> the

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
that's build up a lot of TIG when the

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.559 
that's build up a lot of TIG when the
cage<00:03:39.819> was<00:03:40.030> solid<00:03:40.449> in<00:03:40.659> the<00:03:40.780> car<00:03:41.019> we<00:03:41.739> added<00:03:42.310> the

chassis jegg and put the subframe back
in<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:02.140> had<00:05:02.320> it<00:05:02.440> on<00:05:02.650> its<00:05:02.800> wheels<00:05:03.100> and<00:05:03.580> at

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
in it and had it on its wheels and at

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.450 
in it and had it on its wheels and at
this<00:05:04.000> point<00:05:04.360> we<00:05:05.020> fit<00:05:05.350> it<00:05:05.440> up<00:05:05.590> not<00:05:06.220> only<00:05:06.370> the

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
this point we fit it up not only the

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.770 
this point we fit it up not only the
engine<00:05:06.610> of<00:05:06.850> transmission<00:05:07.450> but<00:05:07.480> all<00:05:07.750> a
