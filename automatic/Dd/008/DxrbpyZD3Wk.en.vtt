00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.070 
recommend I find them to be enjoyable
but<00:00:10.650> also<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:11.099> keeps<00:00:11.250> battlefield<00:00:12.090> fresh<00:00:12.780> and

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
but also it keeps battlefield fresh and

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.330 
but also it keeps battlefield fresh and
fun<00:00:13.259> since<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:13.650> already<00:00:13.799> been<00:00:14.009> out<00:00:14.130> for

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
fun since it's already been out for

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.060 
fun since it's already been out for
almost<00:00:14.370> two<00:00:14.759> years<00:00:14.790> now<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:16.289> time<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.680> lot

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
almost two years now and this time a lot

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.620 
almost two years now and this time a lot
of<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.310> wanted<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.699> see<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.150> could<00:00:18.330> do<00:00:18.449> well

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
of you wanted to see if I could do well

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.349 
of you wanted to see if I could do well
with<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.960> l96<00:00:19.590> sniper<00:00:20.070> rifle<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.910> infrared

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
with the l96 sniper rifle the infrared

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.900 
with the l96 sniper rifle the infrared
night-vision<00:00:21.600> scope<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.619> silencer<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
night-vision scope the silencer and the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.820 
night-vision scope the silencer and the
tech<00:00:24.150> light<00:00:24.390> attachments<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.109> did<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
tech light attachments I did have to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.109 
tech light attachments I did have to
make<00:00:25.859> some<00:00:26.189> small<00:00:26.400> adjustments<00:00:26.519> here<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
make some small adjustments here and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.000 
make some small adjustments here and
there<00:00:27.240> because<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.900> silencer<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> TAC

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
there because the silencer and the TAC

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.490 
there because the silencer and the TAC
light<00:00:29.039> share<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.029> same<00:00:30.269> slot<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.230> it's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
light share the same slot so it's

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.470 
light share the same slot so it's
physically<00:00:32.160> impossible<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.910> me<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.030> use<00:00:33.300> it

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
physically impossible for me to use it

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.350 
physically impossible for me to use it
so<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.930> opted<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.500> use<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.219> iron<00:00:35.489> V<00:00:35.850> scope<00:00:36.090> with

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
so I opted to use the iron V scope with

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.119 
so I opted to use the iron V scope with
the<00:00:36.690> silencer<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> figured<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> lot<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:37.980> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
the silencer I figured that a lot of you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.619 
the silencer I figured that a lot of you
guys<00:00:38.250> would<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.520> preferred<00:00:38.910> seeing<00:00:39.510> that

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
guys would have preferred seeing that

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.750 
guys would have preferred seeing that
type<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.840> gameplay<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.489> into<00:00:41.640> this

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
type of gameplay and so going into this

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.430 
type of gameplay and so going into this
I<00:00:42.000> honestly<00:00:42.450> didn't<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.170> was<00:00:43.260> gonna<00:00:43.350> be

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
I honestly didn't think it was gonna be

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.590 
I honestly didn't think it was gonna be
all<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.920> bad<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.160> mean<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.489> enjoy<00:00:44.910> using<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
all that bad I mean I enjoy using the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.970 
all that bad I mean I enjoy using the
infrared<00:00:45.899> night-vision<00:00:46.230> scope<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
infrared night-vision scope on the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.799 
infrared night-vision scope on the
assault<00:00:47.309> rifles<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> engineer<00:00:48.390> weapons

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
assault rifles on the engineer weapons

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.260 
assault rifles on the engineer weapons
and<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.620> silencer<00:00:50.129> if<00:00:50.309> used<00:00:50.610> correctly<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and the silencer if used correctly and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.939 
and the silencer if used correctly and
you<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.360> get<00:00:51.539> behind<00:00:51.809> enemy<00:00:52.079> lines<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.739> can

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you can get behind enemy lines you can

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.490 
you can get behind enemy lines you can
do<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> number<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.000> enemy<00:00:54.270> team<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
do a number on the enemy team but the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.350 
do a number on the enemy team but the
combination<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.280> these<00:00:56.460> intent<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.210> these

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
combination of these intent of these

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.900 
combination of these intent of these
attachments<00:00:57.660> working<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.469> tandem<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
attachments working in tandem is a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.299 
attachments working in tandem is a
nightmare<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> l96<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
nightmare with the l96 and for the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.130 
nightmare with the l96 and for the
longest<00:01:02.609> time<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.059> couldn't<00:01:03.120> figure<00:01:03.629> out<00:01:03.780> why

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
longest time I couldn't figure out why

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.410 
longest time I couldn't figure out why
but<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> when<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> really<00:01:06.030> looked<00:01:06.240> at

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
but then when I when I really looked at

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.690 
but then when I when I really looked at
it<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.689> realized<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> infrared

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it I realized that the infrared

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.149 
it I realized that the infrared
night-vision<00:01:08.970> scope<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.049> sways<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
night-vision scope with this sways a

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.289 
night-vision scope with this sways a
little<00:01:11.520> bit<00:01:11.640> actually<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.030> sways<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
little bit actually it sways a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.390 
little bit actually it sways a
significant<00:01:13.260> amount<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.979> would<00:01:14.130> assume

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
significant amount and you would assume

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
significant amount and you would assume
that<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.700> would<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:15.000> able<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> steady<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.780> like

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
that you would be able to steady it like

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.109 
that you would be able to steady it like
a<00:01:16.290> sniper<00:01:16.770> rifle<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.430> guys<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.729> see<00:01:17.909> it

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
a sniper rifle as you guys can see it

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.630 
a sniper rifle as you guys can see it
looks<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.840> normal<00:01:19.110> sniper<00:01:19.530> scope<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
looks like a normal sniper scope but you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.789 
looks like a normal sniper scope but you
can't<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.270> when<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.080> are<00:01:22.110> trying<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.650> line

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
can't and so when you are trying to line

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
can't and so when you are trying to line
up<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:23.009> shot<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.430> medium<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.000> long<00:01:24.210> range<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
up a shot at medium to long range it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
up a shot at medium to long range it
becomes<00:01:25.439> infinitely<00:01:26.159> more<00:01:26.400> challenging<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
becomes infinitely more challenging to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.030 
becomes infinitely more challenging to
nail<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.659> shot<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.409> because<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
nail that shot just because of the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.490 
nail that shot just because of the
slight<00:01:29.310> sway<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.509> took<00:01:30.720> me<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.170> long<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
slight sway and it took me so long to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.990 
slight sway and it took me so long to
figure<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.100> out<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.610> would<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.880> was

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
figure this out like I would I was

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
figure this out like I would I was
trying<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.329> get<00:01:33.390> gameplay<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.710> was

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
trying to get gameplay for it and I was

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.350 
trying to get gameplay for it and I was
struggling<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.579> couldn't<00:01:35.939> figure<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.240> why

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
struggling and I couldn't figure out why

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.170 
struggling and I couldn't figure out why
I<00:01:36.540> was<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:36.990> maybe<00:01:37.229> my<00:01:37.829> accuracy<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.670> off<00:01:38.850> I'm

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
I was like maybe my accuracy is off I'm

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.850 
I was like maybe my accuracy is off I'm
just<00:01:39.420> struggling<00:01:39.720> right<00:01:40.049> now<00:01:40.079> I'll<00:01:40.470> take<00:01:40.829> a

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
just struggling right now I'll take a

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.590 
just struggling right now I'll take a
break<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.250> I'll<00:01:41.340> come<00:01:41.490> back<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.360> even

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
break and I'll come back to it but even

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240 
break and I'll come back to it but even
after<00:01:42.750> coming<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.770> multiple<00:01:44.189> times

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
after coming back to it multiple times

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.340 
after coming back to it multiple times
trying<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:44.880> gameplay<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.840> was

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
trying to get gameplay for it I was

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.960 
trying to get gameplay for it I was
still<00:01:46.470> struggling<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.280> then<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> finally

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
still struggling and then I finally

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.969 
still struggling and then I finally
realized<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.380> sway<00:01:49.680> that's

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
realized it's just the sway that's

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.980 
realized it's just the sway that's
causing<00:01:50.399> all<00:01:50.549> these<00:01:50.700> problems<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.360> you

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
causing all these problems and you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.270 
causing all these problems and you
wouldn't<00:01:52.229> think<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.619> would<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.159> big

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
wouldn't think it would be all that big

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.520 
wouldn't think it would be all that big
of<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> deal<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:53.939> when<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.270> constant<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.350> you

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
of a deal but when it's constant and you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.310 
of a deal but when it's constant and you
have<00:01:55.710> no<00:01:55.950> way<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.250> steadying<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> ah<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:58.110> is

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
have no way of steadying it ah it is

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.830 
have no way of steadying it ah it is
such<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:59.009> headache<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.579> it's<00:02:00.149> truly<00:02:00.509> what<00:02:00.630> made

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
such a headache and it's truly what made

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.649 
such a headache and it's truly what made
this<00:02:01.020> challenge<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:02.070> ridiculous<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.479> other

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
this challenge just ridiculous the other

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.590 
this challenge just ridiculous the other

every other weapon except for
high-powered<00:02:10.679> bolt-action<00:02:11.220> rifles<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.879> keeps

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
high-powered bolt-action rifles it keeps

high-powered bolt-action rifles it keeps
you<00:02:12.360> off<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.510> mini-map<00:02:12.750> which<00:02:13.020> is

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
you off the mini-map which is

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.520 
you off the mini-map which is
fantastic<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:13.960> did<00:02:14.140> try<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.380> take

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
fantastic and I did try to take

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.890 
fantastic and I did try to take
advantage<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.190> but<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.850> also<00:02:16.060> reduces

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
advantage of that but it also reduces

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.650 
advantage of that but it also reduces
your<00:02:17.170> bullets<00:02:17.770> velocity<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.550> for<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.790> l96

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
your bullets velocity and for the l96

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.990 
your bullets velocity and for the l96
it<00:02:19.780> merely<00:02:20.260> cuts<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:20.890> half<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.640> goes<00:02:21.790> from

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
it merely cuts it in half it goes from

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.300 
it merely cuts it in half it goes from
540<00:02:22.870> meters<00:02:22.990> per<00:02:23.260> second<00:02:23.590> all<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.980> way<00:02:24.070> down

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
540 meters per second all the way down

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.790 
540 meters per second all the way down
to<00:02:24.550> 310<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.690> when<00:02:26.170> you're<00:02:26.290> trying<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.650> be

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
to 310 and when you're trying to be

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.680 
to 310 and when you're trying to be
accurate<00:02:26.980> with<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.670> sniper<00:02:28.030> rifle<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.570> mean

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
accurate with a sniper rifle I mean

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.210 
accurate with a sniper rifle I mean
that's<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.960> way<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.170> get<00:02:29.410> kills<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.860> you

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
that's the way you get kills you you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.880 
that's the way you get kills you you
live<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:30.790> breathe<00:02:30.850> by<00:02:31.360> your<00:02:31.540> accuracy<00:02:32.050> having

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
live and breathe by your accuracy having

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.520 
live and breathe by your accuracy having
a<00:02:33.040> slower<00:02:33.490> bullet<00:02:34.090> velocity<00:02:34.210> makes<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.320> even

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
a slower bullet velocity makes it even

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.990 
a slower bullet velocity makes it even
it<00:02:35.590> makes<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.950> more<00:02:36.040> challenging<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.700> line<00:02:36.850> up

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
it makes it more challenging to line up

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.310 
it makes it more challenging to line up
those<00:02:37.120> shots<00:02:37.390> you're<00:02:37.600> having<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.020> deal<00:02:38.170> with

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
those shots you're having to deal with

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.750 
those shots you're having to deal with
more<00:02:38.470> bullet<00:02:38.770> drop<00:02:39.010> you're<00:02:39.190> having<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.580> leave

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
more bullet drop you're having to leave

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.790 
more bullet drop you're having to leave
the<00:02:39.970> target<00:02:40.240> a<00:02:40.450> little<00:02:40.600> bit<00:02:40.690> more<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.170> when

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
the target a little bit more and when

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.140 
the target a little bit more and when
you<00:02:41.920> have<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.280> take<00:02:42.430> more<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.730> those<00:02:42.910> things

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
you have to take more of those things

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.060 
you have to take more of those things
into<00:02:43.330> consideration<00:02:43.560> trying<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.680> hit<00:02:44.860> a

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
target at medium to long range becomes

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.710 
target at medium to long range becomes
harder<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.250> harder<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.850> slower<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.390> bullet

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
harder and harder the slower the bullet

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.440 
harder and harder the slower the bullet
is<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.320> if<00:02:51.070> there<00:02:51.250> wasn't<00:02:51.580> enough<00:02:51.790> on<00:02:52.030> top<00:02:52.270> of

worst bolt-action rifles in the game

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.090 
worst bolt-action rifles in the game
because<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.870> doesn't<00:02:59.290> do<00:02:59.410> anything<00:02:59.680> better

other weapons and it's just kind of

other weapons and it's just kind of
something<00:03:29.710> else<00:03:29.860> I<00:03:30.130> had<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.550> work<00:03:30.700> with<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.180> so

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
something else I had to work with and so

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.240 
something else I had to work with and so
the<00:03:32.050> way<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.230> kind<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.650> approach<00:03:32.980> today's

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
the way I kind of approach today's

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.710 
the way I kind of approach today's
challenge<00:03:33.700> was<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.150> play<00:03:34.360> really

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
challenge was to play really

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.140 
challenge was to play really
aggressively<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.680> just<00:03:36.220> get<00:03:36.490> up<00:03:36.520> close<00:03:36.910> and

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
aggressively and just get up close and

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.090 
aggressively and just get up close and
personal<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.960> bullets<00:03:38.350> way<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.860> having

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
personal the bullets way and having

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.730 
personal the bullets way and having
slower<00:03:39.850> bullet<00:03:40.150> travel<00:03:40.540> speed<00:03:40.810> makes<00:03:41.530> it

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
slower bullet travel speed makes it

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.650 
slower bullet travel speed makes it
really<00:03:42.100> hard<00:03:42.460> for<00:03:42.550> me<00:03:42.760> to<00:03:42.850> take<00:03:43.000> people<00:03:43.300> out<00:03:43.420> at

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
really hard for me to take people out at

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.480 
really hard for me to take people out at
medium<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.260> long<00:03:44.530> distance<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:45.190> if<00:03:45.250> they<00:03:45.370> get

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
medium and long distance and if they get

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.400 
medium and long distance and if they get
up<00:03:45.610> close<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:46.570> bullets<00:03:46.840> weight<00:03:47.050> didn't

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
up close the bullets weight didn't

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.290 
up close the bullets weight didn't
become<00:03:47.710> as<00:03:48.010> large<00:03:48.460> of<00:03:48.760> an<00:03:48.850> issue<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.060> mean<00:03:49.210> it

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
become as large of an issue I mean it

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.790 
become as large of an issue I mean it
was<00:03:49.390> still<00:03:49.570> was<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.840> problem<00:03:50.380> even<00:03:50.530> when<00:03:50.770> I

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
was still was a problem even when I

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.350 
was still was a problem even when I
would<00:03:50.890> go<00:03:51.070> for<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.340> chest<00:03:51.610> shot<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:52.000> would<00:03:52.060> suede

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
would go for a chest shot it would suede

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.610 
would go for a chest shot it would suede
just<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.780> little<00:03:52.990> bit<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.260> would<00:03:53.350> hit<00:03:53.440> him<00:03:53.500> in

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
just a little bit and I would hit him in

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.230 
just a little bit and I would hit him in
the<00:03:53.650> arm<00:03:53.710> and<00:03:54.100> then<00:03:54.190> they<00:03:54.460> would<00:03:54.610> of<00:03:54.790> course

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
the arm and then they would of course

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.970 
the arm and then they would of course
kill<00:03:55.540> me<00:03:55.660> at<00:03:55.750> that<00:03:55.900> point<00:03:56.110> but<00:03:56.710> it<00:03:56.800> was<00:03:56.950> a

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
kill me at that point but it was a

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.470 
kill me at that point but it was a
little<00:03:57.250> less<00:03:57.430> frustrating<00:03:58.060> than<00:03:58.210> trying<00:03:58.420> to

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
little less frustrating than trying to

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.960 
little less frustrating than trying to
snipe<00:03:58.720> someone<00:03:59.230> that's<00:03:59.800> 50<00:04:00.220> meters<00:04:00.490> out<00:04:00.730> and

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
snipe someone that's 50 meters out and

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.760 
snipe someone that's 50 meters out and
then<00:04:01.120> every<00:04:01.540> single<00:04:01.750> shot<00:04:02.170> at<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.560> last

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
then every single shot at the last

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.250 
then every single shot at the last
second<00:04:03.220> my<00:04:03.430> my<00:04:03.790> weapon<00:04:04.240> just<00:04:04.450> kind<00:04:04.810> of<00:04:04.870> blips

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
second my my weapon just kind of blips

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.660 
second my my weapon just kind of blips
away<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.770> side<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.160> I<00:04:06.220> don't<00:04:06.280> get<00:04:06.550> the

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
away to the side and I don't get the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.160 
away to the side and I don't get the
kill<00:04:06.850> like<00:04:07.000> that<00:04:07.150> that<00:04:07.540> happened<00:04:07.840> over<00:04:08.080> and

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
kill like that that happened over and

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.780 
kill like that that happened over and
over<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:08.710> was<00:04:08.920> done<00:04:09.070> with<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.250> so<00:04:09.760> I

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
over and so I was done with that so I

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.890 
over and so I was done with that so I
played<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.060> lot<00:04:10.240> of<00:04:10.330> team<00:04:10.450> deathmatch

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
played a lot of team deathmatch

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.720 
played a lot of team deathmatch
I<00:04:11.080> played<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:11.350> lot<00:04:11.590> on<00:04:11.740> the<00:04:11.920> close<00:04:12.130> quarter<00:04:12.490> Maps

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
I played a lot on the close quarter Maps

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.640 
I played a lot on the close quarter Maps
and<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:13.000> had<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.180> lot<00:04:13.300> of<00:04:13.450> success<00:04:13.780> with<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:13.990> but

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
and I had a lot of success with that but

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.180 
and I had a lot of success with that but
overall<00:04:15.160> like<00:04:15.490> it<00:04:15.700> was<00:04:15.850> just<00:04:16.209> such<00:04:16.750> a

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
overall like it was just such a

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.530 
overall like it was just such a
frustrating<00:04:18.190> experience<00:04:18.340> like<00:04:19.000> I<00:04:19.150> did<00:04:19.359> not

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
frustrating experience like I did not

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.050 
frustrating experience like I did not
think<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.260> was<00:04:20.680> going<00:04:20.920> to<00:04:21.520> have<00:04:21.700> this

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
think that I was going to have this

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.090 
think that I was going to have this
large<00:04:22.390> of<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.660> problem<00:04:22.990> with<00:04:23.140> this<00:04:23.290> setup<00:04:23.560> as<00:04:23.830> I

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
large of a problem with this setup as I

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.070 
large of a problem with this setup as I
said<00:04:24.340> I<00:04:24.370> do<00:04:24.520> enjoy<00:04:24.970> these<00:04:25.390> attachments<00:04:25.960> on

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
said I do enjoy these attachments on

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.640 
said I do enjoy these attachments on
pretty<00:04:26.290> much

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
pretty much

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.650 
pretty much
every<00:04:26.830> other<00:04:27.009> weapon<00:04:27.370> even<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:27.910> combination<00:04:28.090> on

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
every other weapon even a combination on

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.030 
every other weapon even a combination on
the<00:04:28.690> assault<00:04:29.110> rifles<00:04:29.410> I<00:04:29.500> think<00:04:29.680> this<00:04:29.800> would<00:04:29.949> be

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
the assault rifles I think this would be

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.360 
the assault rifles I think this would be
