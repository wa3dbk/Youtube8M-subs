00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.080
 Salvadoran pupusas want to know 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.950
 Well, I'm not going to start putting this 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.970

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.860
 pig pig and I'll be 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.300
 placing all of our 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.300
 it is not your body 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.849

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.320
 touching it has several names that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.350
 they mean the same thing I'm going to put this salt 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.949

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.909
 well seasoned girls to those already to taste 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.500
 of you are the a as I do 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.020
 I'll be opening some solitos 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.620
 also in the flesh 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.440
 and I will be placing some eyes 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.660
 as well 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.250
 you know that the more agitated 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.600
 it's better for these meats 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.600
 may be placing more eyes that 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.990
 he says in the holes I did to the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.990
 meat 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.829
 yes 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.960
 and then I'll also be putting him 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.850
 you can put all the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.030
 seasoning they want like books 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.219
 they can also put 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.470
 if you want you can place the tomato if 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.360
 they want they can put it in the end I 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.460
 I 'm placing everything I hope too 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.969
 to the prince and I'm going to put everything 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.829
 also when it's the other step and I'm going to 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.840
 be placing the green chili that is the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.490
 chile morrón that looks 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.630
 a little more garlic salt 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.950
 and this I 'm going to take to the oven is 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.950
 wall with aluminum 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:01.970
 and I'll take it to the oven at 400 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:07.479
 I'm going to put it to 400 degrees it seems 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:10.250
 what is this I put it at 138 in the afternoon 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.960
 and let's see how many hours it takes 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.870
 this also because I already have it up 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.330
 that the meat is very soft and 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.060
 here as you can see I already have also 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.640
 the beans that are also placed 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.810
 beans to the meat since it is ground 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:31.850
 here is my flesh as you can see its 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:35.220
 it takes about 23 hours out there like that 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.810
 three hours because that's what I tell them 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.069
 I like the meat to look good 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:44.830
 soft and finite at least once 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:50.170
 so as you can see apart from 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:54.459
 that the meat of the pork meat then 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:58.890
 it's pretty soft but I like that 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.890
 it's pretty pretty soft 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:07.410
 and very rich girls are very rich here 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.630
 I put a small cup of onion because it 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.390
 I had forgotten to put him but then 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.230
 matter and you can put a 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.570
 whip at the end at the beginning I will 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.270
 I will always be the same now I have here 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.900
 My extractor food and right here as 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.900
 I will be 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.870
 placing they could see that the already returned 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.730
 I was in pieces because I had already 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.630
 made pieces so that it could be 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.630
 sew better 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.170
 you can see I can already 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.030
 put fixed as you want as 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.450
 come here I will be also putting what 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.550
 What is it that I am going to help you, girl? 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.770
 all this that I put to him does not feel to 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.200
 the time that everything is ready is not 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.970
 feel for those who may not like it 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.660
 all this kind of things as you can see 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.530
 I put onion I put garlic I'll put 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.530
 green chile 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.300
 and as I tell you , you can put the 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.940
 ingredients they want and we're going to 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.940
 start liquefying 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.950
 since that of this already no cuadrito 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.680
 I'm going to be putting a little bit of 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.440
 this salsita of the body route we have 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.210
 to take the tomato I put it is me 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.280
 I think that only I do it a lot 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.470
 because they can put the tomato too 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.080
 if you want but I like it 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.530
 this because it helps me bet that this 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.510
 you can grind pretty well also you 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.000
 I'm going to put on another one 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.130
 little bit of salt this seasoned sauce 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.620
 because you have to go testing if 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.470
 it's simple or nights to the changuito of the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.960
 salt to the taste of each one 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.090
 and this sauce was also a color 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.850
 rojito what is our pork rind 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:59.560
 with our flesh and as you can see well 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:02.710
 He has been placed and gave him cheese 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.050
 mozzarella cheese or cheese that you 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.080
 have in this case I do not have more than 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.890
 get nothing else mozzarella cheese and 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.010
 to put him to frijolitos and to all this the 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:20.830
 we stir girl that there is only one 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:24.610
 chew on here I have I already take mass already 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.950
 ready to make the tortilla and I have a 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.990
 cheese that are the pupusas of the 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.990
 kids that I make cheese and how 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.530
 can be seen did not forget to teach them that 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:39.070
 I also have chicharrón already ready 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:43.300
 grabbed a belly and I do a nice 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:46.950
 in the middle and we grab the amount that is 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.290
 necessary for our pot also 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.620
 and then we try to put anything 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.380
 more in stockings at the beginning costs girls 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.470
 but I know that you learn you learn 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.690
 I say it from my own experience and we are going to 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.460
 take away I love doing this and we're going to 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.590
 remove excess putty so that 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.060
 we do not stay for kneaded, I put on a 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.390
 little oil in the hands for 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.640
 can draw well what is the machine 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:16.530
 and I start patting yes to give 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:18.180
 turns in the in the dough started to 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.660
 make me tortillita like tortilla 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.660
 normal 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.590
 so that the bandit is left if we do not 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.860
 it stays there and then our as it has 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.580
 to be hot and ready there is 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.910
 our pupusa and that's how they have been 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.610
 with their tanning and then they can put it 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.110

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.170
