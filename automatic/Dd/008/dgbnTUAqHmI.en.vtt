the lorac one is a lot more it has a lot
more<00:04:15.780> color<00:04:16.320> payoff<00:04:16.620> so<00:04:17.280> it's<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.519> lot<00:04:17.699> brighter

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.870 
and then the peony pedal one is a little
bit<00:04:20.630> better<00:04:20.810> for<00:04:21.049> every<00:04:21.380> day<00:04:21.620> but<00:04:22.280> I<00:04:22.340> really
