00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.300
 Hello everyone, today I will show you how 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.280
 braid this stylish braid with which you 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.290
 just do not go unnoticed 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.750
 This hairstyle is suitable for each 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.619
 the day and on the way pick only 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.619
 matching accessories 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.070
 for extra length and volume I already 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.789
 secured false hair strands on 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.919
 hairpins 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.050
 now just comb my hair well 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:34.210
 then it was easier to separate the strands 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.220
 for the spit on the one hand leave a strand 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.500
 hair width 2 3 centimeters 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.570
 from this period we will be consistent 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.350
 separate thin hide and seek and weave them 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.540
 our braid on the other side here I am separating 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.559
 the first thin strand and carry it to 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.050
 the other side then I separate two more 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.030
 thin hide and seek near the face and weave 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.710
 will be one of the varieties 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.289
 french spit far strand 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.809
 we stack on the central near strand 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.010
 we stack on the central distant strand 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.839
 once again transferred 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.220
 and then separate another thin one 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.050
 a strand from the strands that we 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.380
 originally left on the other side and 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.759
 add it to the central strand 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.710
 Now I shift to the center near 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.130
 strand and add to it a thin strand 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.800
 hair 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.899
 which is to the left of the face afterwards and 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.670
 I repeat all these steps until I reach 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.159
 the lengths that suits me 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.979
 you can weave right up to the tips because 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.049
 what to stop and in 10-15 steps about 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.909
 weaving a few centimeters neatly 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.490
 pulling extra strands to 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.590
 they lay relatively free if their 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.670
 interweave too toga then the pattern is just not 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.670
 will be viewed 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.330
 fix the end with a small rubber band and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.680
 our hairstyle is ready my braid is lying 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.180
 over loose hair 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.490
 but if you want you can fix everything 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.350
