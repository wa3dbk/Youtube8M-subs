 hello people welcome to my new 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.579
 video old version is a new video 

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:08.579
 to turn 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.519
 because it is so sometimes interferes with the material 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.070
 not always so that works 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:28.150
 even at league that was just something 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.009
 small video not as big as I press 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.970
 Now just let me have those 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.690
 everyone has 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.210
 there are two starts here 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.480
 mobile down here, there is one 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.370
 countries and yes now you can 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.370
 now I choose somebody 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.630
 ddp 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:56.770
 and now you have to go now 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:01:02.470
 It would not be a pity to play a miracle 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:07.980
 I prove to you now I have the and 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:12.220
 yes, that's cool when you have a headset 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.300
 Rostocker then do it too 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.300
 that's really cool 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.470
 Well, I've had it for a long time 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.470
 found out 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:33.810
 and as I said , it stops 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:37.090
 then made fast forward to further 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.990
 then it goes to matter matter if 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.450
 I lose too 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.770
 the games just this round maybe 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:51.040
 later it is not here 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.549
 I did not sit so well as the cool thing 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.549
 ecuador 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.850
 But that would have 2015 so invite you 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.990

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.850

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:15.170
 now 4 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:32.860
