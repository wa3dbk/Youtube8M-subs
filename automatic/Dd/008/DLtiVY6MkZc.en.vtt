team care see Sansa gameplay and I'm

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.999 
team care see Sansa gameplay and I'm
going<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.690> be<00:00:12.780> continuing<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.440> topic<00:00:13.860> of

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
going to be continuing the topic of

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.220 
going to be continuing the topic of
immortality<00:00:14.549> from<00:00:15.150> my<00:00:15.269> last<00:00:15.509> video<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.839> kind<00:00:16.170> of

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
immortality from my last video I kind of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.200 
immortality from my last video I kind of
its<00:00:16.619> when<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.920> practicals<00:00:17.430> considerations

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
its when the practicals considerations

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.000 
its when the practicals considerations
of<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.600> there<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.199> now<00:00:19.260> i'm<00:00:19.710> just<00:00:19.859> going<00:00:19.980> to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
of it there and now i'm just going to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.070 
of it there and now i'm just going to
thinking<00:00:20.430> ethically<00:00:20.970> about<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.869> situation

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
thinking ethically about the situation

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.620 
thinking ethically about the situation
because<00:00:22.769> two-thirds<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.550> all<00:00:23.789> human<00:00:24.359> deaths

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
because two-thirds of all human deaths

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.710 
because two-thirds of all human deaths
occur<00:00:25.500> from<00:00:25.859> natural<00:00:26.430> causes<00:00:26.460> old<00:00:27.150> age<00:00:27.390> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
occur from natural causes old age and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.919 
occur from natural causes old age and
that<00:00:28.650> equates<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.279> around<00:00:29.750> 100,000<00:00:30.750> deaths

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
that equates to around 100,000 deaths

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.889 
that equates to around 100,000 deaths
every<00:00:31.260> day<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.279> if<00:00:32.610> people<00:00:33.090> want<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> hit<00:00:33.750> in

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
every day so if people want to hit in

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.750 
every day so if people want to hit in
you<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.230> they're<00:00:34.380> doing<00:00:34.680> now<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.920> increase

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
you what they're doing now to increase

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.709 
you what they're doing now to increase
quality<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.300> life<00:00:36.540> reduce<00:00:37.440> death<00:00:37.860> then<00:00:38.719> surely

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
quality of life reduce death then surely

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.430 
quality of life reduce death then surely
immortality<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:41.300> reducing<00:00:42.300> age<00:00:42.600> related

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
immortality and reducing age related

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.860 
immortality and reducing age related
deaths<00:00:43.980> would<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.059> way<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> go<00:00:45.480> but

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
deaths would be the way to go but

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.139 
deaths would be the way to go but
immediately<00:00:46.260> straight<00:00:47.160> away<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.489> guys<00:00:47.820> can

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
immediately straight away you guys can

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.720 
immediately straight away you guys can
see<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:49.230> if<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.530> happens<00:00:49.980> boom<00:00:50.340> you've<00:00:50.579> got

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
see that if this happens boom you've got

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.270 
see that if this happens boom you've got
another<00:00:50.879> hundred<00:00:51.210> thousand<00:00:51.660> people<00:00:51.690> every

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
another hundred thousand people every

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.220 
another hundred thousand people every
single<00:00:53.280> day<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.940> wouldn't<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
single day that wouldn't be there in a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.060 
single day that wouldn't be there in a
normal<00:00:55.680> natural<00:00:56.149> cycle<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.719> obviously<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
normal natural cycle so obviously in a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.279 
normal natural cycle so obviously in a
matter<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.520> years<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> result

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
matter of years this is going to result

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.420 
matter of years this is going to result
in<00:01:01.649> huge<00:01:02.190> huge<00:01:02.699> huge<00:01:03.439> overpopulation<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
in huge huge huge overpopulation if it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.600 
in huge huge huge overpopulation if it
was<00:01:05.580> done<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.420> literal<00:01:06.960> sense<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.189> human

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
was done in a literal sense so the human

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.469 
was done in a literal sense so the human
you<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.000> exists<00:01:09.810> carries<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.470> exist<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you know exists carries on to exist so a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.770 
you know exists carries on to exist so a
way<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.710> guess<00:01:14.250> prevent<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.450> know<00:01:15.600> if

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
way to I guess prevent this you know if

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.359 
way to I guess prevent this you know if
we<00:01:15.900> would<00:01:15.990> think<00:01:16.229> about<00:01:16.380> immortality<00:01:16.740> as<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
we would think about immortality as a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.550 
we would think about immortality as a
process<00:01:17.640> how<00:01:17.970> would<00:01:18.119> aging<00:01:18.540> occur<00:01:18.869> there

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
process how would aging occur there

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.260 
process how would aging occur there
would<00:01:19.680> people<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.130> fixed<00:01:20.490> at<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> certain<00:01:20.850> age

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
would people be fixed at a certain age

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.230 
would people be fixed at a certain age
and<00:01:21.890> it's<00:01:22.890> very<00:01:23.159> interesting<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:23.880> if

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and it's very interesting because if

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.590 
and it's very interesting because if
people<00:01:24.659> were<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:25.140> immortal<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
people were to be immortal then and the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.289 
people were to be immortal then and the
population<00:01:27.810> was<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.380> remain<00:01:28.560> stable<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:29.700> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
population was to remain stable then you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.030 
population was to remain stable then you
know<00:01:30.420> new<00:01:30.930> people<00:01:30.960> being<00:01:31.470> brought<00:01:31.710> into<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
know new people being brought into the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.670 
know new people being brought into the
world<00:01:32.119> would<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.689> limited<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
world would have to be limited and that

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.760 
world would have to be limited and that
would<00:01:35.400> lead<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.820> very<00:01:36.049> very<00:01:37.049> strange<00:01:37.439> world

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
would lead to a very very strange world

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.200 
would lead to a very very strange world
obviously<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.369> far<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.549> ethical<00:01:39.150> than

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
obviously it's far more ethical than

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.859 
obviously it's far more ethical than
causing<00:01:39.960> people<00:01:40.409> who<00:01:40.680> are<00:01:40.829> immortal<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> die

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
causing people who are immortal to die

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.660 
causing people who are immortal to die
but<00:01:42.869> at<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.140> same<00:01:43.439> way<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.799> know<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.310> there

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
but at the same way you know that there

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.819 
but at the same way you know that there
wouldn't<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.939> many<00:01:45.060> children<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.710> know

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
wouldn't be many children and you know

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.859 
wouldn't be many children and you know
would<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.610> right<00:01:47.909> way<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.119> go<00:01:48.329> around

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
would that be a right way to go around

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.109 
would that be a right way to go around
this<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.070> scenario<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.880> crazy

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
this kind of scenario it's a crazy

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.960 
this kind of scenario it's a crazy
scenario<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.869> kind<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.140> think<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.970> you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
scenario to kind of think of and you

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.789 
scenario to kind of think of and you
know<00:01:54.090> when<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.470> base

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
know when you think of it on a base

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.069 
know when you think of it on a base
level<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.549> kind<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.909> think<00:01:56.969> yourself<00:01:57.509> now

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
level you can kind of think yourself now

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.959 
level you can kind of think yourself now
this<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.680> too<00:01:58.860> much<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:59.219> Humanity<00:01:59.759> to

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
this is this is too much for Humanity to

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.389 
this is this is too much for Humanity to
handle<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.719> gonna<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.680> does<00:02:01.890> ever<00:02:02.189> get

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
handle this is gonna if it does ever get

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.649 
handle this is gonna if it does ever get
to<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> point<00:02:02.729> where<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.149> happen<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.600> is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
to the point where it can happen this is

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.660 
to the point where it can happen this is
gonna<00:02:03.840> mess<00:02:04.140> things<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.280> course<00:02:05.520> it's

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
gonna mess things up but of course it's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.190 
gonna mess things up but of course it's
going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.090> all<00:02:06.360> technology<00:02:06.960> where

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
going to be like all technology where

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.889 
going to be like all technology where
first<00:02:07.799> only<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.429> richest<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.209> most

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
first only the richest and the most

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.589 
first only the richest and the most
powerful<00:02:10.440> people<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:11.370> afford<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:12.150> go<00:02:12.270> through

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
powerful people can afford to go through

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.750 
powerful people can afford to go through
the<00:02:12.780> treatment

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
the treatment

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.309 
the treatment
but<00:02:13.939> like<00:02:14.239> most<00:02:14.450> technology<00:02:14.810> you'll<00:02:15.110> find

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
but like most technology you'll find

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.720 
but like most technology you'll find
that<00:02:15.439> it<00:02:15.560> gets<00:02:15.650> cheaper<00:02:16.099> and<00:02:16.220> cheaper<00:02:16.250> I

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
that it gets cheaper and cheaper I

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.270 
that it gets cheaper and cheaper I
remember<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.120> time<00:02:17.360> when<00:02:17.829> the<00:02:18.829> only<00:02:18.860> business

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
remember a time when the only business

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.640 
remember a time when the only business
people<00:02:19.819> had<00:02:20.030> smartphones<00:02:20.569> with<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.500> know

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
people had smartphones with you know

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.890 
people had smartphones with you know
mobile<00:02:22.159> internet<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.819> now<00:02:23.209> everyone<00:02:23.720> has

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
mobile internet and now everyone has

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.199 
mobile internet and now everyone has
them<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.319> know<00:02:24.409> you<00:02:24.470> me<00:02:25.129> people<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.790> know<00:02:25.970> a

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
them you know you me people you know a

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.119 
them you know you me people you know a
lot<00:02:26.629> of<00:02:26.659> teenagers<00:02:27.049> just<00:02:27.260> walking<00:02:27.620> around<00:02:27.739> and

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
lot of teenagers just walking around and

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.130 
lot of teenagers just walking around and
it's<00:02:28.519> going<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.700> be<00:02:28.849> one<00:02:29.269> of<00:02:29.540> those<00:02:29.750> situations

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
it's going to be one of those situations

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.190 
it's going to be one of those situations
where<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:31.010> slowly<00:02:31.420> develops<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.659> that's<00:02:33.079> a

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
where it slowly develops and that's a

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.229 
where it slowly develops and that's a
perfect<00:02:33.530> example<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:34.099> so<00:02:34.250> there<00:02:34.489> is<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.670> massive

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
perfect example of so there is a massive

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.330 
perfect example of so there is a massive
change<00:02:35.690> just<00:02:36.319> being<00:02:36.500> able<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.799> be<00:02:36.890> connected

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
change just being able to be connected

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.399 
change just being able to be connected
to<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.519> Internet<00:02:37.940> one<00:02:38.150> year<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:39.319> know

that's not possible you know how can

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.780 
that's not possible you know how can
people<00:02:51.319> have<00:02:51.530> all<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.799> this<00:02:51.920> information<00:02:52.129> all

people have all of this information all
the<00:02:52.819> time<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.389> is<00:02:53.510> too<00:02:54.049> much<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:54.560> they<00:02:54.680> won't

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
the time it is too much that they won't

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.300 
the time it is too much that they won't
be<00:02:54.920> able<00:02:55.069> to<00:02:55.280> comprehend<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:57.310> immortality

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
be able to comprehend it and immortality

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.059 
be able to comprehend it and immortality
could<00:02:58.849> be<00:02:58.940> looked<00:02:59.150> at<00:02:59.299> in<00:02:59.329> a<00:02:59.540> similar<00:02:59.989> way<00:03:00.069> and

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
could be looked at in a similar way and

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.319 
could be looked at in a similar way and
one<00:03:01.370> thing<00:03:01.549> I'm<00:03:01.670> going<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.879> cover<00:03:02.000> quickly

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
one thing I'm going to cover quickly

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:03.729 
one thing I'm going to cover quickly
that<00:03:02.540> should<00:03:02.720> have<00:03:02.810> covered<00:03:02.989> earlier<00:03:03.319> on

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
that should have covered earlier on

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.960 
that should have covered earlier on
actually<00:03:04.159> it's<00:03:04.340> just<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.579> idea<00:03:04.609> of

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
actually it's just the idea of

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.539 
actually it's just the idea of
immortality<00:03:05.500> itself<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.739> don't<00:03:07.220> think<00:03:07.430> there

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
immortality itself I don't think there

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.849 
immortality itself I don't think there
are<00:03:07.579> many<00:03:07.700> people<00:03:08.030> who<00:03:08.480> would<00:03:08.810> like<00:03:09.139> the<00:03:09.440> idea

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
are many people who would like the idea

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.160 
are many people who would like the idea
of<00:03:09.920> immortality<00:03:10.510> it's<00:03:11.510> something<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:12.139> you

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
of immortality it's something that you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.960 
of immortality it's something that you
know<00:03:12.349> a<00:03:12.379> lot<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.650> young<00:03:12.920> people<00:03:13.129> can<00:03:13.639> imagine

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
know a lot of young people can imagine

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.839 
know a lot of young people can imagine
themselves<00:03:14.269> living<00:03:14.659> forever<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:16.700> know

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
themselves living forever and you know

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.819 
themselves living forever and you know
just<00:03:16.879> everything<00:03:17.629> would<00:03:17.750> be<00:03:17.870> great<00:03:18.169> however

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
just everything would be great however

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.470 
just everything would be great however
as<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.010> get<00:03:19.280> older<00:03:19.669> I<00:03:19.699> think<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.120> allure<00:03:20.419> of

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
as you get older I think the allure of

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.180 
as you get older I think the allure of
that<00:03:20.900> kind<00:03:21.109> of<00:03:21.199> goes<00:03:21.349> away<00:03:21.590> but<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.010> a

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
that kind of goes away but is that a

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.369 
that kind of goes away but is that a
product<00:03:22.609> of<00:03:22.730> aging<00:03:23.299> itself<00:03:23.419> is<00:03:23.900> that<00:03:24.349> a

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
product of aging itself is that a

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.220 
product of aging itself is that a
product<00:03:24.799> of<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.250> long<00:03:25.459> existence<00:03:26.209> or<00:03:26.510> is<00:03:27.079> it

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
product of a long existence or is it

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.720 
product of a long existence or is it
just<00:03:27.379> something<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:28.040> humans<00:03:28.370> aren't

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
just something that humans aren't

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.909 
just something that humans aren't
designed<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.900> live<00:03:30.079> forever<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.590> if<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:30.799> gets

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
designed to live forever and if it gets

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.309 
designed to live forever and if it gets
to<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.069> point<00:03:31.129> where<00:03:31.519> you<00:03:32.389> know<00:03:32.510> would<00:03:33.049> things

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
to a point where you know would things

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.619 
to a point where you know would things
be<00:03:33.470> removed<00:03:34.340> with<00:03:34.579> the<00:03:34.699> purpose<00:03:35.090> of<00:03:35.180> things<00:03:35.419> be
