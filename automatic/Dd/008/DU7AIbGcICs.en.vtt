room without like pelting on me not the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.789 
room without like pelting on me not the

case and we've had conversations about
this<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.459> his<00:02:44.640> reasoning<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.420> know<00:02:45.510> I've

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
this and his reasoning is you know I've

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.449

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
always thought you were gorgeous then or

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.630 
always thought you were gorgeous then or
now<00:02:47.930> yes<00:02:48.930> you're<00:02:49.170> thinner<00:02:49.470> now<00:02:49.799> but<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.280> still

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
now yes you're thinner now but I still

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.610 
now yes you're thinner now but I still
want<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.239> desire<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:52.019> as<00:02:52.140> much<00:02:52.170> as<00:02:52.500> I

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
want you to desire you just as much as I

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.620 
want you to desire you just as much as I
did<00:02:52.799> then<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.010> now<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.000> think<00:02:54.060> for<00:02:54.239> me<00:02:54.480> it's

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
did then and now so I think for me it's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.920 
did then and now so I think for me it's
a<00:02:54.720> more<00:02:54.959> mental<00:02:55.350> complex<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.459> assumed<00:02:57.209> that

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
a more mental complex of I assumed that

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.500 
a more mental complex of I assumed that
things<00:02:58.380> would<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:59.160> more<00:02:59.609> hot<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.060> heavy<00:03:00.239> or

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
things would be more hot and heavy or

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.030 
things would be more hot and heavy or
the<00:03:00.630> he<00:03:00.780> just<00:03:00.989> wouldn't<00:03:01.290> be<00:03:01.410> able<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.620> resist

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
the he just wouldn't be able to resist

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.539 
the he just wouldn't be able to resist
the<00:03:02.489> urge<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:03.150> me<00:03:03.329> walking<00:03:03.540> in<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.989> room<00:03:04.549> so
