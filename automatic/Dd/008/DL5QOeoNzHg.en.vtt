00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.339 
lot of summoning clips
here<00:02:14.110> just<00:02:14.620> because<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:14.920> did<00:02:15.340> have<00:02:15.580> about<00:02:16.019> 3.5<00:02:17.019> K

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
here just because I did have about 3.5 K

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.149 
here just because I did have about 3.5 K
or<00:02:17.620> so

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
or so

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.979

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
Slayer and stuff like that and I figure

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.880 
Slayer and stuff like that and I figure
you<00:02:22.209> know<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.690> probably<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.379> fastest

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
you know this is probably the fastest

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.729 
you know this is probably the fastest
skill<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.430> actually<00:02:24.790> get<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.180> 80<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:26.319> I<00:02:26.349> decided

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
skill to actually get to 80 so I decided

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.399 
skill to actually get to 80 so I decided
to<00:02:27.069> just<00:02:27.280> go<00:02:27.489> from<00:02:27.730> 74<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.330> 80<00:02:28.599> 70<00:02:29.049> and<00:02:29.200> only

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
to just go from 74 to 80 70 and only

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:30.960 
to just go from 74 to 80 70 and only
took<00:02:29.560> about<00:02:29.680> an<00:02:29.950> hour<00:02:30.069> it<00:02:30.340> really<00:02:30.370> hardly<00:02:30.819> took

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
took about an hour it really hardly took

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.860 
took about an hour it really hardly took
any<00:02:31.030> time<00:02:31.269> at<00:02:31.569> all

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
any time at all

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.199 
any time at all

and there are some other clips mixed in
here<00:02:36.220> as<00:02:36.400> well<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:36.879> not<00:02:36.970> all<00:02:37.329> summoning<00:02:37.900> so

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
here as well it's not all summoning so

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.110 
here as well it's not all summoning so
don't<00:02:38.319> worry<00:02:38.409> about<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.769> but<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.819> will<00:02:40.000> be

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
don't worry about that but I will be

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.850 
don't worry about that but I will be
trying<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.480> just<00:02:40.659> grind<00:02:40.870> away<00:02:41.200> on<00:02:41.349> some<00:02:41.560> skills

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
trying to just grind away on some skills

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.729 
trying to just grind away on some skills
try<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.250> get<00:02:42.459> them<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.819> level<00:02:43.180> 80<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:44.470> also

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
try to get them to level 80 and I also

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.860 
try to get them to level 80 and I also
did<00:02:45.040> some<00:02:45.220> fire<00:02:45.430> making<00:02:45.849> because<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.450> was

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
did some fire making because I was

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.869 
did some fire making because I was
pretty<00:02:47.109> close<00:02:47.319> to<00:02:47.379> getting<00:02:47.859> level<00:02:48.430> 80<00:02:48.609> fire

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
pretty close to getting level 80 fire

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.759 
pretty close to getting level 80 fire
making<00:02:49.150> as<00:02:49.420> well<00:02:49.629> and<00:02:49.810> fire<00:02:49.959> making<00:02:50.290> is<00:02:50.410> really

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
making as well and fire making is really

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:51.509 
making as well and fire making is really
really<00:02:50.980> fast

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
really fast

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.460 
really fast
and<00:02:51.640> even<00:02:52.000> with<00:02:52.180> maple<00:02:52.420> logs<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:53.049> didn't<00:02:53.319> take

through<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.019> video<00:03:53.260> just<00:03:53.500> because<00:03:53.889> they<00:03:54.129> are

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
through the video just because they are

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.500 
through the video just because they are
different<00:03:54.310> levels<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:55.030> I<00:03:55.060> was<00:03:55.150> trying<00:03:55.359> to<00:03:55.389> get

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
themselves just because that's the

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.839 
themselves just because that's the
easiest<00:03:58.959> way<00:03:59.199> to<00:03:59.230> do<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.650> really<00:03:59.799> and<00:04:00.069> here<00:04:00.699> was

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
easiest way to do it really and here was

game here so I've just been doing some
smithing<00:04:51.400> I<00:04:51.520> did<00:04:51.699> buy<00:04:51.849> 80<00:04:52.180> smithing<00:04:52.749> in<00:04:52.990> gold

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:53.379 
smithing I did buy 80 smithing in gold

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.469 
smithing I did buy 80 smithing in gold
bars<00:04:53.620> so<00:04:53.889> I<00:04:53.919> have<00:04:54.189> Ben<00:04:54.370> Smith<00:04:54.580> knows<00:04:54.849> and<00:04:55.150> this

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
bars so I have Ben Smith knows and this

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.529 
bars so I have Ben Smith knows and this
isn't<00:04:55.689> terribly<00:04:56.169> fast<00:04:56.409> it's<00:04:56.740> about<00:04:57.159> 75<00:04:57.789> K<00:04:58.090> XP

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
isn't terribly fast it's about 75 K XP

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.779 
isn't terribly fast it's about 75 K XP
per<00:04:58.689> hour<00:04:58.840> so<00:04:59.439> getting<00:04:59.860> to<00:04:59.979> level<00:05:00.099> 80<00:05:00.400> is<00:05:00.580> going

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
per hour so getting to level 80 is going

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.490 
per hour so getting to level 80 is going
to<00:05:00.849> take<00:05:01.029> about<00:05:01.210> 11<00:05:01.750> hours<00:05:02.020> so<00:05:02.169> that's<00:05:02.349> going

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
to take about 11 hours so that's going

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.499 
to take about 11 hours so that's going
to<00:05:02.590> be<00:05:02.680> quite<00:05:02.919> time-consuming<00:05:03.279> but<00:05:03.909> I'm<00:05:04.300> sure

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
to be quite time-consuming but I'm sure

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.110 
to be quite time-consuming but I'm sure
I<00:05:04.539> can<00:05:04.750> do<00:05:04.900> it<00:05:05.020> in<00:05:05.199> a<00:05:05.319> few<00:05:05.650> days<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:06.069> it<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:06.819> also

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
I can do it in a few days and it is also

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.879

very very afk you get like a minute and

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.350 
very very afk you get like a minute and

to just do whatever while your character
is<00:05:12.039> melting<00:05:12.370> away<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.240> double

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229

again<00:05:46.330> there<00:05:46.509> will<00:05:46.599> be<00:05:46.659> more<00:05:46.899> money<00:05:47.080> making<00:05:47.319> on

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:47.589 
again there will be more money making on

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:49.889 
again there will be more money making on
this<00:05:47.800> account<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:48.969> whenever<00:05:49.210> I<00:05:49.389> do<00:05:49.509> something

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:49.899 
this account and whenever I do something

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:51.749 
this account and whenever I do something
that<00:05:50.110> makes<00:05:50.379> money<00:05:50.620> I<00:05:50.770> will<00:05:51.009> record<00:05:51.370> that<00:05:51.490> and

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
that makes money I will record that and

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.790 
that makes money I will record that and
that<00:05:52.000> will<00:05:52.149> go<00:05:52.330> towards<00:05:52.719> the<00:05:52.870> road<00:05:52.960> to<00:05:53.139> 100<00:05:53.649> mil

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
that will go towards the road to 100 mil

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.559 
that will go towards the road to 100 mil
so<00:05:54.279> it's<00:05:54.430> not<00:05:54.580> like<00:05:54.759> I'm<00:05:54.909> quitting<00:05:55.300> on<00:05:55.419> that

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569
