00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.830

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.900
 hours so I explain to you then me 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.369
 I do not have hair naturally 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.750
 like that they are curly wavy can 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.859
 so to have things like that so 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:37.410
 you will need elastics 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:38.040
 I have this you see then a pencil 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.290
 paper 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.360

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.300
 so I took a gram on foot 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.780
 basic and your hours list a 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.120
 straightener with extra large slaps 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.489
 I searched everywhere and found 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.430

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.559

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.650
 site 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.900

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.640
 speed bumps like this one you can 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.140
 take 10 hours very well like this if 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.830
 you see them it's very good too 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.150

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.060

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.210
 easy it is very simple but me 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.770

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.369
 either do you see cars doing is 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.869
 touch 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.180
 I have trouble because I have a lot of 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.530
 hair and everything is and then it's gone 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.710

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.190
 straightener then me it's the one on the 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.380
 extra wide as a plate but you 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.840

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.300
 like a vacuum on can use any 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:26.940
