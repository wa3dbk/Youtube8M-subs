00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.160 

I<00:00:31.070> think<00:00:31.670> the<00:00:31.880> original<00:00:32.239> game<00:00:32.270> was<00:00:32.599> incredibly

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
I think the original game was incredibly

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.080 
I think the original game was incredibly
compelling<00:00:33.500> because<00:00:33.770> you<00:00:34.309> could<00:00:34.610> play<00:00:34.850> all

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
compelling because you could play all

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.520 
compelling because you could play all
three<00:00:35.360> characters<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:35.960> you<00:00:36.020> kind<00:00:36.290> of<00:00:36.380> got<00:00:36.500> the

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
three characters so you kind of got the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.350 
three characters so you kind of got the
story<00:00:36.920> from<00:00:37.040> different<00:00:37.579> perspectives<00:00:37.670> you've

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
story from different perspectives you've

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.760 
story from different perspectives you've
got<00:00:38.540> your<00:00:38.809> marine<00:00:39.170> story<00:00:39.410> which<00:00:39.739> was

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
got your marine story which was

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.710 
got your marine story which was
fantastic<00:00:40.040> but<00:00:40.790> also<00:00:40.910> we<00:00:41.210> allowed<00:00:41.449> the<00:00:41.600> player

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
fantastic but also we allowed the player

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.689 
fantastic but also we allowed the player
to<00:00:41.840> see<00:00:42.470> the<00:00:42.620> world<00:00:42.800> from<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.280> Predators

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
to see the world from the Predators

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.310 
to see the world from the Predators
perspective<00:00:44.270> as<00:00:44.660> well<00:00:44.809> as<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.020> aliens

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
perspective as well as the aliens

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.750 
perspective as well as the aliens
perspective<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:45.860> get<00:00:45.949> a<00:00:45.980> different<00:00:46.370> part<00:00:46.579> of

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
perspective and get a different part of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.700 
perspective and get a different part of
the<00:00:46.820> same<00:00:47.089> story<00:00:50.290> technologies<00:00:51.290> moved<00:00:51.500> on<00:00:51.680> a

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
the same story technologies moved on a

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.220 
the same story technologies moved on a
long<00:00:51.860> time<00:00:52.220> in<00:00:52.519> the<00:00:52.940> last<00:00:53.150> 10<00:00:53.360> years<00:00:53.390> visually

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
long time in the last 10 years visually

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.810 
long time in the last 10 years visually
we<00:00:54.530> were<00:00:54.589> able<00:00:54.769> to<00:00:55.010> do<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:55.430> kinds<00:00:55.460> of<00:00:55.730> things

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
we were able to do the kinds of things

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.610 
we were able to do the kinds of things
we<00:00:56.059> only<00:00:56.180> dreamt<00:00:56.510> about<00:00:56.720> being<00:00:56.900> able<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.440> do

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
we only dreamt about being able to do

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.030 
we only dreamt about being able to do
back<00:00:57.949> on<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.160> original<00:00:58.699> game<00:00:59.739> the<00:01:00.739> level<00:01:01.010> of

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
back on the original game the level of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.799 
back on the original game the level of
detail<00:01:01.100> in<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.640> environments<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.420> lighting

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
detail in the environments the lighting

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.170 
detail in the environments the lighting
effects<00:01:03.110> we<00:01:03.289> can<00:01:03.469> use<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:04.160> facial<00:01:04.610> animation

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
effects we can use the facial animation

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.660 
effects we can use the facial animation
on<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.449> characters<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:06.590> all<00:01:06.740> goes<00:01:07.160> towards

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
on the characters it all goes towards

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.690 
on the characters it all goes towards
creating<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:08.300> more<00:01:08.479> intense<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:10.009> realistic

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
creating a more intense and realistic

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.230 
creating a more intense and realistic
and<00:01:11.060> compelling<00:01:11.600> experience<00:01:13.240> obviously

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
and compelling experience obviously

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.520 
and compelling experience obviously
having<00:01:14.630> done<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.840> original<00:01:15.200> version<00:01:15.289> of<00:01:15.470> the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
having done the original version of the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.840 
having done the original version of the
game<00:01:15.649> we've<00:01:15.860> got<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.009> very<00:01:16.130> solid<00:01:16.640> gameplay

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
game we've got a very solid gameplay

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.760 
game we've got a very solid gameplay
foundation<00:01:17.660> but<00:01:17.930> what<00:01:18.140> we<00:01:18.259> have<00:01:18.410> to<00:01:18.530> do<00:01:18.649> is

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
foundation but what we have to do is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.779 
foundation but what we have to do is
improve<00:01:19.130> things<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.970> innovate<00:01:20.600> where<00:01:20.780> we<00:01:20.869> can

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
improve things and innovate where we can

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.460 
improve things and innovate where we can
the<00:01:22.789> atmosphere<00:01:23.240> of<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.479> original<00:01:23.810> game<00:01:23.840> was

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
the atmosphere of the original game was

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.469 
the atmosphere of the original game was
obviously<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.070> really<00:01:25.369> big<00:01:25.520> part<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.940> it<00:01:26.090> the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
obviously a really big part of it the

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.359 
obviously a really big part of it the
fear<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.960> dark<00:01:27.170> is<00:01:27.320> very<00:01:27.500> primal<00:01:28.160> human

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
fear of the dark is very primal human

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.400 
fear of the dark is very primal human
thing<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.149> that<00:01:29.330> continues<00:01:29.840> through<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.259> this

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
thing and that continues through to this

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.020 
thing and that continues through to this
one<00:01:30.619> but<00:01:30.830> we're<00:01:30.950> able<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.460> deliver<00:01:31.820> an

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
one but we're able to deliver an

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.550 
one but we're able to deliver an

entirely new level of sophistication

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.620 
entirely new level of sophistication
with<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.460> technology<00:01:34.789> we<00:01:35.030> have<00:01:35.300> available

now

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.240 
now
really<00:01:39.020> exciting<00:01:39.440> is<00:01:39.560> some<00:01:39.770> people<00:01:40.010> are<00:01:40.070> still
