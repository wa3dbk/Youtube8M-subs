see<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> players<00:00:20.699> foot<00:00:21.180> kind<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.570> glides<00:00:22.080> up

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
see the players foot kind of glides up

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.620 
see the players foot kind of glides up
to<00:00:22.769> strike<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.220> ball<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.519> slides<00:00:24.000> along<00:00:24.269> an

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
to strike the ball it slides along an

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.200 
to strike the ball it slides along an
imaginary<00:00:25.560> video<00:00:26.010> game<00:00:26.310> pitch<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.000> that's

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
imaginary video game pitch and that's

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.660 
imaginary video game pitch and that's
just<00:00:27.420> not<00:00:27.570> very<00:00:28.080> realistic<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.490> one<00:00:29.640> of

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
just not very realistic this is one of

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.859 
just not very realistic this is one of
the<00:00:29.820> things<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> event<00:00:30.689> they

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the things that at the event they

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.290 
the things that at the event they
focused<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.710> they<00:00:31.769> said<00:00:32.009> hey<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.700> actually

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
focused on and they said hey we actually

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.120 
focused on and they said hey we actually
want<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> go<00:00:33.660> back<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.110> change<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.380> again<00:00:34.559> same

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
want to go back and change it again same

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.590 
want to go back and change it again same
thing<00:00:35.399> right<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:35.610> we're<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> slow<00:00:36.450> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
thing right here we're going to slow it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.240 
thing right here we're going to slow it
down<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.590> he<00:00:37.829> doesn't<00:00:38.129> really

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
down you can see he doesn't really

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.520 
down you can see he doesn't really
stutter<00:00:38.670> step<00:00:38.969> he<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.840> make<00:00:40.020> up<00:00:40.200> for<00:00:40.230> it

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
stutter step he just to make up for it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.530 
stutter step he just to make up for it
kind<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.010> slide<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.640> there's<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.180> left<00:00:42.360> foot

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
kind of slide so there's the left foot

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.350 
kind of slide so there's the left foot
somehow<00:00:43.140> kind<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.620> hopping<00:00:44.160> forward<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:45.059> not

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
somehow kind of hopping forward it's not

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.299 
somehow kind of hopping forward it's not
very<00:00:45.629> realistic<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.559> has<00:00:46.710> been<00:00:46.890> addressed

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
very realistic this has been addressed

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
very realistic this has been addressed
in<00:00:47.730> FIFA<00:00:48.090> 14<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.600> they're<00:00:48.690> calling<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.170> pure

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
in FIFA 14 and they're calling it pure

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.529 
in FIFA 14 and they're calling it pure
shot<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.090> right<00:00:51.120> there

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
shot there you can see right there

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
shot there you can see right there
player<00:00:51.899> takes<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.320> stutter<00:00:52.710> step<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:53.250> he's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
player takes a stutter step as he's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.279 
player takes a stutter step as he's
approaching<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.180> ball<00:00:54.420> we're<00:00:54.809> gonna<00:00:54.899> slow<00:00:55.260> it

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
approaching the ball we're gonna slow it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.799 
approaching the ball we're gonna slow it
down<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.680> look<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:55.949> again<00:00:56.460> watch<00:00:57.360> his<00:00:57.570> left

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
down and look at it again watch his left

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.170 
down and look at it again watch his left
foot<00:00:58.020> he<00:00:58.500> approaches<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.579> he<00:00:59.670> takes<00:01:00.000> that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
foot he approaches it and he takes that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.779 
foot he approaches it and he takes that
stutter<00:01:00.539> step<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.590> yard<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.250> advance<00:01:02.609> of

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
stutter step you know yard in advance of

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.910 
stutter step you know yard in advance of
actually<00:01:03.000> striking<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.930> ball<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.320> hits<00:01:04.830> a

so<00:01:06.900> very<00:01:07.170> exciting<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:08.010> those<00:01:08.189> animations

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
so very exciting to see those animations

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
in FIFA 14 it's going to really add an

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.010 
in FIFA 14 it's going to really add an
enjoyment<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.640> scoring<00:01:11.970> goals<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.479> my<00:01:12.780> most

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
enjoyment to scoring goals in my most

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.740 
enjoyment to scoring goals in my most
humble<00:01:13.290> opinion<00:01:13.830> again<00:01:14.310> fifa<00:01:14.700> 14<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.450> here

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
humble opinion again fifa 14 right here

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.050 
humble opinion again fifa 14 right here
we're<00:01:16.170> slowing<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.860> down<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.700> ball

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
we're slowing it down this is ball

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.640 
we're slowing it down this is ball
physics<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> player<00:01:19.259> doesn't

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
physics you can see the player doesn't

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.560 
physics you can see the player doesn't
seem<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> strike<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.490> cleanly<00:01:20.790> he<00:01:21.360> may<00:01:21.509> be

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
seem to strike it cleanly he may be

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.359 
seem to strike it cleanly he may be
bleeped<00:01:21.840> maybe<00:01:22.170> let<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> ball<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.920> little

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
bleeped maybe let the ball get a little

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.609 
bleeped maybe let the ball get a little
too<00:01:23.580> far<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.210> front<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.570> him<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.750> he<00:01:25.140> ends

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
too far out in front of him and he ends

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
too far out in front of him and he ends
up<00:01:25.799> hitting<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.759> little<00:01:27.090> bit<00:01:27.330> off-balance

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
up hitting it a little bit off-balance

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.810 
up hitting it a little bit off-balance
creating<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.650> tail<00:01:28.979> spin<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> right

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
creating this tail spin on it right

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.520 
creating this tail spin on it right
there<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.299> watch<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:31.140> as<00:01:31.350> well

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
there you can watch this one as well

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.469 
there you can watch this one as well
another<00:01:31.950> example<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.729> gonna<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.030> dipping

another example it's gonna be a dipping

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.080 
another example it's gonna be a dipping
shot<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.930> another<00:01:34.229> cool<00:01:34.590> new<00:01:34.890> shot<00:01:35.250> animation

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
shot so another cool new shot animation

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.420 
shot so another cool new shot animation
that'll<00:01:36.720> allow<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> wider<00:01:37.650> variety<00:01:37.920> of
