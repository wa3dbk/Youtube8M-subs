00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.360
 Hamburg comes out the percent easy 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.360
 short time 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.759
 Hello my dear friends and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.139
 welcome to the new episode let's play 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.730
 clash of flames today with the cash games 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.990
 and yes you certainly asked for something 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.670
 Today we drove a know already in 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.330
 always third we have today like 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.920
 Champions exactly and you can mine 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.519
 to say what we interchange today 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.450
 So we're both gonna do it 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.340
 said in the camp and have the same 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.410
 groups trained or the same pressure 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.050
 give a composition that means we 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.790
 come to a very nice new 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.350
 lockscreen her in and I was having 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.390
 we clean a poison clean 55 55 foot 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.460
 and each of the heroes do not dress 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.600
 because now I just get no pleasure 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.190
 but it is not bad either 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.840
 that's why you just have to leave, I think 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.129
 I'm not going to let that house out of the house 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.750
 put that in a bit 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.109
 It can be stupid 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.969
 ok, all right before marriage or me can 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.330
 we start well as I start to say 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.409
 now go search until now 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.080
 just think you have 3205 or something 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.540
 So I think I'm just on the border 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 but it would be best if we were such a 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.979
 heaters would have taken so we the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.340
 nice to put over the inferno 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.229
 if ours and exactly because 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.689
 you know dear people keep clean against 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.570
 multi inferno, it is removed from 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.650
 definitely needs us all 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.350
 exactly but I guess why get 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.369
 you can get that way in any case 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.810
 I'm just curious if we are too 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.799
 Decide to find opponents because I mean 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.320
 Boys go directly to the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.990
 Do not defend the rest 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.020
 Well, I'm already looking for people 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.390
 no helmet 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.220
 also the inferno on single everything yes 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.360
 but the stop heavy fighting these are 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.580
 not infrequently and I think 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.140
 just stop if I was directly the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.820
 it actually solo designated to receive 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.440
 but i should consider if i have the 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.799
 Heroes are already chic and then 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.039
 my air rifle or both that is 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.940
 then stop not sure because then 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.600
 I do not have the names anymore 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.600
 get the town hall 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.330
 he just got rid of those very stupid things 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.790
 23 europe looks tasty 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.600
 but then I can actually take 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.519
 okay, where should I go? 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:34.239
 next to it has its level of town hall 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:37.010
 eight or nine york / wien on 19 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.360
 he has two - from the expansion and everything with 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.819
 The air was still there, I do not know if 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.569
 access get it my luis 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.549
 simply at 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.610
 I get to believe heavy opponents 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.620
 I mean, I'm sure I am 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.330
 find mostly only so max city hall tens 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:57.280
 from cape of defense 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.280
 I 'm just human now 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.860
 but I only find people here with multi - 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.780
 among you here just all right to 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.610
 it is so exaggerated that now vw one 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.320
 she can barely control us 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.970
 that's really the problem and before 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.800
 All I have is a short one 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.800
 report carpet absolutely clean 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.990
 Hamburg comes out the percent easy 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.210
 short time with the result but the 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.320
 putty still nice and wittmann i know 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.320
 not like I should come in there 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.090

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:00.010
 just all loose on and indeed at 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.760
 me a mistake in the train split what 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.740
 almost mistakes 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.810
 I believe because I accept 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.959
 have divided it was the snowfall comes 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.590
 also queen comes forward to coming in 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.420
 makes us see your job age with me 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.489
 actually relatively good at how can 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.410
 we the queen is huge as well 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:23.200
 runs in comes already comes already comes 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.790
 already when the war is coming 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.050
 please the x-bow please please please 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:32.050
 Please let the prices for me 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.310
 Heroes come running series already went 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.030
 wait a bit for something to come out 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.030
 come already come on 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.540
 even if it does not it also that the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.720
 to shoot at the height must go around it 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.530
 the outside of the team is a queen 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.530
 cashed damage 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.910
 man man 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.420
 how is it with you from the same time 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.500
 so my only question is to live with me 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:08.670
 the queen is shaving that just now 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.990
 a little better hero can do that 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.050
 I 'll use it now 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.650
 the excuse yes because they can get the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.260
 sense still something true 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.330
 what single multi of course now 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:27.840
 just as much as possible to me 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:29.820
 just fine, but it would have to 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.500
 slower in the range of single in 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.570
 television now ignited again and 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.730
 again the last percent out here 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.250
 zack zack zack the word goes on the 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:41.820
 airborne troops to pass a state law 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.630
 end of mine is also sitting around 19 seconds 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:48.840
 but now and nice - 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.850
 to say then you say're running now 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.240
 times first how much percent and provides 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.090
 So I got 60 percent 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:02.790
 brought and two stars 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:08.550
 I have that unfortunately is bad 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:11.370
 I say there is still no he has 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.600
 always as lucky as I already am 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.720
 once won a challenge so I am 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.280
 yes, every challenge went from that white 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.760
 yes what annoys me is you have to 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.050
 always wear warm 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.480
 Do you want a punishment now? 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.830
 that the audience I I would go for 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.590
 first of all , I have his audience 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.950
 less to think about and the between 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.430
 definitely involved in each 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.220
 case 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.510
 ok with that say if we massage the 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.430
 find a job 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.770
 I liked it anyway 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.500
 passing by and then passing over 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.810
 now again 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.870
 the announcement exactly we are glad about 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.170
 I think your upstairs because 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.150
 we all like so beautiful are all 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.560
 otherwise yes as I said the audience 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.890
 Watching me fight on a railway 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:01.530
 and from my side what now I too 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.530
 I wish you a clean skin
