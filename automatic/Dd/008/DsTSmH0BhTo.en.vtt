00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
doing because he's slightly slow but it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.470

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
game and I believe he's in a region of

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.720 
game and I believe he's in a region of
two<00:03:21.519> hundred<00:03:21.790> thousand<00:03:22.540> coins<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.579> is<00:03:24.699> a

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
two hundred thousand coins so that is a

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.240 
two hundred thousand coins so that is a
team<00:03:25.030> complete<00:03:25.419> guys<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.680> team<00:03:27.220> is

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
team complete guys and this team is

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.930 
team complete guys and this team is
rated<00:03:27.819> 87<00:03:28.599> full<00:03:29.139> chemistry<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.040> this<00:03:30.579> is<00:03:30.760> the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
rated 87 full chemistry and this is the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.879 
rated 87 full chemistry and this is the
best<00:03:31.180> way<00:03:31.419> to<00:03:31.480> lay<00:03:31.989> out<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.440> team<00:03:32.680> for

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
best way to lay out the team for

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.339 
best way to lay out the team for
chemistry<00:03:33.310> anyway<00:03:33.699> and<00:03:34.090> without<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:35.049> subs

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
chemistry anyway and without the subs

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.089 
chemistry anyway and without the subs
this<00:03:35.650> team<00:03:35.859> would<00:03:36.040> be<00:03:36.220> rated<00:03:37.079> 73<00:03:38.079> i<00:03:38.109> believe<00:03:38.620> so

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
this team would be rated 73 i believe so

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.710 
this team would be rated 73 i believe so
this<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:39.549> the<00:03:39.730> highest<00:03:39.940> rate<00:03:40.209> of<00:03:40.239> permittivity

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
this is the highest rate of permittivity

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.199 
this is the highest rate of permittivity
without<00:03:41.440> informs<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:42.579> i<00:03:42.609> hope<00:03:42.879> you<00:03:42.909> guys

if<00:03:47.919> you're<00:03:48.430> on<00:03:48.639> the<00:03:48.669> xbox<00:03:49.150> 360<00:03:49.659> disc<00:03:49.989> team<00:03:50.169> will

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
if you're on the xbox 360 disc team will

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.460 
if you're on the xbox 360 disc team will
cost<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.680> roughly<00:03:51.150> 750<00:03:52.150> k<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.569> make<00:03:52.870> mainly

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
cost you roughly 750 k to make mainly

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.990 
cost you roughly 750 k to make mainly
because<00:03:53.620> there's<00:03:53.889> a<00:03:53.949> strike<00:03:54.159> force<00:03:54.459> Aguero

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
because there's a strike force Aguero

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.879 
because there's a strike force Aguero
and<00:03:55.299> Van<00:03:55.479> Persie<00:03:55.510> costs<00:03:56.229> combined<00:03:56.680> together

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
and Van Persie costs combined together

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.030 
and Van Persie costs combined together
about<00:03:57.479> 350<00:03:58.479> k<00:03:58.629> which<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.079> insane<00:03:59.560> because<00:03:59.799> they

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
about 350 k which is insane because they

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.159 
about 350 k which is insane because they
probably<00:04:00.280> cost<00:04:00.609> about<00:04:00.819> half<00:04:01.449> of<00:04:01.629> this<00:04:01.870> squad

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
probably cost about half of this squad

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.969 
probably cost about half of this squad
then<00:04:02.470> if<00:04:02.680> there<00:04:03.220> were<00:04:03.400> 350<00:04:04.299> k<00:04:04.659> but<00:04:05.260> they<00:04:05.500> are<00:04:05.650> so

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:05.979 
then if there were 350 k but they are so

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.009 
then if there were 350 k but they are so
lethal<00:04:06.250> doubt<00:04:06.729> really<00:04:07.000> what<00:04:07.239> makes<00:04:07.510> his<00:04:07.780> team

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
lethal doubt really what makes his team

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.289 
lethal doubt really what makes his team
van<00:04:08.530> persie<00:04:09.010> is<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.220> most<00:04:09.459> clinical<00:04:10.060> shocker

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
van persie is the most clinical shocker

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.300 
van persie is the most clinical shocker
that<00:04:10.510> I've<00:04:10.629> played<00:04:10.780> with<00:04:10.959> on<00:04:11.229> fifa<00:04:11.620> 14<00:04:11.859> just

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
that I've played with on fifa 14 just

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.520 
that I've played with on fifa 14 just
because<00:04:12.609> he's<00:04:12.729> finishing<00:04:13.090> is<00:04:13.389> so<00:04:13.629> lethal<00:04:13.900> his

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
because he's finishing is so lethal his

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.710 
because he's finishing is so lethal his
finisher<00:04:15.099> is<00:04:15.280> insane<00:04:15.819> on<00:04:16.030> his<00:04:16.180> left<00:04:16.419> foot<00:04:16.570> and

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
finisher is insane on his left foot and

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.689 
finisher is insane on his left foot and
he's<00:04:16.989> also<00:04:17.199> pretty<00:04:17.530> decent<00:04:18.070> on<00:04:18.220> his<00:04:18.400> rapport

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
he's also pretty decent on his rapport

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.029 
he's also pretty decent on his rapport
as<00:04:19.030> well<00:04:19.299> even<00:04:19.989> though<00:04:20.139> I<00:04:20.169> don't<00:04:20.560> think<00:04:20.829> he<00:04:20.949> has

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
as well even though I don't think he has

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.610 
as well even though I don't think he has
five<00:04:21.279> star<00:04:21.609> week<00:04:21.820> for<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.300> guerra<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.169> also<00:04:23.590> a

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
five star week for a guerra is also a

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.060 
five star week for a guerra is also a
very<00:04:24.130> clean<00:04:24.700> of

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
very clean of

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.710 
very clean of
trackers<00:04:25.460> well<00:04:25.760> he's<00:04:25.910> not<00:04:26.060> as<00:04:26.180> clinical<00:04:26.630> as

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
trackers well he's not as clinical as

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.690 
trackers well he's not as clinical as
van<00:04:26.900> persie<00:04:27.350> but<00:04:27.620> he<00:04:27.800> creates<00:04:28.130> just<00:04:28.430> as<00:04:28.550> much

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
van persie but he creates just as much

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.790 
van persie but he creates just as much
as<00:04:28.910> chances<00:04:29.330> as<00:04:29.450> him<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:29.780> also<00:04:30.260> scores

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
as chances as him and also scores

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.010 
as chances as him and also scores
roughly<00:04:31.490> half<00:04:31.760> of<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.060> goals<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.480> van

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
roughly half of the goals that van

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.230 
roughly half of the goals that van
persie<00:04:33.440> scores<00:04:33.740> is<00:04:34.010> wall<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:34.760> them<00:04:35.000> two<00:04:35.210> are

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
persie scores is wall so them two are

persie scores is wall so them two are
really<00:04:35.780> what<00:04:36.050> makes<00:04:36.260> his<00:04:36.500> team<00:04:36.740> and<00:04:36.980> they<00:04:37.190> are

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250

in<00:05:05.480> my<00:05:05.690> opinion<00:05:05.990> he<00:05:06.530> scored<00:05:06.860> one<00:05:07.130> goal<00:05:07.160> for<00:05:07.370> me

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
in my opinion he scored one goal for me

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.490 
in my opinion he scored one goal for me
throughout<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.120> whole<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.570> the<00:05:09.080> matches<00:05:09.290> that

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
throughout the whole of the matches that

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.290 
throughout the whole of the matches that
I<00:05:09.620> played<00:05:09.860> with<00:05:10.010> him<00:05:10.220> but<00:05:10.640> he<00:05:10.820> just<00:05:10.850> didn't

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
I played with him but he just didn't

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.150 
I played with him but he just didn't
contribute<00:05:11.660> 100<00:05:12.020> k<00:05:12.350> worth<00:05:12.620> to<00:05:12.770> this<00:05:12.890> team

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
contribute 100 k worth to this team

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.980 
contribute 100 k worth to this team
maybe<00:05:13.760> you<00:05:14.000> could<00:05:14.150> say<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.330> same<00:05:14.450> for<00:05:14.630> Ozil

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
maybe you could say the same for Ozil

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.660 
maybe you could say the same for Ozil
but<00:05:15.290> he<00:05:15.380> did<00:05:15.560> create<00:05:15.800> a<00:05:15.920> lot<00:05:16.100> of<00:05:16.130> chances<00:05:16.610> and

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
but he did create a lot of chances and

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.180 
but he did create a lot of chances and
only<00:05:17.240> scored<00:05:17.570> a<00:05:17.720> couple<00:05:17.990> but<00:05:18.590> he<00:05:18.800> is<00:05:18.920> better

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
only scored a couple but he is better

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.040 
only scored a couple but he is better
than<00:05:19.340> till<00:05:19.610> what<00:05:19.790> in<00:05:19.880> my<00:05:20.030> opinion<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.690> silver

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
than till what in my opinion and silver

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.810 
than till what in my opinion and silver
is<00:05:21.170> not<00:05:21.380> worth<00:05:21.620> over<00:05:22.010> a<00:05:22.040> hundred<00:05:22.310> thousand

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
is not worth over a hundred thousand

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.120 
is not worth over a hundred thousand
matter<00:05:23.420> done<00:05:23.720> well<00:05:23.990> in<00:05:24.200> this<00:05:24.320> team<00:05:24.620> is<00:05:24.800> war<00:05:24.980> but

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
matter done well in this team is war but

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.850 
matter done well in this team is war but
I<00:05:25.250> don't<00:05:25.490> believe<00:05:25.760> he's<00:05:25.970> scored<00:05:26.330> for<00:05:26.510> me<00:05:26.630> and

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
I don't believe he's scored for me and

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.960 
I don't believe he's scored for me and
now<00:05:27.860> I'm<00:05:27.950> going<00:05:28.070> to<00:05:28.130> be<00:05:28.220> talking<00:05:28.400> about<00:05:28.580> some

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
now I'm going to be talking about some

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.610 
now I'm going to be talking about some
changes<00:05:29.450> that<00:05:29.600> you<00:05:29.720> could<00:05:29.870> make<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.230> this<00:05:30.350> team

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
changes that you could make to this team

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.620 
changes that you could make to this team
and<00:05:30.770> this<00:05:30.830> is<00:05:31.400> basically<00:05:31.940> just<00:05:32.060> a<00:05:32.480> defense

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
and this is basically just a defense

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.050 
and this is basically just a defense
I'll<00:05:33.050> keep<00:05:33.440> company<00:05:33.920> in<00:05:34.190> his<00:05:34.340> defense<00:05:34.700> because

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
I'll keep company in his defense because

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.340 
I'll keep company in his defense because
he's<00:05:35.240> probably<00:05:35.450> one<00:05:35.720> of<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.900> best<00:05:36.140> thing

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
he's probably one of the best thing

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.410 
he's probably one of the best thing
about<00:05:36.470> inner<00:05:36.890> Premier<00:05:37.310> League<00:05:37.490> but<00:05:38.030> i<00:05:38.060> would

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
about inner Premier League but i would

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.210 
about inner Premier League but i would
change<00:05:38.690> videos<00:05:39.140> just<00:05:39.380> because<00:05:39.710> of<00:05:39.830> his<00:05:39.950> pace

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
change videos just because of his pace

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.460 
change videos just because of his pace
he's<00:05:40.640> very<00:05:40.760> solid<00:05:41.390> as<00:05:41.570> a<00:05:41.600> senate<00:05:42.020> back<00:05:42.140> because

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
he's very solid as a senate back because

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.560 
he's very solid as a senate back because
of<00:05:42.500> his<00:05:42.710> strength<00:05:43.070> and<00:05:43.250> his<00:05:43.370> technique<00:05:43.880> but<00:05:44.390> i

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
of his strength and his technique but i

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.870 
of his strength and his technique but i
would<00:05:44.900> prefer<00:05:45.290> to<00:05:45.620> have<00:05:45.980> someone<00:05:46.520> like<00:05:46.580> Louise

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
would prefer to have someone like Louise

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.780 
would prefer to have someone like Louise
de<00:05:47.390> who<00:05:47.810> is<00:05:47.960> just<00:05:48.350> as<00:05:48.530> a<00:05:48.590> nuisance<00:05:49.130> of<00:05:49.340> him<00:05:49.550> and

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
de who is just as a nuisance of him and

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.450 
de who is just as a nuisance of him and
will<00:05:50.210> create<00:05:50.390> more<00:05:50.690> chances<00:05:51.170> like<00:05:51.380> going<00:05:52.340> up

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
will create more chances like going up

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.070 
will create more chances like going up
four<00:05:52.700> corners<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:53.330> stuff<00:05:53.480> like<00:05:53.690> that<00:05:53.750> and

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
four corners and stuff like that and

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.500 
four corners and stuff like that and
also<00:05:54.500> is<00:05:54.890> just<00:05:55.130> a<00:05:55.220> nuisance<00:05:55.460> to<00:05:55.760> strikers<00:05:56.330> I

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510

would also replace Ashley Cole even

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.060 
would also replace Ashley Cole even
though<00:05:59.450> he's<00:05:59.660> a<00:05:59.690> decent<00:05:59.960> left<00:06:00.410> back<00:06:00.620> with
