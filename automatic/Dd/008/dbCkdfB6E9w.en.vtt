speed<00:01:45.529> but<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.729> can<00:01:46.939> work<00:01:47.270> up<00:01:47.420> your<00:01:47.450> speed<00:01:47.810> as

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
speed but you can work up your speed as

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.289 
speed but you can work up your speed as
soon<00:01:48.139> as<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.349> get<00:01:48.469> used<00:01:48.709> to<00:01:48.829> it<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.219> the<00:01:50.029> point

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
soon as you get used to it and the point

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.269 
soon as you get used to it and the point
is<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.599> create<00:01:50.749> a<00:01:50.959> nice<00:01:51.289> little<00:01:51.619> cushion<00:01:52.069> or

is to create a nice little cushion or
base<00:01:52.819> just<00:01:53.479> like<00:01:53.659> that<00:01:53.899> you<00:01:54.439> can<00:01:54.590> see<00:01:54.770> when<00:01:54.920> you

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
base just like that you can see when you

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.739 
base just like that you can see when you
let<00:01:55.219> go<00:01:55.369> of<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.609> hair<00:01:55.819> it<00:01:56.060> stays<00:01:56.359> nice<00:01:56.719> and

you<00:02:22.690> don't<00:02:22.810> need<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.110> tease<00:02:23.320> all<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:24.190> way<00:02:24.310> to

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
you don't need to tease all the way to

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.100 
you don't need to tease all the way to
the<00:02:24.700> end<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.180> hair<00:02:25.330> shaft<00:02:25.390> they're<00:02:25.810> just

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
the end of the hair shaft they're just

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.650 
the end of the hair shaft they're just
right<00:02:26.410> at<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.890> base<00:02:27.070> gives<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.670> nice<00:02:27.880> lift

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
right at the base gives it the nice lift

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.390 
right at the base gives it the nice lift
that<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.960> need<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.770> I'm<00:02:29.860> going<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.040> continue

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400
