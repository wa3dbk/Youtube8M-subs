00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
doing is making sure eight volts not too

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.770 
doing is making sure eight volts not too
long<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:30.670> that<00:03:30.700> when<00:03:30.909> you<00:03:31.000> scroll<00:03:31.269> through<00:03:31.450> it

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
on the bottom but again the work like

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.309 
on the bottom but again the work like
that<00:03:57.510> but<00:03:58.510> again<00:03:58.540> you're<00:03:58.930> going<00:03:59.019> to<00:03:59.109> want<00:03:59.260> to

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
that but again you're going to want to

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.670 
that but again you're going to want to
make<00:03:59.530> sure<00:03:59.560> that<00:04:00.419> the<00:04:01.419> nut<00:04:01.689> doesn't<00:04:02.169> stick

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
make sure that the nut doesn't stick

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.409 
make sure that the nut doesn't stick
through<00:04:03.780> like<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:06.280> right<00:04:06.609> now<00:04:06.669> because

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
through like it is right now because

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.580 
through like it is right now because
that<00:04:07.599> could<00:04:07.750> just<00:04:07.930> poke<00:04:08.229> hole<00:04:08.560> right<00:04:08.859> in<00:04:10.590> and

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
that could just poke hole right in and

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.030 
that could just poke hole right in and
finally<00:04:11.919> the<00:04:12.310> last<00:04:12.340> thing<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:14.560> may<00:04:14.709> want<00:04:14.739> to

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:24.120 
finally the last thing you may want to
do<00:04:15.599> use<00:04:16.599> a<00:04:16.959> nice<00:04:21.720> Mountain<00:04:22.720> board<00:04:22.930> they<00:04:23.620> have

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
do use a nice Mountain board they have

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.810 
do use a nice Mountain board they have
wheels<00:04:25.030> on<00:04:25.360> them<00:04:25.479> so<00:04:26.280> don't<00:04:27.280> really<00:04:27.520> have<00:04:27.669> to

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
wheels on them so don't really have to

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.820 
wheels on them so don't really have to
worry<00:04:27.849> about<00:04:28.120> them<00:04:28.510> poking<00:04:29.139> through<00:04:29.500> big<00:04:29.650> old

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.450 
worry about them poking through big old
air<00:04:30.070> wheels<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:32.440> they<00:04:32.560> aren't<00:04:32.680> very<00:04:32.860> small<00:04:33.250> or

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
air wheels so they aren't very small or

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.839 
air wheels so they aren't very small or
anything<00:04:34.080> or<00:04:35.080> if<00:04:35.199> you<00:04:35.380> want<00:04:35.650> you<00:04:35.919> can<00:04:36.580> still

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
two bikes are how well you can see them

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.170 
two bikes are how well you can see them
this<00:05:21.530> yellow<00:05:21.830> and<00:05:22.160> blue<00:05:22.430> one<00:05:22.639> right<00:05:22.760> here<00:05:23.030> I

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
this yellow and blue one right here I

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.469 
this yellow and blue one right here I
was<00:05:23.389> going<00:05:23.600> to<00:05:23.720> make<00:05:23.960> a<00:05:24.460> trip<00:05:25.460> bike<00:05:25.760> out<00:05:26.030> of<00:05:26.060> and

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
was going to make a trip bike out of and

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.510 
was going to make a trip bike out of and
I<00:05:26.810> know<00:05:26.870> how<00:05:27.169> to<00:05:27.229> and<00:05:27.710> I<00:05:27.770> reached<00:05:27.949> until<00:05:28.130> you<00:05:28.400> go

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
I know how to and I reached until you go

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.270 
I know how to and I reached until you go
a<00:05:28.550> little<00:05:28.729> while<00:05:28.970> I<00:05:29.320> know<00:05:30.320> how<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:30.620> take<00:05:30.830> the

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
a little while I know how to take the

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.540 
a little while I know how to take the
wheels<00:05:31.490> off<00:05:31.790> gears<00:05:32.300> everything<00:05:33.080> well<00:05:33.860> these

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
wheels off gears everything well these

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.190 
wheels off gears everything well these
have<00:05:35.300> suspension<00:05:37.000> so<00:05:38.000> I<00:05:38.240> didn't<00:05:38.840> know<00:05:38.990> if

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
have suspension so I didn't know if

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.379 
have suspension so I didn't know if
anybody<00:05:39.320> else<00:05:39.800> has<00:05:40.070> ever<00:05:40.250> used<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.180> mount

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
anybody else has ever used the mount

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.180 
anybody else has ever used the mount
bike<00:05:41.660> and<00:05:42.020> how<00:05:42.139> it<00:05:42.320> works<00:05:42.590> with<00:05:42.950> the

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
bike and how it works with the

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.219 
bike and how it works with the
suspension<00:05:43.970> so<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.510> spring<00:05:44.990> from<00:05:45.169> the

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
suspension so the spring from the

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.700 
suspension so the spring from the
suspension<00:05:45.919> and<00:05:46.130> the<00:05:46.190> spring<00:05:46.550> from<00:05:46.850> the

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
suspension and the spring from the

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.270 
suspension and the spring from the
trampoline<00:05:49.540> because<00:05:50.620> this<00:05:51.620> one<00:05:51.800> if<00:05:51.919> you<00:05:52.070> look

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
trampoline because this one if you look

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.440 
trampoline because this one if you look
it's<00:05:52.520> kind<00:05:52.790> of<00:05:52.880> an<00:05:53.169> angle<00:05:54.169> through<00:05:54.860> here<00:05:55.450> goes

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
it's kind of an angle through here goes

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.040 
it's kind of an angle through here goes
down<00:05:58.120> so<00:05:59.120> I<00:05:59.180> didn't<00:05:59.389> know<00:05:59.450> how<00:05:59.570> that's<00:05:59.780> worked

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
down so I didn't know how that's worked

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.100 
down so I didn't know how that's worked
for<00:06:00.169> anybody<00:06:00.680> and<00:06:01.039> this<00:06:01.460> one<00:06:01.729> is<00:06:01.910> a<00:06:02.750> lot<00:06:03.080> easier

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
for anybody and this one is a lot easier

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.219 
for anybody and this one is a lot easier
to<00:06:03.590> tell<00:06:04.010> behind<00:06:04.940> it<00:06:05.120> here<00:06:07.479> and<00:06:08.479> I've<00:06:08.780> just<00:06:08.810> got

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
to tell behind it here and I've just got

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.250 
to tell behind it here and I've just got
the<00:06:09.380> same<00:06:09.650> question<00:06:09.950> I<00:06:10.720> know<00:06:11.720> how<00:06:11.960> to<00:06:12.020> do

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
the same question I know how to do

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.840 
the same question I know how to do
everything<00:06:12.490> just<00:06:13.570> this<00:06:14.570> back<00:06:14.930> bar<00:06:15.380> back<00:06:16.340> here

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
everything just this back bar back here

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.450 
everything just this back bar back here
is<00:06:17.680> higher<00:06:18.680> up<00:06:18.820> then<00:06:19.820> the<00:06:20.030> center<00:06:20.450> point<00:06:21.460> so

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
is higher up then the center point so

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.070 
is higher up then the center point so
I've<00:06:22.729> been<00:06:23.030> thinking<00:06:23.090> about<00:06:23.539> maybe<00:06:23.810> just

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
I've been thinking about maybe just

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.870 
I've been thinking about maybe just
trying<00:06:24.289> to<00:06:24.349> take<00:06:24.560> this<00:06:24.770> spring<00:06:25.160> out<00:06:25.370> and

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
trying to take this spring out and

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.490 
trying to take this spring out and
putting<00:06:26.090> a<00:06:26.270> longer<00:06:26.660> piece<00:06:26.870> of<00:06:27.050> wood<00:06:27.229> in<00:06:27.349> there

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
putting a longer piece of wood in there

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.260 
putting a longer piece of wood in there
to<00:06:27.740> push<00:06:28.460> that<00:06:28.700> down<00:06:29.289> so<00:06:30.610> please<00:06:31.610> once<00:06:32.120> again
