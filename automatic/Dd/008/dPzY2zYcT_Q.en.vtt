00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
five-star weak foot which means left

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.270 
five-star weak foot which means left
foot<00:01:19.780> right<00:01:19.990> foot<00:01:20.050> it<00:01:20.410> doesn't<00:01:20.860> matter<00:01:20.950> see

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
foot right foot it doesn't matter see

foot right foot it doesn't matter see
when<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:21.550> get<00:01:21.730> one<00:01:22.000> on<00:01:22.120> one<00:01:22.330> of<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.480> go<00:01:22.600> in

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
score and FIFA now is to just turn one

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.390 
score and FIFA now is to just turn one
way<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.700> finesse<00:01:28.300> and<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:29.380> can<00:01:29.620> turn<00:01:29.830> left<00:01:30.190> or

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
way and finesse and you can turn left or

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.190 
way and finesse and you can turn left or
right<00:01:30.730> with<00:01:30.970> Namor<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.630> he's<00:01:31.870> going<00:01:32.050> to<00:01:32.110> be

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
right with Namor and he's going to be

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.720 
right with Namor and he's going to be
able<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.440> finesse<00:01:32.650> it<00:01:32.710> easily<00:01:33.370> around<00:01:33.610> the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
able to finesse it easily around the

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.100 
able to finesse it easily around the
keeper<00:01:34.000> because<00:01:34.270> he's<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.390> five-star<00:01:34.900> weak

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
keeper because he's a five-star weak

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.780 
keeper because he's a five-star weak
foot<00:01:35.350> so<00:01:35.500> his<00:01:35.680> right<00:01:35.890> foots<00:01:36.160> good<00:01:36.370> his<00:01:36.520> left

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
foot so his right foots good his left

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.180 
foot so his right foots good his left
foot<00:01:36.970> is<00:01:37.060> good<00:01:37.270> but<00:01:37.690> what<00:01:37.900> makes<00:01:38.170> name<00:01:38.470> or<00:01:38.680> not

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
foot is good but what makes name or not

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.190 
foot is good but what makes name or not
so<00:01:39.550> good<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.030> this<00:01:40.330> is<00:01:40.450> gonna<00:01:40.570> sound<00:01:40.810> really

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
so good and this is gonna sound really

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.530 
so good and this is gonna sound really
stupid<00:01:41.680> when<00:01:41.920> I<00:01:42.070> say<00:01:42.370> it<00:01:42.520> because<00:01:42.550> when<00:01:43.180> you<00:01:43.330> go

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
stupid when I say it because when you go

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.800 
stupid when I say it because when you go
look<00:01:43.840> at<00:01:43.990> his<00:01:44.140> stats<00:01:44.440> he<00:01:44.860> has<00:01:44.890> 92<00:01:45.810> acceleration

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
look at his stats he has 92 acceleration

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.040 
look at his stats he has 92 acceleration
but<00:01:47.320> his<00:01:47.500> acceleration<00:01:48.190> feel<00:01:49.360> that's

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
but his acceleration feel that's

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.930 
but his acceleration feel that's
absolutely<00:01:50.620> hate<00:01:51.190> his<00:01:51.370> acceleration

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
absolutely hate his acceleration

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.030 
absolutely hate his acceleration
compared<00:01:52.450> to<00:01:52.600> Messi<00:01:52.960> compared<00:01:53.650> to<00:01:53.830> bail

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
compared to a lot of players that I play

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.470 
compared to a lot of players that I play
with<00:01:56.230> on<00:01:56.380> this<00:01:56.470> BBVA<00:01:56.950> team<00:01:57.070> name<00:01:57.970> or<00:01:58.180> when<00:01:58.390> you

with on this BBVA team name or when you

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.240 
with on this BBVA team name or when you
give<00:01:58.659> him<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.840> through<00:01:59.140> pass<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.620> seems<00:02:00.070> like

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
give him a through pass it seems like

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.950 
give him a through pass it seems like
when<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.550> stop<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.120> go<00:02:01.300> with<00:02:01.479> him<00:02:01.690> his

when you stop and go with him his

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.440 
when you stop and go with him his
acceleration<00:02:02.890> isn't<00:02:03.310> as<00:02:03.760> good<00:02:04.060> as<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.420> should

really<00:02:18.849> understand<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.599> when<00:02:19.750> he's

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
really understand like when he's

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.569 
really understand like when he's
sprinting<00:02:20.290> when<00:02:20.590> he's<00:02:20.709> on<00:02:20.829> the<00:02:20.950> go<00:02:21.099> as<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.400> see

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
sprinting when he's on the go as you see

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.099 
sprinting when he's on the go as you see
right<00:02:21.609> there<00:02:21.909> he<00:02:21.939> could<00:02:22.150> run<00:02:22.239> past<00:02:22.510> anybody

but when he stops and goes his
acceleration<00:02:25.719> /<00:02:26.019> seems<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.409> bit<00:02:26.560> slow<00:02:26.829> but

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
acceleration / seems a bit slow but

the real deal if you can deal with

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.110 
the real deal if you can deal with
acceleration<00:02:56.260> issues<00:02:57.250> then<00:02:57.519> Neymar<00:02:57.909> is<00:02:57.939> a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
acceleration issues then Neymar is a

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.229 
acceleration issues then Neymar is a
good<00:02:58.450> pickup<00:02:58.720> but<00:02:59.319> like<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.650> said<00:02:59.709> speed<00:03:00.639> pace

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
good pickup but like I said speed pace

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.479 
good pickup but like I said speed pace
is<00:03:01.510> important<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.379> FIFA<00:03:02.709> 15<00:03:02.859> and<00:03:03.370> its

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
is important in FIFA 15 and its

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.190 
is important in FIFA 15 and its
acceleration<00:03:04.060> kind<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.629> makes<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.019> his

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
acceleration kind of makes it his

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.140 
acceleration kind of makes it his
downfall<00:03:05.470> but<00:03:05.889> I<00:03:05.950> do<00:03:06.040> still<00:03:06.430> think<00:03:06.489> he's<00:03:06.909> worth

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
downfall but I do still think he's worth

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.000 
downfall but I do still think he's worth
