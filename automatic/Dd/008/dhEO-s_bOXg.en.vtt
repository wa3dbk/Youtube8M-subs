just<00:00:02.310> bringing<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.669> another<00:00:02.840> p-47<00:00:03.840> test<00:00:04.110> and

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
just bringing you another p-47 test and

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.920 
just bringing you another p-47 test and
I<00:00:04.680> know<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:04.859> already<00:00:05.370> tested<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:05.970> p-47<00:00:06.720> in

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
I know I already tested the p-47 in

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.629 
I know I already tested the p-47 in
regards<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.529> its<00:00:07.589> diet<00:00:07.859> performance<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.550> it

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639

model analysis but both of those tests I

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.330 
model analysis but both of those tests I
found<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.509> little<00:00:16.289> bit<00:00:16.470> inadequate<00:00:16.830> they

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
found to be a little bit inadequate they

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.920 
found to be a little bit inadequate they
weren't<00:00:17.550> they<00:00:17.970> weren't<00:00:18.090> tested<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.600> exactly

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
weren't they weren't tested in exactly

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.900 
weren't they weren't tested in exactly
the<00:00:19.080> way<00:00:19.199> they<00:00:19.470> should<00:00:19.529> have<00:00:19.770> been<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.699> that's

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the way they should have been and that's

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.210 
the way they should have been and that's
what<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.689> trying<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.170> do<00:00:22.289> here<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.769> test<00:00:23.100> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
going to measure the amount of time it

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.850 
going to measure the amount of time it
takes<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> speed<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.600> drop<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.930> 250<00:00:49.469> miles

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
takes for the speed to drop to 250 miles

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.709 
takes for the speed to drop to 250 miles
per<00:00:50.039> hour<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.789> amount<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.030> altitude<00:00:51.480> gain

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
per hour and the amount of altitude gain

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.270 
per hour and the amount of altitude gain
in<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.350> time<00:00:53.539> alright<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.660> again<00:00:54.829> 4041<00:00:55.829> feet

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
in that time alright so again 4041 feet

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.069 
in that time alright so again 4041 feet
in<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.610> amount<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.879> time<00:00:56.969> plus<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.690> compel<00:00:57.989> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
in that amount of time plus is compel it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.380 
in that amount of time plus is compel it
to<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> focke-wulf<00:00:58.500> 190<00:00:59.239> alright<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.329> I'm

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
to the focke-wulf 190 alright so I'm

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.819 
to the focke-wulf 190 alright so I'm
here<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.600> my<00:01:00.690> pocket<00:01:00.840> will<00:01:01.050> 490<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> five

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
here in my pocket will 490 a five

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.770 
here in my pocket will 490 a five
testing<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> same<00:01:02.760> zoom<00:01:03.059> climb<00:01:03.300> under<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
testing the same zoom climb under the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.289 
testing the same zoom climb under the
same<00:01:03.960> circumstances<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.070> testing<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> same

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
same circumstances and testing the same

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.500 
same circumstances and testing the same
things<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> different<00:01:07.110> plane<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
things just with a different plane and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.420 
things just with a different plane and
the<00:01:09.510> p-47<00:01:10.200> considering<00:01:10.740> its<00:01:10.860> heavier<00:01:11.189> weight

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the p-47 considering its heavier weight

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.580 
the p-47 considering its heavier weight
it's<00:01:11.670> much<00:01:11.820> heavier<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.659> should<00:01:12.960> there's<00:01:13.530> this

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it's much heavier it should there's this

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.289 
it's much heavier it should there's this
parasitic<00:01:14.010> drag<00:01:14.220> much<00:01:14.580> better<00:01:14.850> than<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
parasitic drag much better than the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.120 
parasitic drag much better than the
focke-wulf<00:01:15.479> 190<00:01:16.020> a5<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.530> therefore<00:01:16.890> zoom

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
focke-wulf 190 a5 and therefore zoom

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.179 
focke-wulf 190 a5 and therefore zoom
climb<00:01:17.340> better<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.390> we'll<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.189> all

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
climb better so we'll see about that all

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.440 
climb better so we'll see about that all
right<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.549> here<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.180> focke-wulf

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
right so if here is not the focke-wulf

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.530 
right so if here is not the focke-wulf
190<00:01:22.080> 85<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.799> more<00:01:23.130> altitude<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.729> retained

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
190 85 and more altitude and retained

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.950 
190 85 and more altitude and retained
its<00:01:24.689> energy<00:01:24.990> for<00:01:25.200> longer<00:01:25.560> than<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.890> p-47

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
its energy for longer than a p-47

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.640 
its energy for longer than a p-47
alright<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> next<00:01:28.140> thing<00:01:28.259> I'm<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.530> do

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
alright the next thing I'm going to do

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.859 
alright the next thing I'm going to do
is<00:01:28.770> test<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> p-47s<00:01:29.850> dive<00:01:30.060> capabilities<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
is test the p-47s dive capabilities and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.289 
is test the p-47s dive capabilities and
compared<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> focke-wulf<00:01:31.619> 190<00:01:32.340> first<00:01:33.090> up

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
compared to the focke-wulf 190 first up

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.870 
compared to the focke-wulf 190 first up
is<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> focke-wulf<00:01:33.869> 190<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.920> how<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:35.759> going

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
is the focke-wulf 190 and how I'm going

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.490 
is the focke-wulf 190 and how I'm going
to<00:01:35.939> test<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.570> I'm<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.290> at

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
to test this is I'm going to be going at

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.340 
to test this is I'm going to be going at
450<00:01:38.070> miles<00:01:38.460> per<00:01:38.670> hour<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:38.939> 10,000<00:01:39.840> feet<00:01:39.900> and

450 miles per hour at 10,000 feet and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.109 
450 miles per hour at 10,000 feet and
I'm<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.130> pitch<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> nose<00:01:41.579> down<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
I'm going to pitch the nose down to a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.340 
I'm going to pitch the nose down to a
negative<00:01:42.720> 30<00:01:43.110> degree<00:01:43.409> dive<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.899> see<00:01:45.899> what

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
negative 30 degree dive and see what

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.499 
negative 30 degree dive and see what
speed<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.399> plane<00:01:47.610> reaches<00:01:48.030> by<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.210> time<00:01:48.390> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
speed the plane reaches by the time it

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.340 
speed the plane reaches by the time it
hits<00:01:48.659> 4,000<00:01:49.590> feet

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.859 

alright<00:01:53.350> so<00:01:53.439> we<00:01:53.560> can<00:01:53.680> see<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:53.890> 19<00:01:54.189> you<00:01:54.280> hit<00:01:54.869> 467

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
alright so we can see the 19 you hit 467

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.740 
alright so we can see the 19 you hit 467
miles<00:01:56.140> per<00:01:56.500> hour<00:01:57.060> alright<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:58.150> next<00:01:58.270> up<00:01:58.450> is<00:01:58.600> the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
miles per hour alright so next up is the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.969 
miles per hour alright so next up is the
p-47<00:01:59.439> and<00:01:59.619> we<00:02:00.340> shall<00:02:00.610> see<00:02:00.670> its<00:02:01.540> dive<00:02:02.470> speed<00:02:02.770> by

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
p-47 and we shall see its dive speed by

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.710 
p-47 and we shall see its dive speed by
testing<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.580> same<00:02:03.790> way<00:02:03.939> we<00:02:04.090> tested<00:02:04.540> the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
testing it the same way we tested the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.279 
testing it the same way we tested the
focke-wulf<00:02:05.200> 190<00:02:06.659> negative<00:02:07.659> 30<00:02:07.840> degree<00:02:08.110> dive

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
focke-wulf 190 negative 30 degree dive

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.590 
focke-wulf 190 negative 30 degree dive
from<00:02:08.739> 10,000<00:02:09.429> feet<00:02:09.459> we're<00:02:10.090> going<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.239> see<00:02:10.450> what

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
from 10,000 feet we're going to see what

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.960 
from 10,000 feet we're going to see what
it<00:02:10.690> gets<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.380> about<00:02:11.410> time<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.950> hits<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.250> 4,000

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
it gets to about time it hits to 4,000

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:21.750 
it gets to about time it hits to 4,000
feet

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.850 

alright<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.510> we<00:02:22.599> can<00:02:22.720> see<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.170> actually<00:02:23.560> didn't

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
alright so we can see it actually didn't

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.130 
alright so we can see it actually didn't
get<00:02:24.010> as<00:02:24.280> fast<00:02:24.640> as<00:02:24.909> the<00:02:25.060> focke-wulf<00:02:25.269> 190<00:02:25.900> only

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
get as fast as the focke-wulf 190 only

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.179 
get as fast as the focke-wulf 190 only
reaching<00:02:26.489> 464<00:02:27.489> miles<00:02:27.879> per<00:02:28.180> hour<00:02:29.010> alright<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.159> I

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
reaching 464 miles per hour alright so I

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.740 
reaching 464 miles per hour alright so I
hope<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.579> settles<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:31.000> few<00:02:31.180> things<00:02:31.329> about<00:02:31.510> the

hope this settles a few things about the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.839 
hope this settles a few things about the
p-47s<00:02:32.349> flight<00:02:32.560> model<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.489> hope<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:33.730> guys
