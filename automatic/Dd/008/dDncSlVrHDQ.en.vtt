today<00:00:00.810> I'm<00:00:00.930> gonna<00:00:01.140> do<00:00:01.380> a<00:00:01.410> review<00:00:01.890> for<00:00:02.129> this

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
today I'm gonna do a review for this

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.949 
today I'm gonna do a review for this
weird<00:00:02.520> thing<00:00:02.730> I<00:00:02.850> ordered<00:00:03.090> off<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.480> internet<00:00:03.629> a

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
weird thing I ordered off the internet a

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.740 
weird thing I ordered off the internet a
few<00:00:04.110> years<00:00:04.589> ago<00:00:04.910> it's<00:00:05.910> called<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.330> Pokemon

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
few years ago it's called the Pokemon

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.870 
few years ago it's called the Pokemon
Ranger<00:00:07.049> set<00:00:07.470> but<00:00:08.309> I'm<00:00:08.400> guessing<00:00:08.580> it's<00:00:08.820> from

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
Ranger set but I'm guessing it's from

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.669 
Ranger set but I'm guessing it's from
the<00:00:09.120> movie<00:00:09.269> rather<00:00:09.660> than<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.080> game<00:00:10.290> because

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
the movie rather than the game because

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.259 
the movie rather than the game because
of<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:11.010> stock<00:00:11.730> art<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:13.549> green<00:00:14.549> styler

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
of a stock art and the green styler

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.150 
of a stock art and the green styler
thing<00:00:15.680> but<00:00:16.680> anyway<00:00:18.800> kind<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.859> like<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
thing but anyway kind of like the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.099 
thing but anyway kind of like the
football<00:00:20.400> Rangers<00:00:20.970> game<00:00:21.300> more<00:00:21.840> than<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
football Rangers game more than the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.609 
football Rangers game more than the
movie<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.590> guess<00:00:22.769> that's<00:00:22.920> why<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.189> got<00:00:23.430> this

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
movie so I guess that's why I got this

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:42.369 
movie so I guess that's why I got this
there<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.769> go<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:41.070> as<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
there we go so as we can see with the

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.680 
there we go so as we can see with the
styler<00:00:43.379> thing<00:00:43.649> has<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> little<00:00:45.090> keypad<00:00:45.570> of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
styler thing has a little keypad of

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.650 
styler thing has a little keypad of
buttons<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.289> don't<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.620> any<00:00:47.510> numbers<00:00:48.510> on

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
buttons that don't have any numbers on

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.930 
buttons that don't have any numbers on
them<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:50.190> push<00:00:50.399> them<00:00:50.640> but<00:00:50.820> they

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
them but you can push them but they

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.990 
them but you can push them but they
don't<00:00:51.149> really<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.809> anything<00:00:52.230> since<00:00:53.000> instead

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
don't really do anything since instead

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.430 
don't really do anything since instead
of<00:00:54.090> having<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.390> lot<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.809> I'll<00:00:54.930> try<00:00:55.230> an

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
of having a lot and I'll try an

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.330 
of having a lot and I'll try an
electronic<00:00:56.250> screen<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.750> put<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:59.190> just

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
electronic screen they just put it just

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.920 
electronic screen they just put it just
include<00:00:59.640> these<00:00:59.879> cards<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.660> put

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
include these cards that you can put

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.260 
include these cards that you can put
into<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.789> looks<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.030> there's

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
into it and so it looks like there's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.050 
into it and so it looks like there's
something<00:01:03.420> on-screen<00:01:04.519> also<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> cards

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
something on-screen also all the cards

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.530 
something on-screen also all the cards
have<00:01:06.270> two<00:01:06.900> sides<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.970> here<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.090> take<00:01:09.270> another

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
have two sides like here to take another

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.600 
have two sides like here to take another
one<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.210> put<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> other<00:01:12.930> way

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
one in so you can put it the other way

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.420 
one in so you can put it the other way
around<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:15.979> but<00:01:16.979> anyway<00:01:18.619> um<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.159> also

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
around and then but anyway um and also

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.969 
around and then but anyway um and also
has<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.700> weird<00:01:20.909> door<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> I'm<00:01:21.930> still<00:01:22.890> not

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
has this weird door on it I'm still not

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.550 
has this weird door on it I'm still not
sure<00:01:23.040> what's<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.030> these<00:01:25.020> things<00:01:25.259> could

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
sure what's for it these things could

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.830 
sure what's for it these things could
either<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.950> buttons<00:01:26.369> or<00:01:26.520> screens<00:01:26.970> because<00:01:27.360> you

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
either be buttons or screens because you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.450 
either be buttons or screens because you
can't<00:01:28.080> press<00:01:28.320> them<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.860> there's<00:01:29.040> nothing<00:01:29.369> on

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
can't press them and there's nothing on

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.100 
can't press them and there's nothing on
them<00:01:30.079> but<00:01:31.079> there's<00:01:31.290> also<00:01:31.470> um<00:01:32.750> antenna<00:01:33.750> thing

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
them but there's also um antenna thing

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.590 
them but there's also um antenna thing
not<00:01:34.890> sure<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.250> all<00:01:35.970> about

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
not sure what that all about

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.210 
not sure what that all about
there<00:01:37.229> was<00:01:37.350> something<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.710> kids<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
there was something like kids in the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.350 
there was something like kids in the
game<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:40.220> doesn't<00:01:41.220> go<00:01:41.340> nearly<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.759> long<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.210> it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
game but doesn't go nearly as long as it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.060 
game but doesn't go nearly as long as it
was<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> game<00:01:42.899> or<00:01:43.110> something<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.590> guess

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
was in the game or something I guess

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.300 
was in the game or something I guess
and<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.259> see<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.560> also<00:01:49.710> has<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> top

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
and you can see that also has a top

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.039 
and you can see that also has a top
launcher<00:01:50.880> thing<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.899> take

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
launcher thing on it and so you can take

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.190 
launcher thing on it and so you can take
one<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.259> these<00:01:55.380> captured<00:01:56.009> disk<00:01:56.460> things<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:58.250> I

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
one of these captured disk things and I

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.569 
one of these captured disk things and I
figured<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.350> they<00:02:01.500> thought<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.280> these

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
figured that they thought that these

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.139 
figured that they thought that these
would<00:02:02.790> get<00:02:02.909> lost<00:02:03.119> immediately<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.170> they

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
would get lost immediately so they

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.310 
would get lost immediately so they
whether<00:02:06.149> they<00:02:06.240> include<00:02:06.479> three<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.990> them<00:02:07.140> or

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
whether they include three of them or

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.430 
whether they include three of them or
something<00:02:08.330> but<00:02:09.330> after<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.780> whined<00:02:10.050> about<00:02:10.110> for

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
something but after you whined about for

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.490 
something but after you whined about for
a<00:02:10.500> bit<00:02:10.649> then

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
a bit then

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.390 
a bit then
I<00:02:12.270> guess<00:02:13.270> they<00:02:13.450> spin<00:02:13.870> but<00:02:14.140> let's<00:02:14.950> see<00:02:15.100> if<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.250> can

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
I guess they spin but let's see if I can

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.160 
I guess they spin but let's see if I can
five<00:02:15.580> please<00:02:18.210> yeah<00:02:19.210> if<00:02:19.360> they<00:02:19.510> crash<00:02:19.750> against

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
five please yeah if they crash against

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.790 
five please yeah if they crash against
anything<00:02:20.350> they<00:02:20.560> make<00:02:20.770> lots<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.130> noise<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:25.800> so

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
anything they make lots of noise and so

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.860 
anything they make lots of noise and so
anyway<00:02:27.160> there's<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:28.120> rest<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.510> cards

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
anyway there's the rest of the cards

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.980 
anyway there's the rest of the cards
there<00:02:29.140> too<00:02:30.160> -<00:02:30.640> there<00:02:30.910> were<00:02:31.030> like<00:02:31.210> three<00:02:31.750> packs

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
there too - there were like three packs

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.050 
there too - there were like three packs

I<00:03:16.140> think<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.260> hold<00:03:17.769> on<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.220> think<00:03:18.580> that<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
I think that hold on I think that the

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.400 
I think that hold on I think that the
idea<00:03:19.120> is<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.690> were<00:03:19.780> supposed<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.170> try<00:03:20.350> to

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
idea is that you were supposed to try to

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.680 
idea is that you were supposed to try to
get<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.830> top<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.220> circle<00:03:21.610> around<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:22.450> figure

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
get the top to circle around the figure

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.870 
get the top to circle around the figure
like<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:24.040> would<00:03:24.160> do<00:03:24.280> in<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.550> game<00:03:24.700> or

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
like you would do in the game or

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.050 
like you would do in the game or
something<00:03:25.120> except<00:03:25.420> that<00:03:26.100> I've<00:03:27.100> tried<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.760> once

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
something except that I've tried it once

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.330 
something except that I've tried it once
and<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.989> top<00:03:29.170> just<00:03:29.380> either<00:03:29.530> stays<00:03:29.920> in<00:03:30.130> place

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
and the top just either stays in place

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.070 
and the top just either stays in place
or<00:03:30.550> crashes<00:03:31.030> right<00:03:31.209> into<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.630> figure<00:03:31.959> and

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
or crashes right into the figure and

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:39.030 
or crashes right into the figure and
makes<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.410> buzzing<00:03:32.620> noise<00:03:33.750> but<00:03:34.750> anyway<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.980> I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
makes a buzzing noise but anyway so I

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.380 
makes a buzzing noise but anyway so I
guess<00:03:39.459> that's<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:40.120> all<00:03:40.269> of<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.600> and<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:42.390> don't

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
guess that's the all of it and I don't

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.820 
guess that's the all of it and I don't
know<00:03:43.630> I'm<00:03:43.750> not<00:03:43.780> really<00:03:43.930> sure<00:03:44.140> what<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.590> think

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
know I'm not really sure what to think

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.630 
know I'm not really sure what to think
of<00:03:45.190> this<00:03:45.400> stuff<00:03:45.640> because<00:03:47.220> I'm<00:03:48.220> guessing<00:03:48.549> that

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
of this stuff because I'm guessing that

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.250 
of this stuff because I'm guessing that
so<00:03:48.940> they<00:03:49.180> just<00:03:49.390> made<00:03:49.600> it<00:03:49.720> when<00:03:49.840> they<00:03:49.959> found<00:03:50.170> out

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
so they just made it when they found out

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.259 
so they just made it when they found out
that<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.739> Pokemon<00:03:51.130> Ranger<00:03:51.340> movie<00:03:51.760> was<00:03:52.000> coming

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
that the Pokemon Ranger movie was coming

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.150

out and they just wanted to have

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.280 
out and they just wanted to have
something<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.640> sell<00:03:54.880> though<00:03:55.290> unsuspecting
