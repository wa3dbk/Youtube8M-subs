00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
first time I tried it now it's not a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.410 
first time I tried it now it's not a
popular<00:00:27.539> popular<00:00:27.779> thing<00:00:28.140> these<00:00:28.560> days<00:00:28.619> still

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
popular popular thing these days still

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.580 
popular popular thing these days still
especially<00:00:30.420> not<00:00:30.689> maybe<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.289> United

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
especially not maybe in the United

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.740 
especially not maybe in the United
States<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.070> reason<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.369> maybe<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.450> know

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
States and the reason that maybe I know

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.240 
States and the reason that maybe I know
a<00:00:33.870> little<00:00:33.960> bit<00:00:34.140> more<00:00:34.290> about<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.710> maybe<00:00:34.890> is

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
a little bit more about it maybe is

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.069 
a little bit more about it maybe is
because<00:00:35.670> I'm<00:00:36.090> from<00:00:36.239> Canada<00:00:36.420> originally<00:00:36.899> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
because I'm from Canada originally and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.200 
because I'm from Canada originally and
it's<00:00:37.620> quite<00:00:38.070> readily<00:00:38.309> avail<00:00:38.610> available<00:00:38.969> up

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
it's quite readily avail available up

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.660 
it's quite readily avail available up
there<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.950> actually<00:00:40.950> growing<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.370> lot<00:00:41.460> more

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
there and actually growing a lot more

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.630 
there and actually growing a lot more
than<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.210> united<00:00:42.989> states<00:00:43.340> now<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.370> did<00:00:44.520> some

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
than it is united states now I did some

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.580 
than it is united states now I did some
research<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.600> told<00:00:45.809> once<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.260> they

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
research on it I was told once that they

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.350 
research on it I was told once that they
didn't<00:00:46.800> allow<00:00:47.010> her<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.730> illegal<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.149> grow

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
didn't allow her it was illegal to grow

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.660 
didn't allow her it was illegal to grow
hemp<00:00:49.079> seeds<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.739> industrial<00:00:50.070> purposes<00:00:50.100> in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
hemp seeds for industrial purposes in

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.869 
hemp seeds for industrial purposes in
United<00:00:51.570> States<00:00:51.620> due<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> cotton<00:00:53.280> laws<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
United States due to the cotton laws and

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.760 
United States due to the cotton laws and
I<00:00:54.390> researched<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.199> bit<00:00:55.289> more<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.500> it's

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
I researched a little bit more and it's

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.319 
I researched a little bit more and it's
this<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.370> said<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.670> not<00:00:56.760> illegal<00:00:57.149> but

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
this they said it's not illegal but

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.090 
this they said it's not illegal but
itself<00:00:57.840> it's<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> lot<00:00:58.170> more<00:00:58.199> difficult<00:00:58.800> or<00:00:58.949> they

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
itself it's a lot more difficult or they

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
itself it's a lot more difficult or they
make<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> lot<00:00:59.520> more<00:00:59.640> difficult<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.180> farmers

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
make it a lot more difficult for farmers

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.720 
make it a lot more difficult for farmers
to<00:01:00.960> grow<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:02.039> United<00:01:02.280> States<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.579> that's

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
to grow the United States so that's

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.399 
to grow the United States so that's
probably<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.000> big<00:01:03.149> reason<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.600> did<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.049> import

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
probably a big reason but did you import

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.350 
probably a big reason but did you import
it<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.559> from<00:01:04.769> my<00:01:04.920> Canada<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.240> also

years some of the earliest research I
found<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> was<00:01:39.689> back<00:01:39.869> from<00:01:40.049> 1955<00:01:40.829> in

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670

found on it was back from 1955 in
Czechoslovakia<00:01:42.420> where<00:01:42.990> they<00:01:43.079> did<00:01:43.200> some<00:01:43.380> tests

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
Czechoslovakia where they did some tests

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.520 
Czechoslovakia where they did some tests
on<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.030> they<00:01:45.030> did<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.600> lot<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.930> different<00:01:46.020> tests

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
on it they did a lot of different tests

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.580 
on it they did a lot of different tests
and<00:01:47.240> they<00:01:48.240> found<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.810> treated<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.290> cured

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and they found that it treated and cured

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.319 
and they found that it treated and cured
or<00:01:49.890> was<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.369> was<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.700> cure<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.149> tuberculosis

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
or was it was a cure for tuberculosis

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.679 
or was it was a cure for tuberculosis
which<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.350> which<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.649> amazing<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.689> modern

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
which is which is amazing so modern

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
research has shown that it has all the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.550 
research has shown that it has all the

all the essential fatty acids that your

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.830 
all the essential fatty acids that your
body<00:02:03.390> needs<00:02:03.479> plus<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> very<00:02:04.619> rare<00:02:05.159> form<00:02:05.490> of

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
body needs plus a very rare form of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.530 
body needs plus a very rare form of
protein<00:02:06.840> which

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
protein which

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.950 
protein which
which<00:02:08.020> is<00:02:08.140> called<00:02:08.320> globule<00:02:09.149> yeah<00:02:10.149> what<00:02:10.840> was<00:02:10.930> it

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
which is called globule yeah what was it

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.170 
which is called globule yeah what was it
called<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.200> globular<00:02:11.650> destined<00:02:12.070> don't<00:02:13.060> quote

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
called a globular destined don't quote

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.430 
called a globular destined don't quote
me<00:02:13.330> on<00:02:13.360> exactly<00:02:13.720> i<00:02:13.810> can<00:02:13.960> say<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.260> word<00:02:14.410> but

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
me on exactly i can say that word but

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.470 
me on exactly i can say that word but
what<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.100> it's<00:02:15.310> very<00:02:15.940> similar<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
what it is is it's very similar to the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.530 
what it is is it's very similar to the
to<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.320> globulin<00:02:17.830> found<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.090> blood<00:02:19.210> and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
to the globulin found in the blood and

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.150 
to the globulin found in the blood and
blood<00:02:20.380> plasma<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.700> anyways<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:23.830> basically

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
blood plasma so anyways just basically

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.710 
blood plasma so anyways just basically
another<00:02:24.460> great<00:02:24.670> source<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:25.030> protein<00:02:25.240> enough

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
another great source of protein enough

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.420 
another great source of protein enough

right off of the label here what it does
a<00:02:31.630> five<00:02:32.020> tablespoons<00:02:32.680> serving<00:02:33.250> which<00:02:33.370> isn't

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
a five tablespoons serving which isn't

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.790 
a five tablespoons serving which isn't
very<00:02:33.640> much<00:02:33.940> because<00:02:34.230> if<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.260> can<00:02:35.350> really<00:02:35.560> see
