00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.290
 great effect 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.539
 here we are in the gray kitchen 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.960
 gray chef just me as ingredients 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:23.760
 simple big effect 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.390
 today pizza in the pan what a kilo is needed 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.690
 of white flour type 00 550 grams of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.710
 water 12 grams of yeast 25 grams of 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:37.909
 salt 30 grams of oil 250 grams of 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.339
 tomato puree and 250 g of mozzarella 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:43.620
 bay be all right 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.620
 Let's start with what we take first 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.460
 water and we divide it into two 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.089
 this is because it is on the side 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:02.069
 put the yeast and the other 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:03.690
 we put the salt insecure yes yes I would say 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:06.990
 that we are there before I love you by and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.790
 let's go straight to the amount of 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.160
 leaven from what we have stability 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.840
 depending on what the hours of 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.970
 leavening that we do August 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.120
 from our dough ok so it's one 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.220
 very simple inversely rule 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:28.590
 proportional to the leavening hours i 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:32.210
 grams of yeast write at 9 o'clock 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.210
 so we have already written 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.940
 g of yeast now limiting then 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.330
 three grams of yeast for 24 hours of 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.920
 leavening then 24 grams of yeast 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:52.670
 this is us for three hours of leavening 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.410
 we let it rise no I wanted to be 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.620
 careful but it was this time around 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:04.100
 then the line la told me 12 grams 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:06.410
 straight face 15 hours 12 15 anyway 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.200
 we immediately begin to knead the pizza is 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.170
 so let's say in the meantime that I put the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.860
 I invite you to volunteer to dissolve 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.540
 this is then we insert the with the 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.209
 yeast 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.590
 let 's start the cast alec said loose not 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.770
 I call it clearly 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.220
 first yeast so the gluten from flour 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.120
 pro 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.600
 it does protect you from moving ahead e 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.150
 let's keep this point 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.150
 we believe the mixture on history 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.769
 we continue less 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.360
 you know about ten minutes of kneading 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.340
 when to tear the dough to make it 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.340
 take more oxygen but so 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.790
 here I would say that we are in the world 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.159
 this is stuff 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.040
 the ball what we do with this is 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.819
 a little bit of flour so I listen to it 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.170
 let it rest and cover the search 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:14.220
 in about twenty minutes very well e 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.290
 let's see what happened in 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.879
 remembered to be a bit like that 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.290
 we share half have done the 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.409
 quantity for at least two of the eight 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:41.319
 people so I would say that 's enough 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:44.590
 for our daughter that of health it 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:49.260
 show if rectangular as I do a 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.260
 make it turn to penetrate in the oil 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.220
 well I would say that at this point 15 hours of 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.139
 leavening does not fall back on already 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.269
 prepared and she brings this door 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:07.930
 the ready one is good and while it is 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.970
 coming 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.660
 I want to remember two important things 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.329
 note of avoided we put it in the oven at 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.160
 maximum temperature 250 there for 4 minutes 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.130
 before starting then put tomato 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.810
 ingredients ok and before you do it 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.699
 I may have forgotten to rise 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.460
 they show up poked by with one 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.949
 very important fork here 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.550
 this is already a 4 already cooked one 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.470
 minutes 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:38.460
 let's start immediately while the tomato 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.460
 she makes her pizza now 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:50.580
 I'd say we make classic pizza 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.580
 Neapolitan and that for margherita 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.900
 gila naples flag naples thousand colors 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.900
 well 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:09.310
 twenty minutes 250 degrees is perfect 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.040
 clearly we didn't do it then 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.840
 an area of ham or tobacco 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.850
 artichoke a bit here then flash 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:26.090
 anchovies then she like an eat is okay 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:28.820
 so perfect we are all ready 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.580
 backside ready to who we are at this 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.580
 point 8 hopefully
