in there and push down here we don't
care<00:01:05.519> we'll<00:01:05.729> separate<00:01:06.060> all<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.540> with

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
care we'll separate all of this with

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.650 
care we'll separate all of this with
highlights<00:01:07.790> you<00:01:08.790> could<00:01:08.940> put<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.210> part<00:01:09.509> on

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
highlights you could put this part on

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
with a with a paint roller another tree

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.840 
with a with a paint roller another tree
maybe<00:01:13.650> he<00:01:14.250> lives<00:01:14.520> right<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.640> same

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
maybe he lives right there and the same

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.649 
maybe he lives right there and the same
thing<00:01:18.150> give<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> little<00:01:18.900> upward<00:01:19.350> push

thing give it a little upward push
upward<00:01:21.659> push<00:01:21.900> big<00:01:22.890> strong<00:01:23.340> tree<00:01:23.550> it<00:01:23.670> goes

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
upward push big strong tree it goes

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.080 
upward push big strong tree it goes
right<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.119> off<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.270> canvas<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:26.090> sometimes

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
right on off the canvas and sometimes

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.430 
right on off the canvas and sometimes
it's<00:01:27.300> neat<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.600> leave<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> little<00:01:28.020> bit<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.350> the

it's neat to leave a little bit of the

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.370 
it's neat to leave a little bit of the
little<00:01:29.039> piece<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.460> trunk<00:01:29.789> showing<00:01:30.380> we'll

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
little piece of the trunk showing we'll

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.940 
little piece of the trunk showing we'll
do<00:01:31.560> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
do that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:40.570

how's<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.940> little<00:01:33.720> naked<00:01:33.899> spot<00:01:36.440> there

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.740 

sometimes<00:01:41.580> in<00:01:41.759> some<00:01:41.940> parts<00:01:42.179> of<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.300> country

sometimes in some parts of the country
the<00:01:43.619> limbs<00:01:43.860> hanging<00:01:44.399> down<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.759> evergreens<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the limbs hanging down on evergreens and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.800 
the limbs hanging down on evergreens and
other<00:01:45.869> parts<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> country<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.220> up

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
other parts of the country they go up

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.630 
other parts of the country they go up
forth<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:49.560> when<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.770> lived<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.039> Alaska<00:01:50.160> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
forth like when I lived in Alaska you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.340 
forth like when I lived in Alaska you
can<00:01:50.759> go<00:01:50.850> some<00:01:51.060> places<00:01:51.300> they<00:01:51.600> hang<00:01:51.810> down<00:01:52.050> some

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
can go some places they hang down some

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.279 
can go some places they hang down some
places<00:01:52.560> they<00:01:52.830> go<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.600> maybe<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:54.810> depends

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
places they go up maybe it just depends

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.550 
places they go up maybe it just depends
on<00:01:55.380> how<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.619> felt<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.039> day<00:01:57.500> actually<00:01:58.500> I

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
on how they felt that day actually I

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.780 
on how they felt that day actually I
think<00:01:58.650> it<00:01:58.860> has<00:01:59.009> something<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.430> do<00:01:59.579> with<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
think it has something to do with the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.440 
think it has something to do with the
amount<00:01:59.970> of<00:02:00.090> water<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.630> cold<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.140> everything

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
amount of water and cold and everything

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.620 
amount of water and cold and everything
but<00:02:03.450> who<00:02:04.259> knows<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.970> don't<00:02:06.390> try<00:02:06.570> to
