00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
what up guys the Green Man War 106 it's

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.900 
what up guys the Green Man War 106 it's
a<00:00:06.060> strange<00:00:06.359> one<00:00:06.649> so<00:00:07.649> some<00:00:08.519> people<00:00:08.790> might

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
a strange one so some people might

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.430 
a strange one so some people might
recognize<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.510> this<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.960> called<00:00:10.320> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
recognize this this is called the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.190 
recognize this this is called the
general<00:00:10.830> it's<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.700> it's<00:00:12.509> not<00:00:12.660> bad<00:00:12.929> base

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
general it's a it's not bad base

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.230 
general it's a it's not bad base
actually<00:00:14.960> the<00:00:16.279> different<00:00:17.279> variations<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.060> it

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
actually the different variations of it

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.920 
actually the different variations of it
is<00:00:18.660> kind<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.560> total<00:00:20.090> and<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.689> can

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
is kind of like the total and it can

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.890 
is kind of like the total and it can
kind<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.410> spray<00:00:22.619> off<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> little<00:00:23.160> bit<00:00:23.689> but<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
kind of spray off a little bit but the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.839 
kind of spray off a little bit but the
way<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.230> double<00:00:25.500> giant<00:00:25.680> bombs<00:00:25.800> are<00:00:26.189> placed<00:00:26.430> if

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
way the double giant bombs are placed if

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.240 
way the double giant bombs are placed if
you<00:00:27.660> understand<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> passing<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.039> base

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
you understand the passing of this base

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.490 
you understand the passing of this base
properly<00:00:29.730> then<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.750> can<00:00:30.900> get<00:00:31.080> around<00:00:31.320> those

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
properly then you can get around those

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.229 
properly then you can get around those
double<00:00:31.859> giant<00:00:32.099> bombs<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.940> kind<00:00:33.210> of

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
double giant bombs and it kind of

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.310 
double giant bombs and it kind of
becomes<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.660> bit<00:00:33.870> easier<00:00:34.399> I<00:00:35.989> was<00:00:36.989> looking<00:00:37.260> at

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
becomes a bit easier I was looking at

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.170 
becomes a bit easier I was looking at
this<00:00:37.500> base<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.129> what<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.550> was<00:00:38.670> going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.149> was

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
this base and what I was going to do was

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.119 
this base and what I was going to do was
I<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> take<00:00:40.410> out<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.680> cannon<00:00:41.010> with

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
I was going to take out this cannon with

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.150 
I was going to take out this cannon with
three<00:00:41.790> balloons<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.710> was<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.070> all

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
three balloons and I was going to do all

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.819 
three balloons and I was going to do all
the<00:00:44.309> killing<00:00:44.610> out<00:00:44.789> here<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.590> funnel<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.680> into

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the killing out here and funnel it into

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.619 
the killing out here and funnel it into
the<00:00:47.129> Queen<00:00:47.399> over<00:00:47.700> there<00:00:48.710> but<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.010> kind<00:00:50.399> of

kill squad for the clan castle and that
was<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.150> hindsight<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:25.130> could<00:01:26.130> have

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
was it in hindsight I could have

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.310 
was it in hindsight I could have
actually<00:01:26.369> reversed<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.330> funneled<00:01:28.200> them

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
actually reversed it and funneled them

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.999 
actually reversed it and funneled them
into<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> king<00:01:29.990> but<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.259> still<00:01:31.590> worked<00:01:31.770> out<00:01:31.890> in

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
into the king but it still worked out in

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.100 
into the king but it still worked out in
the<00:01:32.100> end<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.909> Kings<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.659> big<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the end the Kings not that big of a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.530 
the end the Kings not that big of a
threat<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.770> um<00:01:34.979> yeah<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.259> um

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
threat but um yeah so with this is um

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.280 
threat but um yeah so with this is um
Tesla<00:01:40.189> Tesla<00:01:41.720> like<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.670> he's<00:01:45.270> got<00:01:45.479> Tesla

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
Tesla Tesla like that and he's got Tesla

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.389 
Tesla Tesla like that and he's got Tesla
up<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.240> tests<00:01:48.240> are<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:49.399> with

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
up here and tests are up here with

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.139 
up here and tests are up here with
double<00:01:51.360> giant<00:01:51.600> bomb<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.670> double<00:01:53.670> joint<00:01:53.909> bomb

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
double giant bomb and double joint bomb

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.969 
double giant bomb and double joint bomb
there<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.439> I'll<00:01:55.710> link<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.340> description

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
there so I'll link it in the description

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.620 
there so I'll link it in the description
but<00:01:58.979> we've<00:01:59.130> hit<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.460> base<00:01:59.700> over<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.390> past

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
but we've hit this base over the past

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.679 
but we've hit this base over the past
three<00:02:00.899> wars<00:02:01.140> um<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.640> we're<00:02:03.270> getting<00:02:03.479> pretty

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
three wars um so we're getting pretty

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.920 
three wars um so we're getting pretty
good<00:02:03.750> at<00:02:03.869> hitting<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.439> space<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.750> way<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
good at hitting the space so the way to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.139 
good at hitting the space so the way to
avoid<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.590> double<00:02:07.740> giant<00:02:08.069> bombs<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.849> actually

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
avoid the double giant bombs is actually

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.390 
avoid the double giant bombs is actually
to<00:02:09.300> attack<00:02:09.629> from<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.869> cell

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
to attack from the cell

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.240 
to attack from the cell
and<00:02:11.400> what<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:11.850> is<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.300> release<00:02:12.600> two

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
and what you do is you release two

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.430 
and what you do is you release two
identical<00:02:14.250> lines<00:02:14.490> these<00:02:15.270> two<00:02:15.540> Koch<00:02:16.110> tails

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
identical lines these two Koch tails

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.060 
identical lines these two Koch tails
then<00:02:17.310> they<00:02:17.490> go<00:02:17.640> into<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.000> wizard<00:02:18.300> towers<00:02:18.660> and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
then they go into the wizard towers and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.250 
then they go into the wizard towers and
then<00:02:20.070> they<00:02:20.610> come<00:02:20.850> down<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.690> archer<00:02:21.990> tower

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
then they come down to the archer tower

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.570 
then they come down to the archer tower
and<00:02:22.790> also<00:02:23.790> go<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.090> mortar<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.630> well<00:02:25.580> some

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
and also go to the mortar as well some

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.880 
and also go to the mortar as well some
will<00:02:26.820> break<00:02:27.120> off<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:28.110> air<00:02:28.230> defense<00:02:28.560> but<00:02:28.770> it

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
will break off to the air defense but it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.640 
will break off to the air defense but it
shouldn't<00:02:29.100> be<00:02:29.160> too<00:02:29.310> many<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.660> then<00:02:31.020> after

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
shouldn't be too many and then after

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.430 
shouldn't be too many and then after
that<00:02:31.830> done<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.280> what<00:02:33.030> happens<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.750> they<00:02:34.170> jump

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
that done that what happens is they jump

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.480 
that done that what happens is they jump
into<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:35.250> Tesla's<00:02:36.710> from<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.830> mortar<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.310> that

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
into the Tesla's from the mortar in that

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.580 
into the Tesla's from the mortar in that
and<00:02:38.700> they<00:02:39.240> set<00:02:39.510> off<00:02:39.540> one<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.080> giant<00:02:40.380> bombs

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
and they set off one of the giant bombs

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.630 
and they set off one of the giant bombs
on<00:02:41.250> either<00:02:41.550> side<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:43.260> all<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.280> till

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
on either side so all you have till

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.620 
on either side so all you have till
we've<00:02:44.760> done<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.360> drop<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.960> heal<00:02:46.320> spell<00:02:46.650> here<00:02:47.010> and

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
we've done is drop a heal spell here and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.330 
we've done is drop a heal spell here and
drop<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.750> heel<00:02:48.930> spell<00:02:49.170> here<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.620> covered

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
drop the heel spell here and covered

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.120 
drop the heel spell here and covered
those<00:02:50.490> areas<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:52.020> those<00:02:52.200> first<00:02:52.590> giant<00:02:52.950> bombs

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
those areas and those first giant bombs

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.070 
those areas and those first giant bombs
don't<00:02:53.430> affect<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.390> then<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.810> drop<00:02:55.050> a

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
don't affect you and then you drop a

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.010 
don't affect you and then you drop a
third<00:02:55.650> he'll<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.430> core<00:02:56.820> so<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.480> covered

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
third he'll in the core so you covered

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.440 
third he'll in the core so you covered
when<00:02:58.380> barbarian<00:02:59.340> king<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.940> Expos<00:03:00.270> is

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
when barbarian king and the Expos is

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.110 
when barbarian king and the Expos is
hitting<00:03:00.720> on<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.960> and<00:03:01.610> generally<00:03:02.610> speaking

there<00:03:03.420> may<00:03:03.750> be<00:03:04.220> one<00:03:05.220> hog<00:03:05.550> down<00:03:05.970> here<00:03:06.330> that's

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
there may be one hog down here that's

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.820 
there may be one hog down here that's
going<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.780> come<00:03:06.960> up<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.320> trip<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.680> other

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
going to come up and trip that other

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.720 
going to come up and trip that other
giant<00:03:08.190> bomb<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.610> one<00:03:08.760> over<00:03:09.000> here<00:03:09.300> or<00:03:10.580> ones<00:03:11.580> on

giant bomb and one over here or ones on
the<00:03:11.820> Tesla's<00:03:12.210> are<00:03:12.330> going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.510> run<00:03:12.690> out<00:03:12.720> on<00:03:13.050> the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
the Tesla's are going to run out on the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.110 
the Tesla's are going to run out on the
sides<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.830> trip<00:03:14.070> them<00:03:14.220> over<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:14.790> know<00:03:14.820> so

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
sides and trip them over you know so

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.450 
sides and trip them over you know so
generally<00:03:15.990> speaking<00:03:16.260> these<00:03:16.770> two<00:03:17.040> bombs<00:03:17.280> are

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
generally speaking these two bombs are

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.150 
generally speaking these two bombs are
going<00:03:17.490> to<00:03:17.640> get<00:03:17.730> tripped<00:03:18.060> as<00:03:18.210> well<00:03:18.390> so<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.890> want

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
going to get tripped as well so you want

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.090 
going to get tripped as well so you want
that<00:03:20.220> third<00:03:20.880> he'll<00:03:21.270> there<00:03:21.510> early<00:03:21.990> so<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.860> Hogs

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
that third he'll there early so the Hogs

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.400 
that third he'll there early so the Hogs
that<00:03:23.340> are<00:03:23.430> sitting<00:03:23.610> here<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.180> here<00:03:24.570> don't<00:03:25.260> get

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
that are sitting here and here don't get

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.520 
that are sitting here and here don't get
fried<00:03:25.970> if<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.300> go<00:03:27.840> too<00:03:27.900> slow<00:03:28.050> on<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.500> hills

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
fried if you go too slow on the hills

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.910 
fried if you go too slow on the hills
for<00:03:29.010> this<00:03:29.190> part<00:03:30.110> then<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.260> could<00:03:31.470> end<00:03:31.770> the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
for this part then you could end the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.260 
for this part then you could end the
raid<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:33.150> then<00:03:34.640> once<00:03:35.640> they<00:03:35.820> get<00:03:35.940> into<00:03:36.090> the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
raid and then once they get into the

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.680 
raid and then once they get into the
middle<00:03:36.450> that's<00:03:36.950> it's<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.070> bit<00:03:38.220> iffy<00:03:38.580> like<00:03:39.390> this

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
middle that's it's a bit iffy like this

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.970 
middle that's it's a bit iffy like this
is<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.920> lower<00:03:41.340> level<00:03:41.640> expo<00:03:42.570> but<00:03:42.960> how<00:03:43.530> many<00:03:43.590> hogs

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
is a lower level expo but how many hogs

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.680 
is a lower level expo but how many hogs
have<00:03:44.190> died<00:03:44.400> going<00:03:44.760> this<00:03:45.030> side<00:03:45.270> because

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
have died going this side because

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.590 
have died going this side because
there's<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.930> level<00:03:46.110> seven<00:03:46.470> Tesla<00:03:47.360> how<00:03:48.360> many

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
there's a level seven Tesla how many

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.880 
there's a level seven Tesla how many
have<00:03:48.660> jumped<00:03:49.080> through<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.380> spring<00:03:49.620> traps

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
have jumped through the spring traps

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.620 
have jumped through the spring traps
help<00:03:50.130> me<00:03:50.220> jumped<00:03:50.550> on<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.670> spring<00:03:51.090> trap<00:03:51.420> you

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
help me jumped on that spring trap you

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.560 
help me jumped on that spring trap you
know<00:03:51.750> there's<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.200> lot<00:03:52.380> of<00:03:52.410> um<00:03:53.570> different

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
know there's a lot of um different

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.910 
know there's a lot of um different
things<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.930> could<00:03:55.050> happen<00:03:55.200> on<00:03:55.440> either<00:03:55.560> side

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
things that could happen on either side

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.250 
things that could happen on either side
because<00:03:56.490> this<00:03:57.300> side<00:03:57.540> is<00:03:57.720> generally<00:03:58.050> going<00:03:58.140> to

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
because this side is generally going to

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.380 
because this side is generally going to
go<00:03:58.350> faster<00:03:58.830> than<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.130> side<00:03:59.340> until<00:03:59.730> it<00:04:00.180> hits

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
go faster than this side until it hits

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.690 
go faster than this side until it hits
the<00:04:00.540> call<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:00.990> then<00:04:01.290> it's<00:04:01.740> this<00:04:02.310> side<00:04:02.520> that's

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
the call and then it's this side that's

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.760 
the call and then it's this side that's
going<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.880> go<00:04:03.000> faster<00:04:03.480> because<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.590> lower

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
going to go faster because of the lower

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.990 
going to go faster because of the lower
HP<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.550> defense<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.950> for<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.730> fourth

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
HP of the defense so it for the fourth

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.760 
HP of the defense so it for the fourth
heal<00:04:09.300> that's<00:04:09.510> really<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.870> guessing<00:04:10.200> game<00:04:10.350> of

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
heal that's really a guessing game of

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.910 
heal that's really a guessing game of
which<00:04:11.220> side<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.580> going<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.760> be<00:04:11.820> bigger<00:04:12.920> ended

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
which side is going to be bigger ended

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.560 
which side is going to be bigger ended
up<00:04:14.040> being<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.490> this<00:04:14.700> side<00:04:14.940> was<00:04:15.210> the<00:04:15.390> biggest

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
up being that this side was the biggest

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.410 
up being that this side was the biggest
side<00:04:15.840> for<00:04:16.080> me<00:04:16.200> and

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
side for me and

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.020

I<00:06:33.740> dropped<00:06:34.070> or<00:06:34.220> wizard<00:06:34.550> on<00:06:34.670> each<00:06:34.820> one<00:06:35.000> of<00:06:35.060> those

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
I dropped or wizard on each one of those

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.390 
I dropped or wizard on each one of those
they<00:06:36.140> probably<00:06:36.380> missed<00:06:36.650> it<00:06:36.770> cuz<00:06:36.860> i<00:06:36.950> zoomed<00:06:37.220> in

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
they probably missed it cuz i zoomed in

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.890 
they probably missed it cuz i zoomed in
a<00:06:37.430> little<00:06:37.490> bit<00:06:39.490> but<00:06:40.490> yeah<00:06:40.670> this<00:06:41.600> is<00:06:41.720> how<00:06:41.840> you

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
a little bit but yeah this is how you

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.590 
a little bit but yeah this is how you
hog<00:06:42.320> a<00:06:42.710> base<00:06:43.400> that<00:06:43.430> people<00:06:44.300> would<00:06:44.450> probably

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
hog a base that people would probably

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.360 
hog a base that people would probably
think<00:06:44.900> it's<00:06:45.170> on<00:06:45.290> huggable<00:06:45.680> because<00:06:46.100> it's<00:06:46.250> got

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
think it's on huggable because it's got

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.090 
think it's on huggable because it's got
two<00:06:46.580> double<00:06:46.910> giant<00:06:47.090> bombs<00:06:47.180> locations<00:06:48.100> you

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
two double giant bombs locations you

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.430 
two double giant bombs locations you
just<00:06:49.340> have<00:06:49.490> to<00:06:49.630> the<00:06:50.630> way<00:06:50.750> they're<00:06:51.050> set<00:06:51.230> out

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
just have to the way they're set out

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.650 
just have to the way they're set out
like<00:06:51.740> that<00:06:51.890> beside<00:06:52.280> each<00:06:52.310> other<00:06:52.550> they<00:06:53.180> are

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
like that beside each other they are

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.060 
like that beside each other they are
back<00:06:54.080> to<00:06:54.200> front<00:06:55.570> because<00:06:56.620> when<00:06:57.620> giant<00:06:57.920> bombs

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
back to front because when giant bombs

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.620 
back to front because when giant bombs
are<00:06:58.250> beside<00:06:58.520> each<00:06:58.550> other<00:06:58.760> they're<00:06:59.120> so<00:06:59.270> easy<00:06:59.480> to

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630 
are beside each other they're so easy to

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.620 
are beside each other they're so easy to
set<00:06:59.900> off<00:06:59.930> single<00:07:00.410> and<00:07:01.120> you<00:07:02.120> just<00:07:02.270> attack<00:07:02.600> the

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
set off single and you just attack the

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.300 
set off single and you just attack the
space<00:07:02.960> from<00:07:03.200> the<00:07:03.290> south<00:07:03.500> and<00:07:03.830> it's<00:07:04.190> pretty

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
space from the south and it's pretty

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.620 
space from the south and it's pretty
much<00:07:04.490> game<00:07:04.700> over<00:07:04.850> for<00:07:05.030> those<00:07:05.180> giant<00:07:05.450> bombs

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630 
much game over for those giant bombs

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.500 
much game over for those giant bombs
different<00:07:06.470> variations<00:07:07.210> different<00:07:08.210> effects

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 
different variations different effects

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.510 
different variations different effects
on<00:07:08.690> the<00:07:08.750> past<00:07:09.050> and<00:07:09.350> stuff<00:07:09.470> like<00:07:09.620> that<00:07:09.680> but<00:07:09.830> if

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
on the past and stuff like that but if

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.980 
on the past and stuff like that but if
you<00:07:10.730> can<00:07:10.910> get<00:07:11.090> the<00:07:11.210> passing<00:07:11.630> where<00:07:11.750> it<00:07:11.810> sets

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
you can get the passing where it sets

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.900 
you can get the passing where it sets
with<00:07:12.140> one<00:07:12.320> giant<00:07:12.680> bomb<00:07:12.830> and<00:07:13.100> then<00:07:13.550> sets<00:07:13.790> off

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910 
with one giant bomb and then sets off

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.520 
with one giant bomb and then sets off
the<00:07:13.940> next<00:07:14.240> giant<00:07:14.390> bomb<00:07:14.690> in<00:07:14.870> about<00:07:15.110> two<00:07:15.440> or

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.530 
the next giant bomb in about two or

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.770 
the next giant bomb in about two or
three<00:07:15.710> seconds<00:07:16.010> later<00:07:16.250> then<00:07:16.850> you<00:07:17.270> can<00:07:17.420> hog<00:07:17.600> any

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.780 
three seconds later then you can hog any

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.360 
three seconds later then you can hog any
base<00:07:18.020> like<00:07:18.260> them<00:07:18.470> anyway<00:07:19.340> guys<00:07:19.520> peace
