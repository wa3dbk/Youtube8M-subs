00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.310

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.880
 in this race so I would not have to 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.770
 participated in participated in a real 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.900
 food the other day in Valladolid and this 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.070
 is the second team ducati cross 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.050
 to highlight the truth the war is 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.160
 very well very well organized perfect has 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.500
 there were many everywhere the 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.830
 realization of good you just have to 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.660
 the part of the pine forest or the part that mass 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.100
 wooded was a little confused but 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.960
 good otherwise very good very good 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.790
 environment and tower is super work that 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.920
 pulls very well and you know that this kind of 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.750
 racing the dog is half a career but 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.970
 then that if the dog has only 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.040
 I have run the coast quite a bit for 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.810
 the heat that did and has suffered a 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.800
 little that I like that has not been for him and 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.800
 it ended surely 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.580
 Well, the exit was what I had 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.780
 a little bit because the whole strip pulls 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.270
 we have quite come out at a rhythm 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.700
 too fast and good the ground the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.410
 first part there were many stones and 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.970
 good to enter the field and we will 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.770
 start enjoying yes it's true that 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.470
 there are times that go wrong because there are 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.480
 some very steep descents and good 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.030
 you have to be quite careful the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.640
 phenomenal circuit there has been a 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.830
 little problem of marking 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.060
 some people who have been wrong 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.880
 but we have still had it 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.030
 very much hot we have spent 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.240
 and well delighted with him has been hard 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.340
 very hard we come to enjoy the podium 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.620
 it's in the background because I'm good 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.560
 I dedicate myself to athletics and it's a 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.850
 way to enjoy and make a good 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.610
 training with almost rhythms 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.510
 really quick what it allows me 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.510
 run with the dog
