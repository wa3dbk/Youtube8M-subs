go<00:00:31.890> there's<00:00:32.610> second<00:00:34.579> and<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.940> cut<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> little

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
go there's second and just cut a little

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.139 
go there's second and just cut a little
faster<00:00:37.340> you're<00:00:38.340> going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:39.059> third

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
faster you're going to get your third

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.119 
faster you're going to get your third
there<00:00:42.149> third<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.960> tell<00:00:43.200> by<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.500> dogs

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
inside the internal hub kind of clicky

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.900 
inside the internal hub kind of clicky
so<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.870> always<00:00:49.200> know<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.649> got<00:00:49.920> third<00:00:50.520> year

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
so you always know you got third year

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.500 
so you always know you got third year
and<00:00:52.190> you<00:00:53.190> come<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> stop<00:00:53.670> I'll<00:00:54.120> come<00:00:54.329> right

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and you come to a stop I'll come right

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.299

in<00:00:58.879> this<00:00:59.879> thing<00:01:00.149> down<00:01:00.600> shifts<00:01:01.079> good<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:02.190> up

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
in this thing down shifts good going up

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.100 
in this thing down shifts good going up
a<00:01:02.430> hill<00:01:02.640> you're<00:01:03.059> not<00:01:03.210> stuck<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.780> gear

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
a hill you're not stuck in a gear

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.990 
a hill you're not stuck in a gear
waiting<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.860> its<00:01:04.979> downshift<00:01:07.760> also<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.820> takes

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
waiting for its downshift also it takes

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.899 
waiting for its downshift also it takes
very<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:09.510> load<00:01:10.280> very<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.670> friction

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
very little load very little friction

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.109 
very little load very little friction
driving<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:16.220> much<00:01:17.220> less<00:01:17.490> than<00:01:17.670> any<00:01:17.880> kind

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
driving this so much less than any kind

let<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.259> thing<00:01:22.320> post<00:01:22.740> down<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.400> give<00:01:23.549> you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
let this thing post down just give you

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
let this thing post down just give you
an<00:01:23.700> idea<00:01:23.790> how<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.689> friction<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.290> using

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
an idea how little friction it's using

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.649 
an idea how little friction it's using

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
to run this mechanism in the back

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.760 
to run this mechanism in the back
probably<00:01:30.659> less<00:01:31.049> than<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:32.720> computer-assisted

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
probably less than the computer-assisted

probably less than the computer-assisted
