00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
the switch for that is is right here

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:07.590 
the switch for that is is right here
push<00:03:59.560> in<00:03:59.800> let<00:04:00.430> me<00:04:00.489> go<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:00.670> do<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:00.880> now

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:20.460 

so<00:04:08.320> that<00:04:08.710> bedroom<00:04:10.050> comes<00:04:11.050> in<00:04:11.230> first

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.870 

and<00:04:21.470> then<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.680> living-room<00:04:22.040> area<00:04:22.280> starts<00:04:22.790> to

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
and then the living-room area starts to

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:54.350 
and then the living-room area starts to
come<00:04:23.060> in<00:04:23.210> as<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:23.780> can<00:04:23.960> see<00:04:24.170> over<00:04:24.710> here

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.330 

and<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.110> battery<00:04:55.439> is<00:04:56.330> really<00:04:57.330> weak<00:04:57.479> right<00:04:57.509> now

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
and the battery is really weak right now

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:06.960 
and the battery is really weak right now
so<00:05:01.550> there<00:05:02.550> we<00:05:02.699> go

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:39.430 

now<00:05:07.570> this<00:05:07.750> unit<00:05:07.930> is<00:05:08.080> moving<00:05:08.470> in<00:05:08.590> also

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.040 

so<00:05:40.440> there<00:05:40.590> you<00:05:40.680> go<00:05:41.450> it's<00:05:42.450> as<00:05:42.540> simple<00:05:42.720> as<00:05:43.020> that

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
so there you go it's as simple as that

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.790 
so there you go it's as simple as that
they<00:05:43.590> get<00:05:43.770> packed<00:05:44.070> up<00:05:44.220> and<00:05:44.370> ready<00:05:44.430> to<00:05:44.610> go
