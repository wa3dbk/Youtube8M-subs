00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.799
 hello, I'll explain to you how it works 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:12.360
 connect the micro usb adapter to the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:15.540
 to watch with function is better remembering 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.039
 that are not all the devices that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.560
 has this function 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.990
 yesterday that with it have to see it in 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.820
 manual search do a search on 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.590
 internet to see if your device is 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.310
 has this function 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.059
 in my case mine is a galaxy s2 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.530
 it has this function as cat c3 and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.600
 others 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.260
 Some states also have 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 are not all the galaxy tab that owns 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.600
 I know the two galaxy tab have the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.980
 function 19 I'm not sure 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.020
 So I'll explain to you how it is that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.910
 makes this connection is very simple no 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.410
 need no software just connect 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.280
 cables properly 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.899
 first only get one with adapter will 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.650
 connect to the cable is to watch and this 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.549
 making sure that it will be connected to the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.200
 device designed to TV what you 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:17.939
 to be used also means that the cable 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.119
 power is also connected to the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.540
 it's probably going to be your cable 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.720
 The dodo charger will call you at 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.720
 power plug 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:38.710
 and now just put the TV or 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:44.740
 monitor neh nah correct drive and 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:47.250
 connect the micro USB cable to the device 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:59.100
 I'm a little difficult because I'm 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:59.100
 recording and making the adaptation connected 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.220
 will already appear on your monitor 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:24.160
 everything that disappears in one in your 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.160
 smartphone or tablet will also appear 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:35.660
 on your device 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:38.620
 ok it 's very easy 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.739
 remembering you do not need any software 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.230
 no application but have to certify 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.920
 that your device has the function 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.920
