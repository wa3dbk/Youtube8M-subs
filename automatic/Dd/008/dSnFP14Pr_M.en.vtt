00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.030
 and 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.080
 I 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.330
 hello to all of you 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.590
 listen today it will not be a 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.960
 detection output as you can the 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.700
 see it will be a little review 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.010
 so what do I call a review 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.170
 it's a video presentation on 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.330
 equipment or accessories affecting the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.450
 leisure detection for the first seven 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:48.620
 episodes we'll talk about the breaststroke 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.300
 xp us wsk tu watches so who 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.090
 rather concerns the owners of the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.920
 light version of us so with just 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.659
 with the headphones or so for those who 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.400
 vote to lighten up for the summer or for 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.900
 small outputs detecting everything 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.769
 simply 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.650
 so in fact it's a wristwatch 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.560
 you'll be able clip it's your 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.840
 other detection headset that has that has 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.340
 removed his from his bow comes with 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.170
 this bracelet shows you have a small 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.950
 adapter to add to it actually makes a 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.619
 audio headphone jack just so 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.100
 once you have removed remove two 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.930
 blocks of the rollbar position 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.259
 excuse me position the little 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.689
 insert in the grooves up 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.119
 to eclipse so here you have two 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.579
 pans of the helmet is directly here me 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.490
 so we will integrate it into the bracelet 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.490
 shows quite easily that's all 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.270
 simple it is in position you have to the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.649
 exit 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.719
 the headphone jack that's right on the 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.850
 side we could watch a little bit of 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.119
 move his grave not that it is rather not 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.140
 wrong 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.099
 it would have been a pity China have so 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.869
 why this bracelet world will listen 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:56.030
 already to quickly access the level 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.700
 settings so you're on a 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.990
 mineralized zone pollute so to have 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.049
 settings pretty quickly at the level 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.789
 wrist and especially for artists from 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.979
 conductivity that will display on the 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.599
 small screen that was rather practical 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.009
 to have on the wrist because when you 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.870
 have it on the ears by a clue 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.290
 you would not necessarily have what 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.780
 here is the practical side of the bracelet so bah 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.920
 listen we'll go directly tests 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.359
 in the field we will see what that 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.329
 give and then we find ourselves all 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:25.250
 afterwards go straight 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:28.639
 so that's it I'm equipped like you 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.700
 see I settled the watch 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:33.980
 wsk so it's pretty good 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.299
 I took a runaway helmet that is not 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.220
 terrible because I had that his 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.780
 disposition 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.230
 so here we are going to try this and then I will 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.030
 would give more ideas would give to the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.269
 what we think of going to support it has 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.269
 right now 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.170
 so that's after several holes all to 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.459
 length have actually needed 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.260
 get used because the helmet at the level 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.359
 meaning is not the same as the headphones 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.750
 original with the wired there is another 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.700
 its good after that you get used to 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.160
 but in any case light touches well and 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.019
 what did I do nice a big 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.989
 washer on 500 but a medal 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.230
 thibaut rottiers case it's a shame 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.230
 big medals 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.430
 with still other little things 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.900
 on it here bomb in any case with the 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.090
 helmet system it's not bad at all 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.150
 it's nice, I'm going, I'll continue 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:37.870
 will do the assessment after that time and that 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:40.200
 hollow drÃ´me to listen to it goes well 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.430
 with a rather pretty happy enough 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.130
 so that's fine when you 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.500
 have the simple version wsk of the us 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.920
 so with the headphones and then since the 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:55.209
 can and the detection head so here is 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:59.650
 we listened to a beautiful find 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.780
 capsules to identify here look 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.730
 in the shit bag or is there it's 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.380
 then gone back from a path 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.160
 of extinction that went pretty well 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.840
 as you could see 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.250
 good I will not show you everything 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.670
 with a lot of currencies 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.320
 like highly fluff so listen on 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.700
 will talk a little bit about the bracelet 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.130
 show worried that's pretty good 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.770
 who is nice to wear plastic 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.419
 and flexible is rather nice and so to 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.280
 wander in the back to avoid 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.919
 sensations and sweating Colmant 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.840
 of the watch so that's not so 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.130
 badly but it works well good his list a 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.630
 little bit when we sweat a lot at 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.410
 level of the forearm but hey okay 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.260
 cgra so actually like you could 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.050
 see the tab is rather enough so 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.150
 to fit both positions on the 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.150
 arm at the wrist and level 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.590
 from the forearm the wire helmet we 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.700
 not bother at all since it goes to 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.380
 level of the sleeve that stands out at 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.450
 collar level so there is no 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.340
 problem 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.229
 what could I say he can 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.030
 be adapted our for right-handed or 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.070
 for left-handed people the only thing is 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.450
 when you detect when you pass 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.870
 a clump of land with the target of 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.330
 dance or discs avoid using the 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.830
 hand which has which bracelet world otherwise 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.120
 it's going to ring what makes sense so a 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.820
 little bit same principle as rings 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.150
 or the signet rings or something else or the 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.560
 watches so what it can be not bad 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.169
 so now it's having 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.910
 the helmet at the wrist is that 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.400
 you leave the ears free it's 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.950
 Thursday that why especially winter what 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.630
 was pretty annoying nighttime eyes and annoying 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.220
 to put a hat with the helmet on 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.169
 the ears even to put a 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.210
 cap and now with the bracelet 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.380
 at the wrist bah listen to the 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.090
 ears are said true one can get 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.880
 protection for the winter so it is 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.569
 rather not bad 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.729
 if not, listen to it 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:49.399
 level of the wise room clip held its 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.449
 eclipses as quickly as it gets 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:54.149
 there you can their master after on 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.369
 the hoop by removing the small flapper 

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:57.360
 in the back listen to me I find that 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:59.520
 it's a good product 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.139
 it's a good product that allows you 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.729
 to have a little bit all the 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.619
 information and villages a lot 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:08.039
 faster than it is to the ears 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:10.819
 the two positions a wrist then 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:14.459
 a forearm are very good too 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:16.020
 the only downside is not really 

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:17.969
 a flat is the fact of adding a 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.800
 new headset that differs in terms of 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:23.039
 sounds you used to have with 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.930
 the with the xp sounds of the headphones of the us 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.999
 so it's a little adaptation 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.459
 as you could see after 15 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:31.050
 20 minutes hop it was settled so well 

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:32.099
 listen and here it is a good product that 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.349
 you will be able to find the house 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:36.270
 detection for a small sum 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:39.089
 29 euros so I think it's going 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.539
 it's reasonable that this level 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:45.110
 wear 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:45.110
 it should be more than 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.450
 here are the friends ben listen I you 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.680
 leave on second small product I hope 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.630
 to make others 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.850
 next time and redo 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.560
 several videos several review here 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.360
 well listen to a good release to all and 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.660
 all and see you soon takes all 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.660
 the world 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.430
 yeah 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.360
