00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.000
 welcome to this brand new video by 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.559
 pokemon hicks really in so many me 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.120
 you asked to play this game again 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.560
 and finally we are 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.480
 in this video I will show you two 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.279
 evolutions or that of char izard 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.010
 obviously of my pokemon version 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.260
 hicks and ario look and what better place 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.730
 to show you these mega evolutions if 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.470
 in fact, we are not in a gym 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.029
 tempe rolls in the fourth gym of 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.669
 precise so in case you don't 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.290
 please spoiler yourself I know some 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.329
 part of the gym you stop the video e 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.980
 see it only when precisely 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.210
 arrive in this area anyway 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.790
 go well you won't be there 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.890
 great spoilers there will be 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.270
 personally the two real evolutions but 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.300
 I'm sure that you already have it 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.149
 seen in trailers and other spoilers in 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.070
 previously or that we proceed upward 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.110
 here where we have to go into an idea 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.370
 with that really cool gym and if not 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.920
 mistake was present in some the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.410
 trailer of the game we proceed of 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.539
 as the liana very well and we challenge the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.150
 our first enemy speed him the enemy 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.880
 ok the power of the green to me the power of 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.950
 nature and very well he has happened badly 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.729
 because we have a fire-type pokémon 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.130
 ok belisario pokemon ranger sim the seats 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.380
 in fact a pokémon of grass type therefore 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.130
 you're fucking friend because we have the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.140
 our dearest already very well Richard 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.820
 if you are already at 32 instead we see 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.520
 we are at 39 then completely 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.729
 disadvantaged then of ready made 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.890
 evolve and then make the pyro move 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.890
 launch cia rizzardi takes vai 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.110
 no 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.850
 ok i wanted you to enjoy the scene 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.590
 really guys something 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.450
 absolutely exceptional goes well here is 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.060
 the throwing wire that destroys 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.009
 completely put in gb it doesn't matter 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.090
 however really this version of 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.950
 charlize hard that if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.229
 becoming a dragon is really 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.140
 absolutely fazzissima vazzas blasik 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.539
 ain to 38 fine belisario pokémon 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.150
 ranger is your power where it comes from 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.890
 better not by sight it is otherwise not 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.530
 you can make additional plot spoilers 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.380
 so I would say to proceed with the second 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.269
 opponent ok I climbed a little then the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.400
 tower and thanks to the lines we arrived 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.989
 to our second opponent 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.599
 hi challenge courage we see yours 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.010
 team ok i'm a bit sorry that the 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.560
 quality is not the best because 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.780
 I really don't know I don't know how 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.780
 record jacopo ok i dont know how 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.640
 record precisely with 3ds then 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.519
 the only thing I can do is point the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.860
 camera towards the screen really me 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.500
 I want to propose quality videos but 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.790
 really I did not know at this time 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.560
 how else to do very well 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.639
 we select the moves here medium 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.319
 let's turn around and let's grow a mega punch 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.319
 circle ok attention 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.450
 very cool even lu too expensive even if in 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.540
 reality doesn't change that much 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.730
 compared to the normal version 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.459
 of the pokémon with club is really a 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.470
 he also had very strong thorns 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.850
