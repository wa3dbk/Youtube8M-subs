when most people think about those
wrestling<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.429> probably<00:00:09.349> that<00:00:10.349> they

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
wrestling is probably that they

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.330 
wrestling is probably that they
shouldn't<00:00:10.830> do<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.900> because<00:00:12.900> it's<00:00:13.860> mostly<00:00:14.250> a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
shouldn't do it because it's mostly a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.359 
shouldn't do it because it's mostly a
guys<00:00:14.610> sport<00:00:14.969> not<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> girl's<00:00:16.199> sport<00:00:16.470> but<00:00:17.070> girls

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
guys sport not a girl's sport but girls

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.540 
guys sport not a girl's sport but girls
are<00:00:17.520> actually<00:00:18.140> making<00:00:19.140> their<00:00:19.529> way<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.770> make<00:00:20.400> it

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
are actually making their way to make it

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.240 
are actually making their way to make it
something<00:00:20.880> bigger<00:00:21.380> some<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> stereotypes

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
something bigger some of the stereotypes

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.029 
something bigger some of the stereotypes
are<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.910> girls<00:00:24.449> are<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.750> look<00:00:24.990> frail<00:00:25.350> fragile

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
are that girls are to look frail fragile

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.609 
are that girls are to look frail fragile
I<00:00:26.539> thought<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.840> girl<00:00:28.140> thing<00:00:28.560> that's<00:00:29.010> weird<00:00:29.400> that

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
I thought a girl thing that's weird that

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.620 
I thought a girl thing that's weird that
we<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:32.009> can't<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.520> because<00:00:32.910> we're<00:00:33.210> not

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
we just can't do it because we're not

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.410 
we just can't do it because we're not
strong<00:00:34.200> enough<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.770> like<00:00:35.000> that<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
strong enough for like that it's not a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.740 
strong enough for like that it's not a
girl<00:00:36.690> sport<00:00:37.170> or<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:38.879> easier<00:00:39.300> than<00:00:39.480> guys

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
girl sport or that it's easier than guys

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.560 
girl sport or that it's easier than guys

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
where it's just you and only you it's a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.779 
where it's just you and only you it's a
team<00:01:00.420> sport<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.050> not<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> team<00:01:01.500> sport<00:01:01.920> if

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.740 
you lose it's all on you if you win it's
all<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:06.150> get<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.540> satisfaction

all on you and you get the satisfaction

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.039

think<00:01:13.229> there's<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.500> difference<00:01:13.890> between<00:01:14.070> boys

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
think there's a difference between boys

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
think there's a difference between boys
and<00:01:14.880> girls<00:01:15.090> dressing<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:15.689> all<00:01:15.869> we're<00:01:16.650> both

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
and girls dressing at all we're both

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.230 
and girls dressing at all we're both
doing<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> same<00:01:17.220> sport<00:01:18.320> same<00:01:19.320> move<00:01:20.060> learn<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
doing the same sport same move learn it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.690 
doing the same sport same move learn it
yeah<00:01:21.479> learning<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.900> same<00:01:22.080> stuff<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:23.610> I

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
yeah learning the same stuff I think I

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.999 
yeah learning the same stuff I think I
would<00:01:23.850> tell<00:01:24.030> somebody<00:01:24.750> say<00:01:25.229> told<00:01:25.500> me<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
would tell somebody say told me that

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.880 
would tell somebody say told me that
what<00:01:26.909> girls<00:01:27.180> wrestling<00:01:27.509> had<00:01:27.689> no<00:01:27.840> place<00:01:28.080> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
what girls wrestling had no place that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.870 
what girls wrestling had no place that
they're<00:01:29.280> wrong<00:01:29.670> because<00:01:31.070> it's<00:01:32.070> going

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
they're wrong because it's going

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.090 
they're wrong because it's going
somewhere

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
somewhere

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.460 
somewhere
and<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.490> lot<00:01:34.880> of<00:01:35.030> girls<00:01:35.330> are<00:01:35.540> getting<00:01:35.840> somewhere

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
and a lot of girls are getting somewhere

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.310 
and a lot of girls are getting somewhere
with<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.979> like<00:01:37.250> college<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:38.570> Olympics

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
with it like college the Olympics

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.650 
with it like college the Olympics
I<00:01:39.440> think<00:01:39.770> wrestling<00:01:39.979> teaches<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:41.440> confident

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
I think wrestling teaches you confident

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.480 
I think wrestling teaches you confident
because<00:01:44.660> no<00:01:45.500> one<00:01:45.650> wants<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:45.950> throw<00:01:46.040> in<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.310> mat

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
because no one wants to throw in the mat

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.210 
because no one wants to throw in the mat
in<00:01:46.910> a<00:01:47.030> singlet<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.570> think<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:48.650> teaches<00:01:48.830> you

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
in a singlet I think it teaches you

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.880 
in a singlet I think it teaches you
responsibility<00:01:51.070> leadership<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:54.530> be<00:01:54.710> on

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
responsibility leadership and to be on

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
responsibility leadership and to be on
cast<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.840> want<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.900> represent<00:01:57.050> a<00:01:58.040> girls

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
cast I want to represent a girls

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.969 
cast I want to represent a girls
wrestling<00:01:59.270> as<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.630> positive<00:01:59.840> role<00:02:00.170> models<00:02:00.740> I

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
wrestling as a positive role models I

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.070 
wrestling as a positive role models I
think<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.580> future<00:02:01.910> of<00:02:01.940> women's<00:02:02.390> wrestling<00:02:02.630> is

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
think the future of women's wrestling is

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.410 
think the future of women's wrestling is
going<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.560> be<00:02:03.680> very<00:02:04.520> big<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.180> successful

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
going to be very big and successful

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.169 
going to be very big and successful
because<00:02:06.170> like<00:02:06.950> even<00:02:07.280> five<00:02:07.520> years<00:02:07.550> ago<00:02:07.820> there

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
because like even five years ago there

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.270 
because like even five years ago there
wasn't<00:02:08.390> nearly<00:02:08.869> as<00:02:08.989> many<00:02:09.289> schools<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.890> had

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
wasn't nearly as many schools that had

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.250 
wasn't nearly as many schools that had
women's<00:02:10.670> wrestling<00:02:10.910> like<00:02:11.450> there<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:11.780> now

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
women's wrestling like there is now

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.620 
women's wrestling like there is now
the<00:02:12.709> kaya<00:02:12.980> girls<00:02:13.340> wrestling<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:14.030> actually

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
the kaya girls wrestling is actually

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.530 
the kaya girls wrestling is actually
something<00:02:15.140> really<00:02:15.590> big<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:16.220> lot<00:02:17.209> of<00:02:17.300> people

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540
