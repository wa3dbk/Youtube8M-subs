00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.650
 hello out here and thank you very much 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.150

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.280
 have a little more pasta son 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.620
 and will find the coming weeks also 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.230
 bit override a few 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.910
 Fancy suits sometimes show you 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.399
 I call the relatively easy in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.529
 passau there is a pasta panel 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.619
 the whole time he is with mushrooms 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.720
 Acts a bit of cheese cream and 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.180
 Tastes excellent and in any case 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.730
 i thought wow fans need inferior 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.020
 mettmann with the video going on for the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.820
 First we need a passage 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.640
 handful of mushrooms and fresh photos 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.100
 onions, the white father in the end 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.450
 are then of course cut off and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.790
 then we climb the spring onion in 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.920
 rings and now we come to the 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.120
 champignons the champignons would be us 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.150
 probably a little brush and 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 cutting into small strips 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.480
 Then we take another pan 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.860
 Let's have some butter 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.600
 melt on and then we go the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.800
 chance and let it roast briefly 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.049
 always a bit walls and in the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.399
 next step then come the slides 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.500
 The whole thing will be a little bit more 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.500
 peppered and a little salted 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.360
 again and again stir nothing 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.799
 burns and with it every chance 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.390
 boys then touched the pan 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.509
 and now we give that 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.430
 spring onions to to leave the 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.539
 whole then for three to four more 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.100
 minutes in the pan and shortly 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.100
 stir again as I said three to four 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.200
 minutes left in the pan and so on 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.530
 looks the whole time now and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.860
 Now we add some water to it 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.409
 offer it all up and now 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.640
 there is still a shot cream while doing that 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.090
 We let all of us cook again 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.670
 is still flavored with a bit 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.490
 salt and pepper and now we go the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.080
 Melted cheese by piece by piece 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.459
 We stir then the pan is now 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.159
 something never turned from the 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.689
 temperature and that we continue lightly 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.520
 simmer 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.709
 so we leave so long on the stove 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.899
 until it is created and how it works with the 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.429
 Serve pasta 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.890
 and when this is done right away 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.750
 with the hot passengers fresh up 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.549
 the plate 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.140
 tasting is also best and so on 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.980
 looks the whole way I wish you 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.980
 have fun cooking 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.950
 I wish you all the best there 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.080
