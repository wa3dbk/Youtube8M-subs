00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.999 
notification reminder maybe it's there
but<00:01:51.060> maybe<00:01:51.390> also<00:01:51.540> didn't<00:01:52.020> find<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.409> I'm<00:01:52.619> not

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
but maybe also didn't find it I'm not

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.550 
but maybe also didn't find it I'm not
really<00:01:53.189> sure<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.600> what<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> good<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
really sure so what is the good and the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.709 
really sure so what is the good and the
bad<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.520> good<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.030> get<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> killer

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
bad here the good is you get the killer

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.389 
bad here the good is you get the killer
amount<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.200> features<00:01:58.530> best-in-class<00:01:58.950> I've

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
amount of features best-in-class I've

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.639 
amount of features best-in-class I've
still<00:02:00.000> yet<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.299> see<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> run<00:02:01.020> with<00:02:01.320> more

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
still yet to see a run with more

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.200 
still yet to see a run with more
features<00:02:01.890> than<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.000> bad<00:02:03.180> thing

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
features than this one the bad thing

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.090 
features than this one the bad thing
though<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.990> could<00:02:04.259> be<00:02:04.439> overwhelming<00:02:05.070> for

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
though it could be overwhelming for

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.130 
though it could be overwhelming for
starters<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.759> even<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.540> pros<00:02:06.840> it's

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
starters and even for pros it's

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.260 
starters and even for pros it's
sometimes<00:02:07.860> hard<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.369> find<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> right<00:02:09.060> one

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
sometimes hard to find the right one

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.300 
sometimes hard to find the right one
what<00:02:09.420> you're<00:02:09.569> looking<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.860> think<00:02:10.950> it's

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
what you're looking for but I think it's

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.059 
what you're looking for but I think it's
time<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.819> get

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
time to get

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.559 
time to get
to<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.430> performance<00:02:12.969> and<00:02:13.090> battery<00:02:13.209> life

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
to the performance and battery life

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.319 
to the performance and battery life
let's<00:02:14.200> check<00:02:14.469> the<00:02:14.620> colonel<00:02:14.920> real<00:02:15.040> quick<00:02:15.329> is

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
let's check the colonel real quick is

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.190 
let's check the colonel real quick is
you<00:02:16.689> is<00:02:16.900> uses<00:02:17.349> no<00:02:17.680> custom<00:02:18.430> clone<00:02:18.930> not<00:02:19.930> really

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
you is uses no custom clone not really

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.440 
you is uses no custom clone not really
maybe<00:02:20.379> it<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.650> one<00:02:20.829> but<00:02:20.980> not<00:02:21.189> really<00:02:21.370> don't<00:02:22.329> get

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
maybe it is one but not really don't get

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.899 
maybe it is one but not really don't get
it<00:02:22.510> any<00:02:22.780> custom<00:02:23.769> kernel<00:02:24.069> features<00:02:24.519> like<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
it any custom kernel features like the

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.789 
it any custom kernel features like the
sound<00:02:25.209> control<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.689> everything<00:02:25.959> else<00:02:26.170> but

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
sound control and everything else but

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.589 
sound control and everything else but
you<00:02:26.980> get<00:02:27.189> under<00:02:27.700> clock<00:02:27.879> and<00:02:28.030> over<00:02:28.180> club<00:02:28.359> and<00:02:28.510> as

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
you get under clock and over club and as

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.690 
you get under clock and over club and as
you<00:02:28.719> maybe<00:02:28.870> saw<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.260> already<00:02:29.500> when<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.430> was

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
you maybe saw it already when I was

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.339 
you maybe saw it already when I was
first<00:02:31.030> time<00:02:31.269> I<00:02:31.299> decided<00:02:31.689> the<00:02:31.840> minimum<00:02:32.200> and

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
first time I decided the minimum and

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.860 
first time I decided the minimum and
maximum<00:02:32.379> was<00:02:33.010> both<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.400> 2.2<00:02:33.969> and<00:02:34.180> now<00:02:34.659> it's

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
maximum was both a 2.2 and now it's

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.080 
maximum was both a 2.2 and now it's
already<00:02:35.200> jumped<00:02:35.469> to<00:02:35.530> one<00:02:35.680> point<00:02:35.829> 26<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.519> this

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
already jumped to one point 26 and this

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.699 
already jumped to one point 26 and this
is<00:02:37.209> one<00:02:37.420> issue<00:02:37.629> I<00:02:37.719> have<00:02:37.930> four<00:02:38.109> sisters<00:02:38.200> colonel

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
is one issue I have four sisters colonel

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.390 
is one issue I have four sisters colonel
the<00:02:39.340> frequency<00:02:40.000> always<00:02:40.859> jumps<00:02:41.859> all<00:02:42.069> around

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
the frequency always jumps all around

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.059 
the frequency always jumps all around
even<00:02:42.700> if<00:02:42.790> i<00:02:42.879> do<00:02:42.939> the<00:02:43.180> frequency<00:02:43.719> lock<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.290> even

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
even if i do the frequency lock it even

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.429 
even if i do the frequency lock it even
is<00:02:45.219> on<00:02:45.549> and<00:02:45.849> sometimes<00:02:46.030> just<00:02:46.419> that<00:02:46.659> jumps<00:02:47.290> off

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:47.439 
is on and sometimes just that jumps off

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.429 
is on and sometimes just that jumps off
and<00:02:47.849> this<00:02:48.849> results<00:02:49.329> in<00:02:49.389> my<00:02:49.569> opinion<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:50.139> two

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
and this results in my opinion of two

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.220 
and this results in my opinion of two
high<00:02:50.620> frequencies<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.489> think<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> ROM<00:02:52.599> is<00:02:52.750> fast

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
high frequencies I think the ROM is fast

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.470 
high frequencies I think the ROM is fast
and<00:02:53.379> everything<00:02:53.709> else<00:02:53.859> but<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:54.099> think<00:02:54.579> there's

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
and everything else but I think there's

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.179 
and everything else but I think there's
a<00:02:55.540> slight<00:02:55.810> go<00:02:56.049> work<00:02:56.169> with<00:02:56.199> a<00:02:56.560> back<00:02:56.769> maybe<00:02:57.010> with

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
a slight go work with a back maybe with

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.000 
a slight go work with a back maybe with
the<00:02:57.959> colonel<00:02:58.959> because<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.379> frequencies<00:02:59.829> are

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
the colonel because the frequencies are

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.289 
the colonel because the frequencies are
unstable<00:03:00.430> they<00:03:00.969> jump<00:03:01.209> all<00:03:01.389> around<00:03:01.419> and<00:03:03.299> yeah

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
unstable they jump all around and yeah

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.819 
unstable they jump all around and yeah
the<00:03:04.689> device<00:03:04.900> gets<00:03:05.139> a<00:03:05.230> bit<00:03:05.349> warm<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.739> the

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
the device gets a bit warm and the

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.740 
the device gets a bit warm and the
battery<00:03:06.129> maybe<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.609> bit<00:03:06.819> less<00:03:07.090> good<00:03:07.359> because

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
battery maybe is a bit less good because

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.170 
battery maybe is a bit less good because
of<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.049> I'm<00:03:08.260> not<00:03:08.799> saying<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.459> any<00:03:09.849> big

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
of this I'm not saying it is any big

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.270 
of this I'm not saying it is any big
issue<00:03:10.449> but<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.959> wanted<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.379> mention<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:11.889> because

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
issue but I wanted to mention it because

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.209 
issue but I wanted to mention it because
otherwise<00:03:12.819> as<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.269> can<00:03:13.419> maybe<00:03:13.599> see<00:03:13.900> here<00:03:14.219> this

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:15.219 
otherwise as you can maybe see here this

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.969 
otherwise as you can maybe see here this
this<00:03:15.699> room<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.449> about<00:03:16.599> as<00:03:16.959> smooth<00:03:17.319> and<00:03:17.500> fast<00:03:17.709> as

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:17.979 
this room is about as smooth and fast as

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.719 
this room is about as smooth and fast as
it<00:03:18.099> can<00:03:18.250> get<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.699> was<00:03:19.359> absolutely<00:03:19.620> satisfied

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
it can get I was absolutely satisfied

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.949 
it can get I was absolutely satisfied
over<00:03:21.729> the<00:03:21.849> whole<00:03:22.000> time<00:03:22.269> with<00:03:22.750> this

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
over the whole time with this

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.929 
over the whole time with this
performance<00:03:23.139> maybe<00:03:24.069> this<00:03:24.310> because<00:03:24.669> of<00:03:24.699> the

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
performance maybe this because of the

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.369 
performance maybe this because of the
higher<00:03:25.120> youth<00:03:25.389> frequencies<00:03:25.870> i'm<00:03:26.019> not<00:03:26.199> sure

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
higher youth frequencies i'm not sure

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.770 
higher youth frequencies i'm not sure
but<00:03:26.409> all<00:03:27.069> in<00:03:27.370> all<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.549> would<00:03:27.669> say<00:03:27.819> it<00:03:28.060> is<00:03:28.150> within

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
but all in all I would say it is within

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.539 
but all in all I would say it is within
the<00:03:28.930> top<00:03:29.169> five<00:03:29.199> if<00:03:29.650> not<00:03:29.799> even<00:03:30.040> top<00:03:30.189> three<00:03:30.519> of

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
the top five if not even top three of

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.550

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720

carbon as for the battery life as I said

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.729 
carbon as for the battery life as I said
dude<00:03:42.909> maybe<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.359> using<00:03:43.689> too<00:03:43.900> high<00:03:44.079> frequencies

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
dude maybe to using too high frequencies

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.589 
dude maybe to using too high frequencies
I<00:03:44.919> the<00:03:45.489> battery<00:03:45.759> life<00:03:45.879> is<00:03:45.939> slightly<00:03:46.359> on<00:03:46.569> the

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
I the battery life is slightly on the

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.509 
I the battery life is slightly on the
weaker<00:03:46.930> side<00:03:47.109> it's<00:03:47.530> still<00:03:47.739> respectable<00:03:48.250> got

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
weaker side it's still respectable got

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.249 
weaker side it's still respectable got
me<00:03:48.669> easily<00:03:49.000> through<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.299> day<00:03:49.449> but<00:03:50.019> it<00:03:50.139> is

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:50.259 
me easily through the day but it is

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.979 
me easily through the day but it is
slightly<00:03:50.709> below<00:03:51.159> slimkat<00:03:51.669> in<00:03:51.819> carbon<00:03:52.239> it<00:03:52.419> is

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
slightly below slimkat in carbon it is

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.679 
slightly below slimkat in carbon it is
on<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.560> high<00:03:53.949> level<00:03:54.340> but<00:03:54.579> on<00:03:54.879> the<00:03:55.269> weaker<00:03:55.540> side

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
on a high level but on the weaker side

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.199 
on a high level but on the weaker side
of<00:03:55.840> this<00:03:55.959> high<00:03:56.139> level<00:03:56.579> still<00:03:57.579> good<00:03:57.759> enough<00:03:57.879> and

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
of this high level still good enough and

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.909 
of this high level still good enough and
you<00:03:58.299> can<00:03:58.449> always<00:03:58.719> use<00:03:58.900> customers<00:03:59.349> after<00:03:59.739> all

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
you can always use customers after all

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.429 
you can always use customers after all
to<00:04:00.430> maybe<00:04:00.579> change<00:04:00.939> the<00:04:01.239> frequency<00:04:01.989> looking<00:04:02.349> at

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
to maybe change the frequency looking at

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.699 
to maybe change the frequency looking at
the<00:04:02.769> higher<00:04:03.340> temperatures<00:04:03.879> but<00:04:04.449> to<00:04:05.229> sum<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:05.530> up

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
the higher temperatures but to sum it up

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.640 
the higher temperatures but to sum it up
you<00:04:06.459> have<00:04:06.699> a<00:04:06.729> feature-rich<00:04:07.299> run<00:04:07.689> very

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
you have a feature-rich run very

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.249 
you have a feature-rich run very
feature-rich<00:04:09.099> as<00:04:09.969> i<00:04:10.150> said<00:04:10.359> but<00:04:10.719> therefore<00:04:11.199> it

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:11.259 
feature-rich as i said but therefore it

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:12.689 
feature-rich as i said but therefore it
is<00:04:11.319> leaning<00:04:11.620> more<00:04:11.739> towards<00:04:12.039> hardcore<00:04:12.489> feature

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:12.699 
is leaning more towards hardcore feature

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.789 
is leaning more towards hardcore feature
phonetics<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.329> more<00:04:13.509> to<00:04:13.629> casual<00:04:13.989> users<00:04:14.319> the

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
phonetics and more to casual users the

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.189 
phonetics and more to casual users the
overall<00:04:15.189> performance<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.359> fantastic<00:04:17.109> and

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
overall performance is fantastic and

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.529 
overall performance is fantastic and
definitely<00:04:17.590> way<00:04:17.889> above<00:04:18.370> average<00:04:18.639> battery

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
definitely way above average battery

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.029 
definitely way above average battery
life<00:04:19.810> slightly<00:04:20.320> on<00:04:20.409> the<00:04:20.440> weaker<00:04:20.709> side<00:04:20.829> but

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
life slightly on the weaker side but

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.560 
life slightly on the weaker side but
still<00:04:21.219> acceptable<00:04:21.699> there<00:04:22.300> is<00:04:22.419> this

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
still acceptable there is this

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.379 
still acceptable there is this
temperature<00:04:23.139> and<00:04:23.289> clock<00:04:23.560> speed<00:04:23.830> quirk

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
temperature and clock speed quirk

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.280 
temperature and clock speed quirk
stability<00:04:25.389> wise<00:04:25.539> i<00:04:25.870> had

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
stability wise i had

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.530 
stability wise i had
a<00:04:26.320> few<00:04:26.830> occasional<00:04:27.400> ops<00:04:27.790> where<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.120> device

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
a few occasional ops where the device

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.060 
a few occasional ops where the device
just<00:04:28.870> didn't<00:04:29.080> respond<00:04:29.440> for<00:04:29.590> maybe<00:04:29.740> one<00:04:29.950> or<00:04:30.040> two

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
just didn't respond for maybe one or two

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.160 
just didn't respond for maybe one or two
seconds<00:04:30.550> like<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.790> small<00:04:31.120> fries<00:04:31.420> and<00:04:31.630> two

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
seconds like a small fries and two

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.380 
seconds like a small fries and two
reboots<00:04:32.620> but<00:04:32.890> this<00:04:33.340> within<00:04:33.610> two<00:04:33.880> weeks<00:04:34.030> I

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
reboots but this within two weeks I

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.140 
reboots but this within two weeks I
think<00:04:34.690> it's<00:04:35.200> nothing<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.680> really<00:04:36.150> concern

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
think it's nothing to really concern

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.840 
think it's nothing to really concern
about<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:38.320> good<00:04:38.500> thing<00:04:38.710> about<00:04:38.860> this<00:04:39.520> wrong

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
about the good thing about this wrong

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.970 
about the good thing about this wrong
otherwise<00:04:40.210> would<00:04:40.570> be<00:04:40.750> as<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.290> can<00:04:41.470> maybe<00:04:41.650> see

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
otherwise would be as you can maybe see

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.560 
otherwise would be as you can maybe see

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
frequent official stable ones though

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.760 
frequent official stable ones though
this<00:04:58.420> is<00:04:58.570> no<00:04:58.690> issue<00:04:58.840> but<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.350> good<00:04:59.560> thing<00:04:59.590> is

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
this is no issue but the good thing is

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.800 
this is no issue but the good thing is
you<00:04:59.890> have<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.250> choice<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.970> can<00:05:01.180> use<00:05:01.390> the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
you have the choice you can use the

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.690 
you have the choice you can use the

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
stable ones once they get along the

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.010 
stable ones once they get along the
other<00:05:06.670> good<00:05:06.850> thing<00:05:06.910> is<00:05:07.090> you<00:05:07.300> get<00:05:07.450> quick<00:05:07.750> help

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
other good thing is you get quick help

from the community if you get noticed
and<00:05:10.450> here<00:05:10.750> is<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:10.990> bad<00:05:11.140> thing<00:05:11.410> it's<00:05:12.010> sometimes

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
and here is the bad thing it's sometimes

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.150 
and here is the bad thing it's sometimes
a<00:05:12.610> bit<00:05:12.730> harder<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.090> get<00:05:13.270> noticed<00:05:13.750> as<00:05:14.740> you<00:05:15.040> can

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
a bit harder to get noticed as you can

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.070 
a bit harder to get noticed as you can
see<00:05:15.310> there's<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:15.640> much<00:05:15.760> going<00:05:15.970> on<00:05:16.210> and<00:05:16.420> I<00:05:16.870> did

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
see there's so much going on and I did

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.780 
see there's so much going on and I did
two<00:05:17.290> or<00:05:17.440> three<00:05:17.590> requests<00:05:18.160> and<00:05:18.280> back<00:05:18.370> reports

two or three requests and back reports

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.850 
two or three requests and back reports
and<00:05:18.940> just<00:05:19.120> didn't<00:05:19.390> get<00:05:19.510> any<00:05:19.660> answer<00:05:20.080> but<00:05:20.620> I

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
think this is possible due to so many

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.700 
think this is possible due to so many

and would I use that had my daily driver
for<00:05:38.170> the<00:05:38.290> first<00:05:38.560> question<00:05:39.310> would<00:05:39.580> I<00:05:39.760> use<00:05:39.910> I

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
could i use it yes absolutely because

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.090 
could i use it yes absolutely because
most<00:05:43.210> of<00:05:43.390> what<00:05:43.570> i<00:05:43.600> need<00:05:43.840> is<00:05:43.990> available<00:05:44.560> it's

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
very solid super smooth for that really

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.020 
very solid super smooth for that really
that's<00:05:47.890> really<00:05:48.070> important<00:05:48.580> for<00:05:48.610> me<00:05:48.730> better

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030

life<00:05:49.300> isn't<00:05:49.630> so<00:05:49.990> important<00:05:50.500> because<00:05:50.590> it's

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
life isn't so important because it's

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.030 
life isn't so important because it's
easily<00:05:51.760> enough<00:05:52.060> for<00:05:52.090> me<00:05:52.390> but<00:05:53.050> would<00:05:53.560> I<00:05:53.740> use<00:05:53.890> it

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
easily enough for me but would I use it

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.920 
easily enough for me but would I use it
