00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 good 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.700
 hello everyone I'm looking and here I bring you 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.219
 a new trick in this trick as you have 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.369
 seen in the title we can use drums 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.770
 by way of this strategic position to 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.630
 defend or attack for example we have 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.090
 this can here we can 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.470
 burst with care because it exploits the 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.930
 drums are exploited and doing much 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.820
 hurt 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.260
 there are the drums destroyed as 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.500
 you can see we can use them in a way 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.790
 of deposition to attack or defend and 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.230
 here as you can see this example of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.670
 here we can defend those that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.800
 come for the change of medium or 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.810
 defend the tunnel from this 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.700
 position that is perfectly disparate 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.190
 speak you can shoot no no clashes 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.710
 with nothing is a hole that pass 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.750
 bullets and we made it very difficult for us 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.270
 see how good those who come by 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.190
 here usually send more rocks than 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.710
 to that corner and as you can see then it 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.780
 they see very very little on the other side too 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.120
 we have a deposit that also 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.920
 we can burst as you can see is the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.399
 deposit we can also cover the other 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.500
 way and there are more deposits as per 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.630
 example this you are seeing here that 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.970
 I just destroyed it already as you can see 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.899
 we are in the range of cee we are in range 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.970
 of flag and we can capture 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.590
 perfectly silos with demos, so no 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.950
 we are nothing visible we only have 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.570
 that covering the tunnel is dry and there or 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.149
 getting up we put ourselves in the middle 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.979
 duck here you do not see us you see 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.259
 very little and we can see what we 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.380
 they are looking to kill I do not know what 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.600
 be 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.219
 and here we are on kart island as 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.289
 you can see I am the flag of a we are 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.450
 to flag range and we are in this 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.210
 deposit that good we can burst to 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.220
 others that come from de portic de de por 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.619
 here you can use this deposit to mode 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.229
 of hiding and finally I'm in 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:52.439
 channels on the flag of de of the finger and 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.399
 I'm going to show you this last deposit 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.679
 good in which we can cover 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.170
 perfectly well everything that comes from the 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.549
 Russian side as you can see I know 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.349
 perfectly on the road you know 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.770
 perfectly the sea and we can 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:07.630
 hide here to get nothing 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.030
 that would be all if you know about tricks and 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.370
 you also say it as always give the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.610
 credits and such and see you in the next 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.610
 trick
