how<00:00:03.750> much<00:00:03.990> can<00:00:04.380> you<00:00:04.410> afford<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:05.009> pay<00:00:05.220> for

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
how much can you afford to pay for

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.249 
how much can you afford to pay for
phosphorus<00:00:06.089> well<00:00:06.509> fortunately<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:07.049> aren't

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
phosphorus well fortunately we aren't

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.169 
phosphorus well fortunately we aren't
going<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.500> have<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.890> pay<00:00:08.069> as<00:00:08.280> much<00:00:08.309> as<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:08.970> did

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
going to have to pay as much as we did

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.320 
going to have to pay as much as we did
just<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.540> few<00:00:09.570> months<00:00:10.050> ago<00:00:10.170> phosphorus<00:00:10.800> was

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
just a few months ago phosphorus was

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.879 
just a few months ago phosphorus was
$1400<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> ton<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:12.990> unfortunately<00:00:13.710> many

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
$1400 a ton and unfortunately many

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.220 
$1400 a ton and unfortunately many
fertilizer<00:00:14.309> dealers<00:00:14.700> loaded<00:00:15.269> up<00:00:15.420> on<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:16.020> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
fertilizer dealers loaded up on it so a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.570 
fertilizer dealers loaded up on it so a
lot<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.560> farmers<00:00:16.830> are<00:00:16.949> forced<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.430> buy

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
lot of farmers are forced to buy

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.429 
lot of farmers are forced to buy
fertilizer<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> wholesale<00:00:18.990> market

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
fertilizer on the wholesale market

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.380 
fertilizer on the wholesale market
because<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> savings<00:00:20.130> are<00:00:20.430> tremendous<00:00:21.090> we're

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
because the savings are tremendous we're

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.990 
because the savings are tremendous we're
talking<00:00:21.720> about<00:00:21.890> $500<00:00:22.890> phosphorus<00:00:23.430> or<00:00:23.640> instead

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
talking about $500 phosphorus or instead

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.810 
talking about $500 phosphorus or instead
of<00:00:24.119> $1400<00:00:25.080> phosphorus<00:00:25.650> that's<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.130> big<00:00:26.310> deal<00:00:26.519> so

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
of $1400 phosphorus that's a big deal so

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.460 
of $1400 phosphorus that's a big deal so
what<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.300> were<00:00:27.449> kind<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.720> curious<00:00:27.990> about<00:00:28.260> is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
what we were kind of curious about is

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.410 
what we were kind of curious about is
all<00:00:28.710> right<00:00:28.890> how<00:00:29.250> much<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.730> really<00:00:30.179> afford

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
all right how much can you really afford

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.150 
all right how much can you really afford
to<00:00:30.810> pay<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.170> phosphorus<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.800> still<00:00:32.009> get<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
to pay for phosphorus and still get a

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.950 
to pay for phosphorus and still get a
good<00:00:32.340> return<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.669> investment<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.600> your<00:00:33.719> farm

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
good return on investment for your farm

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.600 
good return on investment for your farm
so<00:00:34.320> basically<00:00:34.680> what<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.070> did<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.579> put

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
so basically what we did is we put

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.670 
so basically what we did is we put
together<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.180> little<00:00:36.390> chart<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:37.110> each<00:00:37.260> crop

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
together a little chart for each crop

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160 
together a little chart for each crop
that<00:00:37.860> we<00:00:37.980> raise<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.399> our<00:00:38.520> farm<00:00:38.820> corn<00:00:39.360> soybeans

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
that we raise on our farm corn soybeans

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.229 
that we raise on our farm corn soybeans
and<00:00:40.350> wheat<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:41.520> we're<00:00:41.670> looking<00:00:41.969> at<00:00:42.059> on

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and wheat and what we're looking at on

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.990 
and wheat and what we're looking at on
this<00:00:42.390> chart<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.989> how<00:00:43.500> many<00:00:43.739> bushels<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.550> terms

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
this chart is how many bushels in terms

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.459 
this chart is how many bushels in terms
of<00:00:45.180> yield<00:00:45.390> increase<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.020> get<00:00:46.320> from

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
of yield increase you can get from

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.860 
of yield increase you can get from
applying<00:00:46.890> phosphorus<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.850> what's<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.690> price

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
applying phosphorus and what's the price

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.840 
applying phosphorus and what's the price
of<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> commodity<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> start

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
of the commodity going to be so to start

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.850 
of the commodity going to be so to start
with<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.180> corn<00:00:51.539> what<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.050> did<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.469> figure<00:00:52.710> this

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
with in corn what we did to figure this

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.299 
with in corn what we did to figure this
all<00:00:53.039> out

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
all out

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.250 
all out
is<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.850> looked<00:00:54.030> at<00:00:54.180> okay<00:00:54.600> last<00:00:54.840> year<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.140> our

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
is we looked at okay last year on our

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.860 
is we looked at okay last year on our
farm<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.680> had<00:00:55.860> 200<00:00:56.399> bushel<00:00:56.699> corn<00:00:56.850> 200<00:00:57.539> bushel

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
farm we had 200 bushel corn 200 bushel

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.290 
farm we had 200 bushel corn 200 bushel
corn<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> grain<00:00:58.710> only<00:00:59.100> removes<00:00:59.609> seventy

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
corn just the grain only removes seventy

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.060 
corn just the grain only removes seventy
six<00:01:00.570> units<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.020> phosphate<00:01:01.500> well<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> get

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
six units of phosphate well to get

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.009 
six units of phosphate well to get
seventy<00:01:02.430> six<00:01:02.640> units<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.059> phosphate<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.840> would

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
seventy six units of phosphate we would

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.490 
seventy six units of phosphate we would
have<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:05.030> 146<00:01:06.030> pounds<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.510> map<00:01:06.750> because

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
have to have 146 pounds of map because

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.120 
have to have 146 pounds of map because
map<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:08.479> 1152<00:01:09.479> old<00:01:09.750> all<00:01:10.110> right<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:10.619> 52

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
map is 1152 old all right so it's 52

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.219 
map is 1152 old all right so it's 52
percent<00:01:11.520> phosphorus<00:01:11.970> now<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.420> 11<00:01:12.840> percent

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
percent phosphorus now that 11 percent

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.030 
percent phosphorus now that 11 percent
in<00:01:13.380> there<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.250> 11:52<00:01:14.909> oh<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.570> means

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
in there in the 11:52 oh that means

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.039 
in there in the 11:52 oh that means
nitrogen<00:01:17.040> 11<00:01:17.490> percent<00:01:17.850> nitrogen<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.869> need

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
nitrogen 11 percent nitrogen so we need

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.780 
nitrogen 11 percent nitrogen so we need
to<00:01:19.140> take<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> nitrogen<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> equation

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
to take the nitrogen out of the equation

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.010 
to take the nitrogen out of the equation
because<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.210> want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> figure<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:21.900> is

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
because all we want to figure here is

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990 
because all we want to figure here is
phosphorus<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.220> did<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.580> figured

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
phosphorus so what we did is we figured

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.780 
phosphorus so what we did is we figured
that<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.390> nitrogen<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.049> worth<00:01:25.229> 40<00:01:26.009> cents<00:01:26.369> per

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that that nitrogen is worth 40 cents per

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.060 
that that nitrogen is worth 40 cents per
actual<00:01:27.479> unit<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:28.080> you've<00:01:28.290> got<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> whole<00:01:28.680> ton<00:01:29.040> of

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
actual unit if you've got a whole ton of

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.460 
actual unit if you've got a whole ton of
fertilizer<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.180> would<00:01:30.299> have<00:01:30.420> 11%<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.320> as

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
fertilizer you would have 11% of that as

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.219 
fertilizer you would have 11% of that as
a<00:01:31.500> nitrogen<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.520> would<00:01:32.670> amount<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.229> 220

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
a nitrogen so that would amount to 220

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.800 
a nitrogen so that would amount to 220
pounds<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:35.009> multiply<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.640> times<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.210> 40

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
pounds we multiply that times the 40

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.800 
pounds we multiply that times the 40
cents<00:01:37.110> per<00:01:37.740> unit<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:38.280> nitrogen<00:01:38.909> value<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.570> give

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
cents per unit of nitrogen value we give

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.719 
cents per unit of nitrogen value we give
it<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.110> then<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.350> subtracted<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.130> off<00:01:41.340> of

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
it and then we subtracted that off of

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.090 
it and then we subtracted that off of
our<00:01:42.240> figures<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.079> by<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> time<00:01:43.920> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
our figures here so by the time you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.100 
our figures here so by the time you
figure<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:44.729> out<00:01:44.790> you're<00:01:45.540> gonna<00:01:45.630> look<00:01:45.899> at

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
figure this all out you're gonna look at

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.190 
figure this all out you're gonna look at
a<00:01:46.350> yield<00:01:46.950> increase<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.729> look<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> price<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
a yield increase and look at a price and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
a yield increase and look at a price and
what<00:01:49.619> I'm<00:01:49.740> gonna<00:01:49.860> figure<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.369> an<00:01:50.490> 8<00:01:50.610> bushel

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
what I'm gonna figure is an 8 bushel

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.420 
what I'm gonna figure is an 8 bushel
yield<00:01:51.210> increase<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.049> $4<00:01:52.590> price<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.159> corn

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
yield increase and a $4 price of corn

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.389 
yield increase and a $4 price of corn
for<00:01:53.790> new<00:01:54.119> crop<00:01:54.390> corn<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:55.020> 2009<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.250> we'd

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
for new crop corn for 2009 and what we'd

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.300 
for new crop corn for 2009 and what we'd
get<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.180> number<00:01:57.590> 526<00:01:58.590> that's<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.219> we

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
get to is the number 526 that's what we

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.310 
get to is the number 526 that's what we
can<00:01:59.430> afford<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.909> pay<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.119> map<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.869> our<00:02:00.990> farm

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
can afford to pay for map on our farm

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.200 
can afford to pay for map on our farm
well<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.680> could<00:02:01.920> find<00:02:02.219> some<00:02:02.430> map<00:02:02.610> for<00:02:02.880> cheaper

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
well we could find some map for cheaper

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.730 
well we could find some map for cheaper
than<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.689> get<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> positive<00:02:04.140> return<00:02:04.710> on

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
than that and get a positive return on

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.350 
than that and get a positive return on
investment<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.880> question<00:02:06.210> you're

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
investment but the question you're

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.059 
investment but the question you're
probably<00:02:06.390> asking<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.200> well<00:02:07.409> how<00:02:07.560> much<00:02:07.740> yield

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
probably asking is well how much yield

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.979 
probably asking is well how much yield
increase<00:02:08.429> am<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.700> going<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.030> get<00:02:09.179> on<00:02:09.420> my<00:02:09.629> farm

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.170 
increase am I going to get on my farm
applying<00:02:10.590> some<00:02:10.890> phosphorus<00:02:11.430> well<00:02:11.819> that's<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
applying some phosphorus well that's a

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.880 
applying some phosphorus well that's a
good<00:02:12.330> question<00:02:12.810> it's<00:02:12.989> going<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.290> depend<00:02:13.379> on

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
good question it's going to depend on

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.740 
good question it's going to depend on
soils<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.700> how<00:02:14.760> rich<00:02:15.150> they<00:02:15.420> are<00:02:15.450> and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
soils and how rich they are and

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.630 
soils and how rich they are and
phosphorus<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.350> begin<00:02:16.680> with<00:02:16.890> it's<00:02:17.250> one<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.610> I

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
phosphorus to begin with it's one that I

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.190 
phosphorus to begin with it's one that I
can't<00:02:17.970> answer<00:02:18.209> for<00:02:18.360> each<00:02:18.720> one<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:18.990> you

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
can't answer for each one of you

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.990 
can't answer for each one of you
personally<00:02:19.470> but<00:02:20.010> what<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.190> would<00:02:20.400> say<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.760> take

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
personally but what I would say is take

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.760 
personally but what I would say is take
a<00:02:21.030> look<00:02:21.209> on<00:02:21.420> your<00:02:21.630> farm<00:02:21.959> when<00:02:22.410> you're<00:02:22.530> putting

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
a look on your farm when you're putting

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.800 
a look on your farm when you're putting
out<00:02:22.890> some<00:02:23.130> phosphorus<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.910> year<00:02:24.240> maybe

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
out some phosphorus this year maybe

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.270 
out some phosphorus this year maybe
leave<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> strip<00:02:25.440> where<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.709> don't<00:02:25.890> put<00:02:26.069> any

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
leave a strip where you don't put any

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.830 
leave a strip where you don't put any
out<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.700> see<00:02:26.910> what<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> old<00:02:27.300> difference<00:02:27.480> is

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
out and see what the old difference is

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.570 
out and see what the old difference is
so<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.080> know<00:02:28.290> for<00:02:28.500> future<00:02:28.620> years<00:02:29.040> but<00:02:29.400> that

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
so you know for future years but that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.400 
so you know for future years but that
yield<00:02:29.819> increase<00:02:30.270> is<00:02:30.480> really<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> big<00:02:31.020> factor

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
yield increase is really the big factor

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.260 
yield increase is really the big factor
here<00:02:31.590> because<00:02:31.620> let's<00:02:32.130> say<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.520> we<00:02:32.640> got<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.820> 12

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
here because let's say that we got a 12

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.030 
here because let's say that we got a 12
bushel<00:02:33.720> yield<00:02:33.990> increase<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.590> still<00:02:34.800> had<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
bushel yield increase we still had the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.000 
bushel yield increase we still had the
$4<00:02:35.400> corn<00:02:35.640> all<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> sudden<00:02:36.300> now<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.450> can<00:02:36.660> pay

$4 corn all of a sudden now you can pay

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.130 
$4 corn all of a sudden now you can pay
746<00:02:38.010> dollars<00:02:38.370> if<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:38.790> gained<00:02:38.970> 16<00:02:39.540> bushels<00:02:39.989> now

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
746 dollars if we gained 16 bushels now

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.949 
746 dollars if we gained 16 bushels now
you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.440> pay<00:02:40.970> 965<00:02:41.970> dollars<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.540> number<00:02:42.810> just

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
you can pay 965 dollars the number just

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.930 
you can pay 965 dollars the number just
keeps<00:02:43.170> going<00:02:43.530> up<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:44.040> really<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.819> have

keeps going up you really have to have

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
some kind of idea on your farm what you

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.830 
some kind of idea on your farm what you

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
justify the use of phosphate you don't

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.740 
justify the use of phosphate you don't

pounds<00:03:24.840> out<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.170> soil<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:25.829> you<00:03:25.890> want<00:03:26.040> to

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
pounds out of the soil so you want to

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.860 
pounds out of the soil so you want to
make<00:03:26.190> sure<00:03:26.220> you've<00:03:26.430> got<00:03:26.549> at<00:03:26.670> least<00:03:26.700> 48<00:03:27.630> pounds

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
of actual phosphorus so that'd be 92

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.180 
of actual phosphorus so that'd be 92
pounds<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:31.049> map<00:03:31.260> that's<00:03:31.650> pretty<00:03:31.980> much<00:03:32.160> a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
pounds of map that's pretty much a

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.220 
pounds of map that's pretty much a

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
applied ok now let's take a look at

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.940 
applied ok now let's take a look at
wheat<00:03:36.090> if<00:03:36.329> let's<00:03:36.600> say<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.840> had<00:03:37.079> 100<00:03:37.620> bushel

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
wheat if let's say you had 100 bushel

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.130 
wheat if let's say you had 100 bushel
wheat<00:03:37.980> just<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.760> grain<00:03:39.120> only<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:39.810> going<00:03:40.049> to

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
wheat just the grain only is going to

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.140 
wheat just the grain only is going to
remove<00:03:40.470> from<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.890> soil<00:03:41.130> 50<00:03:41.700> units<00:03:42.000> of

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
remove from the soil 50 units of

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.330 
remove from the soil 50 units of
phosphate<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.019> get<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.440> with<00:03:43.650> map<00:03:43.890> we

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
phosphate so to get that with map we

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.569 
phosphate so to get that with map we
need<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.610> have<00:03:44.959> 96<00:03:45.959> pounds<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:46.650> map<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.280> let's

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
need to have 96 pounds of map and let's

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.370 
need to have 96 pounds of map and let's
say<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.880> we<00:03:48.000> can<00:03:48.120> get<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.239> 5<00:03:48.630> bushel<00:03:49.140> yield

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
say that we can get a 5 bushel yield

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.890 
say that we can get a 5 bushel yield
increase<00:03:49.799> by<00:03:50.130> putting<00:03:50.640> this<00:03:50.790> map<00:03:51.360> out<00:03:51.630> there

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
increase by putting this map out there

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.630 
increase by putting this map out there
and<00:03:52.079> let's<00:03:52.320> just<00:03:52.500> say<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.860> our<00:03:53.070> new<00:03:53.310> crop

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
and let's just say that our new crop

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.240 
and let's just say that our new crop
wheat<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:54.269> worth<00:03:54.450> 5<00:03:54.780> dollars<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.260> 75<00:03:55.709> cents<00:03:56.010> if

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
wheat is worth 5 dollars and 75 cents if

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.800 
wheat is worth 5 dollars and 75 cents if

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
if you can buy it on the wholesale

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.050 
if you can buy it on the wholesale
market<00:04:07.500> today<00:04:07.620> for<00:04:07.739> four<00:04:08.400> hundred<00:04:08.790> or<00:04:08.910> four

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
hundred fifty dollars that looks like a

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.259 
hundred fifty dollars that looks like a
pretty<00:04:10.859> good<00:04:11.010> equation<00:04:11.489> if<00:04:11.700> you're<00:04:11.970> still

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
pretty good equation if you're still

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.509 
pretty good equation if you're still
paying<00:04:12.570> a<00:04:12.870> fertilizer<00:04:13.320> dealer<00:04:13.769> nine<00:04:14.130> hundred

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
paying a fertilizer dealer nine hundred

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.219 
paying a fertilizer dealer nine hundred
dollars<00:04:14.850> or<00:04:15.000> twelve<00:04:15.299> hundred<00:04:15.390> dollars<00:04:15.930> this

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
dollars or twelve hundred dollars this

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.440 
dollars or twelve hundred dollars this
probably<00:04:16.890> doesn't<00:04:17.250> look<00:04:17.370> real<00:04:17.609> good<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.329> with

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
probably doesn't look real good so with

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.180 
probably doesn't look real good so with
phosphorus<00:04:19.019> take<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.289> look<00:04:19.530> at<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.709> crops<00:04:19.979> that

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
phosphorus take a look at the crops that

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.949 
phosphorus take a look at the crops that
you're<00:04:20.310> raising<00:04:20.459> on<00:04:20.729> your<00:04:21.000> farm<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.539> the

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
you're raising on your farm and the

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.020 
you're raising on your farm and the
place<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.260> start<00:04:22.500> is<00:04:22.860> figuring<00:04:23.370> out<00:04:23.520> how<00:04:23.820> much

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
place to start is figuring out how much

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.700 
place to start is figuring out how much
they're<00:04:24.330> going<00:04:24.539> to<00:04:24.630> remove<00:04:25.080> from<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.470> soil

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
they're going to remove from the soil

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.650 
they're going to remove from the soil
this<00:04:25.979> year<00:04:26.250> then<00:04:26.550> look<00:04:26.789> at<00:04:26.910> your<00:04:27.030> soil<00:04:27.330> test

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
this year then look at your soil test

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.980 
this year then look at your soil test
since

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
since

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.719

what kind of availability there is for

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.610 
what kind of availability there is for

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
crop then you say ah you know what I may

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.230 
crop then you say ah you know what I may
wait<00:04:37.889> till<00:04:38.099> next<00:04:38.280> year<00:04:38.550> when<00:04:38.699> phosphorus
