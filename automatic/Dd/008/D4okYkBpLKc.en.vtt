00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.439 
game this is a regular TDM game and i'm
using<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.119> ACR<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.429> think<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.580> series<00:00:30.150> should

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
using the ACR I think this series should

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.120 
using the ACR I think this series should
go<00:00:30.689> down<00:00:30.960> pretty<00:00:31.320> well<00:00:31.529> I'm<00:00:31.740> sure<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.980> guys
