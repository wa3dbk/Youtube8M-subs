00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.790 

our<00:04:12.460> voltages<00:04:12.970> terrible<00:04:13.630> terrible<00:04:14.020> we're<00:04:14.650> not

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
our voltages terrible terrible we're not

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.300 
our voltages terrible terrible we're not
the<00:04:14.890> best<00:04:15.010> of<00:04:15.220> her<00:04:15.280> copiers<00:04:16.560> but<00:04:17.560> our<00:04:17.829> temps

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
the best of her copiers but our temps

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.970 
the best of her copiers but our temps
and<00:04:18.730> I<00:04:18.970> don't<00:04:19.150> 3836<00:04:20.109> deviate<00:04:20.560> data<00:04:22.410> not<00:04:23.410> too

terrible I guess I've got much more than
stock<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:29.020> I<00:04:29.200> mean<00:04:29.320> it's<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.830> dual<00:04:30.040> fan<00:04:30.400> cooler

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910

get<00:05:32.650> left<00:05:32.860> out<00:05:33.010> that's<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.520> mast<00:05:33.850> I<00:05:34.240> mean<00:05:34.930> I<00:05:34.960> I

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
get left out that's the mast I mean I I

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.659 
get left out that's the mast I mean I I
know<00:05:35.380> there's<00:05:35.680> a<00:05:35.740> bracket<00:05:35.950> kick<00:05:36.250> you<00:05:36.340> can<00:05:36.490> buy

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
know there's a bracket kick you can buy

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.210 
know there's a bracket kick you can buy
but<00:05:37.120> to<00:05:37.330> pay<00:05:37.900> extra<00:05:38.260> just<00:05:38.500> because<00:05:38.680> you're<00:05:38.800> AMD

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
that's garbage

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.969 
that's garbage
I<00:05:41.020> think<00:05:41.290> they're<00:05:41.380> kind<00:05:41.560> of<00:05:41.590> used<00:05:41.770> for<00:05:41.890> that

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
I think they're kind of used for that

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.790 
I think they're kind of used for that
actually<00:05:42.510> are<00:05:43.510> they<00:05:43.660> yeah<00:05:44.290> all<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.650> things

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
actually are they yeah all the things

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.560 
actually are they yeah all the things
that<00:05:44.950> come<00:05:45.100> with<00:05:45.190> a<00:05:45.280> new<00:05:45.490> record<00:05:45.669> that's<00:05:45.910> awful

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
that come with a new record that's awful

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.170 
that come with a new record that's awful
I<00:05:46.979> that's<00:05:47.979> why<00:05:48.220> I<00:05:48.280> usually<00:05:48.430> buy<00:05:48.880> things<00:05:49.090> that

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
I that's why I usually buy things that

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.020 
I that's why I usually buy things that
have<00:05:49.390> all<00:05:49.600> the<00:05:50.050> CPU<00:05:50.610> support<00:05:51.669> so<00:05:52.390> in<00:05:53.080> closing

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
have all the CPU support so in closing

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.020 
have all the CPU support so in closing
busted<00:05:55.030> pitch<00:05:55.510> later<00:05:55.750> guys
