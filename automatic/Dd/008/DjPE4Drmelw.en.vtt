the game of football has really changed

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.910 
the game of football has really changed
a<00:00:32.509> lot<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:32.960> that's<00:00:33.170> been<00:00:33.440> really<00:00:33.710> impactful

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
a lot and that's been really impactful

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.610 
a lot and that's been really impactful
in<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:35.150> design<00:00:35.450> of<00:00:35.600> this<00:00:35.660> food<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.410> players

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
in the design of this food the players

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.100 
in the design of this food the players
are<00:00:36.770> much<00:00:36.920> faster<00:00:37.240> the<00:00:38.240> game<00:00:38.480> is<00:00:38.660> faster

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
are much faster the game is faster

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.160 
are much faster the game is faster
there's<00:00:39.440> much<00:00:39.620> more<00:00:39.800> athleticism<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:41.480> with

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
there's much more athleticism and with

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.020 
there's much more athleticism and with
that<00:00:42.320> game<00:00:42.590> being<00:00:42.860> faster<00:00:43.310> that<00:00:43.460> visual<00:00:43.790> apply

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
that game being faster that visual apply

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.640 
that game being faster that visual apply
needs<00:00:44.240> to<00:00:44.300> be<00:00:44.390> faster<00:00:44.810> and<00:00:44.990> therefore<00:00:45.380> the

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
needs to be faster and therefore the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.740 
needs to be faster and therefore the
boots<00:00:45.890> need<00:00:46.130> to<00:00:46.250> even<00:00:46.520> more<00:00:46.790> vanish<00:00:47.239> away<00:00:47.570> from

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
boots need to even more vanish away from

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.450 
boots need to even more vanish away from

mercurial<00:01:14.330> superfly<00:01:14.450> just<00:01:15.020> because<00:01:15.290> of<00:01:15.440> this

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
mercurial superfly just because of this

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.920 
mercurial superfly just because of this
revolutionary<00:01:16.490> technology<00:01:16.700> that's<00:01:17.480> in<00:01:17.720> the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
revolutionary technology that's in the

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.070 
revolutionary technology that's in the
boot<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:18.590> all<00:01:18.740> came<00:01:18.950> about<00:01:18.980> the<00:01:19.400> idea<00:01:19.730> of<00:01:20.080> the

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
boot it all came about the idea of the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.710 
boot it all came about the idea of the
cheater<00:01:21.320> he<00:01:22.010> stays<00:01:22.190> focused<00:01:22.430> I<00:01:22.760> spray<00:01:23.090> and

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
cheater he stays focused I spray and

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.150 
cheater he stays focused I spray and
everything<00:01:24.170> about<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.440> adapt<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.040> the

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
everything about it adapt to the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.680 
everything about it adapt to the
different<00:01:25.490> terrain<00:01:25.760> if<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.390> make<00:01:26.540> that

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
different terrain if you make that

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.970 
different terrain if you make that
analogy<00:01:26.990> into<00:01:27.350> football

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
analogy into football

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.730 
analogy into football
the<00:01:28.640> player<00:01:28.850> can<00:01:29.000> focus<00:01:29.360> on<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.570> ball<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:30.530> let

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
the player can focus on the ball and let

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.910 
the player can focus on the ball and let
his<00:01:31.010> equipment<00:01:31.430> vanish<00:01:32.260> but<00:01:33.260> really<00:01:33.560> function

his equipment vanish but really function
the<00:01:34.010> highest<00:01:34.280> level<00:01:34.580> think<00:01:35.030> in<00:01:35.330> every<00:01:35.810> big

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
the highest level think in every big

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.200 
the highest level think in every big
club<00:01:36.260> you<00:01:36.410> play<00:01:36.650> you<00:01:36.710> have<00:01:36.860> pressure<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:37.580> win

club you play you have pressure to win

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.600 
club you play you have pressure to win
of<00:01:38.390> course<00:01:38.690> my<00:01:39.230> mentality<00:01:39.560> is<00:01:39.830> to<00:01:39.950> win<00:01:40.250> I<00:01:40.430> don't

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
of course my mentality is to win I don't

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.240 
of course my mentality is to win I don't
like<00:01:40.730> to<00:01:40.910> lose<00:01:41.120> wherever<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:41.690> went<00:01:41.720> I<00:01:42.380> wanted<00:01:43.070> to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
like to lose wherever I went I wanted to

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.750 
like to lose wherever I went I wanted to
win<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:43.640> I<00:01:43.790> won<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:44.030> far<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:45.340> was<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.520> same

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
win and I won so far and was the same

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.330 
win and I won so far and was the same
mentality<00:01:47.300> of<00:01:47.810> their<00:01:48.020> team<00:01:48.290> I<00:01:48.470> came<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.950> same

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
mentality of their team I came to same

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.150 
mentality of their team I came to same
mentality<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.330> club<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:51.020> I<00:01:51.380> think<00:01:52.010> it's

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
mentality of the club and I think it's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.100 
mentality of the club and I think it's
very<00:01:52.280> important<00:01:52.880> if<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.450> don't<00:01:53.780> have<00:01:53.930> this

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
very important if you don't have this

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.060 
very important if you don't have this
mentality<00:01:54.640> it's<00:01:55.640> difficult<00:01:56.150> to<00:01:56.270> win<00:01:56.420> because

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
mentality it's difficult to win because

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.700 
mentality it's difficult to win because
the<00:01:58.070> mentality<00:01:58.670> thing<00:01:58.880> is<00:01:59.320> if<00:02:00.320> I<00:02:00.500> don't

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
the mentality thing is if I don't

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
the mentality thing is if I don't
accelerate<00:02:01.040> now<00:02:01.430> 50%<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.509> football
