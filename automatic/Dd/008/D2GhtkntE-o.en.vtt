00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.580
 Nine people and welcome to 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.340
 a new video from me so of 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.890
 so mountaineers of mine you know already 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.329
 and today it's the song we fly murder 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.899
 but only the smi maybe because 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.250
 I have an interesting ex file 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.579
 So found a connection file 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.920
 which makes you totally free 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.079
 can install for the 1.0 that is 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.700
 really very easy you do not have any mods 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.950
 or other im bin or im 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.030
 team council and if so you have to 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.769
 nothing just change that 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.329
 configure and configure experts a bit 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.039
 you can start flying 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.219
 I'll show you some for everyone 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.039
 Things do not know the zombie movie and 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:01.159
 shows the easy times do not call the 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:08.479
 world now just new world and go 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:10.430
 So let 's go , nation is like 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.720
 always after the video that's clear for 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.320
 all the first time here now 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.420
 look 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.969
 and here you are already directly you look 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.219
 now here I walk in the normal 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.320
 world around and nothing special if I am 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.420
 but now I press l 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.369
 So you can configure how yes 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.049
 I want to have the taste now 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.299
 l and there is a number up there 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.310
 you can already see sense of the flies 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.539
 organic and fast and i can now 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.430
 here I have the keys now 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.890
 configured with me he is flying high 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.490
 and eleven fly down and parents and 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.079
 make up 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.369
 click here with which I believe 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.689
 fastest speed than if you 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.119
 Do you stand up fast it does not panic it came 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.810
 of course , wise wise, slower 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.799
 let fly 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.750
 it can be much better explored that long 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.859
 and so on for example if you 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.539
 breathe on the server since that is 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.750
 Of course, very very very practical 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.100
 that's clear for singleplayer 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.539
 players play here a bit 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.740
 It's natural to explore the world 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.810
 also very suitable so have studies 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.660
 do not have it in it does not matter anyway 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.039
 I can not do that anyway 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.850
 here a little fly can then 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.140
 later, of course, the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.410
 speed and also how fast 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.620
 flies up and down and so on 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.150
 tune 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.500
 I can not show it much now 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.690
 is easy to do is natural 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.050
 also speaking speak the air 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:29.180
 he looks like this with f5 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.890
 because they are so hello and good rather can 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.120
 not to tell you anymore now 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.500
 I hope you at least understood 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.790
 what it's all about you can definitely 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.650
 You can not fly buttons yourself 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.840
 So we'll see each other now 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.070
 at the installation of this funny 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.470
 mod again 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.780
 See you soon! 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.440
 Installation partner I have to come 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.050
 now here in the morning so ok so ok 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.640
 Here you can see the page here 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.870
 reputable perhaps it establishes is 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.010
 it's me too no one else is one 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.300
 other forum I know myself there 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.010
 not at all that's me 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.140
 it does not really matter anyway 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.510
 the song fly mode and what do you need now 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.430
 just make 300 for that 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.390
 Looking at that for the 1.8 point now 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.750
 one and for the 1.0.0 available I say 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.120
 times 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.070
 We wait a few seconds then the five seconds 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.320
 came here you read it is not with xp 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.840
 compatible as far as I am here 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.880
 can translate 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.740
 and if you have windows vista or windows 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.140
 7 and windows 7 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.910
 then you have to do it as an administrator 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.320
 I have not done that before 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.230
 That's why I read a few 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.480
 problems with this ex file but later 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.050
 then does that surely memory 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.180
 is that 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.580
 I know now first on the desktop 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.100
 so that takes 10 seconds because I have one 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.450
 doing there alone the internet but have that 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.730
 you must not disturb yourself 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.930
 then she came to read a bit so well 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.550
 You can not read anything 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.420
 I burned myself here 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.220
 namely nothing interesting but and 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.410
 now you can see here could hurt 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.510
 but I know that that no 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.790
 virus is so I do not care now 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.650
 and you can already see that directly 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.920
 this file the city you as 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.350
 administrator here we want 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.300
 to let and you can see here 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.140
 you can choose minecraft 1.9 or 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:23.870
 Peter 1.810 bronze I use now 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:25.400
 here 1.9 visited okay he wants to update 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.100
 I do that then also normal directly 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.870
 fast 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.040
 yes I think that's really pointless 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.170
 I can cancel it though 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.910
 I want you to be interested 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.280
 closed again very nice a clock 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.700
 execute as administrator 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.940
 the update simply skips no 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.080
 Okay, here we are, that's how you start 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.330
 now here is above 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.740
 delete meter in full that i would open 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.130
 let each case just let the 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.190
 hook 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.500
 that is quite the option has long been 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.340
 that is a duty 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.950
 now you can do such a thing 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.300
 choose speed so slowly 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.370
 Here you can already see the downside, 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.470
 values therefore tend to change so much for building 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.960
 or a bit to build and to 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:14.060
 explore or really stop like me 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.950
 just 10.10 so had 10 400 speed that 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.970
 is then and box you can stop 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.820
 You can pick your own here 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.410
 Imagine how you want to 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.960
 Now you can get a taste 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.240
 search with the one the free mode 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.740
 I took care of that because I did 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.210
 because not always press on it and then 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.040
 do not do it abroad 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.100
 further away from the gas.de and then that is 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.570
 quite handy for me yes he is for 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.370
 fly me up because it's right next to it 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:42.170
 the b is there I have my index finger 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:44.780
 not move far here yes that was 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.130
 right and effects and down that is 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.980
 at least that's for me 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.480
 most perfect oil in my opinion 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.140
 Here you can still get the 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.660
 speed so to speak this is the 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.510
 speed so if you okay me 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.870
 So explain slowly so if you now 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.300
 here a cup takes for example h and 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.910
 now here on the speed 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.110
 10 then yes is 100% of 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:16.400
 speed if you are hard when 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:17.630
 one has not moved on he is so and 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.790
 That's the speed of the normal one 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.930
 We'll fly 5 and that's it 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.550
 speed for gloves for 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.020
 For example, we will set to 10 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.840
 that means you usually fly with 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.780
 speed 5 and if you have moved 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.940
 at ten this is under search so now 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.760
 you can enter text here 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.430
 left up comes is clear until 10.01 can 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.300
 For example, he wrote youtube in 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.910
 if it's one right now 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.090
 can 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.650
 like that and that 's it, I 've got an administrator 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.110
 that's very good up here 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:50.760
 there are a few hints but that 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:53.190
 is not so important here so and keeps 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.410
 Let's go now patches though I am 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:07:00.270
 english association now stands here for 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:02.220
 Murder was installed so perfect that 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.140
 I was already that up here 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.810
 a bit packed cool and is times 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.250
 clean it up again that's it 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.040
 installation i hope you video now 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.970
 I liked them and I would like them 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.970
 two next video too
