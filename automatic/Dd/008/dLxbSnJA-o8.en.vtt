00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.060
 travel on a car 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.430
 feeling more confident thanks to the remarkable 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.410
 technological level achieved is no longer a 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.449
 aspiration but a need that 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.300
 commonly we are used to demand 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.340
 however, it is often necessary to ask for more 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.379
 to take shelter not only from 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.629
 bad luck but also by bad guys 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.550
 the need for adequate armor 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.360
 record a number today always 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.360
 greater than requests 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.290
 the land rover brand is particularly 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.269
 also sensitive to such needs 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.370
 to be chosen as well as numerous 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.379
 also private by the police body of 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.300
 Italian state for the development of 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.190
 cars able to guarantee safety 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.190
 and performances at the same time 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.070
 the collaboration between land rover and la 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.080
 body shop marazzi leading company in 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.479
 sector has brought appreciated results 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.290
 for the high technological level as well as the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.290
 care of assemblies 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.909
 the armoring process is used 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.710
 of the constant search for materials 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.170
 sophisticated to improve the 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.329
 consistency of two resistance factors e 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.329
 lightness commonly in opposition 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.220
 the armoring operation requires a 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.990
 in-depth initial project where 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.990
 nothing is the can be left to chance 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.980
 the first phase is that of dismantling 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.470
 essentially the passenger compartment of the car 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.050
 is emptied to access the 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.240
 internal bodywork 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.410
 only the engine compartment remains intact and not 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.410
 requires specific interventions 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.910
 the armoring phase comes according to 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.380
 degree of protection provided come 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.450
 applied inside the body 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.440
 of the passenger compartment and on the doors and parts 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.440
 in manganese steel 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.480
 the presence of manganese increases in 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.590
 general hardness and elasticity 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.590
 wear resistance 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.130
 Yup 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.020
 the doors require strengthening 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.730
 of the hinges and of the mechanism of 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.470
 opening of the windows due to 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.500
 significant increase in weight and weight 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.120
 thickness of the glass walls in the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.220
 armor almost nothing can be 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.720
 automated and every intervention comes 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.720
 strictly handmade 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.860
 the phases we have seen follow that 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.860
 of painting 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.959
 it also requires high skill 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.420
 manual in everything happens in areas 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.890
 pressurized that allow the immediate 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.010
 of dust flow towards the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.010
 floor 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.489
 then finally the assembly is 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.140
 required the highest precision a 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.890
 starting from the laying of the surfaces 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.720
 windows 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.910
 despite the high ballistic resistance 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.769
 this is the bulletproof laminate 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.840
 is extremely susceptible in 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.849
 laying phase due to the weight and the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.110
 precision and due help is needed 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.110
 of mechanical suction cups 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.030
 before restoring the passenger compartment not 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.470
 remains to protect the fund with 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.599
 application of a kevlar carpet 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.790
 able to counter the effect of 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.800
 explosive devices coming from the sound 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.379
 Kevlar is a synthetic fiber 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.160
 polymer at the same weight five times 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.160
 more resistant than steel 

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.260
 now everything must appear as before 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.540
 electric system upholstery coverings 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.220
 the purpose has reached is that of a 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.200
 armor almost completely 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.690
 invisible absolutely respectful 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:37.510
 of the original aesthetic we said 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.250
 nothing is left to chance 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.350
 naturally also in case of puncture 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.090
 firearm the dynamics of the medium 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.800
 a special is not compromised 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.930
 American patent provides a soul 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.940
 stiff within their matic that 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.170
 allows a long distance too 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.170
 after the air has escaped 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.040
 the overall increase in weight well 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.050
 that falls within the parameters of 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.090
 homologation often in the higher levels 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.340
 armor plating requires the adoption of 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.340
 suspensions with reinforced springs 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.139
 naturally the car is subjected 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.970
 to the strictest ballistic tests with 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.830
 specialized assistance of forces 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.539
 the order 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.250
 armor plating must be able to 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.860
 protect from attacks with firearms 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.469
 like the kalashnikov for example true and 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.240
 own weapons of war 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:29.830
 the bullet-proof laminates ed 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.560
 anti-splinters are able to absorb 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.270
 all the kinetic energy of the projectile 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.370
 the different ballistic tests hold 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.500
 present of different parameters such as 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.780
 a given geometric portion of the 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.060
 target to protect the speed the 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.190
 caliber of the bullet and distance 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.389
 the purpose is to guarantee 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.789
 protections not only against a single person 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.840
 shot but also repeated bursts without 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.840
 that there are weaknesses 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.919
 today, technology makes it possible to resort 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.020
 to increasingly sophisticated armor and ed 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:02.280
 evolved without having to renounce to value 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.280
 car aesthetic
