strength I look for a course journey
that<00:01:46.630> look<00:01:46.750> for<00:01:46.930> athleticism<00:01:47.470> I<00:01:47.860> look<00:01:48.010> for<00:01:48.310> you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
know flexibility conditioning now take

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.890 
know flexibility conditioning now take
them<00:01:51.730> through<00:01:51.970> all<00:01:52.330> these<00:01:52.600> different

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
them through all these different

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.740 
them through all these different
aesthetic<00:01:53.170> testings<00:01:53.860> as<00:01:54.490> not<00:01:54.850> just<00:01:54.880> climbing

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
aesthetic testings as not just climbing

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.300 
aesthetic testings as not just climbing
I<00:01:55.870> think<00:01:56.380> climbers<00:01:56.860> need<00:01:56.980> to<00:01:57.040> look<00:01:57.160> at

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
I think climbers need to look at

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.770 
I think climbers need to look at
themselves<00:01:57.730> more<00:01:57.910> as<00:01:58.030> athletes<00:01:58.330> for<00:01:58.540> sure

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
themselves more as athletes for sure

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.300 
themselves more as athletes for sure
they<00:01:59.350> may<00:01:59.500> not<00:01:59.590> be<00:01:59.740> getting<00:01:59.950> paid<00:02:00.070> the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
they may not be getting paid the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.220 
they may not be getting paid the
millions<00:02:00.730> that<00:02:00.940> NBA<00:02:01.300> players<00:02:01.630> get<00:02:01.870> NFL

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
things that take so much - strength the

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.680 
things that take so much - strength the
abuse<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.340> your<00:02:09.369> body<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:10.060> know<00:02:10.210> so<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.570> you

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
abuse in your body you know so that you

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.790 
abuse in your body you know so that you

need to make sure that you're always
taking<00:02:12.100> care<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:13.180> think<00:02:13.240> climbers

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
taking care of it and I think climbers

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.570 
taking care of it and I think climbers
will<00:02:13.990> sometimes<00:02:14.410> get<00:02:14.560> stuck<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.100> just<00:02:15.310> just

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
will sometimes get stuck and just just

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.730 
will sometimes get stuck and just just
climb<00:02:15.880> just<00:02:16.150> climb<00:02:16.390> just<00:02:16.630> climb<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.080> think<00:02:17.650> is

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
climb just climb just climb I think is

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.370 
climb just climb just climb I think is
very<00:02:17.860> important<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.670> add<00:02:18.960> different<00:02:19.960> aspects

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
very important to add different aspects

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.190 
very important to add different aspects
to<00:02:20.500> their<00:02:20.620> training

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200
