part<00:02:42.540> that's<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.780> place<00:02:44.530> where<00:02:44.769> there<00:02:44.889> was<00:02:44.950> a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
part that's a place where there was a

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.690 
part that's a place where there was a
bleed

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
bleed

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.800 
bleed
they<00:02:46.150> basically<00:02:46.329> stroke-like<00:02:47.019> activity<00:02:48.810> they

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
they basically stroke-like activity they

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.379 
they basically stroke-like activity they
also<00:02:49.989> did<00:02:50.349> your<00:02:50.859> analysis<00:02:51.579> you<00:02:51.849> know<00:02:52.299> it

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
also did your analysis you know it

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.089 
also did your analysis you know it
showed<00:02:52.599> that<00:02:52.629> there's<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:53.230> glucose<00:02:53.769> in<00:02:53.980> your

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
showed that there's a glucose in your

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.149 
showed that there's a glucose in your
urine<00:02:54.780> it's<00:02:55.780> not<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.019> normal<00:02:56.349> fighting<00:02:57.040> you

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
urine it's not a normal fighting you

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.750 
urine it's not a normal fighting you
should<00:02:57.340> not<00:02:57.549> have<00:02:57.849> glucose<00:02:58.689> in<00:02:58.870> your<00:02:59.019> urine

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
should not have glucose in your urine

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.039 
should not have glucose in your urine
one<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:00.970> main<00:03:01.180> things<00:03:01.510> that's<00:03:01.659> associated

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
one of the main things that's associated

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.349 
one of the main things that's associated
with<00:03:02.379> this<00:03:02.650> diabetes<00:03:03.370> or<00:03:03.579> prediabetes

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
with this diabetes or prediabetes

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.339 
with this diabetes or prediabetes
and<00:03:05.189> and<00:03:06.189> yeah<00:03:06.939> your<00:03:07.180> glucose<00:03:07.629> was<00:03:07.959> high<00:03:08.290> it

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
and and yeah your glucose was high it

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.649 
and and yeah your glucose was high it
was<00:03:08.650> 124<00:03:09.840> normal<00:03:10.840> range<00:03:11.049> is<00:03:11.400> 7200<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:13.480> there's

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
was 124 normal range is 7200 so there's

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.839 
was 124 normal range is 7200 so there's
a<00:03:13.720> number<00:03:13.989> of<00:03:14.169> signs<00:03:14.530> here<00:03:14.889> that<00:03:15.129> it<00:03:15.489> may<00:03:15.700> have

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
a number of signs here that it may have

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.069 
a number of signs here that it may have
gone<00:03:16.030> on<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.299> kidney<00:03:16.870> failure<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:19.720> prior

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
gone on to kidney failure and the prior

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.409 
gone on to kidney failure and the prior
strokes<00:03:20.799> might<00:03:21.400> have<00:03:21.519> gone<00:03:21.729> on<00:03:21.909> to<00:03:22.150> become

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
strokes might have gone on to become

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.420 
strokes might have gone on to become
full-blown<00:03:22.870> strokes<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.919> might<00:03:24.099> have<00:03:24.190> died
