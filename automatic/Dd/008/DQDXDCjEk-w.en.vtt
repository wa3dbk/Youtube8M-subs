00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.990
 last super rediscovered this palette 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.360
 of discovery this palette of joe was 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:43.080
 which I bought called 26 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.410
 eyeshadow is a blush palette but the 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.790
 pigmentation of the edition eye shadows 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.130
 look at the beauty of the colors I have 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:54.120
 all these shades are chosen 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.220
 drink beautiful bronze 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.800
 actually the row below I don't use them 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.510
 all as blush but only the first three 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.700
 because this is a super bronze this is 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.410
 a super barry but it's all high 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.590
 shades that you can use both as blush 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:10.800
 that like eye shadows but this good here and 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.620
 from fear this red bronze is here from 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.990
 fear better, I had nothing to do with zoeva 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.190
 and I guess I'll get more because of it 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.050
 dust quality is absurd guys 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.740
