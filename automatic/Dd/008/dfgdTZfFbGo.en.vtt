00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.860
 Thousands of supporters of the Kabyle 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.220
 it gives us more strength because I 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.439

 wear this yellow and green jersey and I 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.659
 I'm proud of defense and we say no 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.180
 because I know that I have this desire 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.640
 that I demonstrated from data 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.330
 - each meeting is to progress to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.890
 every game 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.230
 he's working and you'll see and discover a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.380
 beautiful region kabylie his chances 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.960
 moment to fall in a beautiful view where 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.680
 people are shouting bad sense 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.770
 Clientless nice woman helped in 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.970
 so that I can adapt easily 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.130
 to already on the plane is a hard scaf 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.260
 I am perfectly fine I feel 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.520
 is to beat is Algeria well the 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.890
 Cameroon will play one last match 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.810
 decisive for going to the world cup in 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.830
 predictions and already before the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.060
 go matches I had said that taxes 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.070
 algeria algeria 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.200
 it will not be easy against burkina 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.150
 faso but they will qualify 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.550
 and here they have made a very good match 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.280
 to go to burkina where they were 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.290
 tilted 3 goals to 2 and now that's 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.180
 a benefit to him he'll have everything 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.940
 give and try you tell me everything 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.830
 to try to win but that's not to 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.640
 you to be qualified there I think that 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.290
 saw i'm at jsk we're going to celebrate this 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.120
 qualification all together and 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.489
 now we come back to cameroon we have 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.140
 a very good match and in Tunisia where she 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.160
 did not manage the match and now we 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.739
 redo the match via genius so that's 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.600
 to us to be lucid in the round and your 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.310
 turn he tries not to let this 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.470
 team plays and that is not bad and 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.090
 it is this attitude that Cameroon and 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.680
 Algeria qualified for the cup 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.459
 of the world so but there you are half 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.470
 Algerian half case bothers me so much 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.870
 I am at the jsk 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.630
 it's my new family I see more 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.340
 the people I work with that those 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.730
 of my family no it's my new 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.350
 family I'm here from touquet with that 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.200
 it's the leader who is the 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:20.040
 president hu had to endure basically 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.049
 from a family and everyone you 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.610
 leave my country and now and I am 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.019
 I went there this terrier I have 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.630
 children I had to do the job said 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.989
 when one has the mind I am obliged to 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.560
 give it all and it's not over to my 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.000
 goals 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.250
 you are an attacker where I'm going 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.500
 certainly very happy about the return of 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.310
 samuel eto'o at the level of lions this 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.079
 accountant and has nothing to say and 100 coop 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.730
 The cool thing is a bit say soon 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.709
 now if we want it because I 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.620
 draws a lot of teachers coming from 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.900
 him and sees today are trying to 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.579
 copy what is it is because this 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.139
 either in training or in match 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.079
 you must always keep your cool 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.329
 must know how to manage the street renoir and he 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.560
 must be objective therefore to all and to 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.720
 all meetings must be objective 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.930
 we must always believe and it goes through 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.459
 the will that passes my determination and 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.709
 its not in your opinion then 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.419
 precisely the last question the jsk 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.459
 parents including mouloudia alger 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:17.549
 when they show up for the jsk he 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.010
 must be modest in the gulf not going 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.520
 says that the 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.200
 the djia but six years they spent 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.670
 difficult moments remains a very big 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.730
 level team now this 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.340
 victory before you have to go 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.320
 by work it goes through seriousness to 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.120
 the training we 'll go over there as 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.450
 of course because he also 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.340
 we have a good team in bourgeois d3 and 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.020
 now it will have to manage these masts 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.270
 mouloudia which is not easy already 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.870
 I think it's the present that we 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.030
 give a dream 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.190
 in any case the defenders of the mouloudia 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.020
 d'Alger are warned for tomorrow Saturday 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.880
 because he's the kind of attacker 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.880
 watch like milk on fire
