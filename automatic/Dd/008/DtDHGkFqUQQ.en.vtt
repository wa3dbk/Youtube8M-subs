00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.080
 because there next quickie from 19 11 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.420
 Yesterday everybody was sick today we are 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.400
 come back and these are the themes of this 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.890
 Tomorrow morning, it started with 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.570
 the qualcomm talk that's this smart 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.580
 watch with mirasol display we had 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.480
 looked at us on the ifa very much 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.619
 liked 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.690
 and for that there is now one 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.489
 date of sale at least in the usa there 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.220
 you should start from the second december for 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.860
 york as a decent 349 us dollars in 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.559
 We come to the trade saying the clock 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.720
 the price anyway, now no 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.980
 too little success especially since 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.190
 smart watch it's just in vogue 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.860
 and samsung announced yes or 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.780
 rather claims already 800,000 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.030
 copies of his new mediocre 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.190
 galaxy greed to have sold so there 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.840
 could the qualcomm talk through abroad 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.030
 to reach these regions as well 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.860
 to derive december in the usa for 349 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.479
 We now have dollars for Germany 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.369
 no concrete information yet 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.560
 but if you sell in the usa 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.610
 This is not going to be that long here 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.430
 to wait 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.560
 I second theme most degree the nexus 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.240
 Five of the report is tomorrow if everything 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.149
 good online now I have here now 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.819
 no wood that's why i believe in glass too 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.860
 and yes one of the negative points of the nexus 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:26.300
 5, the camera is not so much the 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.520
 hardware that's all right but 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.470
 the software this android camera app 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.000
 yes, even the nexus four in it 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.470
 but and has not changed much 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.780
 since then leaves in things 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.300
 functionality a lot to be desired 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.099
 and we wish that google there 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.679
 a bit updated and now there 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.810
 It references in the documents of android 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.069
 that they probably had that , but it did 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.080
 not in time for android 4 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.420
 Colleague Frank did it tomorrow morning 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.220
 something written about it that we thus 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.869
 So the work on it was now in 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.520
 finished for android 44 the stand 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.840
 but certainly not silent 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.489
 so we're in one of the next 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.830
 major releases but maybe so 

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:02.989
 expect in between with new features 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.369
 For example, Rosport is allowed to do it 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.539
 be that the android camera then 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.009
 just not in the jpeg file anymore 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.080
 what he stores with certain 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.660
 losses connected but rome as well 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.700
 The professional cameras make you 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.650
 then bigger but also a lot 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.270
 could produce higher quality images 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.340
 Native facial recognition should also be included 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.840
 I do not know its throwing mode now 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.209
 I'm watching photos in Boston 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.860
 the also and external exchange cameras 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.040
 I'll show you something like that here 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.040
 something like the sony offers then 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.390
 x10 would then be natively supported 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.099
 so fine things will be happy 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.750
 that google the camera app of 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.220
 android then just take an active one 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.230
 a little bit better then that too 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.580
 nexus 5 even better 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.540
 keyword nexus 5 respectively 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.069
 android 4.4 kitkat update time many 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.349
 nexus 4 owners are still waiting 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.810
 on her update on kitkat while for 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.870
 the nexus seven models and the nexus 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.950
 10 with wlan this update already since 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.090
 A few days will be cleared up 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.160
 ours still has not arrived 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.540
 I keep on pushing there 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.090
 nothing still happens but it will 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.069
 nexus 4 is actually being rolled out 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.660
 Owners and also those with tablets with 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.280
 lte functionality or 3g 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.140
 functionality still on the update 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.970
 now has a google support staff 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.040
 on twitter if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.980
 from the e-mail to a 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.810
 customer request answered that one 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.579
 possibly at the end of november at the beginning of december 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.200
 could expect this update 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.150
 we do not have more specific information 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.200
 that's why we believe the best and 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.450
 hope that would be timely 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.819
 watch out that to the end of this 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.459
 month of the beginning of december then also nexus 4 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.350
 Owner in the enjoyment of delicious kitkat 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.380
 com and where we are already at updates 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.870
 The Samsung Galaxy Note 2 is currently being updated 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.930
 in india and scandinavia the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.889
 official 4.3 update we enjoy 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.569
 a little bit with caution 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.579
 Because we remember the Samsung Galaxy 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.200
 s3 had officially in some regions 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.819
 so that not Ireland and the UK 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.319
 already got this update 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.329
 Assembly has meanwhile 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.980
 stopped again and on the weekend itself 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.989
 expressed that yes that is one 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.130
 have been totally banned and that can 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.489
 we can not expand that way I can 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.060
 I had me a confirm 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.950
 corresponding one corresponding 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.109
 firmware flashed on my s3 and after 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.870
 In fact, that was not really true anymore 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.400
 usable and accordingly we go 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.620
 times it still slightly beaten 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.900
 the colleague on the right also accordingly 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.340
 let's assume that this is only 2 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.780
 update maybe then again 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.039
 wanting to do that back 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.840
 Of course, but not in Germany 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.600
 it has not arrived anyway 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.160
 yes those were the topics of the day we 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.479
 link all articles to these 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.250
