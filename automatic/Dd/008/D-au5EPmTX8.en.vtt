I'll cover the specific sensitivities as

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.620 
I'll cover the specific sensitivities as
a<00:00:20.900> note<00:00:21.200> when<00:00:21.800> we<00:00:21.919> say<00:00:22.130> skin<00:00:22.580> of<00:00:22.700> color<00:00:22.849> we're

to<00:02:10.220> have<00:02:10.369> more<00:02:10.789> of<00:02:10.849> a<00:02:10.940> luster<00:02:11.709> just<00:02:12.709> remember

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
to have more of a luster just remember

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.800 
to have more of a luster just remember
however<00:02:13.220> it's<00:02:13.910> great<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.330> skin<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.660> color

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
however it's great the skin of color

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.679 
however it's great the skin of color
provides<00:02:15.590> inherent<00:02:16.310> protection<00:02:16.459> but<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:17.510> only

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
provides inherent protection but I only

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.750 
provides inherent protection but I only
mention<00:02:18.109> SPF<00:02:18.650> which<00:02:18.890> protects<00:02:19.280> against<00:02:19.609> UVB

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
mention SPF which protects against UVB

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.759 
mention SPF which protects against UVB
so<00:02:21.000> if<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.150> have<00:02:21.360> skin<00:02:21.659> of<00:02:21.750> color<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.409> still

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
so if you have skin of color you still

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.220 
so if you have skin of color you still
need<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.220> apply<00:02:23.310> sunscreen<00:02:23.760> daily<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.780> protect

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
need to apply sunscreen daily to protect

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.280 
need to apply sunscreen daily to protect
you<00:02:25.440> from<00:02:25.650> UVA<00:02:26.659> and<00:02:27.659> while<00:02:27.840> these<00:02:27.989> are<00:02:28.110> some<00:02:28.260> of

you from UVA and while these are some of

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.530 
you from UVA and while these are some of
the<00:02:28.379> benefits<00:02:28.890> there<00:02:29.430> are<00:02:29.459> trade-offs<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
the benefits there are trade-offs to the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.000 
the benefits there are trade-offs to the
greater<00:02:30.750> amount<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.230> melanin<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:31.799> these

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
greater amount of melanin in these

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.070 
greater amount of melanin in these
