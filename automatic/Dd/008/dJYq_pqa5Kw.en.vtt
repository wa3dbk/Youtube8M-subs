00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
because when I glued it back together it

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.270 
because when I glued it back together it
was<00:04:39.060> working<00:04:39.389> perfect<00:04:39.780> at<00:04:39.900> epoch<00:04:40.290> but<00:04:40.620> on<00:04:40.770> the

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
was working perfect at epoch but on the

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.810 
was working perfect at epoch but on the
turret<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:42.229> advancing<00:04:43.229> years<00:04:43.889> separated

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
turret and the advancing years separated

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.010 
turret and the advancing years separated
the<00:04:45.540> this<00:04:46.169> part<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:46.710> this<00:04:46.800> part<00:04:48.020> separated

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
the this part and this part separated

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.140 
the this part and this part separated
and<00:04:49.290> when<00:04:49.560> I<00:04:49.590> glued<00:04:49.919> it<00:04:50.070> back<00:04:50.100> together<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.880> was

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
and when I glued it back together it was

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.870 
and when I glued it back together it was
glued<00:04:51.360> on<00:04:51.479> crooked<00:04:51.990> so<00:04:52.800> i<00:04:52.830> used<00:04:53.160> some<00:04:53.430> boiling

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
glued on crooked so i used some boiling

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.650 
glued on crooked so i used some boiling
water<00:04:55.010> to<00:04:56.010> try<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.340> remove<00:04:56.669> it<00:04:56.850> but<00:04:57.270> instead<00:04:57.540> of

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
water to try to remove it but instead of

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.030 
water to try to remove it but instead of
removing<00:04:57.840> it<00:04:58.080> it<00:04:58.200> just<00:04:58.229> kind<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.590> warped<00:04:58.889> the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
removing it it just kind of warped the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.740 
removing it it just kind of warped the
plastic<00:04:59.520> because<00:04:59.669> it's<00:04:59.850> it's<00:05:00.120> not<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.540> best

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
plastic because it's it's not the best

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.690 
plastic because it's it's not the best
it's<00:05:01.320> not<00:05:01.440> like<00:05:01.620> nerf<00:05:01.830> plastic<00:05:02.310> it's<00:05:02.430> not<00:05:02.580> the

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
it's not like nerf plastic it's not the

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.420 
it's not like nerf plastic it's not the
best<00:05:02.850> quality<00:05:02.970> plastic<00:05:03.630> so<00:05:04.110> now<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:04.680> this

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
best quality plastic so now the this

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.550 
best quality plastic so now the this
disc<00:05:05.790> is<00:05:06.000> like<00:05:06.210> has<00:05:06.540> this<00:05:06.720> like<00:05:06.930> slight<00:05:07.320> wave

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
disc is like has this like slight wave

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.330 
disc is like has this like slight wave
in<00:05:07.800> it<00:05:07.950> um<00:05:08.669> so<00:05:09.120> it<00:05:09.450> wouldn't<00:05:09.810> it<00:05:10.020> just<00:05:11.010> wasn't

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
in it um so it wouldn't it just wasn't

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.280 
in it um so it wouldn't it just wasn't
working<00:05:11.550> out<00:05:11.610> so<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.389> removed<00:05:12.780> all<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:12.960> barrels

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
working out so I removed all the barrels

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.390 
working out so I removed all the barrels
and<00:05:13.530> I<00:05:13.710> ordered<00:05:14.070> another<00:05:14.280> one<00:05:14.490> and<00:05:15.770> it's<00:05:16.770> not

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
and I ordered another one and it's not

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.820 
and I ordered another one and it's not
hard<00:05:17.700> facts<00:05:17.970> just<00:05:18.300> very<00:05:18.539> annoying<00:05:18.810> but<00:05:19.470> in<00:05:19.710> the

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
hard facts just very annoying but in the

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.360 
hard facts just very annoying but in the
meantime<00:05:20.270> I've<00:05:21.470> gone<00:05:22.470> through<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.889> shell<00:05:23.160> and

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
meantime I've gone through the shell and

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.610 
meantime I've gone through the shell and
what<00:05:23.669> I'm<00:05:23.789> envisioning<00:05:23.970> is<00:05:24.539> everywhere<00:05:25.380> that

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
what I'm envisioning is everywhere that

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.170 
what I'm envisioning is everywhere that
there<00:05:25.770> isn't<00:05:26.010> a<00:05:26.039> moving<00:05:26.340> part<00:05:26.580> is<00:05:26.760> just<00:05:26.789> like<00:05:27.150> a

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
there isn't a moving part is just like a

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.770 
there isn't a moving part is just like a
wall<00:05:27.539> of<00:05:27.750> epoxy<00:05:28.050> buddy<00:05:28.550> is<00:05:29.550> this<00:05:30.300> when<00:05:30.660> it

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
wall of epoxy buddy is this when it

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.409 
wall of epoxy buddy is this when it
worked<00:05:31.020> it<00:05:31.350> was<00:05:31.950> amazing<00:05:32.160> and<00:05:32.520> i<00:05:32.669> love<00:05:32.700> it<00:05:33.060> to

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
worked it was amazing and i love it to

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.990 
worked it was amazing and i love it to
just<00:05:34.490> you<00:05:35.490> know<00:05:35.520> never<00:05:36.419> break<00:05:36.690> again<00:05:36.960> I'd<00:05:38.000> like

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
just you know never break again I'd like

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.760 
just you know never break again I'd like
to<00:05:39.150> make<00:05:39.300> this<00:05:39.419> my<00:05:39.600> signature<00:05:40.050> primary<00:05:40.470> place

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
to make this my signature primary place

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.159 
to make this my signature primary place
like<00:05:41.099> the<00:05:41.280> thing<00:05:41.490> cuz<00:05:41.940> I've<00:05:42.090> used<00:05:42.599> the<00:05:42.930> quad

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
like the thing cuz I've used the quad

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.100 
like the thing cuz I've used the quad
shot<00:05:43.470> for<00:05:43.680> two<00:05:43.830> years<00:05:44.099> now<00:05:44.280> and<00:05:44.520> it<00:05:45.270> just<00:05:45.990> suits

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
shot for two years now and it just suits

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.740 
shot for two years now and it just suits
me<00:05:46.289> so<00:05:46.530> well<00:05:46.740> and<00:05:46.950> an<00:05:47.849> octo<00:05:48.180> shot<00:05:48.389> I'm<00:05:48.570> never

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
me so well and an octo shot I'm never

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.270 
me so well and an octo shot I'm never
going<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:48.990> need<00:05:49.139> more<00:05:49.320> than<00:05:49.380> that<00:05:49.560> ever

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
going to need more than that ever

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.510 
going to need more than that ever
doesn't<00:05:51.000> matter<00:05:51.090> what<00:05:51.300> comes<00:05:51.510> out<00:05:52.400> that's<00:05:53.400> it

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
doesn't matter what comes out that's it

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.050 
doesn't matter what comes out that's it
so<00:05:54.240> if<00:05:55.110> this<00:05:55.590> all<00:05:55.830> goes<00:05:55.860> according<00:05:56.760> to<00:05:56.789> plan

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
so if this all goes according to plan

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.270 
so if this all goes according to plan
and<00:05:57.360> it<00:05:57.450> works<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.780> way<00:05:57.810> I<00:05:57.930> wanted<00:05:58.200> to<00:05:58.260> this<00:05:59.099> is

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
and it works the way I wanted to this is

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.800 
and it works the way I wanted to this is
going<00:05:59.400> to<00:05:59.490> be<00:05:59.580> my<00:05:59.760> signature<00:06:00.210> primary<00:06:00.630> which

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
going to be my signature primary which

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.600 
going to be my signature primary which
is<00:06:00.930> the<00:06:01.050> thing<00:06:01.260> I'll<00:06:01.410> always<00:06:01.680> use<00:06:02.220> at<00:06:02.430> nerve

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
is the thing I'll always use at nerve

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.270 
is the thing I'll always use at nerve
force<00:06:02.880> so<00:06:03.450> I'm<00:06:04.229> just<00:06:04.500> going<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:04.710> like<00:06:04.889> line

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
force so I'm just going to like line

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.860 
force so I'm just going to like line
this<00:06:05.550> thing<00:06:05.729> with<00:06:05.849> epoxy<00:06:06.090> buddy<00:06:06.389> this<00:06:06.570> is<00:06:06.750> how

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
this thing with epoxy buddy this is how

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.659 
this thing with epoxy buddy this is how
much<00:06:07.050> I<00:06:07.169> have<00:06:07.320> left<00:06:07.349> and<00:06:07.830> I<00:06:07.860> plan<00:06:08.099> on<00:06:08.250> using<00:06:08.460> at

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
much I have left and I plan on using at

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.520 
much I have left and I plan on using at
least<00:06:08.700> double<00:06:09.000> this<00:06:09.270> so<00:06:09.990> you<00:06:10.050> know<00:06:10.260> buying

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
least double this so you know buying

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.670 
least double this so you know buying
more<00:06:10.770> and<00:06:11.690> I'm<00:06:12.690> going<00:06:12.900> to<00:06:12.930> put<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.200> internals

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
more and I'm going to put the internals

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.960 
more and I'm going to put the internals
in<00:06:13.860> lube<00:06:14.400> the<00:06:14.430> internals<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.270> then<00:06:15.840> just<00:06:16.110> like

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
in lube the internals and then just like

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.730 
in lube the internals and then just like
seep<00:06:17.970> epoxy<00:06:18.539> katia<00:06:18.900> around<00:06:19.229> them<00:06:19.410> everywhere

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
seep epoxy katia around them everywhere

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.589 
seep epoxy katia around them everywhere
it<00:06:19.889> will<00:06:20.010> fit<00:06:20.190> probably<00:06:20.760> not<00:06:20.849> that<00:06:21.120> much<00:06:21.330> but

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 
it will fit probably not that much but

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:25.430 
it will fit probably not that much but
you<00:06:22.530> get<00:06:22.650> the<00:06:22.710> idea<00:06:22.830> so<00:06:24.169> that's<00:06:25.169> what<00:06:25.349> I'm

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
you get the idea so that's what I'm

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.960 
you get the idea so that's what I'm
working<00:06:25.620> on<00:06:25.830> I<00:06:26.039> just<00:06:26.340> felt<00:06:26.520> like<00:06:26.610> making<00:06:26.789> a

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
working on I just felt like making a

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.000 
working on I just felt like making a
video<00:06:27.210> real<00:06:27.539> quick<00:06:27.570> and<00:06:28.050> give<00:06:28.680> you<00:06:28.740> guys<00:06:28.800> an

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
video real quick and give you guys an

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.010 
video real quick and give you guys an
update<00:06:29.070> because<00:06:29.430> again<00:06:29.849> I<00:06:29.880> wasn't<00:06:30.450> here<00:06:30.810> all
