00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.269 
on for the bass drum on for the snare
drum<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.090> two<00:00:18.330> overheads<00:00:19.010> because<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.100> like<00:00:20.250> a

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
drum and two overheads because I like a

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.519 
drum and two overheads because I like a
little<00:00:20.460> bit<00:00:20.640> more<00:00:20.880> control<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.600> my<00:00:21.810> mix<00:00:22.050> when

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
little bit more control in my mix when

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.950 
little bit more control in my mix when
I'm<00:00:22.650> recording<00:00:23.130> I'm<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.760> use<00:00:23.970> six<00:00:24.539> just

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
I'm recording I'm going to use six just

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.689 
I'm recording I'm going to use six just
to<00:00:25.019> bring<00:00:25.199> out<00:00:25.350> some<00:00:25.529> different<00:00:25.920> nuances<00:00:26.400> in

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
to bring out some different nuances in

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.339 
to bring out some different nuances in
the<00:00:26.789> drunker<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.840> I'm<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.080> take<00:00:28.199> you

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the drunker so I'm going to take you

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.710 
the drunker so I'm going to take you
through<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.490> microphones<00:00:29.970> at<00:00:30.179> which<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.480> use

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
through the microphones at which I use

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.510 
through the microphones at which I use
and<00:00:31.019> then<00:00:31.170> we'll<00:00:31.320> look<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.560> positioning<00:00:32.070> on

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
and then we'll look at positioning on

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.270 
and then we'll look at positioning on
the<00:00:32.579> drum<00:00:32.910> kit<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.239> get<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> good<00:00:33.540> sound

drum sample on the snare drum I'm just

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.090 
drum sample on the snare drum I'm just
going<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.719> use<00:01:00.899> two<00:01:02.449> shure<00:01:03.449> sm57<00:01:04.350> microphones

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
going to use two shure sm57 microphones

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.789 
going to use two shure sm57 microphones
one<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> top<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> bottom<00:01:07.350> and

one on the top and one on the bottom and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.030 
one on the top and one on the bottom and
I<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> use<00:01:08.670> these<00:01:09.049> clips<00:01:10.049> rather<00:01:10.770> than

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
I like to use these clips rather than

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.190 
I like to use these clips rather than
using<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.790> forest<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.390> microphone<00:01:12.900> stands

using a forest of microphone stands
around

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.840 

then<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:18.020> overheads<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.159> whole<00:01:19.310> method

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
then the overheads and the whole method

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.030 
then the overheads and the whole method
the<00:01:20.030> Glyn<00:01:20.210> John's<00:01:20.240> method<00:01:20.900> really<00:01:21.140> revolves

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
the Glyn John's method really revolves

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.530 
the Glyn John's method really revolves
around<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.490> having<00:01:22.790> to<00:01:23.000> good<00:01:23.270> quality

sure BG force I've particularly like

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.310 
sure BG force I've particularly like
sounded<00:01:38.119> them<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.450> they<00:01:38.570> work<00:01:38.780> really<00:01:39.110> well

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
sounded them and they work really well

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.600 
sounded them and they work really well
in<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.680> room<00:01:39.920> that<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:41.390> I'm<00:01:41.509> using<00:01:42.610> if

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
in the room that that I'm using if

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.719 
in the room that that I'm using if
you're<00:01:43.790> not<00:01:44.030> sure<00:01:45.640> experiment<00:01:46.640> with

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
you're not sure experiment with

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.219 
you're not sure experiment with
different<00:01:46.850> microphones<00:01:47.420> ribbon<00:01:47.810> microphones

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
different microphones ribbon microphones

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.900 
different microphones ribbon microphones
work<00:01:48.440> particularly<00:01:48.800> well<00:01:49.070> for<00:01:49.250> this<00:01:49.399> for<00:01:49.820> this

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
work particularly well for this for this

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.150 
work particularly well for this for this
method<00:01:50.300> so<00:01:51.110> those<00:01:51.259> are<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.440> six<00:01:51.619> microphones

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
method so those are the six microphones

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.040 
method so those are the six microphones
that<00:01:52.550> I'm<00:01:52.640> using<00:01:52.850> traditionally<00:01:53.479> would<00:01:53.750> just

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
that I'm using traditionally would just

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.430 
that I'm using traditionally would just
be<00:01:54.550> bass<00:01:55.550> drum<00:01:55.789> microphone<00:01:56.020> snare<00:01:57.020> drum<00:01:57.170> spot

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.770 
be bass drum microphone snare drum spot
microphone<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.160> two<00:01:58.610> overheads<00:01:59.060> like<00:01:59.570> I<00:01:59.600> said

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
microphone and two overheads like I said

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.870 
microphone and two overheads like I said
I'm<00:01:59.899> adding<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.200> bottom<00:02:00.890> snare<00:02:01.070> microphone<00:02:01.580> and

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
I'm adding a bottom snare microphone and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.090 
I'm adding a bottom snare microphone and
sub<00:02:02.420> kick<00:02:02.570> microphone<00:02:03.110> just<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.830> bring<00:02:03.950> out

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
sub kick microphone just to bring out

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.400 
sub kick microphone just to bring out
some<00:02:04.250> some<00:02:04.610> different<00:02:04.910> yarns<00:02:05.179> here<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:06.259> let's

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
some some different yarns here so let's

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:25.520 
some some different yarns here so let's
look<00:02:06.530> at<00:02:06.679> placing<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.070> mammal<00:02:07.340> dump<00:02:07.520> you

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530

better and get pounded three there
we<00:04:28.240> go

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
we go

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.370 
we go
and<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.139> other<00:04:29.260> microphone<00:04:30.660> is<00:04:31.660> panned<00:04:32.110> to

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
and the other microphone is panned to

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:44.960 
and the other microphone is panned to
nine<00:04:33.070> o'clock<00:04:42.810> secret<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.900> this<00:04:44.020> technique<00:04:44.380> is

your days the correct amount for this
particular<00:04:56.410> microphone<00:04:56.950> see<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.910> distance

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
particular microphone see the distance

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.090 
particular microphone see the distance
from<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.479> center<00:04:58.810> of<00:04:58.960> my<00:04:59.139> snare<00:04:59.410> drum<00:04:59.440> the

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
from the center of my snare drum the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:08.240 
from the center of my snare drum the
diaphragm<00:05:00.610> with<00:05:00.700> my<00:05:00.850> microphone<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:07.539> side

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
diaphragm with my microphone to the side

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.760 
diaphragm with my microphone to the side
is<00:05:09.250> exactly<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:13.660> same<00:05:13.810> place<00:05:14.110> on<00:05:14.349> my<00:05:14.500> snare

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
is exactly the same place on my snare

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.440 
is exactly the same place on my snare
drum<00:05:14.800> I'm<00:05:15.070> doing<00:05:15.430> is<00:05:15.490> lifting<00:05:16.500> today<00:05:17.500> okay

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
drum I'm doing is lifting today okay

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.110 
drum I'm doing is lifting today okay
that's<00:05:19.450> the<00:05:19.660> secret<00:05:19.960> of<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:20.229> technique

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
that's the secret of the technique

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.400 
that's the secret of the technique
having<00:05:22.120> your<00:05:22.270> overhead<00:05:22.750> microphones<00:05:22.960> in<00:05:23.380> the

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
having your overhead microphones in the

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.250 
having your overhead microphones in the
correct<00:05:24.150> place<00:05:25.150> and<00:05:25.510> also<00:05:25.840> having<00:05:26.050> them

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
correct place and also having them

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.379 
correct place and also having them
exactly<00:05:26.770> the<00:05:26.979> same<00:05:27.070> distance<00:05:27.639> from<00:05:27.880> the

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
exactly the same distance from the

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.000 
exactly the same distance from the
center<00:05:28.840> your<00:05:29.440> snow

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
center your snow

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.250 
center your snow
otherwise<00:05:30.430> you<00:05:30.580> get<00:05:30.700> all<00:05:30.910> sorts<00:05:31.479> of<00:05:31.539> different

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
otherwise you get all sorts of different

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.670 
otherwise you get all sorts of different
phases

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
phases

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.189 
phases
and<00:05:34.100> that's<00:05:34.280> pretty<00:05:34.430> much<00:05:34.639> it<00:05:34.880> so<00:05:35.060> here<00:05:36.020> I've
