00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.959
 mario yepes how to comment on this 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:15.240
 defeat against the certain stone comes 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.910
 to say sin for a whole series of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.490
 reasons the record that stops you 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.150
 victories but also a stadium full of many 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.670
 children 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.199
 in short, a pity sin, yes, that I believe 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.650
 that the game did it 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.140
 the atanta has tried especially in the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.780
 first time the first first half hour I have 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.280
 made the game he had to do and us 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.159
 we managed to unlock it and then 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.780
 we suffered the blow and goal of the 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:47.790
 sassuolo 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.619
 well i am also happy with that 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.049
 who made these last matches to 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.879
 team because as long as we can't six 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:55.860
 consecutive victories we do not forget 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.479
 surely this is certainly not the case 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.960
 you can forget anyone can 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.760
 forget i think people who that 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.189
 the one that cares about us so much doesn't 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.820
 forget it and this was seen after later 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.590
 the game today is the atanta in his 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.840
 the best moment is scored when then 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.940
 look also in the second half of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.240
 react to find this balance 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.860
 immediately doubled 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.190
 and so is football, perhaps in others 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.190
 occasions we have won so it is a 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.770
 shame because today surely yes though 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.140
 they had unlocked the game before us and 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.700
 it went from another way but the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.970
 football is like that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.800
 today we have lost and must get up 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.350
 quickly because there is a Saturday 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.880
 difficult game and important game 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.409
 difficult to get back up 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.940
 immediately also because the atanta remains 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.540
 still in the running for something 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.020
 important 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.320
 certainly not us as we are used to 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.500
 try to play it like we did 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.600
 these last period we will have 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.549
 to win where we go now up 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.770
 in the end how the team is trying to 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.200
 do who is trying to keep or 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.200
 maybe we can do something we see
