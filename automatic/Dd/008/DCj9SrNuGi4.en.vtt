them so I'm not using them but you
should<00:00:39.690> use<00:00:39.719> them<00:00:40.670> okay<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.000> go

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.230 

I'm<00:01:09.780> finding<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:11.119> prosthetic<00:01:12.119> on

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
I'm finding that with a prosthetic on

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.450 
I'm finding that with a prosthetic on
the<00:01:12.299> left<00:01:12.509> it's<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.020> little<00:01:13.229> bit<00:01:13.380> difficult<00:01:13.740> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the left it's a little bit difficult to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.280 
the left it's a little bit difficult to
swing<00:01:15.390> your<00:01:15.570> leg<00:01:16.490> from<00:01:17.490> your<00:01:17.640> bike<00:01:18.290> over

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
swing your leg from your bike over

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.469 
swing your leg from your bike over
because<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.369> rotate<00:01:20.700> your<00:01:20.820> foot<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
because you have to rotate your foot and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.969 
because you have to rotate your foot and
you<00:01:21.570> put<00:01:21.750> ends<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.020> kind<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> whack<00:01:22.560> so

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
you put ends up kind of out of whack so

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.499 
you put ends up kind of out of whack so
for<00:01:23.250> example<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.420> start<00:01:24.720> here<00:01:27.049> swing<00:01:28.049> over

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
for example if I start here swing over

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.419 
for example if I start here swing over
head<00:01:30.509> awkward<00:01:30.990> we're<00:01:31.590> leaning<00:01:31.860> back<00:01:32.100> into<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
head awkward we're leaning back into the

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.080 
head awkward we're leaning back into the
more<00:01:32.610> awkward

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.770 

so<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:37.659> thought<00:01:37.840> about<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:40.479> from<00:01:40.540> the<00:01:40.659> other

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
so I thought about going from the other

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.980 
so I thought about going from the other
side<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:44.640> balance<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.720> know<00:01:46.840> we're

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
side then the balance you know we're

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.260 
side then the balance you know we're
really<00:01:47.170> easy<00:01:47.820> swing<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:48.909> back<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.210> really

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
really easy swing you back is really

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.010 
really easy swing you back is really
easy<00:01:49.509> too

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
easy too

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.520 
easy too
the<00:01:50.829> only<00:01:50.950> problem<00:01:51.369> with<00:01:51.460> mounting<00:01:52.060> your<00:01:52.689> bike

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
the only problem with mounting your bike

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.230 
the only problem with mounting your bike
from<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:53.920> opposite<00:01:54.280> side<00:01:54.460> as<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.670> kickstand<00:01:55.210> is

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
from the opposite side as a kickstand is

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.070 
from the opposite side as a kickstand is
on<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.630> side<00:01:57.420> that's<00:01:58.420> pretty<00:01:58.689> easy<00:01:58.720> to<00:01:58.899> flip

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
on the side that's pretty easy to flip

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.109 
on the side that's pretty easy to flip
okay<00:01:59.439> well<00:02:00.340> you're<00:02:00.610> looking<00:02:00.840> okay<00:02:02.939> I'm<00:02:03.939> trying

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
okay well you're looking okay I'm trying

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:41.020 
okay well you're looking okay I'm trying
to<00:02:04.240> do<00:02:04.360> without<00:02:04.600> looking

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.310 

if<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.480> want<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.720> ride<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> bike<00:02:42.080> your

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
if you want to ride a bike your

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.080 
if you want to ride a bike your
prosthetic<00:02:42.770> promptly<00:02:43.220> has<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.520> be<00:02:43.580> cut<00:02:43.820> pretty

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
prosthetic promptly has to be cut pretty

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.560 
prosthetic promptly has to be cut pretty
low<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.660> back<00:02:44.960> because<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.760> bend<00:02:47.150> your<00:02:47.390> knee

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
low and back because you bend your knee

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.600 
low and back because you bend your knee
pretty<00:02:47.870> high<00:02:48.140> at<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.650> top<00:02:48.860> of<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.310> pedal

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
pretty high at the top of the pedal

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.210 
pretty high at the top of the pedal
stroke<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:50.840> if<00:02:51.080> your<00:02:51.290> prosthetic<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:51.950> cut

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
stroke and so if your prosthetic is cut

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.100 
stroke and so if your prosthetic is cut
too<00:02:52.400> high<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:53.360> won't<00:02:53.450> be<00:02:53.600> able<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.840> bend<00:02:53.990> your

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110

too high you won't be able to bend your
knee<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:54.470> this<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:55.100> it'll<00:02:56.030> make<00:02:56.120> riding<00:02:56.360> a

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
knee like this and it'll make riding a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.300 
knee like this and it'll make riding a
bike<00:02:56.660> uncomfortable<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:57.800> if<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.010> have<00:02:58.130> that

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310

I'm finding that riding a bike with an
application<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.299> actually<00:03:43.450> pretty<00:03:43.959> easy<00:03:44.170> it's

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:44.469 
application is actually pretty easy it's

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.819 
application is actually pretty easy it's
easier<00:03:44.769> than<00:03:44.920> I<00:03:45.010> thought<00:03:45.189> I<00:03:46.469> was<00:03:47.469> afraid<00:03:47.680> that

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
easier than I thought I was afraid that

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.800 
easier than I thought I was afraid that
it<00:03:48.340> would<00:03:48.459> be<00:03:48.609> hard<00:03:48.819> to<00:03:49.090> keep<00:03:49.269> my<00:03:49.420> foot<00:03:49.599> on<00:03:49.659> the

pedal but actually that turns out to be
pretty<00:03:51.819> darn<00:03:51.969> easy<00:03:52.090> it's<00:03:52.749> no<00:03:53.019> big<00:03:53.170> deal<00:03:53.200> my

foot did kind of fall off pedal a couple
of<00:03:55.689> times<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:56.549> think<00:03:57.549> if<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:57.790> was<00:03:57.939> into

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
of times I think if I was into

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
competitive bicycling I would probably

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.770 
competitive bicycling I would probably
want<00:04:00.459> a<00:04:00.670> foot<00:04:00.909> that<00:04:01.030> clipped<00:04:01.269> into<00:04:01.420> my<00:04:01.599> bike

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
want a foot that clipped into my bike

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.199 
want a foot that clipped into my bike

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
but since I just do it as a hobby

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.330 
but since I just do it as a hobby
occasionally<00:04:04.959> probably<00:04:05.739> will<00:04:05.859> bother<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.159> do

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
occasionally probably will bother to do
