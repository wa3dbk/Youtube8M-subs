that<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.470> is

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that that is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.400 
that that is
I<00:02:13.890> we<00:02:14.730> have<00:02:15.000> put<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.420> stretches<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.110> all<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
I we have put the stretches in all the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.100 
I we have put the stretches in all the
dressage<00:02:16.560> test<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.370> many<00:02:17.550> people<00:02:17.820> have<00:02:18.110> they

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
dressage test so many people have they

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.750 
dressage test so many people have they
don't<00:02:19.260> know<00:02:19.500> how<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.770> do<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.310> because<00:02:20.490> their

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
don't know how to do it because their

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.010 
don't know how to do it because their
horses<00:02:20.970> aren't<00:02:21.210> going<00:02:21.510> right<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.840> when<00:02:21.930> they

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
horses aren't going right so when they

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.740 
horses aren't going right so when they
try<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.230> stretch<00:02:22.590> nothing<00:02:23.100> happens<00:02:23.580> at<00:02:24.450> best

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
try the stretch nothing happens at best

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.480 
try the stretch nothing happens at best
their<00:02:24.900> noses<00:02:25.110> kind<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.470> poke<00:02:25.650> out<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
their noses kind of poke out the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.430 
their noses kind of poke out the
stretches<00:02:27.030> were<00:02:27.150> put<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.540> there<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.900> prove<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
stretches were put in there to prove the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.260 
stretches were put in there to prove the
correct<00:02:28.770> foundation<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.760> horses<00:02:30.150> that's

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
correct foundation of the horses that's

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.670 
correct foundation of the horses that's
why<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:30.900> important<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.350> be<00:02:31.470> able<00:02:31.500> to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
why it's so important to be able to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.240 
why it's so important to be able to
stretch<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.300> for<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.420> other<00:02:33.630> reason<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.800> I

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
stretch and for the other reason that I

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.830 
stretch and for the other reason that I
tell<00:02:35.640> all<00:02:35.820> beginners<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.390> know<00:02:36.540> when<00:02:36.720> you're

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
tell all beginners you know when you're

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.450 
tell all beginners you know when you're
learning<00:02:37.200> how<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.350> do<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.190> everybody

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
learning how to do this and everybody

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.220 
learning how to do this and everybody
even<00:02:38.820> an<00:02:38.910> advanced<00:02:39.270> level<00:02:39.480> person<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.050> going

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
even an advanced level person is going

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.110 
even an advanced level person is going
to<00:02:40.290> make<00:02:40.500> mistakes<00:02:40.709> sometimes<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
to make mistakes sometimes and the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.820 
to make mistakes sometimes and the
beauty<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.660> stretch<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.350> horse<00:02:43.650> will

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
beauty of the stretch is the horse will

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.010 
beauty of the stretch is the horse will
forgive<00:02:44.280> your<00:02:44.580> mistakes<00:02:45.150> if<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.570> come<00:02:45.840> back

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
forgive your mistakes if you come back

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.020 
forgive your mistakes if you come back
to<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> stretch<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.890> allow<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.340> relax<00:02:47.730> again

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
to a stretch and allow it to relax again

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.630 
to a stretch and allow it to relax again
so<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.810> kind<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.050> like<00:02:49.200> wipes<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.800> slate<00:02:50.010> clean

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
so it kind of like wipes the slate clean

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.699 
so it kind of like wipes the slate clean
with<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.060> horse<00:02:51.270> as<00:02:51.810> opposed<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.290> people<00:02:52.620> that

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
with the horse as opposed to people that

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.140 
with the horse as opposed to people that
you<00:02:52.830> see<00:02:53.040> who<00:02:53.160> just<00:02:53.370> fight<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.610> fight<00:02:53.970> and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
you see who just fight and fight and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.640 
you see who just fight and fight and
fight<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.510> fight<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.750> they<00:02:54.900> never<00:02:55.050> give<00:02:55.500> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
fight and fight and they never give the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.330 
fight and fight and they never give the
horse<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.920> break

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
horse a break

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.190 
horse a break
so<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:57.090> certainly<00:02:57.330> normal<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.020> you're

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
so it's certainly normal that you're

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.380 
so it's certainly normal that you're
gonna<00:02:58.350> make<00:02:58.709> some<00:02:59.070> mistakes<00:02:59.610> as<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> beginning

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
gonna make some mistakes as a beginning

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.720 
gonna make some mistakes as a beginning
rider<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.080> even<00:03:01.590> as<00:03:01.709> an<00:03:01.830> advanced<00:03:02.160> rider<00:03:02.489> you

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
rider and even as an advanced rider you

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.220 
rider and even as an advanced rider you
know<00:03:02.760> something<00:03:03.239> may<00:03:03.360> happen<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:03.989> pop

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230
