00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:07.567
This video is about an exercise called the Upright Row.

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:15.833
Many people classify this exercise as dangerous, which is correct if you're 
 using a narrow grip and pull the bar too high.

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:19.633
This puts the shoulder into a very weak position

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:24.567
and can lead to joint pain, injury and the likes.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.133
Basically speaking, the Upright Row can be a valuable exercise if you're 
 using the right grip, correct exercise form and the appropriate weight.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:36.600
It works the back obviously, the biceps, 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.167
the forearms (brachioradialis), the lateral deltoids and many more.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.167
Of course you can do this exercise with a regular barbell,

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:54.733
but personally speaking, I like to use an EZ 
 curl bar, because it's easier on the wrists.

00:00:56.867 --> 00:01:02.133
As I mentioned before: The grip is very important. 
 Use a very wide grip if you can.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:06.567
Furthermore don't pull the bar as high as you can.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:12.800
It's better to pull it until it's at the level of your lower 
 or mid chest. This is more than enough range of motion.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.000
By doing this the exercise stays safe and effective.

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:20.100
Upright Row: Form

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.033
There isn't much to say about the exercise form, 
 except the grip issues I've already mentioned.

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:29.300
Also keep the shoulders in a natural position.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.767
Chest up. Then just pull the bar up.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.633
Don't pull it to your face, your nose or something 
 like that. That's bad for  the shoulders.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:44.700
Pull it to the lower part or the middle of your chest.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.600
Then lower the bar again.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.370
Let me demonstrate a grip, which would be too close.

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:58.470
You see this a lot in the gym or in 
 general when people don't do this exercise carefully.

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:03.070
Some people use this grip and pull the bar way too high.

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:07.670
You'll notice during the execution of this exercise form

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:12.330
that the shoulder feels very weak in this position 
 and thus simply can't be good for them.

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:15.430
On the other hand: This is how a wide grip can look like.

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:20.700
If you use this grip and don't pull as 
 high you can feel the difference immediately.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.500
That's the way it should be.

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:29.330
Minimize the risk of injury:
Wide Grip
Pull only to 
 mid chest at max
Use EZ curl bar

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:36.300
Everyone who is looking for a compound exercise that 
 targets the side delts should do this exercise.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.500
Maybe you don't want to use isolation exercises.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.670
So you might be using a regular Press for the front part

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:48.230
some rowing for the rear delts

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:52.570
and finally the Upright Row for the side delts, which is an excellent choice.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.170
Moreover this exercise is top-notch for the Trapezius muscle - the traps.

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:05.930
It's an excellent compound exercise for the whole upper back so to say.

00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:11.430
It can definitely be a valuable asset to everyone's back workout.

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:15.570
That's all for now. Thanks for watching and until next time!

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:20.030
It's your responsibility to evaluate this video and to 
 consult a doctor before choosing a workout program.
