you've got a drink and you're a cup of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.380 
you've got a drink and you're a cup of
tea<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.470> glass<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.159> wine<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.729> you're<00:01:06.119> trying<00:01:06.360> to

tea a glass of wine and you're trying to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.600 
tea a glass of wine and you're trying to
set<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> table<00:01:07.200> beside<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.950> if<00:01:08.130> it's

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
set it on the table beside you if it's

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.789 
set it on the table beside you if it's
at<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.090> same<00:01:09.330> height<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:10.080> below<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.590> arm

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
at the same height or just below the arm

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.520 
at the same height or just below the arm
it<00:01:11.070> will<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.400> very<00:01:11.700> easy<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.540> pick<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
it will be very easy to pick it up and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.950 
it will be very easy to pick it up and
put<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.890> down<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.909> higher<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.689> run<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
put it down if it's higher you run the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.570 
put it down if it's higher you run the
risk<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.290> dumping<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:16.830> over<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> ground

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
risk of dumping it all over the ground

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.420 
risk of dumping it all over the ground
that's<00:01:18.270> not<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> very<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:18.930> idea<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.650> well

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that's not a very good idea is it well

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.179 
that's not a very good idea is it well
it<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:20.880> look<00:01:21.540> good<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.229> put<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.710> table

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
it can look good if you put a table

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.850 
it can look good if you put a table
beside<00:01:23.729> your<00:01:24.000> sofa<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.869> taller<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
beside your sofa that is taller and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.830 
beside your sofa that is taller and
narrower<00:01:25.970> but<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> bit<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.750> an

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
narrower but this is a bit of an

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.230 
narrower but this is a bit of an
advanced<00:01:28.200> maneuver<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.250> requires<00:01:29.729> having

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
advanced maneuver and it requires having

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.140 
advanced maneuver and it requires having
the<00:01:30.509> right<00:01:30.780> light<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.619> would<00:01:31.890> say<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.610> probably

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the right light I would say it probably

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.240 
the right light I would say it probably
won't<00:01:33.479> work<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:34.020> put<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> traditional<00:01:34.890> lamp

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
won't work to put a traditional lamp

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.200 
won't work to put a traditional lamp
