this does not magically curl your hair
but<00:02:14.780> my<00:02:14.840> hair<00:02:14.959> is<00:02:15.290> very<00:02:15.379> thick<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.040> curly<00:02:16.280> and

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.729 
but my hair is very thick and curly and
wavy<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:17.480> just<00:02:17.660> helps<00:02:17.780> eliminate<00:02:18.230> frizz

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739
