00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.110
 ah 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.539
 the poor quality of public transport 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.610
 in temuco is one of the great tasks 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.320
 pending from the authorities and 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.240
 social organizations that must 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.250
 solve among other problems the 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.009
 reckless driving congestion 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.330
 vehicular and environmental pollution 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.250
 problems that must be corrected for 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.609
 create a sustainable and friendly city 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.929
 for its inhabitants toxic gases 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.730
 pollution and machines in poor condition 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.589
 that also endanger the 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.629
 user safety is that I believe 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.250
 which is an element to consider but 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.530
 unfortunately here in the authorities 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.449
 public transport services and 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.089
 regional government authorities have not 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.129
 driven a system that modernizes the 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.170
 public transport in our region 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.720
 from the ministerial regional secretary 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.089
 transport and telecommunications 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.280
 implements a renewal program 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.290
 urban buses thanks to the subsidy 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.960
 from the Chilean state I've made that bookstore 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.760
 partly this problematic we 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.260
 We are delivering bonds to 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.390
 entrepreneurs to incentivize this 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.490
 replacement of machines that brings us 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.740
 coupled multiple benefits within 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.340
 of which is for example to increase 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.539
 the transportation security levels 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.759
 pollution or emission that 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.859
 produce these types of buses you 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.469
 We also give the driver a 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.780

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.240
