take the neck without fail my job
essentially<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.660> make<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.590> fit<00:00:35.100> perfectly

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
essentially is to make it fit perfectly

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.639 
essentially is to make it fit perfectly
together<00:00:35.840> so<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.850> when<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.940> press<00:00:39.180> them<00:00:39.300> in

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
together so that when you press them in

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.470 
together so that when you press them in
there<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.950> tight<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.460> can't<00:00:41.760> lift<00:00:42.000> up<00:00:42.239> on

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
there so tight that you can't lift up on

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.680 
there so tight that you can't lift up on
the<00:00:42.510> back<00:00:42.780> or<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.290> front<00:00:44.360> now<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.660> that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the back or in the front now what that

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.600 
the back or in the front now what that
means<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.620> take<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> measurement<00:00:47.280> on

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
means is I have to take a measurement on

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.170 
means is I have to take a measurement on
my<00:00:48.000> center<00:00:48.329> line<00:00:49.460> with<00:00:50.460> my<00:00:50.579> left<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.969> right

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
my center line with my left and right

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.870 
my center line with my left and right
and<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:52.170> information<00:00:52.860> height

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
and my information height

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.580 
and my information height
so<00:00:54.480> that's<00:00:54.630> three<00:00:54.870> different<00:00:55.170> measurements

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
so that's three different measurements

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.990 
so that's three different measurements
and<00:00:55.740> three<00:00:55.950> different<00:00:56.070> accesses<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.700> you

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and three different accesses that you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.020 
and three different accesses that you
have<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.650> have<00:00:58.650> to<00:00:58.800> worry<00:00:59.010> about<00:00:59.130> and<00:00:59.730> if<00:00:59.880> one

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
have to have to worry about and if one

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790 
have to have to worry about and if one
of<00:01:00.150> those<00:01:00.240> are<00:01:00.450> off<00:01:00.600> than<00:01:00.990> the<00:01:01.290> whole<00:01:01.470> things

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
of those are off than the whole things

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.290 
of those are off than the whole things
off<00:01:02.960> once<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.410> set<00:01:05.210> everything<00:01:06.210> is
