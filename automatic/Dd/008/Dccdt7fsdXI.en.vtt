time now but i think the pc mods is
what's<00:03:06.960> going<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.200> make<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:08.400> game<00:03:08.670> was<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> lot

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
what's going to make the game was a lot

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.180 
what's going to make the game was a lot
interesting<00:03:09.570> again<00:03:10.410> even<00:03:10.770> though<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.010> game's

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
interesting again even though the game's

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.100 
interesting again even though the game's
been<00:03:11.430> out<00:03:11.580> for<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:12.209> year<00:03:12.300> or<00:03:12.480> whatever<00:03:12.930> it's

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
been out for a year or whatever it's

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.350 
been out for a year or whatever it's
been<00:03:13.320> and<00:03:13.610> that's<00:03:14.610> what's<00:03:14.880> going<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.060> make<00:03:15.180> the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
been and that's what's going to make the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.340 
been and that's what's going to make the
difference<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.840> then<00:03:15.989> we<00:03:16.080> also<00:03:16.230> have

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
difference and then we also have

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.350 
difference and then we also have
daylight<00:03:16.920> but<00:03:17.280> that's<00:03:17.459> only<00:03:17.610> sort<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.000> single

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
daylight but that's only sort of single

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.500 
daylight but that's only sort of single
player<00:03:18.480> but<00:03:18.900> yet<00:03:19.230> for<00:03:19.470> zombies<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:21.209> I'm<00:03:21.300> really

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510

quality<00:05:43.300> that's<00:05:43.780> usually<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.650> case<00:05:44.770> if

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
quality that's usually the case if

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.950

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
usually you don't focus on it too much

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.060 
usually you don't focus on it too much
and<00:05:48.670> it<00:05:48.940> turns<00:05:49.150> out<00:05:49.330> to<00:05:49.480> be<00:05:49.510> shit<00:05:49.900> so<00:05:50.740> let<00:05:51.040> us
