00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
it two thousand eleven minus MB that's

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.590

do this and while you're in the math

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.930 
do this and while you're in the math
that's<00:02:10.009> how<00:02:10.220> would<00:02:10.430> be<00:02:10.520> able<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.729> get<00:02:10.820> like

I'm just I just get like random points

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.750 
I'm just I just get like random points
of<00:02:14.600> randomness<00:02:14.990> this<00:02:15.440> okay<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:15.890> i'm<00:02:16.520> really

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
of randomness this okay so i'm really

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.640 
of randomness this okay so i'm really
going<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.060> especially<00:02:17.330> really<00:02:17.810> way<00:02:17.960> said<00:02:18.350> loan

actually this probably be the one thing
that<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.680> probably<00:04:10.010> would<00:04:10.430> confess<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.880> I

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940
