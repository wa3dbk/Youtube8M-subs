everybody<00:00:42.350> who<00:00:42.559> owns<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:43.100> car<00:00:43.340> like<00:00:43.519> this<00:00:43.760> and

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
everybody who owns the car like this and

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.619 
everybody who owns the car like this and
then<00:00:44.719> who<00:00:45.469> would<00:00:45.500> be<00:00:46.010> considering<00:00:46.820> selling<00:00:47.179> it

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
then who would be considering selling it

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.750 
then who would be considering selling it
since<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.410> ones<00:00:48.590> coming<00:00:48.859> off<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.309> markets

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
since the ones coming off the markets

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.220 
since the ones coming off the markets
they<00:00:49.879> are<00:00:49.910> really<00:00:50.239> not<00:00:50.359> in<00:00:50.510> good<00:00:50.690> shape<00:00:50.960> and

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
they are really not in good shape and

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.740 
they are really not in good shape and
this<00:00:51.469> one<00:00:51.679> is<00:00:52.399> in<00:00:52.460> very<00:00:52.879> good<00:00:53.120> shape<00:00:53.179> as<00:00:53.600> you

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
this one is in very good shape as you

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.419 
this one is in very good shape as you
can<00:00:53.960> see<00:00:54.199> it<00:00:55.129> was<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.399> good<00:00:56.359> start<00:00:56.890> for<00:00:57.890> more

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
can see it was a good start for more

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:02.200 
can see it was a good start for more
than<00:00:58.609> enough<00:00:58.940> time<00:00:59.769> in<00:01:00.769> the<00:01:01.010> years<00:01:01.280> from<00:01:01.460> 1999

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
than enough time in the years from 1999

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.649 
than enough time in the years from 1999
to<00:01:02.260> 2003<00:01:03.260> professionally<00:01:04.160> I<00:01:04.400> did<00:01:05.150> send<00:01:05.420> a

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
to 2003 professionally I did send a

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.870 
to 2003 professionally I did send a
couple<00:01:05.930> of<00:01:06.140> improvements<00:01:06.800> after<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:07.190> got<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:07.610> to

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
couple of improvements after I got it to

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.060 
couple of improvements after I got it to
make<00:01:07.909> it<00:01:08.180> really<00:01:08.210> reliable<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.590> since<00:01:09.890> then

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
make it really reliable and since then

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.570 
make it really reliable and since then
with<00:01:10.310> over<00:01:10.790> six<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.510> half<00:01:11.570> thousand<00:01:12.080> miles

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
with over six and a half thousand miles

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.370

so what did you believe what have you
done<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.770> actually<00:01:16.120> make<00:01:17.120> it<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.360> way<00:01:17.510> it<00:01:18.230> was

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
done to actually make it the way it was

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.720 
done to actually make it the way it was
did<00:01:18.800> it<00:01:18.920> in<00:01:19.070> fire<00:01:19.250> like<00:01:19.490> this<00:01:19.640> I<00:01:19.990> bought<00:01:20.990> it

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730
