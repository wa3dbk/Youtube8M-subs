console the PlayStation let's see how
the<00:00:07.230> place<00:00:07.589> has<00:00:07.799> been<00:00:07.830> compared<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.370> its

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
the place has been compared to its

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.330 
the place has been compared to its
competitor<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.360> Nintendo<00:00:09.780> 64<00:00:10.349> one<00:00:11.130> great

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
competitor the Nintendo 64 one great

competitor the Nintendo 64 one great
thing<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.610> have<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.820> say<00:00:11.849> about<00:00:12.059> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
thing I have to say about the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.060 
thing I have to say about the
PlayStation<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.469> uses<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.830> power

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
PlayStation is that it uses a power

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.070 
PlayStation is that it uses a power
cable<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.580> looks<00:00:14.759> like<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.179> not<00:00:15.780> only<00:00:15.900> is

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
cable that looks like this not only is

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.470 
cable that looks like this not only is
it<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.289> hundred<00:00:16.529> percent<00:00:16.710> box<00:00:17.369> free<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:18.269> if<00:00:18.359> you

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
it a hundred percent box free but if you

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.729 
it a hundred percent box free but if you
look<00:00:18.630> at<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> edge<00:00:18.989> of<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.319> thing

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:19.739 
look at the edge of this thing

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.919 
look at the edge of this thing
it's<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.099> connector<00:00:20.489> that's<00:00:20.609> not<00:00:20.849> very<00:00:21.060> rare<00:00:21.390> so

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:21.929 
it's a connector that's not very rare so

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.719 
it's a connector that's not very rare so
if<00:00:22.019> you<00:00:22.140> lose<00:00:22.319> it<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.859> won't<00:00:23.009> be<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.369> hard<00:00:23.399> to

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:23.729 
if you lose it it won't be that hard to

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:24.620 
if you lose it it won't be that hard to
find<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.060> new<00:00:24.239> one

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
find a new one

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.439 
find a new one
but<00:00:24.929> worst<00:00:25.169> AC<00:00:25.470> adapter<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.759> probably<00:00:27.239> built

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
but worst AC adapter it's probably built

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.899 
but worst AC adapter it's probably built
into<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.809> conflict<00:00:28.169> cell<00:00:28.499> that's<00:00:28.979> good<00:00:29.309> the

into the conflict cell that's good the
Nintendo<00:00:30.269> 64<00:00:30.779> used<00:00:30.989> cartridges<00:00:31.589> but<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:31.889 
Nintendo 64 used cartridges but the

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:34.520 
Nintendo 64 used cartridges but the
PlayStation<00:00:32.520> uses<00:00:32.850> CDs<00:00:33.329> while<00:00:33.929> they<00:00:34.170> totally

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
universe but if you see my video about

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.440 
universe but if you see my video about
it<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.829> already<00:01:13.979> know<00:01:14.310> how<00:01:14.490> awful<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.180> game

it you already know how awful this game
is<00:01:15.630> look<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> back<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:18.780> describes<00:01:19.560> what

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
is look at the back that describes what

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.870 
is look at the back that describes what
this<00:01:20.250> game<00:01:20.610> is

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
this game is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.130 
this game is
and<00:01:21.630> also<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.170> game<00:01:23.570> magical<00:01:24.570> tetris

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and also this game magical tetris

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.080 
and also this game magical tetris
challenge<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.219> sniffing<00:01:26.610> version<00:01:27.000> of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
challenge and this sniffing version of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.590 
challenge and this sniffing version of
tetris<00:01:27.590> but<00:01:28.590> guess<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.820> game<00:01:30.090> doesn't

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
tetris but guess what the game doesn't

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.340 
tetris but guess what the game doesn't
work<00:01:30.689> anymore

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
work anymore

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.429 
work anymore
the<00:01:31.829> disc<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> way<00:01:32.670> over<00:01:33.180> scratch<00:01:33.509> but

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
the disc is the way over scratch but

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.410 
the disc is the way over scratch but
shorter<00:01:34.920> exist<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.340> lot<00:01:35.549> better<00:01:35.820> PlayStation

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
shorter exist a lot better PlayStation

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.330 
shorter exist a lot better PlayStation
games<00:01:36.630> out<00:01:36.840> there<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.409> crash<00:01:37.710> games<00:01:38.039> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
games out there like the crash games and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.670 
games out there like the crash games and
Rayman<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.270> let's<00:01:39.689> talk<00:01:39.840> about<00:01:39.899> controllers

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
Rayman now let's talk about controllers

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920 
Rayman now let's talk about controllers
because<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.399> an<00:01:41.520> incredibly<00:01:42.180> long<00:01:42.479> story

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
because it's an incredibly long story

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.050 
because it's an incredibly long story
the<00:01:43.649> first<00:01:43.920> blessing<00:01:44.219> controller<00:01:44.700> looked

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
the first blessing controller looked

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.569 
the first blessing controller looked
like<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.420> pretty<00:01:46.229> basic<00:01:46.469> but<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.340> had<00:01:47.549> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
like this pretty basic but it had a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.910 
like this pretty basic but it had a
modern<00:01:48.030> grip<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.420> its<00:01:48.539> time<00:01:48.780> later<00:01:49.380> when<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
modern grip for its time later when the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.190 
modern grip for its time later when the
intensity<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.729> an<00:01:50.850> analogue<00:01:51.420> thumbstick<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
intensity for an analogue thumbstick and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.319
