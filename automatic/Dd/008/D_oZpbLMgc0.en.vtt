00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.240 

we've<00:01:56.939> got<00:01:57.090> three<00:01:57.420> years<00:01:57.770> all<00:01:58.770> three<00:01:59.070> years

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
we've got three years all three years

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.230 
we've got three years all three years
are<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.840> then<00:02:01.109> all<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.409> way<00:02:01.469> down<00:02:02.030> in<00:02:03.030> one

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
are up and then all the way down in one

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.449 
are up and then all the way down in one
pass<00:02:03.509> first<00:02:04.170> put<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.280> back<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.549> neutral

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:44.530 

drop<00:02:11.000> one<00:02:11.299> hand<00:02:11.569> I'm<00:02:12.079> trying<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.439> camera

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.610 

all<00:02:45.540> right<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:47.690> think<00:02:48.690> it's<00:02:49.140> just<00:02:49.230> about<00:02:49.440> out<00:02:49.590> of

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
all right I think it's just about out of

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.670 
all right I think it's just about out of
gas<00:02:49.739> actually<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:52.700> petcock<00:02:54.410> petcock<00:02:55.410> we<00:02:55.530> put

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
gas actually the petcock petcock we put

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.199 
gas actually the petcock petcock we put
in<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.069> little<00:02:56.310> short<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.790> came<00:02:56.940> out<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.150> a

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
in it is a little short it came out of a

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.720 
in it is a little short it came out of a
Yamaha<00:02:57.569> Badger<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.769> was<00:02:58.860> short<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.700> uh

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
Yamaha Badger and it was short so the uh

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.830 
Yamaha Badger and it was short so the uh
you<00:03:00.690> got<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.930> on<00:03:01.019> regular<00:03:01.410> or<00:03:02.129> one<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:03.330> it's<00:03:03.720> in

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
you got it on regular or one and it's in

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.720 
you got it on regular or one and it's in
the<00:03:03.900> way<00:03:04.019> we<00:03:04.170> can't<00:03:04.349> get<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.560> on<00:03:04.590> flip<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.670> all

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
the way we can't get it on flip it all

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.020 
the way we can't get it on flip it all
the<00:03:05.790> way<00:03:05.849> around<00:03:05.940> for<00:03:06.180> reserve<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:08.030> original

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
the way around for reserve the original

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.440 
the way around for reserve the original
petcock<00:03:09.390> hangs<00:03:09.810> down<00:03:10.019> more<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.239> flip

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
petcock hangs down more so you can flip

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.449 
petcock hangs down more so you can flip
the<00:03:12.599> switch<00:03:12.629> around<00:03:12.989> but<00:03:13.920> we<00:03:14.010> actually<00:03:14.130> got

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
the switch around but we actually got

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.860 
the switch around but we actually got
the<00:03:14.579> new<00:03:14.670> one<00:03:14.819> coming<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.540> mail

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870

last<00:03:20.640> week<00:03:21.110> we<00:03:22.110> got<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.980> got<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.220> top<00:03:23.370> into

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
last week we got you got the top into

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.839 
last week we got you got the top into
one<00:03:24.739> he<00:03:25.739> started<00:03:26.099> it<00:03:26.250> but<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.430> petcock<00:03:26.670> was

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
one he started it but the petcock was

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:27.830 
one he started it but the petcock was
leaking<00:03:27.060> everywhere<00:03:27.150> so<00:03:27.450> we<00:03:27.540> really<00:03:27.720> haven't

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
leaking everywhere so we really haven't

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.690 
leaking everywhere so we really haven't
messed<00:03:28.019> with<00:03:28.110> this<00:03:28.260> since<00:03:28.440> then<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.280> was

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
messed with this since then so that was

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.240 
messed with this since then so that was
first<00:03:30.569> one<00:03:31.049> of<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.230> first<00:03:31.440> rods<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.980> make<00:03:32.129> sure

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
first one of the first rods to make sure

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.130 
first one of the first rods to make sure
that<00:03:32.340> shifted<00:03:32.700> right<00:03:32.930> everything<00:03:33.930> after

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
that shifted right everything after

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.520 
that shifted right everything after
