00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.480
 hello welcome to a new way 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.820
 cooperative that we will dedicate to 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.009
 joy word ascension we already talk to you 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.049
 a few weeks of the multiplayer beta that 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.669
 to which all the 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.770
 playstation 3 users that so 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.380
 they wanted but now we've had 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.480
 chance to test the campaign mode of 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.670
 new god of war good I do not marten 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.360
 Sanchez our current editor 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.900
 how long did you travel to the angels 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.940
 with sony to throw him throw his hands 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.310
 over the first 30 minutes of 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.560
 joy game gameplay good 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.380
 ascension we are seeing it here so 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.960
 start well, tell us this is a 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.020
 engine not basically but essentially 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.150
 is a god of war that, as is logical with 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.470
 the years development because it includes improvements 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.710
 includes the multiplayer you've 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.489
 mentioned but it's humor you know a hack 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:01.120
 and slash is a killing action game 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.540
 enemies so tender and with that touch 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.690
 of good kratos that we already know 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.480
 these combos and that way of brutality 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.640
 always associated with ghost of war let's go 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.130
 that people fans of the saga are leaving 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.480
 to feel like cassano but brutality 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.870
 it's a kratos keeps cutting heads still 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.020
 naming everything by cutting everything but this 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.810
 it's a radio they want to show a deal 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.850
 it's more human have insisted on it is 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.220
 a prequel to the previous entries 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.580
 of the trilogy the god of war iii 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.600
 and although it is just as gross there is no more 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.650
 that you can not see him but you look for that 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.630
 called his hand what happens is that 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.820
 us in the demo in the first 30 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.310
 minutes then it really is not the side 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.880
 We could not appreciate much, not no 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.680
 no no because it was a lot of action such for 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.900
 history moment either removing this 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.780
 start we see with fury not like 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.300
 fight against anger to free yourself more 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.760
 beyond that we did not see stories like 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.100
 such a lot of action awaits us 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.610
 action many final bosses do not wait 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.800
 great that the boarding changed the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.840
 dynamic not because as you go 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.490
 kill the typical enemies in variety 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.959
 smaller ones that kill them very fast 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.709
 others more complicated and then there was 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.600
 much 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.670
 I'm surprised the first 30 minutes the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.950
 of clashes fails against bosses 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.780
 endings not of different sizes but yes 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.810
 it's a kind of 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.020
 It is not a trunk that is not a very 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.660
 big then another giant that put the 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.640
 camera in the side scroll was moving away 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.670
 to see the giant monster 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.739
 and if not offer the variety and good this 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.470
 is the start of the game the 30 minutes 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.910
 first of a game are important 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.150
 especially to hook people that 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.300
 you thought spectacular those first 30 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.920
 minutes the games then on all that 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.800
 more surprised that I tell you that 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.390
 not the amount of big enemies to the 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.950
 you have to face it begins 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.600
 being a bit tutorial as 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.940
 always not as an initiate of the game 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.100
 then difficult as such this part 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.250
 it was not what we play in normal everything is 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.310
 well it was not difficult but above all I 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.530
 he drew attention 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.239
 the amount of salt big enemies of 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.310
 I have to fight and good views 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.920
 as always the truth and it's true 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.150
 that we are not surprised by anything 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.220
 all of us who have played ghost of 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.230
 work we did not feel at home 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.060
 this spectacularity of the images 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.200
 cinematographic the camera is changing 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.569
 it goes away it is getting closer 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.980
 depending on the action is a little what 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.489
 that we work with enemies not if 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.150
 the camera goes on its own in certain 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.830
 moments go away or come very close or 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.720
 he puts even that as I told you in 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.180
 a final boss in the side scroll that 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.620
 it looks very tiny crater and it's almost 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.180
 I'm here jumping side by side and the 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.590
 Big enemy is what you really see 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.030
 they are not the camera plays she also does not 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.510
 then the general feelings of 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.819
 these first 30 minutes of gameplay from 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.310
 ascension war are good no yes yes it is not 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.780
 very fun and the amount of combos and 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.630
 that you can use with swords 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.239
 of chaos you can pick up weapons from 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.260
 enemies not now and you can combine a 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.329
 sword for example that we 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.739
 we picked up with the swords of chaos and 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.560
 you make more spectacular combos 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.479
 and a new thing that is a bar that you 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.460
 appears on the screen below the right that 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.650
 it is filling up as you see 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.330
 seconds fighting well let's say it's going 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.009
 filling and every time it is more 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.259
 forceful we were not winning in 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:39.020
 spectacularity in these games is what 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:42.020
 that really does not matter, well, well, 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.550
 very good looking the elements already 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.910
 they put our teeth long because 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.280
 We really want to try the 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.680
 try the story of joy word 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.440
 ascension and nothing when we have more 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.210
 news when we play something else 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.800
 we will continue talking about him or you 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.380
 we will invite another day to go to the plate 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.370
 to tell us guard love up 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.699
