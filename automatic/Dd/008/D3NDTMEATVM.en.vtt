as far as I know there's a really slow
part<00:02:03.170> where<00:02:03.320> I<00:02:03.380> think<00:02:03.620> he<00:02:03.710> actually<00:02:03.860> plays

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
part where I think he actually plays

chords<00:02:04.820> but<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.090> cared<00:02:05.600> if<00:02:06.290> I<00:02:06.440> didn't<00:02:06.800> learn<00:02:06.950> it
