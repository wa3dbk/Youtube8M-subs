00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:18.289
 I'm playing at night that I'm not going 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.289

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:32.099

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 the first thing I wanted to commend the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.800
 elite of the room that is the chiba 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.610
 I think something like that is 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.750
 being very fair here are people who die 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.300
 and he's complaining about it and it's not going 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.070
 to face and also crying has had 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.870
 several times and he recognized me 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.440
 ask if I was still coming in 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:01.079
 radical then he recognized me 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:11.790
 he recovered to file the legal fine 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:17.700

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.770

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:29.020
