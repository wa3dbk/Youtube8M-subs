 [Music] 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.969
 today because TV attack invites you 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.279
 at the European house of the 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.510
 photography in paris to speak image 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.310
 and that's good because we're going 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.650
 introduce yourself with very important to 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.029
 bmw this has lived of course image 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.410
 This is the latest generation of 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:42.010
 bmw series 5 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:45.690
 [Music] 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.489
 the maquis henri dumas 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.690
 after leaving the European house 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.460
 from photography to paris 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.989
 we are here in a very corner 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.420
 particular of France since if I 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.159
 tell you rocks and rivers of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.570
 cascades of bridges we think everything from 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.219
 following the mountain of the Pyrenees or 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.539
 alps such well you 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.610
 wrong since we are in Normandy 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.649
 but beware in Norman Switzerland a 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.000
 very particular corner France and it's 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.770
 in this region that we decided 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.770
 so try the new bmw 5 series 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.590
 [Music] 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.420
 first phase this discovery syria 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.950
 without exception the aesthetic that breaks 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.640
 radically with the previous 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.350
 generation 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.470
 so this new series 5 is 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.240
 called f10 internally has nothing left to 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.440
 see with the previous who was born 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.119
 with the chris bangle style 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.470
 so we remember especially for his 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.700
 new generation one front 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.710
 much more dynamic 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.119
 we find the two big nostrils of the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.880
 mark of course that we had found 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.670
 identical on the z4 but also on 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.920
 the series 7 of the ribs at the level of 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.600
 hood that can also be seen on the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.340
 Restyled series 3 cases are observed 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.720
 this new series profile scenes on 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.700
 notice two elements first one 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.280
 long front cover followed by a passenger compartment 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.349
 very contoured then there is the care that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.520
 is brought to the sides of the vehicle with 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.920
 a very marked cash line that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.479
 brings a touch of sportiness and more 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.800
 Of course, we will also remember 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.179
 level of measurements that this 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.700
 new series 5 gran 10 compared to 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.720
 the previous 4 cm she measures 4 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.280
 meters 89 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.230
 it's roughly the same dimensions 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.390
 that a class e mercedes and you 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.810
 see that bmw has taken care of the least 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.480
 details 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.920
 even for the night look first 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.420
 detail the door handles turns on 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.420
 concerts watch 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.409
 so second thing is of course the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.109
 visual signature of this new 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.340
 series 5 with diode lights but 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:42.870
 of idiots who are placed circularly 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:44.579
 so it makes diode rings so 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.299
 here we are at the rear seats of the 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.700
 series 5 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.109
 no worries of habitability whatsoever 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.180
 at the level of knee space 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.950
 slightly smaller than class e 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.049
 still at the station of toine 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.639
 also no problem we will opt for a 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.919
 little flat has more than just 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.139
 two places because of the tunnel 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.549
 very important transmission and the small 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.719
 detail that kills it's an option of course 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.799
 it's the screens embedded in the 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:09.269
 front seats with what will know 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.799
 the small remote control in the front seats 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.019
 the series 5 we discover a board 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.209
 very close to the 7 series with 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.680
 especially this huge screen we will notice 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.120
 also the care that is given to the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.159
 quality at the choice of materials is the 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.780
 sign that the bmw assembly had been 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.709
 criticized on the previous generation and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.930
 to correct the shot 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.359
 this new series 5 with 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.159
 flattering materials in good assembly 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.550
 a clear will to beat 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.689
 audi in this area 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.689
 [Music] 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.760
 [Music] 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.230
 like the series 7 and the series 5 gt the 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.850
 series 5 with high content 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.590
 technological with multiple aids 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.150
 electronic as for example alert 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.970
 involuntary line crossing 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.250
 adaptive cruise control you 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.900
 also have an intersection camera 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.280
 but also the young Nazi system on 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.140
 will do a demonstration of some 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.610
 of these systems that really have us 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.440
 seduced beginning of our demonstration 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.640
 with the first system that has us 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.350
 seduced to know the camera 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.030
 of intersection look if we have no 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.550
 visibility on the left and very little on the right 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.500
 and we press this button here just 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.220
 close to eight gears watch the screen 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.690
 splits in two and so we see in 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.700
 left at right so we can 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.010
 engage quietly and small 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.540
 yellow lines corresponds to the nose of your 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.130
 car you pretty much see you are 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.650
 it's very convenient it brings a net 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.420
 security gain follows the discovery of 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.100
 the night series 5 the proverb says that 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.350
 at night all cats are gray but 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.750
 not at bmw since the German mark 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.850
 has set up is installed on the series 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.890
 c1 with his system navy annoys it will be read 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.270
 by what to look on the screen we see 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.230
 very good at night that's it we were going 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.030
 do it so it's good and it's very 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.010
 especially for pedestrians or 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.970
 for areas that are unlit we 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.970
 see it a little bit like in daylight 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:59.220
 [Applause] 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.220
 [Music] 

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:06.080
 so here at the wheel of new renovated 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.869
 dry series and more particularly from the 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.219
 5 38 and a known authorization and that 

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:12.139
 has evolved for the occasion since she 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:15.439
 is more powerful with 245 horsepower and 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.419
 has a couple of 548 meters at this 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.800
 engine perfectly matches the 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.839
 philosophy of the car since 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.969
 allows you to benefit from a recovery 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.649
 very straightforward acceleration and 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.099
 travel peacefully on long 

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:28.099
 distance 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.229
 it should be noted cut here to a box 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.509
 automatic 8-speed controlled 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.360
 pallets and that consumption of this 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.129
 automatic gearbox six engine 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.990
 online cylinders all 145 play 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.149
 since measure what during our 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.399
 test we raised our means to 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:50.870
 around 8 5 prices very 

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:52.909
 reasonable in terms of behavior and 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.229
 of nout we will retain two elements the 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.330
 first of all the silence of 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.649
 functioning this series 5 indeed 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.719
 cavity stabilize as is the case 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:01.849
 currently pending in caspar and a 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:02.539
 tunnel and bruno movement comes on 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:04.459
 slopes of the road 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.589
 it's very nice and very relaxing 

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:08.449
 verb according to distance the second is 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:09.110
 much more amazing that's it jt the 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.689
 series 5 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.149
 actually despite its size closely 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:16.819
 of five meters its mass of nearly 1800 

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:18.349
 kg the 5 series is very very dynamic and 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.209
 it really has nothing to do yet 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:22.189
 reverse classy which appears a lot 

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:24.139
 heavier and much more clumsy and 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:26.240
 much less pleasant to drive here 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.249
 bmw develops the meaning since its slogan 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.529
 the joy of driving is very 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:33.050
 nice of this series 5 tell you that at 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:34.020
 a roll virtually non - existent thanks to its 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.970
 suspensions 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.889
 nick that can be set following 80 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.849
 sports sport more 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.620
 normal comfort 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.940
 you also have and it's an option 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.449
 on it's our test model and the 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.349
 see yesterday director who has yet nothing 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:48.720
 of agility or we can say that this 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:51.060
 series 5 and the perfect marriage between the 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:57.960
 comfort and agility pronounce the 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:59.310
 reference is too much to say it all 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.620
 right away we cracked for this 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.030
 bmw series 5 both at the level of its lines 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.460
 far more successful than the previous one 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.690
 generation than by his behavior that 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.970
 according to us the perfect marriage between 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.280
 dynamism and comfort it becomes so 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.139
 the reference in the category and 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.479
 far ahead of class E enersys 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.550
 + not todd and an aging audi a6 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:19.500
 there is of course a strong content 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.180
 technology in this vehicle which 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.009
 is normal for a model this 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.960
 category we will remember unfortunately 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:26.490
 also that all this has a price and these 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.310
 Rates are very elitist since they 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:32.270
 are between 40 to 1500 euros and 80 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.270
 4800 euros
