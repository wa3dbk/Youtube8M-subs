00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.400
 I will not cry Not even suffer 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.400
 The flame of my soul burns for you 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:32.000
 But if it's to be so, whatever it is, let it be 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.400
 But if it's to be this way 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.300
 1, 2, 3, 4 Ah, pure and beautiful melody 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.400
 Delight of woman, my muse Cinderella That enchants and hallucinates 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.590
 In my mind comes the most obscene fantasies It makes me write poetry and poems 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.510
 From the front there is no one who can resist It is inevitable not to smile, to shout to the world 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.860
 So that you can hear me 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.539
 All the ways lead me to you. Without understanding, I began to ask why. 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.720
 Today I am a poet my princess If I have to write to you that way 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.250
 I do not care what you say, because it's always going to be 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.360
 so everything that begins has a means and ends 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.300
 But one thing I know In your arms I found myself, and I fell in love 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.729
 I will not cry Not even suffer 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.890
 The flame of my soul burns for you 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.890
 But if it's to be so, whatever it is, let it be 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:52.900
 But if it's supposed to be so hummmmm ... 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.659
 I remember the first time I saw you Millions of adjectives I attributed to you 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.810
 I thought about what to say to you. I created the most beautiful song I could give 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.780
 I do not need fireflies to see you smile You are my light you make me happy 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.890
 That our love is alive I'm sure Unfortunately this is the cold law of nature 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.220
 I want to grab you, kiss you, deliver a bouquet. Tell you how wonderful it was to meet you. 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.019
 I have never seen a woman so beautiful as jasmine. The sweetest perfume is the flower of my garden. 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.280
 Happiness exists I found in your arms At those moments listening to waters of marco 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.820
 Our soul danced our spirit ignited You were Juliet, and I was Romeo 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.600
 I will not cry Not even suffer 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.700
 The flame of my soul burns for you 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:53.500
 But if it's meant to be so whatever it is 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.300
 This story was a novel Not at all was just a bid 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.300
 I just wanted the chance to say How wonderful it was to meet you. 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.000
 This story was a novel Not at all was just a bid 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 I just wanted the chance to say How wonderful it was to meet you. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.700
 I will not cry Not even suffer 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.600
 The flame of my soul burns for you 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:31.600
 But if it's meant to be so whatever it is
