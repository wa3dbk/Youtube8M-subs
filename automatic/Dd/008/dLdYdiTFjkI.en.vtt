heads up the training unit and she's
noticed<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.100> big<00:01:50.460> difference<00:01:50.490> since<00:01:51.390> her<00:01:51.540> new

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
noticed a big difference since her new

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.270 
noticed a big difference since her new
patient<00:01:52.439> arrived

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
patient arrived

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.319 
patient arrived
it<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.790> 100%<00:01:55.159> changed<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.340> way<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.909> we<00:01:57.149> do

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
it is 100% changed the way that we do

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.469 
it is 100% changed the way that we do
training<00:01:57.960> before<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.920> had<00:01:59.130> sim<00:01:59.460> man<00:01:59.729> we<00:02:00.299> would

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
training before we had sim man we would

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.510 
training before we had sim man we would
just<00:02:00.689> tell<00:02:00.899> them<00:02:00.930> you're<00:02:01.350> hearing<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.920> rub<00:02:02.219> your

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
just tell them you're hearing a rub your

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.999 
just tell them you're hearing a rub your
hearing<00:02:03.000> friction<00:02:03.719> now<00:02:04.320> when<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> nurses

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
hearing friction now when the nurses

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.310 
hearing friction now when the nurses
listen<00:02:05.640> they<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:06.060> what<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.509> rubs<00:02:06.780> are<00:02:07.049> they

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
listen they know what the rubs are they

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.199 
listen they know what the rubs are they
know<00:02:07.530> what<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> friction<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.520> they<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.970> tell

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
know what the friction is they can tell

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.510 
know what the friction is they can tell
the<00:02:09.390> difference

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
the difference

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.130 
the difference
I<00:02:11.550> think<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.180> making<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.629> lot<00:02:12.810> of

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
I think it's making a lot of

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.530 
I think it's making a lot of
Prince<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.530> our<00:02:13.620> nurses<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.310> say<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.970> it's

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
Prince and our nurses I say that it's

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.900 
Prince and our nurses I say that it's
increasing<00:02:16.380> their<00:02:16.590> confidence<00:02:16.950> level<00:02:17.730> in

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
increasing their confidence level in

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.059 
increasing their confidence level in
their<00:02:18.390> training<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.410> not<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.860> medical

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
their training and it's not just medical

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.100 
their training and it's not just medical
procedures<00:02:20.790> they<00:02:21.030> rehearse<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.810> could<00:02:21.990> be

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
procedures they rehearse it could be

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.730 
procedures they rehearse it could be
caring<00:02:22.470> compassion<00:02:23.270> it<00:02:24.270> simply<00:02:24.900> can<00:02:25.080> be<00:02:25.230> did

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
caring compassion it simply can be did

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.860 
caring compassion it simply can be did
they<00:02:25.860> recognize<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.790> simulator<00:02:27.630> was

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
they recognize that the simulator was

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.390 
they recognize that the simulator was
asking<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:28.350> some<00:02:28.709> type<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:29.010> psychological

what mistakes they made and review it
and<00:02:50.190> we<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:51.390> repeat<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.320> situation<00:02:53.100> over<00:02:53.820> and

and we can repeat the situation over and

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.300 
and we can repeat the situation over and
over<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.450> over<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.320> real<00:02:55.530> world<00:02:55.739> you
