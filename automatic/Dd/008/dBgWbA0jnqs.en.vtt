adulterer in the same way but they give

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.230 
adulterer in the same way but they give
you<00:02:19.910> no<00:02:20.690> displacement<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.710> a<00:02:22.430> nose<00:02:22.640> placement

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
you no displacement and a nose placement

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.050 
you no displacement and a nose placement
you<00:02:23.450> see<00:02:23.750> don't<00:02:24.590> color<00:02:24.860> okay<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:25.610> we<00:02:25.880> all<00:02:26.030> know

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
you see don't color okay so we all know

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.390 
you see don't color okay so we all know
when<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.540> look<00:02:26.690> at<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.870> soap<00:02:27.200> bubble<00:02:27.410> or<00:02:28.010> an<00:02:28.220> oil

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
when you look at a soap bubble or an oil

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.400 
when you look at a soap bubble or an oil
spot<00:02:28.760> on<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:28.970> ground<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.420> see<00:02:29.630> an<00:02:29.960> array<00:02:30.380> of

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
spot on the ground you see an array of

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.070 
spot on the ground you see an array of
bright<00:02:30.980> colors<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:32.390> happens<00:02:32.870> because

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
bright colors and this happens because

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.380 
bright colors and this happens because
of<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.560> reflection<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.550> light<00:02:34.730> on<00:02:35.000> the

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
of the reflection of the light on the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.990 
of the reflection of the light on the
thin<00:02:35.690> layer<00:02:35.960> and<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:37.160> interference<00:02:37.910> that

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
thin layer and the interference that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.170 
thin layer and the interference that
happens<00:02:38.420> within<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:39.220> thin<00:02:40.220> layer<00:02:40.460> and<00:02:40.940> this

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
happens within the thin layer and this

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.500 
happens within the thin layer and this
is<00:02:41.390> called<00:02:41.630> then<00:02:42.230> film<00:02:42.590> interference

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
is called then film interference

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.450 
is called then film interference
abbreviated<00:02:44.510> TF<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:46.600> because<00:02:47.600> cuz<00:02:48.290> yes<00:02:49.190> that's

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
abbreviated TF I because cuz yes that's

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.580 
abbreviated TF I because cuz yes that's
what<00:02:49.700> it's<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.850> permitted<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:51.260> is

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
what it's a permitted and this is

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.080 
what it's a permitted and this is
basically<00:02:51.920> how<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.460> works<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:55.070> air<00:02:55.430> later

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
basically how it works this is air later

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.410 
basically how it works this is air later
and<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:58.100> is<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.430> soap<00:02:58.730> bubble<00:02:59.240> or<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.959> oil

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
and this is the soap bubble or the oil

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.800 
and this is the soap bubble or the oil
and<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:03.140> is<00:03:03.290> arrogant<00:03:03.800> and<00:03:04.300> this<00:03:05.300> is<00:03:05.630> the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
and this is arrogant and this is the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.960 
and this is arrogant and this is the
thin<00:03:06.050> film<00:03:06.080> right<00:03:06.530> here<00:03:06.560> like<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.400> one<00:03:07.730> light

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
thin film right here like a one light

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.390 
thin film right here like a one light
ray<00:03:08.180> will<00:03:08.390> come<00:03:08.570> in<00:03:08.720> at<00:03:08.870> an<00:03:08.989> angle<00:03:09.110> like<00:03:09.590> this

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.300 

part<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:13.670> will<00:03:14.150> reflect<00:03:14.650> at<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:16.070> same

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
part of it will reflect at the same

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.380 
part of it will reflect at the same
angle<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:18.500> part<00:03:18.830> of<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.070> is<00:03:19.130> transmitted<00:03:20.060> it

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.810 
angle but part of it is transmitted it
comes<00:03:20.660> in<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.140> reflected<00:03:21.560> refract<00:03:22.280> slightly

comes in it reflected refract slightly

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.150 
comes in it reflected refract slightly
and<00:03:23.060> then<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.690> reflects<00:03:24.170> off<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.500> bottom<00:03:25.070> of

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
and then it reflects off the bottom of

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.880 
and then it reflects off the bottom of
the<00:03:25.250> dim<00:03:25.459> film<00:03:25.900> we've<00:03:26.900> reflected<00:03:27.170> back<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.769> the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
of soap bubbles some bubbles as I said

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.969 
of soap bubbles some bubbles as I said
before<00:04:29.970> is<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.389> great<00:04:30.720> way<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:30.990> explain<00:04:31.680> them

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
before is a great way to explain them

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.820 
before is a great way to explain them
from<00:04:32.220> interference<00:04:32.990> look<00:04:33.990> as<00:04:34.200> you<00:04:34.229> see<00:04:34.590> when

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
from interference look as you see when

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.500 
from interference look as you see when
tire<00:04:35.040> blows<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.430> bubble<00:04:35.729> through<00:04:36.090> his<00:04:36.210> little

tire blows a bubble through his little

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.870 
tire blows a bubble through his little
hole<00:04:36.690> see<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.740> different<00:04:38.100> colors<00:04:38.370> changing

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
hole see the different colors changing

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.940 
hole see the different colors changing
in<00:04:39.060> there<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.840> watch<00:04:40.020> what<00:04:40.229> it<00:04:40.320> does<00:04:40.350> check<00:04:40.830> it

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
in there and watch what it does check it

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.500 
in there and watch what it does check it
out<00:04:41.780> as<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:44.370> can<00:04:44.490> see<00:04:44.729> throughout<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.060> oval

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
out as you can see throughout the oval

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.810 
out as you can see throughout the oval
and<00:04:45.810> in<00:04:46.620> different<00:04:46.860> spots<00:04:47.220> you<00:04:47.520> can<00:04:47.580> see

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
and in different spots you can see

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.180 
and in different spots you can see
different<00:04:48.210> colors<00:04:48.450> and<00:04:48.840> what<00:04:49.770> does<00:04:49.860> that<00:04:50.040> is

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
different colors and what does that is

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.000 
different colors and what does that is
doing<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.820> to<00:04:51.060> do<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.900> steps<00:04:52.290> of<00:04:52.470> interference

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
doing is to do the steps of interference

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.529 
doing is to do the steps of interference
in<00:04:53.250> different<00:04:53.580> colors<00:04:53.850> are<00:04:54.000> determined<00:04:54.450> by

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
in different colors are determined by

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.060 
in different colors are determined by
the<00:04:54.570> thickness<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.229> the<00:04:55.350> bubble<00:04:55.650> so<00:04:55.770> as<00:04:55.860> the

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
the thickness of the bubble so as the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.310 
the thickness of the bubble so as the
solution<00:04:56.760> moves<00:04:57.210> around<00:04:57.360> it<00:04:57.900> makes<00:04:58.169> the

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
solution moves around it makes the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.750 
solution moves around it makes the
bubble<00:04:58.590> thicker<00:04:58.830> in<00:04:59.010> different<00:04:59.280> places<00:04:59.460> you

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
bubble thicker in different places you
