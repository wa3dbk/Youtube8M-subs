two<00:00:22.180> keys<00:00:22.600> as<00:00:23.020> well<00:00:23.050> with<00:00:23.410> the<00:00:23.500> key<00:00:23.650> tag<00:00:23.890> so<00:00:24.130> I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
two keys as well with the key tag so I

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.060 
two keys as well with the key tag so I
can<00:00:24.340> have<00:00:24.430> another<00:00:24.580> key<00:00:24.790> mate<00:00:24.970> if<00:00:25.090> I<00:00:25.180> want<00:00:25.360> to

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
can have another key mate if I want to

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.730 
can have another key mate if I want to
as<00:00:27.070> I<00:00:27.820> said<00:00:28.000> it's<00:00:28.119> only<00:00:28.180> three<00:00:28.510> pins<00:00:28.810> but<00:00:29.230> they

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
as I said it's only three pins but they

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.299 
as I said it's only three pins but they
are<00:00:29.920> the<00:00:30.070> evil<00:00:30.870> angled<00:00:31.870> medico<00:00:32.529> pin<00:00:32.950> so<00:00:33.250> you

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
are the evil angled medico pin so you

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.060 
are the evil angled medico pin so you
see<00:00:33.640> we<00:00:33.730> got<00:00:33.820> some<00:00:34.000> angles<00:00:34.450> cut<00:00:35.230> there<00:00:35.530> so<00:00:35.770> not

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
see we got some angles cut there so not

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.740 
see we got some angles cut there so not
only<00:00:36.160> do<00:00:36.309> we<00:00:36.400> have<00:00:36.460> to<00:00:36.580> raise<00:00:36.820> the<00:00:37.180> pin<00:00:37.449> to<00:00:37.660> the

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
only do we have to raise the pin to the

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.720 
only do we have to raise the pin to the
correct<00:00:37.989> height<00:00:38.050> we've<00:00:38.949> also<00:00:39.129> got<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.430> rotate

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
correct height we've also got to rotate

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.850 
correct height we've also got to rotate
it<00:00:39.850> to<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.059> correct<00:00:40.300> angle<00:00:40.480> so<00:00:41.350> picking<00:00:41.650> it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
it to the correct angle so picking it

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.320 
it to the correct angle so picking it
can<00:00:42.010> be<00:00:42.100> quite<00:00:42.309> a<00:00:42.340> chore<00:00:42.699> this<00:00:43.030> one's<00:00:43.210> only

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
can be quite a chore this one's only

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.570 
can be quite a chore this one's only
three<00:00:43.629> pins<00:00:43.900> so<00:00:44.260> it<00:00:44.410> might<00:00:44.530> not<00:00:44.710> be<00:00:44.830> quite<00:00:45.550> that

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
three pins so it might not be quite that

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.060 
three pins so it might not be quite that
much<00:00:45.910> of<00:00:46.060> a<00:00:46.120> chore<00:00:46.360> but<00:00:46.600> rather<00:00:47.530> than<00:00:47.739> pick<00:00:47.950> it

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
much of a chore but rather than pick it

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.740 
much of a chore but rather than pick it
I've<00:00:48.160> heard<00:00:48.280> a<00:00:48.370> lot<00:00:48.489> about<00:00:48.550> raking<00:00:49.270> medicos

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
I've heard a lot about raking medicos

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.500 
I've heard a lot about raking medicos
some<00:00:50.050> guys<00:00:50.230> have<00:00:50.850> said<00:00:51.850> that<00:00:52.030> they've<00:00:52.180> done<00:00:52.360> it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
some guys have said that they've done it

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.569 
some guys have said that they've done it
on<00:00:52.570> some<00:00:52.780> of<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:53.079> lock<00:00:53.470> picking<00:00:53.800> boards<00:00:54.370> but

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
on some of the lock picking boards but

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.220 
on some of the lock picking boards but
no<00:00:54.760> one's<00:00:54.910> ever<00:00:55.000> actually<00:00:55.239> demonstrated<00:00:56.110> it

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
no one's ever actually demonstrated it

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.830 
no one's ever actually demonstrated it
so<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:56.950> thought<00:00:57.190> I'd<00:00:57.280> give<00:00:57.370> it<00:00:57.399> a<00:00:57.520> shot<00:00:57.840> using

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
so I thought I'd give it a shot using

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.630 
so I thought I'd give it a shot using
top<00:00:59.140> of<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.320> key<00:00:59.500> way<00:00:59.649> and<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.980> try<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.219> rake<00:01:00.489> it

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
top of the key way and to try to rake it

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.310 
top of the key way and to try to rake it
I'll<00:01:00.730> use<00:01:00.910> this<00:01:01.180> sparrows<00:01:01.989> triple<00:01:02.680> peak<00:01:04.320> now

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
I'll use this sparrows triple peak now

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.990 
I'll use this sparrows triple peak now
when<00:01:05.560> we<00:01:05.649> rake<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.950> medical<00:01:06.550> because<00:01:06.820> those

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
when we rake a medical because those

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.670 
when we rake a medical because those
pins<00:01:07.240> are<00:01:07.390> cut<00:01:07.540> at<00:01:07.660> three<00:01:08.080> different<00:01:08.229> angles

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
pins are cut at three different angles

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.290 
pins are cut at three different angles
and<00:01:08.920> because<00:01:09.310> they<00:01:09.430> also<00:01:09.580> contain<00:01:10.030> false

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
and because they also contain false

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.480 
and because they also contain false
gates<00:01:10.660> we<00:01:11.350> turn<00:01:11.560> this<00:01:11.710> just<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.100> bit<00:01:12.280> so<00:01:12.430> I<00:01:12.460> don't

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
gates we turn this just a bit so I don't

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.230 
gates we turn this just a bit so I don't
hit<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.789> camera

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
hit the camera

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.650 
hit the camera
I<00:01:14.250> can't<00:01:15.250> just<00:01:15.460> rake<00:01:15.700> in<00:01:15.940> and<00:01:16.090> out<00:01:16.210> straight

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
I can't just rake in and out straight

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.330 
I can't just rake in and out straight
because<00:01:17.020> that's<00:01:17.229> only<00:01:17.410> raking<00:01:17.800> one<00:01:18.010> angle

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
because that's only raking one angle

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.010 
because that's only raking one angle
we're<00:01:18.909> never<00:01:19.030> going<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.240> rotate<00:01:19.570> those<00:01:19.690> pins

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
we're never going to rotate those pins

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.930 
we're never going to rotate those pins
so<00:01:20.409> what<00:01:21.040> you'll<00:01:21.190> see<00:01:21.280> is<00:01:21.490> when<00:01:21.580> I'm<00:01:21.729> row

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
so what you'll see is when I'm row

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.149 
so what you'll see is when I'm row
making<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.140> strokes<00:01:23.440> in<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:23.740> out<00:01:23.830> I'm<00:01:23.950> also

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
making the strokes in and out I'm also

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.510 
making the strokes in and out I'm also
rotating<00:01:25.030> along<00:01:25.659> this<00:01:25.900> axis<00:01:26.140> trying<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.250> find

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
rotating along this axis trying to find

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.690 
rotating along this axis trying to find
the<00:01:27.760> correct<00:01:28.030> gate<00:01:28.390> now<00:01:29.290> when<00:01:29.500> I'm<00:01:29.619> raking<00:01:30.549> it

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
the correct gate now when I'm raking it

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.120 
the correct gate now when I'm raking it
I<00:01:31.030> may<00:01:31.720> give<00:01:31.869> you<00:01:31.900> fifteen<00:01:32.350> or<00:01:32.470> twenty<00:01:32.680> strokes

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
I may give you fifteen or twenty strokes

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.010 
I may give you fifteen or twenty strokes
I<00:01:33.250> may<00:01:33.880> get<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.060> false<00:01:34.270> set<00:01:34.540> as<00:01:34.659> soon<00:01:34.780> as<00:01:34.930> I've

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
I may get a false set as soon as I've

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.750 
I may get a false set as soon as I've
done<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.500> I<00:01:35.530> don't<00:01:35.590> get<00:01:35.860> it<00:01:35.950> open<00:01:36.250> that

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
done that and I don't get it open that

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.250 
done that and I don't get it open that
means<00:01:36.939> I'm<00:01:37.090> not<00:01:37.240> going<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.720> get<00:01:37.840> an<00:01:37.960> open<00:01:38.170> it

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
means I'm not going to get an open it

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.840 
means I'm not going to get an open it
means<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.470> found<00:01:38.680> a<00:01:38.770> false<00:01:38.979> gate<00:01:39.250> so<00:01:39.460> you'll<00:01:39.700> see

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
means I found a false gate so you'll see

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.700 
means I found a false gate so you'll see
miri<00:01:40.299> it<00:01:40.510> and<00:01:40.659> then<00:01:41.170> we'll<00:01:41.320> just<00:01:41.470> try<00:01:41.619> it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
miri it and then we'll just try it

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.560 
miri it and then we'll just try it
again<00:01:41.830> so<00:01:42.189> let's<00:01:42.369> see<00:01:42.430> if<00:01:42.490> we<00:01:42.520> can't<00:01:42.759> do<00:01:43.420> this

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
again so let's see if we can't do this

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.810 
again so let's see if we can't do this
on<00:01:43.750> camera<00:01:44.049> one<00:01:44.350> time<00:01:44.590> all<00:01:45.340> right<00:01:45.520> light

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
on camera one time all right light

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.240 
on camera one time all right light
tension<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.600> just<00:01:47.409> put<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.710> pic<00:01:47.860> in<00:01:48.040> there

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
tension and just put the pic in there

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.679 
tension and just put the pic in there
and<00:01:48.430> just<00:01:48.850> start<00:01:49.470> rotating<00:01:50.470> left<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:50.770> right

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.179 

but<00:01:55.689> try<00:01:56.049> not<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.229> do<00:01:56.409> that<00:01:56.560> like<00:01:56.860> I<00:01:56.890> said<00:01:57.040> like

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
but try not to do that like I said like

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.550 
but try not to do that like I said like
tension<00:01:57.640> but<00:01:57.820> heavy<00:01:58.630> enough<00:01:58.900> tension<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.320> keep

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
tension but heavy enough tension to keep

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:08.430 
tension but heavy enough tension to keep
it<00:01:59.740> in<00:01:59.829> the<00:01:59.920> key<00:02:00.100> way

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.309 

okay<00:02:09.440> probably<00:02:09.890> hit<00:02:10.099> a<00:02:10.130> fault<00:02:10.369> skate<00:02:10.670> down<00:02:10.880> a

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.780 

little<00:02:15.319> slight<00:02:15.650> give<00:02:15.920> on<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.190> core<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.430> felt

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
little slight give on the core I felt

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.170 
little slight give on the core I felt
this<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.120> know<00:02:17.480> we<00:02:17.599> get<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.780> fault<00:02:17.959> skate<00:02:18.170> that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
this I know we get it fault skate that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.580 
this I know we get it fault skate that
and<00:02:20.180> again<00:02:20.720> hit<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.020> fault<00:02:21.260> skate<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:24.260> we're

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
and again hit a fault skate and we're

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.180 
and again hit a fault skate and we're
stuck<00:02:24.830> in<00:02:24.980> there<00:02:25.190> come<00:02:25.610> on<00:02:25.730> baby

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.750 

now<00:02:31.190> we're<00:02:31.340> stuck<00:02:31.550> again<00:02:33.459> something<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.580> back

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
now we're stuck again something the back

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.309 
now we're stuck again something the back
of<00:02:34.970> this<00:02:35.090> for<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.630> there<00:02:35.750> we<00:02:35.840> go<00:02:35.959> we<00:02:36.080> got<00:02:36.170> it

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
of this for and there we go we got it

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.110 
of this for and there we go we got it
open<00:02:36.440> something<00:02:37.280> in<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.489> back<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.819> core

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
open something in the back of that core

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.390 
open something in the back of that core
grabbing<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.810> tip<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.170> this<00:02:39.290> pick<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:40.040> it's

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
grabbing the tip of this pick so it's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.770 
grabbing the tip of this pick so it's
pretty<00:02:40.550> short<00:02:40.819> lock<00:02:41.060> it's<00:02:41.299> got<00:02:41.390> only<00:02:41.540> three

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
pretty short lock it's got only three

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.539 
pretty short lock it's got only three
pins<00:02:42.049> but<00:02:42.350> let's<00:02:42.890> go<00:02:43.040> ahead<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.250> gut<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.400> and

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
pins but let's go ahead and gut it and

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.780 
pins but let's go ahead and gut it and
take<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.670> look<00:02:44.590> let's<00:02:45.590> see<00:02:45.830> here<00:02:46.220> I'll<00:02:46.459> need<00:02:46.670> the

take a look let's see here I'll need the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.030 
take a look let's see here I'll need the
key<00:02:47.030> for<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:47.510> we<00:02:47.959> take<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:48.410> down<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:48.920> we

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
key for this we take this down so we

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.080 
key for this we take this down so we
don't<00:02:49.600> have<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.750> hold<00:02:50.959> it<00:02:51.080> up<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.410> air<00:02:52.090> okay

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
don't have to hold it up in the air okay

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.970 
don't have to hold it up in the air okay
now<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.269> back<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.690> this<00:02:53.870> once<00:02:54.200> we<00:02:54.350> rotate<00:02:54.830> this

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
now the back of this once we rotate this

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.039 
now the back of this once we rotate this
and<00:02:55.190> it's<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.519> unlocked<00:02:55.940> position<00:02:56.060> that

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
and it's in the unlocked position that

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.559 
and it's in the unlocked position that
little<00:02:57.290> bar<00:02:57.530> in<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.920> back<00:02:58.100> will<00:02:58.880> line<00:02:59.120> up<00:02:59.150> with

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
little bar in the back will line up with

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.009 
little bar in the back will line up with

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
a hole in the side and once that happens

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.199 
a hole in the side and once that happens
we<00:03:03.170> can<00:03:03.200> take<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.590> probe<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.610> we<00:03:04.670> can<00:03:04.819> push<00:03:05.030> that

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
we can take a probe and we can push that

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:12.130 
we can take a probe and we can push that
little<00:03:05.510> thing<00:03:05.660> out<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.870> there<00:03:10.900> out<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:11.959> the

little thing out of there out of the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.400 
little thing out of there out of the
side<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.680> now<00:03:13.690> isn't<00:03:14.690> that<00:03:14.750> cool<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.200> core

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
side and now isn't that cool the core

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.090 
side and now isn't that cool the core
just<00:03:15.680> pops<00:03:15.920> out<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.310> miraculously<00:03:17.239> no<00:03:17.630> pins

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
just pops out and miraculously no pins

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.500 
just pops out and miraculously no pins
spew<00:03:19.100> all<00:03:19.340> over<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.609> top<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:19.970> your<00:03:20.090> workbench

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
spew all over the top of your workbench

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.590 
spew all over the top of your workbench
now<00:03:21.260> we<00:03:21.320> have<00:03:21.620> a<00:03:21.890> fully<00:03:22.190> key<00:03:22.880> out<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.299> can<00:03:23.450> see

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
now we have a fully key out you can see

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.710 
now we have a fully key out you can see
that<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:24.829> top<00:03:25.070> is<00:03:25.100> intact<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:26.000> sidebar<00:03:26.510> is

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
that the top is intact the sidebar is

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.780 
that the top is intact the sidebar is
locked<00:03:27.170> when<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.709> key<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:27.920> out<00:03:28.220> so<00:03:28.519> it<00:03:28.609> doesn't

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
locked when the key is out so it doesn't

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.569 
locked when the key is out so it doesn't
depress<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:30.709> when<00:03:30.920> we<00:03:30.980> flip<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.190> over<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.519> can

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
depress and when we flip it over you can

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.270 
depress and when we flip it over you can
see<00:03:31.700> all<00:03:32.000> three<00:03:32.239> of<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.359> key<00:03:32.540> pins<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.530> think

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
see all three of the key pins I think

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.340 
see all three of the key pins I think
the<00:03:34.400> light<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:34.730> reflecting<00:03:35.420> off<00:03:35.510> them<00:03:35.720> like

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
the light is reflecting off them like

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.870 
the light is reflecting off them like
there's<00:03:36.560> only<00:03:36.620> three<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.190> right<00:03:37.519> now<00:03:37.670> they're

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
there's only three and right now they're

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.610 
there's only three and right now they're
straight<00:03:38.239> but<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:38.480> can<00:03:38.660> see<00:03:38.810> they're<00:03:38.959> cut<00:03:39.230> at

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
straight but you can see they're cut at

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.430 
straight but you can see they're cut at
different<00:03:40.340> angles<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.870> when<00:03:42.019> they're<00:03:42.170> lined

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
different angles so when they're lined

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.229 
different angles so when they're lined
up<00:03:43.299> in<00:03:44.299> other<00:03:44.420> words<00:03:44.630> when<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.840> key<00:03:45.049> is<00:03:45.079> in

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
up in other words when the key is in

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.370 
up in other words when the key is in
there<00:03:47.239> race<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.720> proper<00:03:48.019> height<00:03:48.049> they're

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
there race to the proper height they're

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.020 
there race to the proper height they're
rotated<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:48.950> a<00:03:48.980> lot<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.459> allows<00:03:49.790> the

rotated and a lot of that allows the

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.720 
rotated and a lot of that allows the
sidebar<00:03:50.569> to<00:03:50.650> depress<00:03:51.650> into<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.310> side<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.519> lot

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730
