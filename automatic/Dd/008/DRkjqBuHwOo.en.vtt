 I'll show you a macro 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.060
 here it means we have of course 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.489
 instruction and here are such 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.349
 pipette ampoules which without any 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.140
 extra headphones yourself need an account 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:33.699

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.230

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:41.909

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:47.019
 it means it keeps about three weeks here 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:49.780
 dig dogs three times a year two or three 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.500

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.679
 around mid- april closer to may and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.000
 probably last time 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:03.249
 the second half of September means from 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.070
 experienced a huge number of different 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:07.479
 funds from some dogs becomes 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.539
 bad from some 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.580
 some just don't work 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:16.140

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.820
 dogs for little toshchenko and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.040
 keeps although it is written that four weeks 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.040
 here 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.090
 There is of course there are negative reviews about 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.869
 facilities 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.899
 but it doesn't seem to me that this is true with 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.210
 still more positives than negative 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.950

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.500

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.119

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:59.780
 when I eat, and on Mars this leopard is 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.909
 He begins to rub in all in all in a row 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.649
 grass there wallow all well some 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.110
 dogs this is going as if 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:11.750
 you need to get rid of the dog can 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.870
 bathe i'm letting the dogs bathe in 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.510
 ponds in streams in rivers but if you wash 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.599
 the dog with the soap there shampoo then of course 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.540

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:32.360
 if we spun on the grass today 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:35.090
 sprinkle the dogs then maybe today 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.970
 ticks on them will still creep and can 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.400
 even bite but already biting not yet 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.459
 skipping up blood biting on the skin they 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.590
 already die then it happens on dogs 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.290
 may end the action of the medicine on 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.540
