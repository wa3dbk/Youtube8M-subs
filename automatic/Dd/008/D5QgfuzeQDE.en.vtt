 cataluña christmas but let's expand it 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.060
 the recipes if they are not good 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.400
 sideburns 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.370
 and that there is no better time to get 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.730
 cepo rzeizim or Christmas so 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.279
 here we have this silverware that good is going to 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.949
 suppose one more will cost you 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.989
 costar let's make a broth first 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.960
 broth a soup a Christmas broth 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.089
 then we will use an onion 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.070
 We are going to use two potatoes that 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.809
 we are going to peel as you are already seeing and 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.210
 well let's see in a pot well 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.890
 big with lots of water one amount water 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.350
 that covers everything because you are already seeing two 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.269
 potatoes an onion two carrots a 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.640

 let this boil slowly during a 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.509
 hour is worth with the pot so half covered 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.330
 so that you do not consume all the broth 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.979
 and well, you are going to see that the process 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.360
 it is quite slow but with 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.000
 patience then let's add there 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.770
 about 300 grams of chickpeas that the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.840
 they sell already in boats you can add them 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.630
 directly at the last moment the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.360
 last quarter of an hour well let's strain 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.179
 the broth and let's cool it down 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.159
 so that to remove the fat and then the 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.140
 crap that could have been for us 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.429
 over and look what back girls more 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.310

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.929
 on the other hand mixed ground beef 100 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.330
 grams of beef 100 grams of 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.970
 pork we are going to mix it with a 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.789
 little salt of pepper and a bit of 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.940
 garlic and parsley and an egg we're going to 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.940
 Crush well there with force give passion 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.530
 it's Christmas you have to fill galets this 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.960
 it's a work of Chinese lady a 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.119
 good Chinese work here is not of the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.190
 everything is cold but it is to show you 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.720
 when you withdraw from being too cold is 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.750
 better the fat that remains in the 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.420
 surface the galets is this is a 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.310
 piece of snail shark pasta like 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.519
 what you want to call and what we are going to do 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.440
 it is first boil them for about 4 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.019
 minutes or less remaining one 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.000
 slightly soft and slightly spread 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.579
 so to make it easier 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.180
 stuffing that will not be easy sir that 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.230
 It will not be easy but let's try 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.230
 you take meat that we go for a sting 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.970
 filling one by one about 200 grams 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.819
 of pasta because this will grow 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.620
 fill them well because this widens and 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.810
 then for what happens is that if not 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.940
 we fill it well the meat can come out 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.579
 we leave the bald boiling the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.760
 we have strained and we have cleaned during 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.440
 about 10 11 minutes depending on the 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.260
 pasta that you have bought will indicate it 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.780
 in the package and ready 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.200
