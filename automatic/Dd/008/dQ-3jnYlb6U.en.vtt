that doesn't really bother me but

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.600 
that doesn't really bother me but
sometimes<00:01:22.229> gives<00:01:22.740> me<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> little<00:01:23.159> bug<00:01:23.430> about

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
sometimes gives me a little bug about

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.649 
sometimes gives me a little bug about
this<00:01:23.790> figure<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> tail<00:01:24.710> I<00:01:26.180> don't<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.390> don't

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
this figure is the tail I don't I don't

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.560 
this figure is the tail I don't I don't
really<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> big<00:01:29.100> problem<00:01:29.460> with<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.939> it's

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
really have a big problem with it it's

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.170 
really have a big problem with it it's
just<00:01:30.750> bad

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.529 

should<00:01:35.180> sometimes<00:01:35.780> put<00:01:36.229> some<00:01:36.409> figures<00:01:36.590> with

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
should sometimes put some figures with

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.060 
should sometimes put some figures with
longtail<00:01:38.539> well<00:01:39.020> not<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:39.500> sometimes<00:01:39.829> I<00:01:40.009> think

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
longtail well not so sometimes I think

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.760 
longtail well not so sometimes I think
they<00:01:40.310> should<00:01:40.490> always<00:01:40.640> do<00:01:40.850> that<00:01:41.000> because

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
they should always do that because

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.770 
they should always do that because
Bandai<00:01:42.770> creations<00:01:42.820> figures<00:01:43.820> like<00:01:44.060> they<00:01:44.509> come

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
Bandai creations figures like they come

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.249 
Bandai creations figures like they come
in<00:01:44.899> these<00:01:45.170> boxes<00:01:45.850> these<00:01:46.850> boxes<00:01:47.420> just<00:01:47.929> simple

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
in these boxes these boxes just simple

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.169 
in these boxes these boxes just simple
little<00:01:48.319> boxes<00:01:48.859> that<00:01:49.159> shows<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:49.729> whole<00:01:49.819> figure

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
little boxes that shows the whole figure

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.940 
little boxes that shows the whole figure
you've<00:01:50.420> outside<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.409> know<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:51.799> gotta

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
with me but these guys come in boxes and

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.889 
with me but these guys come in boxes and
box<00:01:57.259> length<00:01:58.069> is<00:01:58.250> like<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:58.670> in<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.509> wall<00:01:59.689> and

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
box length is like that in the wall and

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.480 
box length is like that in the wall and
width<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:01.750> width<00:02:02.750> or<00:02:02.990> length<00:02:03.020> or<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.740> don't<00:02:04.399> know

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
width so width or length or I don't know

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.569 
width so width or length or I don't know
but<00:02:04.899> they<00:02:05.899> always<00:02:06.319> curved<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.130> tail<00:02:07.369> like

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
but they always curved the tail like

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.180 
but they always curved the tail like
this<00:02:07.610> what<00:02:08.509> fair<00:02:09.140> line<00:02:09.289> creation<00:02:09.649> figures<00:02:09.920> so

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
this what fair line creation figures so

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.339 
this what fair line creation figures so
that<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.789> figures<00:02:11.000> can<00:02:11.299> fit<00:02:11.540> inside<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:12.140> box

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
that the figures can fit inside the box

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.520 
that the figures can fit inside the box
I<00:02:13.299> don't<00:02:14.299> know<00:02:14.360> why<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.720> they<00:02:15.170> did<00:02:15.410> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
I don't know why that they did that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.470 
I don't know why that they did that
because<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.010> previous<00:02:16.220> waves<00:02:16.640> like<00:02:17.269> for

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
because in the previous waves like for

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.420 
because in the previous waves like for
example<00:02:17.569> this<00:02:18.079> Godzilla<00:02:18.620> Godzilla<00:02:18.920> final

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
example this Godzilla Godzilla final

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.500 
example this Godzilla Godzilla final
wars<00:02:19.610> they<00:02:21.190> made<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.430> testing<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.239> box

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
wars they made the testing of the box

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.720 
wars they made the testing of the box
that<00:02:24.230> that's<00:02:24.470> fine<00:02:24.680> that's<00:02:24.829> not<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.040> problem<00:02:25.310> so

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
that that's fine that's not a problem so

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.250 
that that's fine that's not a problem so
I<00:02:26.030> don't<00:02:26.239> know<00:02:26.329> why<00:02:26.420> they<00:02:26.569> stopped<00:02:26.810> doing<00:02:27.140> that

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
I don't know why they stopped doing that

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.229 
I don't know why they stopped doing that

their<00:02:34.069> tail<00:02:34.670> let's<00:02:35.120> go<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:36.790> articulation<00:02:37.790> with

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
their tail let's go to articulation with

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.710 
their tail let's go to articulation with
this<00:02:38.060> guy<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:39.709> articulation<00:02:40.190> on<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.730> sky<00:02:40.970> he

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
this guy the articulation on the sky he

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.270 
this guy the articulation on the sky he
got<00:02:41.870> he<00:02:42.139> has<00:02:42.350> five<00:02:43.220> points<00:02:44.500> his<00:02:45.500> arms<00:02:46.010> can

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
got he has five points his arms can

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.849 
got he has five points his arms can
rotate<00:02:46.310> I'm<00:02:46.940> not<00:02:47.209> sure<00:02:47.450> if<00:02:47.569> he<00:02:47.660> can<00:02:47.690> go<00:02:47.959> 360

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
rotate I'm not sure if he can go 360

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.729 
rotate I'm not sure if he can go 360
degrees<00:02:49.160> well<00:02:49.519> before<00:02:49.970> they<00:02:50.180> could<00:02:50.420> but<00:02:50.739> why

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
degrees well before they could but why

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.129 
degrees well before they could but why
why<00:02:52.069> would<00:02:52.250> he<00:02:52.340> do<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.730> mean<00:02:53.019> there's<00:02:54.019> no

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
why would he do that I mean there's no

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.569 
why would he do that I mean there's no
there's<00:02:54.590> no<00:02:54.760> use<00:02:56.079> to<00:02:57.079> turn<00:02:57.889> out<00:02:58.069> all<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.489> way

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
there's no use to turn out all the way

there's no use to turn out all the way
360<00:02:59.120> degrees<00:02:59.420> this<00:02:59.660> is<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:00.139> fast<00:03:00.319> enough

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
360 degrees this is that fast enough

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.059 
360 degrees this is that fast enough
this<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.739> enough<00:03:01.299> sad<00:03:02.299> that's<00:03:02.540> good<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.799> legs

this is enough sad that's good the legs

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:12.099 
this is enough sad that's good the legs
can<00:03:04.400> go<00:03:04.579> 360<00:03:05.569> degrees<00:03:08.739> say<00:03:09.880> legs<00:03:10.880> go<00:03:11.180> 360

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
can go 360 degrees say legs go 360

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:19.240 
can go 360 degrees say legs go 360
degrees<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:13.099> tail<00:03:13.340> can<00:03:13.670> go<00:03:13.840> 360<00:03:14.840> degrees<00:03:18.250> this

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
tilt like the Millennium figure so you

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.539 
tilt like the Millennium figure so you
won't<00:03:25.280> have<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:26.739> fricassee<00:03:27.739> or<00:03:27.799> anything

won't have to fricassee or anything
they'll<00:03:29.510> just<00:03:29.660> be<00:03:29.810> an<00:03:29.930> articulation<00:03:30.709> there

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
they'll just be an articulation there

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.309 
they'll just be an articulation there
for<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.690> well<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.720> don't<00:03:32.989> know<00:03:33.049> some<00:03:33.290> people

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
say that there are a glue C on this

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.780 
say that there are a glue C on this
figure<00:03:36.169> some<00:03:36.470> people<00:03:36.709> say<00:03:36.829> they<00:03:37.099> don't<00:03:37.250> for<00:03:37.669> me
