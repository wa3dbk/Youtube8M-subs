00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 we are here at nice advance more 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.360
 exactly on the heights of nice for 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.870
 try the latest mv agusta novelty 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.910
 the rival 800 last proposed machine 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.180
 with the three-cylinder of 8 centimeters 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.760
 cubes 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.430
 the winch pestoni a hypermotard 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.829
 competing with the ducati hypermotard of 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.360
 the aprilia dorsoduro of the ktm and its 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.850
 seas and it will not be the last 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.920
 novelty precisely on this base 800 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.170
 you know there will be turismo 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.080
 the ofce very soon a sport gt 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.840
 and with justin also offers us to 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.259
 discover new machines on 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.310
 this same platform for 2014 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.720
 It must be recognized that 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.280
 Italians have worked quite a bit on the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.229
 good design it's always the same we like 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.000
 or we do not like it's a story of 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.670
 taste these new forms not find them 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.190
 rather singular then engine side 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.229
 in this chassis there that is identical to 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.420
 that of the brutal 800 we find the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.460
 same 3 cylinders that develops 125 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.740
 horses 8.24 of the newton-meters cases 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.860
 The switch is placed at 13 rpm 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.110
 no modification on this engine if this 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.970
 is no longer the air box that has been 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.399
 reworked and the exhaust line 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.479
 also that has been adapted to the model 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.220
 of course this third 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.530
 declination on platform 800 is 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.479
 also equipped with all electronics 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.340
 mv agusta traction control 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.530
 fully customizable several 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.500
 mapping that can be selected at 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.149
 handlebars quite easily here and here who 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.759
 are visible on the new screen 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.009
 particularly readable on to support 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.930
 the fiery motor we find beautiful 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.090
 equipment on this rival 800 a 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.610
 inverted fork to tube 43 mm because 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.590
 that they brembo calipers mounted on 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.660
 320 discs at the back we have a 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.190
 damper sachs of course all 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.260
 is fully customizable 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.299
 last little thing mv tells us 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.489
 have done a lot of work 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.380
 which would be more progressive 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.450
 we're going to test that on 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.890
 small roads in the hinterland of Nice 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.890
 I tell you this after 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.500
 Yes 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.530
 which engine this Estonian trip from the 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.510
 rival 800 superb sensation 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.920
 exceptional really a climb into 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.990
 very impressive diet 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.880
 and then there with the new ride system 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.830
 by wire better set up and well we can 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.120
 to roll more easily below 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.540
 4000 rpm without feeling 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.340
 of accous we find a small small 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.140
 down to six seven laps 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.280
 minute and then after that go back it's 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.740
 really very impressive 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.240
 as to the dynamic qualities of this 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.940
 rival 800 are very real 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.020
 it's a motorcycle that is agile 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.910
 certainly because of the position of 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.620
 conduct one masters very well precisely 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.210
 the whole front part finally the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.330
 driving position she finds herself a 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.310
 little bit between hypermotard and mt 09 on 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.340
 the angle is a rigorous machine 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.300
 maintaining course is ideal 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.820
 quick angle changes 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.790
 no problem it's also a very 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.360
 good braking we control the power 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.490
 quite easily 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.500
 the back only blocks very rarely 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.360
 it's not bad and then there are all 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.500
 these electronic assistances the 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.210
 traction control which is pretty good 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.780
 parametric we can fix everything 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.220
 from 0 to 8 the most intrusive who still 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.690
 quite intrusive but when it rains 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.460
 we tested it in the rain 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.770
 it's still not bad to see her 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.210
 good you understood this rival 800 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.870
 it's really a fan bike a motorcycle 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.130
 to have fun 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.290
 can we use it at 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.660
 daily certainly except in the city 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.400
 obviously with the wide handlebar and the 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.180
 mirrors ascent queues 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.549
 will not be terrible 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.500
 and then the turning radius that is not 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.120
 terrible the height of that pretty 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.030
 consequent fact that the maneuvers 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.460
 at the stop bah it's not that either 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.760
 price side to this very playful bike and 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.800
 still sold with 2690 euros 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.840
 shifter two series which is when 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.520
 even 1000 euros more than 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.170
 brutal 800 who is still a small 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.760
 little more versatile 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.610
 but here is the loan also to have 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.500
 a motorcycle whose manufacture is more 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.300
 high and then that is really more 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.070
 players in the winding it's really 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.110
 very nice and to know everything 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.000
 know everything about our try our 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.370
 rolling the two days of our taxi 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.660
 I invite you to meet us on motorcycle 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.660
