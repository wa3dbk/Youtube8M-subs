00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.340

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.250
 to put five columns of icons in 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:56.400

 and many are made when they put this 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.119
 tweet will already be reduced because they are going to 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.119

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.940
