00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.360 

the<00:00:17.510> biggest<00:00:17.810> concern<00:00:18.290> that<00:00:18.320> she<00:00:18.590> had<00:00:18.800> was<00:00:19.070> the

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.370 
the biggest concern that she had was the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.660 
the biggest concern that she had was the
her<00:00:19.970> profile<00:00:20.450> she<00:00:21.350> had<00:00:21.470> a<00:00:21.500> large<00:00:21.770> hump<00:00:22.070> she<00:00:22.580> was

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
her profile she had a large hump she was

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.609 
her profile she had a large hump she was
unhappy<00:00:22.910> with<00:00:23.090> that<00:00:23.240> but<00:00:24.110> you<00:00:24.320> know<00:00:24.440> during

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
unhappy with that but you know during

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.650 
unhappy with that but you know during
the<00:00:24.860> consultation<00:00:25.250> we<00:00:25.730> also<00:00:25.880> addressed<00:00:26.480> the

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
the consultation we also addressed the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.810 
the consultation we also addressed the
tip<00:00:26.900> and<00:00:27.140> she<00:00:27.410> wanted<00:00:27.680> to<00:00:27.770> see<00:00:28.010> there's<00:00:28.520> a<00:00:28.670> way

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
tip and she wanted to see there's a way

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.140 
tip and she wanted to see there's a way
to<00:00:29.090> make<00:00:29.570> my<00:00:30.170> tip<00:00:30.680> smaller<00:00:31.100> but<00:00:31.460> look<00:00:31.610> natural

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
to make my tip smaller but look natural

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.119 
to make my tip smaller but look natural
during<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.840> consultation<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.860> after

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
during the consultation and after

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.220 
during the consultation and after
talking<00:00:34.400> to<00:00:34.640> her<00:00:34.820> about<00:00:34.940> well<00:00:35.629> the<00:00:35.840> bones<00:00:36.050> are

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
talking to her about well the bones are

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.990 
talking to her about well the bones are
gonna<00:00:36.320> come<00:00:36.590> in<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:36.770> little<00:00:36.800> bit<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:37.850> may<00:00:37.940> be

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
gonna come in a little bit and it may be

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.080 
gonna come in a little bit and it may be
some<00:00:38.300> asymmetry<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:39.260> with<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.220> way<00:00:40.370> that<00:00:40.700> the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
some asymmetry and with the way that the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.650 
some asymmetry and with the way that the
the<00:00:41.420> bones<00:00:42.020> are<00:00:42.410> gonna<00:00:42.530> be<00:00:42.680> smaller<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:43.660> the

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
the bones are gonna be smaller and the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.810 
the bones are gonna be smaller and the
tip<00:00:45.260> will<00:00:45.410> be<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.530> little<00:00:45.650> bit<00:00:45.830> bigger<00:00:46.010> we

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
tip will be a little bit bigger we

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:55.630 
tip will be a little bit bigger we
talked<00:00:47.180> about<00:00:47.360> doing<00:00:47.629> some<00:00:47.900> tip<00:00:48.110> work

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.680 

I'm<00:00:56.540> glad<00:00:57.440> I<00:00:57.470> chose<00:00:57.980> dr.<00:00:58.280> massive<00:00:58.820> over<00:00:59.180> anyone

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
I'm glad I chose dr. massive over anyone

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.000 
I'm glad I chose dr. massive over anyone
else<00:00:59.870> yeah<00:01:00.230> I<00:01:00.290> just<00:01:00.500> feel<00:01:00.680> a<00:01:00.710> lot<00:01:00.980> more

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
else yeah I just feel a lot more

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:15.660 
else yeah I just feel a lot more
comfortable<00:01:01.430> now<00:01:01.910> after<00:01:03.610> I<00:01:04.610> guess<00:01:05.239> you'd<00:01:05.479> say

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.550 

when<00:01:16.670> max<00:01:16.940> first<00:01:17.210> came<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.600> me<00:01:17.720> has<00:01:17.900> two<00:01:18.229> main

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
when max first came to me has two main

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.160 
when max first came to me has two main
concerns<00:01:18.950> were<00:01:19.190> one<00:01:19.400> breathing<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.049> to<00:01:21.049> the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
concerns were one breathing and to the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.830 
concerns were one breathing and to the
symmetry<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:21.830> his<00:01:21.950> nose<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.659> one<00:01:23.659> of<00:01:23.780> the

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
symmetry of his nose and one of the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.840 
symmetry of his nose and one of the
things<00:01:24.049> that<00:01:24.229> I<00:01:24.290> noticed<00:01:24.619> on<00:01:24.770> Max's<00:01:25.400> face<00:01:25.640> is

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
things that I noticed on Max's face is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.030 
things that I noticed on Max's face is
that<00:01:26.000> he<00:01:26.090> had<00:01:26.240> asymmetric<00:01:27.229> facial<00:01:27.590> bones<00:01:27.799> as<00:01:28.009> a

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
that he had asymmetric facial bones as a

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
that he had asymmetric facial bones as a
matter<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.280> fact<00:01:28.520> we<00:01:29.149> got<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.330> 3d<00:01:30.020> CT<00:01:30.590> scan<00:01:31.100> which

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
matter of fact we got a 3d CT scan which

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.760 
matter of fact we got a 3d CT scan which
showed<00:01:32.300> some<00:01:32.540> of<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.690> symmetries<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.649> that

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
showed some of the symmetries and that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.100 
showed some of the symmetries and that
was<00:01:33.920> one<00:01:34.040> of<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.190> reasons<00:01:34.490> why<00:01:34.729> his<00:01:35.390> left<00:01:35.840> side

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
was one of the reasons why his left side

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.070 
was one of the reasons why his left side
was<00:01:36.440> collapsed<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.820> 3d<00:01:38.060> CT<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:38.810> had<00:01:38.990> up

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
was collapsed so the 3d CT you had up

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.899 
was collapsed so the 3d CT you had up
your<00:01:39.200> face<00:01:39.409> I<00:01:39.710> got<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.490> results<00:01:40.850> back

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
your face I got the results back

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:41.680 
your face I got the results back
yesterday

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
yesterday

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.499 
yesterday
your<00:01:42.229> facial<00:01:42.500> bones<00:01:43.100> are<00:01:43.520> very<00:01:44.119> minimally

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
your facial bones are very minimally

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.529 
your facial bones are very minimally
different<00:01:45.229> everyone's<00:01:46.130> asymmetric<00:01:46.789> but<00:01:47.450> it

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
different everyone's asymmetric but it

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.050 
different everyone's asymmetric but it
wasn't<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.869> large<00:01:48.170> difference<00:01:48.820> so<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:49.880> lot<00:01:50.030> of

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
wasn't a large difference so a lot of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.600 
wasn't a large difference so a lot of
this<00:01:50.270> is<00:01:50.450> due<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.810> nose<00:01:51.080> but<00:01:52.070> our<00:01:52.190> goal<00:01:52.399> is

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
this is due to the nose but our goal is

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:01.719 
this is due to the nose but our goal is
to<00:01:52.820> breathing<00:01:53.570> symmetry<00:01:59.229> and<00:02:00.460> he's<00:02:01.460> very

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
to breathing symmetry and he's very

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.419 
to breathing symmetry and he's very
happy<00:02:02.030> with<00:02:02.149> his<00:02:02.420> nose<00:02:02.600> he<00:02:03.289> can<00:02:03.440> breathe<00:02:03.770> he

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
happy with his nose he can breathe he

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.340 
happy with his nose he can breathe he
likes<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.850> appearance<00:02:05.360> he's<00:02:05.569> more<00:02:05.780> symmetric

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
likes the appearance he's more symmetric

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:19.860 
likes the appearance he's more symmetric
he's<00:02:06.920> happy<00:02:07.340> I'm<00:02:07.520> happy

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:29.540 

you
