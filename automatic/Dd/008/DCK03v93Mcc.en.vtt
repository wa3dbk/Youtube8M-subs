00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.749

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.119
 this is a record last year figure 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.010
 hesitated 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.739
 according to different sources from 300 to 700 thousand 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.199
 but on good Friday before Easter day 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.629
 the most stringent of the year and the most 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.699
 intense prayer preparation even 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.429
 a small part of these one and a half million 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.620
 could hardly come to the temple service 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.469

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.329

 go to work get into things 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.810
 resurrected Christ 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.729
 The establishment of non-working days has always been 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.830
 a marker of state attitudes towards 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.970
 values ​​of people and this is especially true 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.729

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.560
 I consider statistics for myself in full 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.200
 sense of the word holiday holidays and 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.150
 tradition to give people the opportunity 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.369
 worthy to prepare for it and worthy 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.610
 to spend it exists in many 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.690
 countries of the world so good friday and 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.530

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.300

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.640
 tuesday after easter special day 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.489
 commemoration of the dead and all this much 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.980
 more than just a calendar issue is 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.730
 the question of real manifestation of faith in business 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.650
 people and in society about this after 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.519

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.610
 Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, Kirill 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.100
 better this is our testimony of 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.410
 resurrection of Christ 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.150
 the evidence of our faith is refracted in 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:39.150
 our affairs in personal social 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.540

 the world met through the preaching of christ 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:55.129
 the savior will really become part of our 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:58.730
 life and then change for the better 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:04.170
 life of everybody country life 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.790
