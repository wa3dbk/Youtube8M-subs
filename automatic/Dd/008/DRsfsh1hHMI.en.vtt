short piece it's a short solo but it's a
finger<00:00:26.630> tapping<00:00:26.869> one<00:00:27.169> so<00:00:27.409> the<00:00:27.589> tuning<00:00:28.009> is<00:00:28.989> just

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:29.989 
finger tapping one so the tuning is just

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.720 
finger tapping one so the tuning is just
a<00:00:30.109> standard<00:00:30.319> tuning<00:00:30.769> but<00:00:30.829> everything<00:00:31.220> dropped

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
a standard tuning but everything dropped

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.630 
a standard tuning but everything dropped
a<00:00:31.909> half<00:00:32.149> step<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:32.510> it's<00:00:32.870> d<00:00:33.080> sharp<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:33.680> all<00:00:34.490> your

strengths and be a half step lower and
your<00:00:36.860> tutor<00:00:37.240> so<00:00:38.240> your<00:00:38.420> low<00:00:38.990> string<00:00:39.350> would<00:00:39.530> be

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
your tutor so your low string would be

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.160

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
tap on the 15th fret will be your

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.160 
tap on the 15th fret will be your
opening<00:00:55.219> part<00:00:55.579> so<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.300> first<00:00:56.480> part<00:00:56.750> of<00:00:56.809> it<00:00:56.960> is

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.430 
opening part so the first part of it is
like<00:00:58.100> this<00:01:01.480> and<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.600> second<00:01:02.989> part<00:01:03.199> is<00:01:03.350> the

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
like this and the second part is the

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.259 
like this and the second part is the
same<00:01:03.559> thing<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:04.309> if<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:04.460> move<00:01:04.729> your<00:01:04.909> first

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
same thing so if you move your first

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.530 
same thing so if you move your first
finger<00:01:05.630> down<00:01:05.899> to<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.710> ninth<00:01:07.190> fret<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:08.270> that'll

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
finger down to the ninth fret so that'll

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.540 
finger down to the ninth fret so that'll
be<00:01:08.659> like<00:01:08.690> this<00:01:11.380> so<00:01:12.380> those<00:01:12.560> two<00:01:12.800> combined<00:01:13.310> or

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
be like this so those two combined or

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.740 
be like this so those two combined or
like<00:01:13.700> this<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:19.700> next<00:01:20.000> part<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.240> that<00:01:20.479> would<00:01:20.720> be

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
like this the next part to that would be

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:31.590 
like this the next part to that would be
a<00:01:21.140> go

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:40.870 

so<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.780> tail<00:01:33.050> end<00:01:33.080> of<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.679> riff<00:01:33.830> just<00:01:34.159> goes

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.270 
thing and the toms are doing another and
I<00:02:54.090> notice<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.510> lot<00:02:54.629> of<00:02:54.659> people<00:02:55.049> either<00:02:55.709> do<00:02:56.040> one

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
I notice a lot of people either do one

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.759 
I notice a lot of people either do one
or<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.549> other<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.450> just<00:02:58.079> pay<00:02:58.200> attention<00:02:58.230> to

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
or the other so just pay attention to

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.309 
or the other so just pay attention to
both<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.250> just<00:03:00.150> incorporate<00:03:00.629> them<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.140> it

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
both and just incorporate them and it

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:20.530 
both and just incorporate them and it
goes<00:03:01.470> something<00:03:01.950> like<00:03:01.980> this

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.420 

pretty<00:03:21.540> simple<00:03:21.840> part<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.829> main<00:03:23.129> thing<00:03:23.400> to

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
pretty simple part the main thing to

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.970 
pretty simple part the main thing to
remember<00:03:23.579> is<00:03:24.209> that<00:03:24.780> there's<00:03:24.989> eighth<00:03:25.590> note

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
remember is that there's eighth note

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.460 
remember is that there's eighth note
kicks<00:03:26.280> underlying<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.359> part<00:03:27.599> and<00:03:27.780> then<00:03:28.409> you

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
kicks underlying that part and then you

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.770 
kicks underlying that part and then you
just<00:03:28.680> play<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.859> pattern<00:03:29.129> on<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.430> Tom's<00:03:29.780> again

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
just play the pattern on the Tom's again

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.680 
just play the pattern on the Tom's again
most<00:03:30.989> people<00:03:31.319> usually<00:03:31.500> forget<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.730> do<00:03:32.910> both

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
most people usually forget to to do both

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.110 
most people usually forget to to do both
parts<00:03:33.769> incorporated<00:03:34.769> so<00:03:35.250> that's<00:03:35.730> really<00:03:35.940> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
parts incorporated so that's really the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.339 
parts incorporated so that's really the
main<00:03:36.269> thing<00:03:36.299> is<00:03:36.599> pretty<00:03:36.810> simple<00:03:37.079> part

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
main thing is pretty simple part

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.680 
main thing is pretty simple part
otherwise
