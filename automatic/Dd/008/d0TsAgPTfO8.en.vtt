there is absolutely no windows I have a

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.269 
there is absolutely no windows I have a
lot<00:00:15.400> of<00:00:15.430> fluorescent<00:00:16.000> bulbs<00:00:16.949> quite<00:00:17.949> a<00:00:17.980> lot<00:00:18.160> of

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
lot of fluorescent bulbs quite a lot of

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.960 
lot of fluorescent bulbs quite a lot of
model<00:00:18.519> kits<00:00:18.789> but<00:00:19.599> absolutely<00:00:20.289> no<00:00:20.470> ventilation

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
model kits but absolutely no ventilation

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.249 
model kits but absolutely no ventilation
now<00:00:21.970> as<00:00:22.119> you<00:00:22.210> can<00:00:22.300> imagine<00:00:22.390> when<00:00:22.839> I'm<00:00:22.960> modeling

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
now as you can imagine when I'm modeling

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.009 
now as you can imagine when I'm modeling
that<00:00:23.499> can<00:00:23.769> be<00:00:23.949> a<00:00:23.980> bit<00:00:24.159> of<00:00:24.220> an<00:00:24.310> issue<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.689> here<00:00:25.929> we

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.019 
that can be a bit of an issue so here we

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.470 
that can be a bit of an issue so here we
have<00:00:26.140> my<00:00:26.230> workbench<00:00:26.999> normally<00:00:27.999> I<00:00:28.029> don't<00:00:28.269> find

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
have my workbench normally I don't find

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.729 
have my workbench normally I don't find
modeling<00:00:28.810> up<00:00:28.900> here<00:00:29.050> too<00:00:29.199> much<00:00:29.349> of<00:00:29.470> a<00:00:29.529> problem

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
modeling up here too much of a problem

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.159 
modeling up here too much of a problem
except<00:00:30.640> when<00:00:30.730> I'm<00:00:30.819> airbrushing<00:00:31.210> now<00:00:31.839> that<00:00:32.020> can

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
except when I'm airbrushing now that can

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.600 
except when I'm airbrushing now that can
be<00:00:32.200> a<00:00:32.259> big<00:00:32.529> problem<00:00:32.710> because<00:00:33.220> there<00:00:33.370> is<00:00:33.460> no

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
be a big problem because there is no

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.760 
be a big problem because there is no
ventilation<00:00:33.940> I<00:00:34.480> tend<00:00:34.810> to<00:00:34.870> get<00:00:34.990> a<00:00:35.050> mist<00:00:35.410> form

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
ventilation I tend to get a mist form

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.680 
ventilation I tend to get a mist form
you<00:00:36.670> know<00:00:36.760> you<00:00:36.910> can<00:00:37.030> tell<00:00:37.210> when<00:00:37.330> I'm<00:00:37.420> having<00:00:37.630> a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690

good session because literally

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.400 
good session because literally

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
going to turn the booth on so it's not

particularly<00:02:33.370> noisy<00:02:34.590> certainly<00:02:35.590> gear<00:02:35.890> you

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
particularly noisy certainly gear you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.610 
particularly noisy certainly gear you
can't<00:02:36.940> be<00:02:37.030> hitting<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.450> outside<00:02:37.840> my<00:02:38.140> loft<00:02:38.380> I

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
can't be hitting it outside my loft I

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.680 
can't be hitting it outside my loft I
have<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.489> this<00:02:39.610> mode<00:02:39.880> with<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.269> lights<00:02:40.480> on

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
have it in this mode with the lights on

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.420 
have it in this mode with the lights on
so<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:41.050> can<00:02:41.200> see<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:41.560> quite<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.769> bright<00:02:42.130> light

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
so you can see it's quite a bright light

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.640

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.589 

I'm<00:02:46.220> not<00:02:46.400> sure<00:02:46.610> how<00:02:46.790> well<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.269> going<00:02:47.480> to

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
I'm not sure how well this is going to

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.869 
I'm not sure how well this is going to
show<00:02:47.780> up<00:02:47.930> on<00:02:48.079> the<00:02:48.200> camera<00:02:48.620> but<00:02:49.400> I've<00:02:49.489> got<00:02:49.670> my

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
show up on the camera but I've got my

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.910 
show up on the camera but I've got my
airbrush<00:02:50.450> here<00:02:50.750> I'm<00:02:51.079> just<00:02:51.260> going<00:02:51.439> to<00:02:51.470> spray

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
airbrush here I'm just going to spray

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.920 
airbrush here I'm just going to spray
across<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:53.180> food<00:02:53.360> now<00:02:53.599> I'm<00:02:53.689> not<00:02:53.810> actually

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
across the food now I'm not actually

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.899 
across the food now I'm not actually
aiming<00:02:54.260> at<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.590> booth<00:02:54.769> here<00:02:55.069> but<00:02:55.790> you'll

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
aiming at the booth here but you'll

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.000 
aiming at the booth here but you'll
actually<00:02:56.090> see<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.900> speak<00:02:57.319> that<00:02:57.620> spray

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
actually see the speak that spray

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.229 
actually see the speak that spray
actually<00:02:58.610> curving<00:02:59.299> into<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.500> boom<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:01.730> really

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
actually curving into the boom it really

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.089 
actually curving into the boom it really
is<00:03:02.359> quite<00:03:02.540> dramatic<00:03:02.810> so<00:03:03.560> I'm<00:03:03.650> not<00:03:03.769> sure<00:03:03.859> how

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
is quite dramatic so I'm not sure how

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.309 
is quite dramatic so I'm not sure how
well<00:03:04.310> it's<00:03:04.459> picking<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:04.849> up<00:03:05.030> but<00:03:05.720> basically

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
well it's picking this up but basically

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.110 
well it's picking this up but basically
nothing<00:03:06.890> is<00:03:07.040> actually<00:03:07.220> coming<00:03:07.579> outside<00:03:07.939> the

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
nothing is actually coming outside the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.839 
nothing is actually coming outside the
booth<00:03:08.269> everything<00:03:08.870> is<00:03:08.959> being<00:03:09.200> pulled<00:03:09.500> in<00:03:09.849> it's

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
booth everything is being pulled in it's

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.610 
booth everything is being pulled in it's
very<00:03:10.970> very<00:03:11.450> impressive<00:03:11.780> especially<00:03:12.470> when

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
very very impressive especially when

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.050 
very very impressive especially when
you're<00:03:12.739> spraying<00:03:12.980> something<00:03:13.280> like<00:03:13.519> our<00:03:13.730> pad

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
you're spraying something like our pad

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.819 
you're spraying something like our pad
before<00:03:14.989> I<00:03:15.019> always<00:03:15.319> used<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.560> get<00:03:15.680> that

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
before I always used to get that

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.649 
before I always used to get that
cellulose<00:03:16.340> smell<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:17.090> now<00:03:17.239> I<00:03:17.269> don't<00:03:17.420> get

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
cellulose smell and now I don't get

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.940 
cellulose smell and now I don't get
anything<00:03:17.930> at<00:03:18.139> all

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.620 

replacing<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.070> filter<00:03:24.460> is<00:03:24.550> simplicity<00:03:25.270> this

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
replacing the filter is simplicity this

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.990 
replacing the filter is simplicity this
literally<00:03:26.080> just<00:03:26.350> unclips<00:03:26.860> I'm<00:03:27.640> trying<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:27.910> do

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
literally just unclips I'm trying to do
