00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869

numbers<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:19.530> again<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> thought

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
numbers are there again I thought

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.130 
numbers are there again I thought
defensively<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:21.299> were<00:01:21.600> good<00:01:21.780> when<00:01:21.900> they<00:01:21.990> had

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
defensively they were good when they had

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.480 
defensively they were good when they had
to<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.380> with<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> two<00:01:23.189> end<00:01:23.340> zone

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490

was<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.610> good<00:01:27.210> performance<00:01:27.420> against<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.259> good

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
was a good performance against a good

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
was a good performance against a good
team<00:01:28.680> that's<00:01:28.920> tough<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.310> play<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:30.060> you

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
team that's tough to play I think you

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.370 
team that's tough to play I think you
move<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.049> know<00:01:31.170> more

against<00:01:40.650> temple<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:42.119> know<00:01:42.210> maybe<00:01:42.630> this

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
against temple so you know maybe this

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.330 
against temple so you know maybe this
defense<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.320> little<00:01:43.560> better<00:01:43.710> than<00:01:43.920> we

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
defense is a little better than we

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.530 
defense is a little better than we
thought<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.000> still<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> work<00:01:45.420> in

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
thought it's it's still a work in

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.789 
thought it's it's still a work in
progress<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.020> maybe<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.439> little<00:01:46.560> better

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
progress but maybe it's a little better

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.200 
progress but maybe it's a little better
than<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.100> thought<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.880> got<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.149> be

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
than we thought now you got to be

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.219 
than we thought now you got to be
feeling<00:01:48.329> pretty<00:01:48.479> good<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:48.930> you're<00:01:49.049> Mike

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
tranghese right now the big east is 14

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.389 
tranghese right now the big east is 14
and<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.810> two<00:01:51.930> belong<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.799> Syracuse<00:01:53.250> who

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and to the two belong to to Syracuse who

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.889 
and to the two belong to to Syracuse who
probably<00:01:53.579> couldn't<00:01:53.909> beat<00:01:54.000> themselves<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
probably couldn't beat themselves in a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.020 
probably couldn't beat themselves in a
inertia<00:01:55.560> quad<00:01:55.860> scrimmage<00:01:56.310> I'm<00:01:56.490> curious<00:01:56.759> what

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
inertia quad scrimmage I'm curious what

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.340 
inertia quad scrimmage I'm curious what
you<00:01:57.210> think<00:01:57.420> about<00:01:57.540> we're<00:01:57.899> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> rewrite

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
you think about we're going to rewrite

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.899 
you think about we're going to rewrite
the<00:01:58.409> Big<00:01:58.710> East<00:01:58.860> now<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.640> look<00:01:59.759> at

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the Big East now do we have to look at

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.030 
the Big East now do we have to look at
South<00:02:00.479> Florida<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.170> Cincinnati<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.860> perhaps

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
South Florida and Cincinnati as perhaps

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
South Florida and Cincinnati as perhaps
better<00:02:02.759> than<00:02:02.880> than<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.450> thought<00:02:03.689> in

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
better than than we thought in

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.569 
better than than we thought in
Louisville<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.439> West<00:02:04.590> Virginia<00:02:04.649> struggling

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
Louisville and West Virginia struggling

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.249 
Louisville and West Virginia struggling
in<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.759> couple<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.030> games<00:02:06.210> maybe<00:02:06.750> not<00:02:06.990> as<00:02:07.110> good

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
in a couple of games maybe not as good

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.020 
in a couple of games maybe not as good
as<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.469> thought<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.950> think<00:02:08.039> Syracuse<00:02:08.819> is

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
as we thought and I think Syracuse is

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.029 
as we thought and I think Syracuse is
the<00:02:09.149> new<00:02:09.270> temple<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.869> tell<00:02:10.050> if<00:02:10.170> taken<00:02:10.800> over<00:02:10.979> as

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the new temple you tell if taken over as

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.290 
the new temple you tell if taken over as
a<00:02:11.099> new<00:02:11.220> temple<00:02:11.520> here's<00:02:11.940> what's<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.239> to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
a new temple here's what's going to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.970 
a new temple here's what's going to
happen<00:02:12.629> I

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
happen I

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.410 
happen I
because<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.819> things<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.090> have<00:02:14.180> happened

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
because of the things that have happened

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.910 
because of the things that have happened
with<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.599> big<00:02:14.750> east<00:02:14.959> if<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.379> look<00:02:15.530> at<00:02:15.620> rutgers

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
with the big east if you look at rutgers

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.649 
with the big east if you look at rutgers
schedule<00:02:16.340> there's<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.610> very<00:02:16.849> good<00:02:16.940> chance<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.510> a

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
schedule there's a very good chance in a

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.780 
schedule there's a very good chance in a
four-game<00:02:17.900> stretch<00:02:18.459> Cincinnati<00:02:19.459> South

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
four-game stretch Cincinnati South

Florida<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.209> West<00:02:20.360> Virginia<00:02:20.420> could<00:02:20.870> all<00:02:21.080> be

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
Florida in West Virginia could all be

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.360 
Florida in West Virginia could all be
unbeaten<00:02:21.680> when<00:02:21.769> they<00:02:21.860> come<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.129> wreck<00:02:22.250> your

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.979 
know if all of them be ranked i'm not
sure<00:02:25.909> that<00:02:25.940> Cincinnati<00:02:26.269> will<00:02:26.629> even<00:02:26.930> though

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
sure that Cincinnati will even though

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.539
