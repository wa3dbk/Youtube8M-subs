00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
pretty accurate I cooked it for 12

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.090 
pretty accurate I cooked it for 12
minutes<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.700> was<00:02:12.850> recommended<00:02:13.180> 11<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.900> 13<00:02:14.319> the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
minutes it was recommended 11 to 13 the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.740 
minutes it was recommended 11 to 13 the
only<00:02:15.250> thing<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.760> vegetables<00:02:16.239> don't<00:02:16.540> look

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750

quite<00:02:16.989> as<00:02:17.670> saucy<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.850> exciting<00:02:19.360> but<00:02:19.510> overall

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
quite as saucy and exciting but overall

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.710 
quite as saucy and exciting but overall
I<00:02:20.410> think<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:20.769> pretty<00:02:20.920> close<00:02:21.130> comparison

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.220

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.839 

mmm<00:02:53.569> this<00:02:54.260> pizza<00:02:54.500> has<00:02:54.860> sucked<00:02:55.099> them<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.550> little

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
mmm this pizza has sucked them a little

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.520 
mmm this pizza has sucked them a little
bit<00:02:56.060> different<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.480> it's<00:02:56.660> kind<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:57.019> kick

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
bit different to it's kind of a kick

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.490 
bit different to it's kind of a kick
there<00:02:57.739> it's<00:02:58.069> not<00:02:58.280> too<00:02:58.760> overly<00:02:59.090> powerful<00:02:59.330> but<00:03:00.230> i

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
there it's not too overly powerful but i

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.720 
there it's not too overly powerful but i
think<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.160> mix<00:03:01.459> of<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.709> peppers<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:04.459> garlic

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
think the mix of the peppers the garlic

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.750 
think the mix of the peppers the garlic
and<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.349> red<00:03:06.349> pepper<00:03:06.709> sauce<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.550> has

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
and the red pepper sauce that it has

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.600 
and the red pepper sauce that it has
really<00:03:08.630> brings<00:03:08.930> out<00:03:09.050> kind<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.680> slow<00:03:10.040> heat

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
really brings out kind of a slow heat

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.420 
really brings out kind of a slow heat
kind<00:03:11.330> of<00:03:11.420> like<00:03:11.510> some<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.780> those<00:03:12.280> rugs<00:03:13.280> you
