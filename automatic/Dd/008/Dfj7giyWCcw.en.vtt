00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.990
 the suv 3 becker is gone now is the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.750
 Outback close the gap 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.750
 and become the flagship of the brand 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.880
 the outback is little different 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.810
 from his sister model legacy 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.879
 visually you can see the differences 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.670
 especially at the greater ground clearance 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:43.680
 and the reinforced front are laterally 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.680
 the fenders are more heavily exploited 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:52.010
 Inside, there is plenty of space and comfort 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.780
 yes, but what is really new for the first time 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.809
 there is the so-called lineartronic 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.309
 power transmission in combination with 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.309
 a boxer diesel engine 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.270
 the stepless cvt gear works 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.270
 similar to a bicycle chain 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.140
 the advantages of driving we want 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.510
 during a test drive around the titisee 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.170
 find out 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:31.190
 but we need a test couple for that 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:36.070
 Manfred Klosters spoon already found 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.070
 next to us for the outback under the microscope 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.900
 he feels visibly at tax 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.880
 maybe a bit too well 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.880
 at least for wife spoon 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.980
 right 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.250
 that's right 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.530
 the outback runs quietly and the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.480
 Stepless automatic harmonizes very well 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.480
 with the boxer diesel engine 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.599
 thereby manufactures 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.780
 subaru offers beside the two-liter 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.480
 diesel engine also a two and a half liter 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.540
 petrol on 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:09.610
 the titisee round is finished we are 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:12.220
 now in a nutshell pleasant 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.160
 drive a quiet drive one 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.560
 relatively good acceleration and 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.030
 a good view and will like them 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.829
 So exciting as a passenger passenger 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.599
 and bend you have to say 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.349
 So I have to but first 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:34.060
 somehow get used to it so from the 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:36.250
 driving style here or or half drive 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.500
 sporty yes but there is one has to 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.430
 is well accelerated what is coming 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.489
 test passed 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:51.989
 the subaru outback boxer diesel is on 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.989
 us from 37,100 50 burned available
