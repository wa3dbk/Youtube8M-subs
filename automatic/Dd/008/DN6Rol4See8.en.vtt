00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
know I just sort of took one look at him

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.570 
know I just sort of took one look at him
and<00:01:17.960> thinking<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.080> know<00:01:19.310> punch<00:01:20.310> him<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and thinking you know punch him in the

and thinking you know punch him in the
face<00:01:20.670> again<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.479> pee<00:01:21.689> guy<00:01:21.900> he<00:01:22.619> clearly

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950

hasn't<00:01:23.220> learned<00:01:23.369> his<00:01:23.610> lesson<00:01:24.770> one<00:01:25.770> thing<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
hasn't learned his lesson one thing that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.530 
hasn't learned his lesson one thing that
I<00:01:26.159> think<00:01:26.250> would<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.790> helped<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> character

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
I think would have helped the character

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.440 
I think would have helped the character
is<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:28.350> at<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> end<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> game<00:01:29.159> he<00:01:30.060> looked

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
is if at the end of the game he looked

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
is if at the end of the game he looked
around<00:01:30.600> real<00:01:31.110> quick<00:01:31.140> kind<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.770> furtively<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
around real quick kind of furtively and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.390 
around real quick kind of furtively and
took<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> cap<00:01:33.540> off<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.200> turns<00:01:34.470> out<00:01:34.740> he<00:01:35.310> was

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
took the cap off and it turns out he was

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.649 
took the cap off and it turns out he was
like<00:01:35.549> one<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.700> those<00:01:35.850> 20-somethings<00:01:36.600> who

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
like one of those 20-somethings who

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.969 
like one of those 20-somethings who
already<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.470> male<00:01:37.650> pattern<00:01:37.829> baldness

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
already have the male pattern baldness

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.179 
already have the male pattern baldness
in<00:01:38.579> full<00:01:38.790> force<00:01:39.350> then<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> feel<00:01:40.619> bad<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:40.829> him

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
in full force then I feel bad for him

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.300 
in full force then I feel bad for him
then<00:01:41.280> I'd<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:44.189> would

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
then I'd be like you know it would

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.380 
then I'd be like you know it would
change<00:01:44.640> my<00:01:44.909> perspective<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> entire<00:01:45.990> game
