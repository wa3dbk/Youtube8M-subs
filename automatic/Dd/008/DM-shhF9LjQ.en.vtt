late<00:01:09.290> March<00:01:10.180> you<00:01:11.180> probably<00:01:11.420> remember<00:01:11.540> this<00:01:11.870> is

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
late March you probably remember this is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.180 
late March you probably remember this is
the<00:01:12.110> one<00:01:12.260> that<00:01:12.380> I<00:01:12.470> was<00:01:12.620> having<00:01:12.740> issues<00:01:13.010> with

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
the one that I was having issues with

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.380 
the one that I was having issues with
carbonating<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:16.490> temperatures<00:01:16.940> here<00:01:17.210> now

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
carbonating so the temperatures here now

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.740 
carbonating so the temperatures here now
really<00:01:17.900> come<00:01:18.110> up<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.320> lot<00:01:19.240> in<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.420> in<00:01:20.690> the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
really come up a lot in the in the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.830 
really come up a lot in the in the
basement<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:21.650> I<00:01:21.950> can<00:01:22.580> probably<00:01:22.729> start<00:01:23.030> to<00:01:23.150> let

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
basement so I can probably start to let

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.880 
basement so I can probably start to let
things<00:01:25.210> bottle<00:01:26.210> down<00:01:26.360> here<00:01:26.840> as<00:01:27.290> opposed<00:01:27.680> on

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
things bottle down here as opposed on

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.109 
things bottle down here as opposed on
the<00:01:28.040> landing<00:01:28.310> but<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.729> know<00:01:28.820> for<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.030> next

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
the landing but you know for the next

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.450 
the landing but you know for the next
month<00:01:29.450> or<00:01:29.660> so<00:01:29.720> I<00:01:29.840> think<00:01:29.960> I'll<00:01:30.229> just<00:01:30.590> play<00:01:31.430> it

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
month or so I think I'll just play it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.550 
month or so I think I'll just play it
the<00:01:31.640> way<00:01:31.670> i<00:01:31.790> have<00:01:32.030> done<00:01:32.330> with<00:01:33.080> things<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.410> little

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
the way i have done with things a little

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.180 
the way i have done with things a little
bit<00:01:33.770> warmer<00:01:34.759> upstairs<00:01:35.240> priming<00:01:36.050> son<00:01:36.290> stood<00:01:36.530> to

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
bit warmer upstairs priming son stood to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.920 
bit warmer upstairs priming son stood to
stay<00:01:37.399> that<00:01:37.430> way<00:01:37.790> but<00:01:37.850> i<00:01:38.030> think<00:01:38.360> we're<00:01:38.509> getting

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
stay that way but i think we're getting

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.260 
stay that way but i think we're getting
to<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.200> point<00:01:39.380> where<00:01:39.790> things<00:01:40.790> can<00:01:41.000> kind<00:01:41.240> of

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
to the point where things can kind of

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.380 
to the point where things can kind of
get<00:01:41.420> back<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.750> normal<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:42.890> brewers<00:01:43.820> best<00:01:44.090> says

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
get back to normal so brewers best says

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.380 
get back to normal so brewers best says

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
there right in the ballpark so anyway

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.309 
there right in the ballpark so anyway
this<00:02:37.459> one's<00:02:37.670> been<00:02:37.910> done<00:02:38.390> sitting<00:02:38.630> for<00:02:38.959> for

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319

this one's been done sitting for for
quite<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.560> while<00:02:39.770> I<00:02:39.830> would<00:02:40.310> say<00:02:40.430> it's<00:02:40.580> done<00:02:41.770> if

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
quite a while I would say it's done if

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.140 
quite a while I would say it's done if
we're<00:02:42.920> talking<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:43.550> we're<00:02:43.670> talking<00:02:43.819> maybe

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.370 

well<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:45.300> gets<00:03:45.450> better<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.810> better<00:03:45.959> each

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
well this gets better and better each

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.160 
well this gets better and better each
time<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.220> have<00:03:47.670> it<00:03:47.880> guess<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.599> did<00:03:48.810> have<00:03:48.959> one

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
time I I have it guess I did have one

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.070 
time I I have it guess I did have one
the<00:03:49.319> other<00:03:49.440> day<00:03:49.819> and<00:03:50.819> then<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.270> think<00:03:51.870> there's

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
the other day and then I think there's

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.930 
the other day and then I think there's
probably<00:03:52.260> 10<00:03:52.890> of<00:03:53.040> them<00:03:53.130> gone<00:03:53.340> because<00:03:53.640> the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
probably 10 of them gone because the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.449 
probably 10 of them gone because the
first<00:03:54.150> four<00:03:54.450> or<00:03:54.569> five<00:03:54.780> were<00:03:55.110> really<00:03:55.980> just<00:03:56.160> test

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.040 
first four or five were really just test

was<00:04:42.690> nine<00:04:42.930> days<00:04:43.200> in<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.620> primary<00:04:45.290> just

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
was nine days in the primary just

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.960 
was nine days in the primary just
because<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.680> saw<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:46.919> lot<00:04:47.160> of<00:04:47.190> activity<00:04:47.790> there

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
because I saw a lot of activity there

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.340 
because I saw a lot of activity there
and<00:04:48.150> I<00:04:48.210> just<00:04:48.360> wanted<00:04:48.479> to<00:04:48.630> let<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:48.870> play<00:04:48.990> out<00:04:49.080> but

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
and I just wanted to let it play out but

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.000 
and I just wanted to let it play out but
I<00:04:49.440> did<00:04:49.620> do<00:04:50.180> a<00:04:51.180> reading<00:04:52.140> on<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:52.530> today<00:04:52.680> and<00:04:52.950> it

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
I did do a reading on it today and it

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.860 
I did do a reading on it today and it
looked<00:04:53.190> like<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.340> pretty<00:04:53.729> much<00:04:53.880> spent<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:54.539> it

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
looked like it pretty much spent and it

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.850 
looked like it pretty much spent and it
was<00:04:56.660> sitting<00:04:57.660> at<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.840> level<00:04:58.320> where<00:04:58.470> I<00:04:58.590> felt

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
was sitting at a level where I felt

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.520 
was sitting at a level where I felt
comfortable<00:04:58.979> moving<00:04:59.430> it<00:04:59.669> over<00:04:59.760> to<00:05:00.090> the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
comfortable moving it over to the

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.719 
comfortable moving it over to the
secondary<00:05:01.530> so<00:05:01.890> I<00:05:01.919> think<00:05:02.100> we're<00:05:02.370> good<00:05:02.520> there

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
secondary so I think we're good there

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.890 
secondary so I think we're good there
now<00:05:03.360> to<00:05:03.419> boot<00:05:03.900> I'm<00:05:04.380> almost<00:05:04.710> out<00:05:04.979> of<00:05:05.220> the

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
now to boot I'm almost out of the

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.090 
now to boot I'm almost out of the
American<00:05:06.900> light<00:05:07.080> in<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.350> bottles<00:05:07.740> i<00:05:07.830> think<00:05:08.039> i

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
American light in the bottles i think i

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.710 
American light in the bottles i think i
have<00:05:08.130> maybe<00:05:08.460> eight<00:05:08.789> left<00:05:09.120> and<00:05:09.390> this<00:05:09.479> one's
