00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:11.730
 hello today we are operating 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.730
 table them the agenda and the sand and club 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.310
 of 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.000
 working condition on the floor of the worker 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.420
 state of the ball valve scutum 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.220
 maybe 100 percent wo n't start 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.919
 will miss you right away 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.919
 deaf what is the reason 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.320
 answering the fact that between petals and 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.260
 the basics 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.089
 confused grit some kind of garbage and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.870
 pit-stop does not raise that is not 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:51.410
 close the principle of the petal 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.410
 will tell 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.880
 it just comes in here fuel 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.940
 mixture 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.380
 questions let the fat opened then they 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:11.200
 need well for this prize have dare 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.200
 some part of the reason and puppies 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.110
 that 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.110
 vacuum is created 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.840
 snarling lube 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.119
 combustible mixture is not caused can 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.400
 a little bit 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.340
 as fact may still be the cause but it 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.430
 basically mounds on suzuki such 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.400
 the problem is the quality of the material 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.149
 here this one does not apply worse 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.830
 I can say the noise is original here see 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.649
 here the metal here is more than something 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.159
 rubberized 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.020
 here we take 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:54.289
 how is it a quality product 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.810
 the central petal is poorly understood all 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:01.700
 valve material created 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:06.259
 firmly some kind of plastic don't know so 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.239
 further here it is now these more alims 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.879
 materials are being developed 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.799
 created with a needle for pasha blurts out that his 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.349
 dad 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:18.349
 production is obtained on the material too 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:22.970
 will then not take 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:25.730
 the club is badly started but as a fact 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.040
 to restore such in advise yourself 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.220
 set although it was of such quality 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.640
 rebound runs out 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.690
 glass smooth sandpaper top over can 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.480
 disassemble the kaluga 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.870
 movements not strongly giving having 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.099
 I polish it to be perfectly smooth ps what 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.190
 can be restored 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.440
 valve everything will be ok you will 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:57.480
 wind up without problems 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:01.040
 so here but if the court in suzuka way 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.350
 gets one hundred percent trial 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.210
 dust and trash for so bad 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.370
 location of the air filter under 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.330
 wheel that is the summer period by 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:16.200
 primer will leave 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.930
 Do not start the release should ideally 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.550
 take well 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:27.290
 sand valve for suzuki too 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.290
 ammo on all
