00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.629 

okay<00:00:01.020> now<00:00:01.230> we<00:00:01.290> are<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:02.010> prepare<00:00:02.460> the

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
okay now we are going to prepare the

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.519 
okay now we are going to prepare the
pattern<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.240> like<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.810> do<00:00:03.899> things<00:00:04.110> differently

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
pattern I like to do things differently

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.530 
pattern I like to do things differently
I<00:00:04.620> never<00:00:05.040> buy<00:00:05.279> patterns<00:00:05.790> I<00:00:05.940> like<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.240> make<00:00:06.359> my

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
I never buy patterns I like to make my

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.080 
I never buy patterns I like to make my
own<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:07.049> that<00:00:07.500> way<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.649> can<00:00:07.799> make<00:00:08.130> them<00:00:08.280> exactly

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
own and that way I can make them exactly

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.060 
own and that way I can make them exactly
how<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.240> want<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.080> can<00:00:10.260> adjust<00:00:10.349> them<00:00:10.889> as

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
how I want and I can adjust them as

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.850 
how I want and I can adjust them as
needed<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.990> that<00:00:12.990> way<00:00:13.080> they<00:00:13.230> fit<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.710> way<00:00:13.830> I

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
needed and that way they fit the way I

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.340 
needed and that way they fit the way I
like<00:00:14.099> them<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.210> first<00:00:15.450> off<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.049> want<00:00:16.260> to

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
like them to so first off I want to

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.109 
like them to so first off I want to
think<00:00:16.650> about<00:00:16.770> what<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.190> want<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.699> look<00:00:17.850> like

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
think about what I want it to look like

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.650 
think about what I want it to look like
so<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:19.050> want<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.500> be<00:00:19.680> basically<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:21.330> shape

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
so we want it to be basically this shape

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.210 
so we want it to be basically this shape
you<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:21.900> your<00:00:22.199> top<00:00:22.439> shape<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.010> then<00:00:23.100> it's

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
you have your top shape and then it's

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.970 
you have your top shape and then it's
going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.430> come<00:00:23.609> out<00:00:23.789> straight<00:00:24.269> at<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> bottom

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
going to come out straight at the bottom

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.880 
going to come out straight at the bottom
like<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:27.960> straight<00:00:28.320> across<00:00:28.529> at<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
like that and straight across at the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.490 
like that and straight across at the
bottom<00:00:29.300> you<00:00:30.300> will<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> strap<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.080> will

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
bottom you will have a strap that will

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.680 
bottom you will have a strap that will
go<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.099> strap<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.030> will<00:00:33.120> go<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.360> here

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
go in here strap that will go in here

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.139 
go in here strap that will go in here
and<00:00:34.230> you'll<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.800> larger<00:00:35.309> straps<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and you'll have to larger straps on the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.540 
and you'll have to larger straps on the
sides<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.540> will<00:00:36.750> tie<00:00:36.930> around<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> back<00:00:37.550> now

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
sides that will tie around the back now

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.250 
sides that will tie around the back now
knowing<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.750> shape<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:40.110> want

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
knowing that this is the shape we want

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.450 
knowing that this is the shape we want
to<00:00:40.410> do<00:00:40.940> I'm<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> go<00:00:42.239> ahead<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.460> fold

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
to do I'm going to go ahead and fold

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.400 
to do I'm going to go ahead and fold
over<00:00:44.670> my<00:00:44.910> paper<00:00:47.780> you<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.930> use<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.110> newspaper

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
over my paper you can use a newspaper

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.470 
over my paper you can use a newspaper
whatever<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.309> want<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.640> careful<00:00:50.670> not<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> get

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
whatever you want be careful not to get

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.290 
whatever you want be careful not to get
your<00:00:51.890> material<00:00:52.890> all<00:00:53.039> dirty<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.030> doesn't

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
your material all dirty but it doesn't

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.369 
your material all dirty but it doesn't
have<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> clean<00:00:55.520> piece<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:58.140> then<00:00:58.260> I'm

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
have to be a clean piece and then I'm

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.470 
have to be a clean piece and then I'm
going<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.559> draw<00:00:58.800> half<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.609> what<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> need

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
going to draw half of what I need

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.450 
going to draw half of what I need
because<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.320> way<00:01:01.469> each<00:01:01.710> side<00:01:02.039> will<00:01:02.280> match

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
because that way each side will match

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.479 
because that way each side will match
and<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:04.110> paper<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.799> actually<00:01:05.339> as<00:01:05.460> long

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and this paper is not actually as long

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.490 
and this paper is not actually as long
as<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.270> want<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> go<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> won't

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
as what I want to go but that won't

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.950 
as what I want to go but that won't
matter<00:01:08.000> I'm<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.540> straight

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
matter I'm just going to go straight

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:27.109 
matter I'm just going to go straight
down<00:01:10.549> like<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:16.520> cut<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:26.119> if

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
down like that and then cut this out if

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.210 
down like that and then cut this out if
I<00:01:27.270> decide<00:01:27.659> that's<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.530> too<00:01:28.740> far<00:01:28.950> there

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
I decide that's going out too far there

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.219 
I decide that's going out too far there
I<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:29.909> change<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.780> while<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.020> cutting

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
I can just change it while I'm cutting

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.990 
I can just change it while I'm cutting
it<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.560> want<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.920> make<00:01:32.009> sure<00:01:32.040> both<00:01:32.400> sides<00:01:32.430> are

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
it you want to make sure both sides are

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.890 
it you want to make sure both sides are
the<00:01:33.900> same

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.560 

there's<00:01:39.900> my<00:01:40.229> pattern<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.009> then<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
there's my pattern and then for the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.139 
there's my pattern and then for the
straps<00:01:43.049> are<00:01:43.500> actually<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.250> straight<00:01:44.670> strips

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
straps are actually just straight strips

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.969 
straps are actually just straight strips
so<00:01:45.540> I'm<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.290> rip<00:01:46.560> those<00:01:46.740> from

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
so I'm going to just rip those from

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.710 
so I'm going to just rip those from
material<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.850> really<00:01:48.119> need<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.420> pattern

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
material I don't really need a pattern

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.630 
material I don't really need a pattern
for<00:01:49.049> them<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.590> make<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> pattern<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.399> lot<00:01:50.490> of

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
for them if I do make a pattern a lot of

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.910 
for them if I do make a pattern a lot of
times<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.030> add<00:01:51.630> sizes<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.470> seems<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.799> be

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
times I get add sizes it seems to be

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.069 
times I get add sizes it seems to be
more<00:01:53.070> uniform<00:01:53.520> if<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.909> rip<00:01:54.119> them<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.450> do

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
more uniform if I just rip them I do

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.469 
more uniform if I just rip them I do
like<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.350> mark<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.770> my<00:01:55.860> pattern<00:01:56.250> where<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.060> want

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
like to mark on my pattern where I want

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.770 
like to mark on my pattern where I want
to<00:01:57.570> put<00:01:57.719> my<00:01:57.869> straps<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.920> don't<00:01:59.189> forget<00:01:59.780> there

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
to put my straps so I don't forget there

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.999 
to put my straps so I don't forget there
just<00:02:00.899> pick<00:02:01.049> one<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.649> little<00:02:01.860> ones

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
just pick one up there and little ones
