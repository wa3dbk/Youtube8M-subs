got a quick update on the 50 gallon
planted<00:00:06.990> fish<00:00:07.140> tank<00:00:07.379> all<00:00:08.130> right<00:00:08.280> so<00:00:08.580> I

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
planted fish tank all right so I

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.200 
planted fish tank all right so I
mentioned<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.559> last<00:00:10.679> video<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:12.059> was

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
mentioned in the last video that I was

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.050 
mentioned in the last video that I was
gonna<00:00:12.389> get<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.920> new<00:00:13.920> filter<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:15.480> did<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:17.060> don't

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
gonna get a new filter and I did I don't

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.590 
gonna get a new filter and I did I don't
know<00:00:18.119> if<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:19.670> blocking<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.150> mean<00:00:21.570> I

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
know if that blocking that I mean I

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.840 
know if that blocking that I mean I
don't<00:00:21.720> know<00:00:21.840> if<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.020> are<00:00:22.170> seen<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:22.789> see<00:00:23.789> if

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
don't know if you are seen it but see if

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.160 
don't know if you are seen it but see if
you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.560> guess<00:00:25.560> before<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.789> actually<00:00:27.779> show<00:00:27.990> you

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
you can guess before I actually show you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.700 
you can guess before I actually show you
what<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.160> see<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:30.500> parts<00:00:31.500> right

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
what it is you can see the parts right

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.590 
what it is you can see the parts right
there<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.930> don't<00:00:33.930> mind<00:00:34.200> my<00:00:35.360> really<00:00:36.360> really

there and don't mind my really really
cloudy<00:00:37.020> slash<00:00:37.649> algae<00:00:38.190> blooming<00:00:38.550> water<00:00:38.760> I'm

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
cloudy slash algae blooming water I'm

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.080 
cloudy slash algae blooming water I'm
still<00:00:41.239> trying<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.300> deal<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:44.090> algae

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
still trying to deal with the the algae

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
still trying to deal with the the algae
problem<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.770> oh<00:00:48.289> no<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:49.860> hard

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
problem here oh no it's just really hard

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.189 
problem here oh no it's just really hard
to<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.340> rid<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.579> I've<00:00:51.030> narrowed<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.600> down<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.319 

narrowed<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> down<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:56.399> few<00:00:56.699> things<00:00:56.760> well<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
narrowed it down to a few things well it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.849 
narrowed it down to a few things well it
can't<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.660> over<00:00:57.989> feeding<00:00:58.260> because<00:00:58.620> I'm<00:00:58.739> only

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
can't be over feeding because I'm only

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.520 
can't be over feeding because I'm only
feeding<00:00:59.129> once<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.520> day<00:00:59.670> can't<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.780> excess<00:01:01.320> light

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
feeding once a day can't be excess light

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.959 
feeding once a day can't be excess light
because<00:01:01.800> I'm<00:01:01.890> only<00:01:01.980> running<00:01:02.190> six<00:01:02.579> hours<00:01:02.850> of

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
because I'm only running six hours of

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.170 
because I'm only running six hours of
light<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> day<00:01:03.830> can't<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:05.040> accessed<00:01:05.790> nutrients

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
light a day can't be accessed nutrients

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.810 
light a day can't be accessed nutrients
in<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.650> substrate<00:01:08.130> because<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.430> got<00:01:08.640> rid

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
in the in a substrate because I got rid

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.140 
in the in a substrate because I got rid
of<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.090> soil<00:01:09.630> base<00:01:09.840> substrate<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:11.760> plants

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
of the soil base substrate the plants

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
of the soil base substrate the plants
wouldn't<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.540> affecting<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:15.170> well<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.830> I'm

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
wouldn't be affecting it well and I'm

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
wouldn't be affecting it well and I'm
not<00:01:17.220> dosing<00:01:17.850> too<00:01:18.000> much<00:01:18.150> or<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.390> fertilizer<00:01:18.869> so

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
not dosing too much or the fertilizer so

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.920 
not dosing too much or the fertilizer so
that<00:01:19.350> can't<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.680> doing<00:01:19.950> anything<00:01:20.810> what<00:01:21.810> I've

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that can't be doing anything what I've

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.140 
that can't be doing anything what I've
heard<00:01:22.259> from<00:01:22.470> my<00:01:22.650> local<00:01:23.009> pet<00:01:23.189> store<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.460> we've

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
heard from my local pet store and we've

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.580 
heard from my local pet store and we've
kind<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.450> came<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.750> conclusion<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.439> it's

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
kind of came to the conclusion I it's

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.920 
kind of came to the conclusion I it's
basically<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:27.000> new<00:01:27.150> tank<00:01:27.450> syndrome

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
basically just the new tank syndrome

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.590 
basically just the new tank syndrome
because<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.500> did<00:01:28.770> flush<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.369> tank<00:01:29.579> down<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
because I did flush the tank down and it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.270 
because I did flush the tank down and it
did<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.650> sometimes<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.250> just

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
did have this and and sometimes you just

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.030 
did have this and and sometimes you just
have<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.549> let<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> tank<00:01:33.590> like<00:01:34.590> play<00:01:34.890> its

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
have to let the tank like play its

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.170 
have to let the tank like play its
course<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> run<00:01:36.600> through<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.850> first<00:01:38.850> stages

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
course and run through the first stages

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.480 
course and run through the first stages
building<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.079> bacteria<00:01:40.259> which<00:01:41.250> will

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
building up the good bacteria which will

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.090 
building up the good bacteria which will
eventually<00:01:41.700> out-compete<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.600> algae<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
eventually out-compete the algae and and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.649 
eventually out-compete the algae and and
or<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.509> algae<00:01:45.960> will<00:01:46.140> basically<00:01:47.210> like<00:01:48.210> reach<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
or the algae will basically like reach a

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.920 
or the algae will basically like reach a
climax<00:01:49.049> community<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.540> they<00:01:51.540> won't<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.810> able

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
climax community and they won't be able

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.749 
climax community and they won't be able
to<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.710> there<00:01:52.829> won't<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.040> enough<00:01:53.220> nutrients

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
to like there won't be enough nutrients

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.069 
to like there won't be enough nutrients
in<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.909> water<00:01:54.119> column<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.479> support<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
in the water column to support that

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.899 
in the water column to support that
community<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> community<00:01:56.219> will<00:01:56.729> just

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
community so the community will just

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.350 
community so the community will just
crash<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:58.009> then<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.729> beneficial<00:02:00.329> bacteria

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
crash and then the beneficial bacteria

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.670 
crash and then the beneficial bacteria
will<00:02:00.899> move<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.500> start<00:02:01.799> doing<00:02:02.060> all<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
will move in and start doing all the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.399 
will move in and start doing all the
doing<00:02:04.680> all<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.979> good<00:02:05.189> things<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.259> can

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
doing all the good things so you can

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.390 
doing all the good things so you can
really<00:02:08.149> can<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.239> look<00:02:09.420> up<00:02:09.539> at<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> lights<00:02:10.400> you

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
really can you look up at the lights you

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.339 
really can you look up at the lights you
can<00:02:11.580> actually<00:02:12.150> physically<00:02:12.599> see

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
can actually physically see

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.619 
can actually physically see
the<00:02:13.980> bloom<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:14.849> see<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.269> like<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
the bloom and you can see that like the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
three hundred dollars I paid for this

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.200 
three hundred dollars I paid for this
it's<00:04:43.320> worth<00:04:43.620> every<00:04:43.950> penny<00:04:43.980> because<00:04:44.520> down<00:04:45.180> the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
it's worth every penny because down the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.580 
it's worth every penny because down the
road<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.660> would<00:04:45.750> be<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.840> lot<00:04:46.140> less<00:04:46.320> maintenance

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
road it would be a lot less maintenance

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.590 
road it would be a lot less maintenance
on<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.100> tank<00:04:47.310> because<00:04:47.610> this<00:04:47.790> will<00:04:48.000> be<00:04:48.390> doing

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
on the tank because this will be doing

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.420 
on the tank because this will be doing
most<00:04:48.840> of<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:48.990> filtration<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.860> I'll<00:04:50.220> probably

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
most of the filtration and I'll probably

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.700 
most of the filtration and I'll probably
only<00:04:50.610> once<00:04:51.120> this<00:04:51.240> tank<00:04:51.510> kind<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.840> gets<00:04:52.590> the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
only once this tank kind of gets the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.380 
only once this tank kind of gets the
algae<00:04:53.040> problem<00:04:53.370> figured<00:04:53.700> out<00:04:53.850> down<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.270> road

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
algae problem figured out down the road

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.430 
algae problem figured out down the road
I'll<00:04:54.570> probably<00:04:54.720> gonna<00:04:54.900> have<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.080> clean<00:04:55.290> this

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
I'll probably gonna have to clean this

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.950 
I'll probably gonna have to clean this
like<00:04:55.620> once<00:04:56.190> every<00:04:56.460> three<00:04:56.729> weeks<00:04:56.880> maybe<00:04:57.780> even

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
like once every three weeks maybe even

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.240 
like once every three weeks maybe even
every<00:04:58.229> month<00:04:58.590> so<00:04:59.190> because<00:04:59.940> of<00:05:00.090> this<00:05:01.160> so<00:05:02.160> it's

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
every month so because of this so it's

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.040 
every month so because of this so it's
been<00:05:02.430> three<00:05:02.790> days<00:05:02.820> since<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:05.450> mechanical<00:05:06.450> and

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
been three days since the mechanical and

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.659 
been three days since the mechanical and
chemical<00:05:07.260> yeah<00:05:07.830> it<00:05:07.979> sucks<00:05:08.250> you<00:05:08.370> can't<00:05:08.550> really

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
chemical yeah it sucks you can't really

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.680 
chemical yeah it sucks you can't really
see<00:05:08.850> this<00:05:08.940> on<00:05:09.120> this<00:05:09.240> camera<00:05:09.479> but<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:11.690> intake

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
see this on this camera but the intake

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.130 
see this on this camera but the intake
tube<00:05:13.260> and<00:05:13.590> then<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.250> outtake<00:05:14.669> two<00:05:15.150> right

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
tube and then the outtake two right

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.070 
tube and then the outtake two right
there<00:05:16.340> water<00:05:17.340> goes<00:05:17.580> down<00:05:17.990> through<00:05:18.990> the

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
there water goes down through the

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.120 
there water goes down through the
mechanic<00:05:19.650> I<00:05:19.800> know<00:05:19.860> mechanical<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:20.669> then

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
mechanic I know mechanical and then

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.460 
mechanic I know mechanical and then
circles<00:05:23.130> around<00:05:23.220> through<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:24.260> carbon<00:05:25.260> and

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
circles around through the carbon and

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.560 
circles around through the carbon and
then<00:05:25.650> through<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.220> biological<00:05:26.400> media<00:05:27.330> you

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
then through the biological media you

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.659 
then through the biological media you
can<00:05:27.690> actually<00:05:27.960> switch<00:05:28.169> out<00:05:28.320> cartridges<00:05:28.919> like

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
can actually switch out cartridges like

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.990 
can actually switch out cartridges like
I'll<00:05:29.850> show<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.180> right<00:05:30.510> now<00:05:30.570> quickly<00:05:32.000> just

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
here this leader here all the water

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.010 
here this leader here all the water
coming<00:05:44.190> down<00:05:44.310> will<00:05:44.789> lift<00:05:44.970> up<00:05:45.210> that<00:05:45.930> uh<00:05:48.020> here's

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
coming down will lift up that uh here's

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.650 
coming down will lift up that uh here's
the<00:05:49.200> lid<00:05:49.970> for<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.090> two<00:05:51.240> cartridges<00:05:51.630> you<00:05:52.440> just

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
the lid for the two cartridges you just

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.219 
the lid for the two cartridges you just
tap<00:05:54.660> system

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
tap system

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.830 
tap system
unlocks<00:05:55.680> it<00:05:57.620> there's<00:05:58.620> the<00:05:58.919> mechanical<00:05:59.660> as<00:06:00.660> you

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
unlocks it there's the mechanical as you

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.580 
unlocks it there's the mechanical as you
can<00:06:00.990> see<00:06:02.060> it's<00:06:03.060> kind<00:06:03.270> of<00:06:03.360> greenish<00:06:03.660> because

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
can see it's kind of greenish because

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.550 
can see it's kind of greenish because
there's<00:06:04.800> so<00:06:05.010> much<00:06:05.160> freaking<00:06:06.169> so<00:06:07.169> much<00:06:07.320> brick

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
there's so much freaking so much brick

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.700 
there's so much freaking so much brick

my<00:06:10.639> tank<00:06:12.699> near<00:06:13.699> the<00:06:13.789> water<00:06:14.000> going<00:06:14.270> back<00:06:14.539> down

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
my tank near the water going back down

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:20.590 
my tank near the water going back down
in<00:06:15.009> this<00:06:16.180> twist<00:06:17.180> to<00:06:17.330> walk<00:06:17.479> it<00:06:17.660> back<00:06:17.810> in<00:06:19.600> there's

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
in this twist to walk it back in there's

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:43.360 
in this twist to walk it back in there's
the<00:06:20.870> carbon<00:06:21.940> right<00:06:22.940> there<00:06:41.860> whatever<00:06:42.860> I'll

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
the carbon right there whatever I'll

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.409 
the carbon right there whatever I'll
figure<00:06:43.430> that<00:06:43.789> out<00:06:43.970> later

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
figure that out later

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.189 
figure that out later
um<00:06:45.009> so<00:06:46.009> yeah<00:06:46.250> that's<00:06:46.940> basically<00:06:47.120> what<00:06:47.870> I<00:06:47.900> added

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
um so yeah that's basically what I added

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.260 
um so yeah that's basically what I added
on<00:06:48.470> to<00:06:48.590> the<00:06:48.680> tank<00:06:48.940> if<00:06:49.940> you<00:06:50.030> have<00:06:50.150> any

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
on to the tank if you have any

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.909 
on to the tank if you have any
