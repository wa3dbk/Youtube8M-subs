okay guys so today we are going to be
working<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> modified<00:00:31.770> version<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.370> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
working on a modified version of the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.970 
working on a modified version of the
elbow<00:00:33.030> thrust<00:00:33.390> now<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.470> a<00:00:34.500> pretty<00:00:34.739> simple

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
elbow thrust now this is a pretty simple

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.950 
elbow thrust now this is a pretty simple
technique<00:00:35.580> and<00:00:35.850> there's<00:00:36.030> very<00:00:36.330> few<00:00:36.420> ways<00:00:36.930> you

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
technique and there's very few ways you

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.170 
technique and there's very few ways you
can<00:00:37.379> use<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.400> this<00:00:38.489> will<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> shorter

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
can use it so this will be a shorter

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.390 
can use it so this will be a shorter
tutorial<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.350> basic<00:00:40.680> concept<00:00:40.830> of<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
tutorial but the basic concept of the

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.540 
tutorial but the basic concept of the
strike<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.300> stab<00:00:42.870> forward<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:44.370> your

up and warmed up properly from here

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.450 
up and warmed up properly from here
let's<00:01:00.479> say<00:01:00.629> our<00:01:00.809> opponent<00:01:01.350> throws<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.949> right

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
let's say our opponent throws a right

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.890 
let's say our opponent throws a right
hook<00:01:03.229> instead<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.379> doing<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.890> short<00:01:05.370> cover<00:01:05.900> what

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
hook instead of doing a short cover what

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.000 
hook instead of doing a short cover what
we're<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.440> is<00:01:07.650> we're<00:01:07.799> going<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.320 
we're going to do is we're going to
cover<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.729> we're<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> make<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
cover but we're going to make it a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.899 
cover but we're going to make it a
deeper<00:01:09.659> cover<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.229> our<00:01:10.350> shoulder<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.979> elbow

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
deeper cover so our shoulder and elbow

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.080

right<00:02:10.979> back<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.550> you're<00:02:11.970> covered<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.840> from

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
right back in so you're covered so from

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:21.380 
right back in so you're covered so from
here

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.000 

now<00:02:22.390> as<00:02:22.570> you<00:02:22.720> can<00:02:22.840> tell<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.440> an<00:02:23.560> extremely

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
now as you can tell this is an extremely

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.940 
now as you can tell this is an extremely
close<00:02:24.490> range<00:02:24.820> strike<00:02:25.330> if<00:02:25.870> he<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.260> an<00:02:26.440> elbow

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
close range strike if he is an elbow

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.970 
close range strike if he is an elbow
range<00:02:27.250> or<00:02:27.640> close<00:02:28.180> punching<00:02:28.750> range<00:02:29.020> this<00:02:29.770> would

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
range or close punching range this would

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.390 
range or close punching range this would
be<00:02:30.070> a<00:02:30.100> good<00:02:30.310> time<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.580> do<00:02:30.850> this<00:02:31.290> cover<00:02:32.400> strike

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
be a good time to do this cover strike

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.850 
be a good time to do this cover strike
now<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.450> can<00:02:34.750> also<00:02:34.870> do<00:02:35.230> this<00:02:35.380> strike<00:02:35.650> with<00:02:35.830> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
now you can also do this strike with the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.290 
now you can also do this strike with the
rear<00:02:36.100> arm<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:36.520> it's<00:02:36.640> not<00:02:36.820> going<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.120> be<00:02:37.210> as

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
rear arm but it's not going to be as

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.960 
rear arm but it's not going to be as
powerful<00:02:37.510> because<00:02:38.200> from<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.340> position<00:02:39.520> it's

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
powerful because from this position it's

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.300 
powerful because from this position it's
much<00:02:40.150> harder<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.570> turn<00:02:40.990> your<00:02:41.260> hips<00:02:41.530> completely

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
much harder to turn your hips completely

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.280 
much harder to turn your hips completely
sideways<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.060> that's<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.750> only<00:02:44.080> thing

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
sideways and that's the only thing

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.920 
sideways and that's the only thing
that's<00:02:44.470> gonna<00:02:44.620> allow<00:02:44.980> us<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.250> jam<00:02:46.240> our<00:02:46.510> elbow

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
that's gonna allow us to jam our elbow

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.840 
that's gonna allow us to jam our elbow
forward<00:02:47.230> because<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.800> shoulder<00:02:48.190> joint<00:02:48.430> only

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
forward because the shoulder joint only

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.150 
forward because the shoulder joint only
goes<00:02:49.060> up<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.630> down<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:50.290> doesn't<00:02:50.590> go<00:02:50.830> forward

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
goes up and down it doesn't go forward

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.670 
goes up and down it doesn't go forward
but<00:02:51.490> a<00:02:51.520> few<00:02:51.760> inches<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.840> order<00:02:52.990> to<00:02:53.260> get<00:02:53.500> that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
but a few inches so in order to get that

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.790 
but a few inches so in order to get that
forward<00:02:54.280> motion<00:02:54.610> we<00:02:55.360> have<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.810> twist<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.620> hips

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
forward motion we have to twist the hips

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.630 
forward motion we have to twist the hips
to<00:02:57.160> get<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.520> elbow<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.570> move<00:02:58.780> forward<00:02:59.320> so<00:02:59.640> from

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
to get the elbow to move forward so from

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.950 
to get the elbow to move forward so from
here<00:03:00.850> if<00:03:00.970> we're<00:03:01.090> going<00:03:01.240> to<00:03:01.330> do<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.570> rear<00:03:01.750> arm

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
here if we're going to do the rear arm

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.680 
here if we're going to do the rear arm
off<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.770> cover<00:03:03.010> or<00:03:03.340> just<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.210> raise<00:03:04.390> your

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
off of a cover or just to raise your

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.620 
off of a cover or just to raise your
your<00:03:04.990> elbow<00:03:05.350> up<00:03:05.670> you're<00:03:06.670> going<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.030> have<00:03:07.180> to

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
your elbow up you're going to have to

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.090 
your elbow up you're going to have to
really<00:03:08.350> turn<00:03:09.810> your<00:03:10.810> hips<00:03:11.140> over<00:03:11.410> in<00:03:11.740> order<00:03:11.920> to

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
really turn your hips over in order to

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.240 
really turn your hips over in order to
get<00:03:12.220> your<00:03:12.310> shoulder<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.820> push<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.270> elbow<00:03:13.630> in

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
get your shoulder to push that elbow in

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.370 
get your shoulder to push that elbow in
so<00:03:15.250> from<00:03:15.430> here<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.840> you're<00:03:19.960> gonna<00:03:20.110> have<00:03:20.350> a

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
so from here and you're gonna have a

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.950 
so from here and you're gonna have a
little<00:03:20.770> bit<00:03:20.890> less<00:03:21.100> range<00:03:21.430> than<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:22.090> front<00:03:22.690> arm

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
little bit less range than the front arm

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.110 
little bit less range than the front arm
which<00:03:23.560> doesn't<00:03:23.980> have<00:03:24.100> much<00:03:24.310> range<00:03:24.610> to<00:03:24.820> begin

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
which doesn't have much range to begin

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.110 
which doesn't have much range to begin
with<00:03:25.300> so<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.200> can<00:03:26.650> do<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.010> with<00:03:27.190> both<00:03:27.400> arms<00:03:27.730> but

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
with so you can do it with both arms but

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:47.850 
with so you can do it with both arms but
it<00:03:28.240> is<00:03:28.360> more<00:03:28.540> effective<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.200> lead<00:03:29.350> arm

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.500 

now<00:03:48.860> in<00:03:49.010> order<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.310> get<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.550> maximum<00:03:50.120> power<00:03:50.240> in

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
now in order to get the maximum power in

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.750 
now in order to get the maximum power in
this<00:03:50.630> strike<00:03:50.960> you<00:03:51.230> have<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:52.010> move<00:03:52.370> your<00:03:52.580> body

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
this strike you have to move your body

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.240 
this strike you have to move your body
way<00:03:53.090> in<00:03:53.300> the<00:03:53.420> direction<00:03:53.720> of<00:03:53.960> the<00:03:54.080> strike<00:03:54.350> since

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
way in the direction of the strike since

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.640 
way in the direction of the strike since
this<00:03:55.520> strike<00:03:55.790> is<00:03:55.820> travelling<00:03:56.510> forward<00:03:56.870> we

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
this strike is travelling forward we

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.760 
this strike is travelling forward we
have<00:03:57.860> to<00:03:58.010> move<00:03:58.280> our<00:03:58.670> body<00:03:58.940> weight<00:03:59.210> forward

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
have to move our body weight forward

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.770 
have to move our body weight forward
with<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:00.920> strike<00:04:01.220> as<00:04:01.430> we<00:04:01.760> hit<00:04:01.940> one<00:04:02.600> thing

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
with the strike as we hit one thing

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.270 
with the strike as we hit one thing
people<00:04:02.900> do<00:04:03.170> is<00:04:03.320> they<00:04:03.440> combine<00:04:03.800> an<00:04:03.950> elbow

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
people do is they combine an elbow

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.370 
people do is they combine an elbow
thrust<00:04:04.610> with<00:04:04.970> an<00:04:05.150> upward<00:04:05.360> elbow<00:04:05.840> strike

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
thrust with an upward elbow strike

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.290 
thrust with an upward elbow strike
so<00:04:06.740> from<00:04:06.890> here<00:04:06.920> they<00:04:07.310> would<00:04:07.520> raise<00:04:08.090> their

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
so from here they would raise their

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.620 
so from here they would raise their
elbow<00:04:08.600> up<00:04:08.840> as<00:04:09.080> they<00:04:09.470> push<00:04:09.710> forward<00:04:10.220> now<00:04:11.150> what's

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
elbow up as they push forward now what's

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.500 
elbow up as they push forward now what's
happening<00:04:12.020> there<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:12.640> as<00:04:13.640> I<00:04:13.790> said<00:04:14.060> your

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
happening there is as I said your

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.199 
happening there is as I said your
shoulder<00:04:14.870> only<00:04:15.140> goes<00:04:15.290> up<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.620> down<00:04:15.680> okay<00:04:16.310> so

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
shoulder only goes up and down okay so

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.670 
shoulder only goes up and down okay so
if<00:04:17.600> you're<00:04:17.780> moving<00:04:17.989> your<00:04:18.230> body<00:04:18.440> weight

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
if you're moving your body weight

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.880 
if you're moving your body weight
forward<00:04:19.040> while<00:04:19.640> your<00:04:19.820> shoulder<00:04:20.120> is<00:04:20.180> going<00:04:20.209> up

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
forward while your shoulder is going up

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.410 
forward while your shoulder is going up
you're<00:04:21.890> gonna<00:04:22.040> have<00:04:22.280> your<00:04:22.460> momentum<00:04:22.970> going<00:04:23.210> in

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
you're gonna have your momentum going in

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.240 
you're gonna have your momentum going in
two<00:04:23.600> different<00:04:23.720> directions<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.650> you're<00:04:25.100> not

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
two different directions and you're not

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.190 
two different directions and you're not
going<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.520> benefit<00:04:25.940> much<00:04:26.120> from<00:04:26.420> it<00:04:26.450> if<00:04:27.050> you

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
going to benefit much from it if you

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.080 
going to benefit much from it if you

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
want to benefit from putting your body

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.690 
want to benefit from putting your body
weight<00:04:29.300> behind<00:04:29.480> any<00:04:30.020> stripes<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:31.190> has<00:04:31.430> to<00:04:31.610> be

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
weight behind any stripes it has to be

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.340 
weight behind any stripes it has to be
going<00:04:31.850> in<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.150> same<00:04:32.180> direction<00:04:32.600> as<00:04:33.110> the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
going in the same direction as the

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.300 
going in the same direction as the
strike<00:04:33.650> so<00:04:34.550> if<00:04:34.760> I<00:04:34.910> was<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.180> do<00:04:35.300> an<00:04:35.420> elbow<00:04:35.600> thrust

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
strike so if I was to do an elbow thrust

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.620 
strike so if I was to do an elbow thrust
it<00:04:37.310> wouldn't<00:04:37.700> make<00:04:37.790> any<00:04:37.850> sense<00:04:38.060> for<00:04:38.510> me<00:04:38.600> to

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
it wouldn't make any sense for me to

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.800 
it wouldn't make any sense for me to
move<00:04:38.780> my<00:04:38.960> body<00:04:39.370> upward<00:04:40.370> because<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.420> strike

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
move my body upward because the strike

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.020 
move my body upward because the strike
is<00:04:41.990> traveling<00:04:42.440> forward<00:04:42.920> so<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.490> have<00:04:43.730> to<00:04:43.850> move

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
is traveling forward so I have to move

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.450 
is traveling forward so I have to move
my<00:04:44.090> strength<00:04:44.570> with<00:04:44.960> be<00:04:46.210> thrust<00:04:47.500> forward<00:04:48.500> now

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
my strength with be thrust forward now

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.520 
my strength with be thrust forward now
if<00:04:49.760> I<00:04:49.880> was<00:04:50.000> doing<00:04:50.030> an<00:04:50.330> elbow<00:04:50.720> upward<00:04:51.200> elbow

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
if I was doing an elbow upward elbow

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.490 
if I was doing an elbow upward elbow
here<00:04:52.130> it<00:04:53.090> wouldn't<00:04:53.390> make<00:04:53.540> much<00:04:53.900> sense<00:04:54.140> for<00:04:54.290> me

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
here it wouldn't make much sense for me

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.950 
here it wouldn't make much sense for me
to<00:04:54.650> move<00:04:54.830> forward<00:04:55.790> except<00:04:56.510> maybe<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.750> close

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
to move forward except maybe to close

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.350 
to move forward except maybe to close
the<00:04:57.169> distance<00:04:57.350> but<00:04:57.860> as<00:04:58.430> far<00:04:58.790> as<00:04:58.940> putting<00:04:59.210> your

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
the distance but as far as putting your

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.210 
the distance but as far as putting your
body<00:04:59.720> weight<00:04:59.990> into<00:05:00.140> the<00:05:00.260> strike<00:05:00.620> is<00:05:00.800> concerned

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
body weight into the strike is concerned

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.020 
body weight into the strike is concerned
I<00:05:01.520> have<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.480> push<00:05:03.320> my<00:05:03.560> body<00:05:03.800> weight<00:05:04.130> and<00:05:04.340> an

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
I have to push my body weight and an

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.940 
I have to push my body weight and an
upward<00:05:05.480> angle<00:05:05.510> so<00:05:06.200> if<00:05:06.290> I<00:05:06.380> was<00:05:06.500> throwing<00:05:06.710> this

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
upward angle so if I was throwing this

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.250 
upward angle so if I was throwing this
upward<00:05:07.400> strike<00:05:07.700> I<00:05:08.000> would<00:05:08.480> push<00:05:08.810> off<00:05:09.050> the

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
upward strike I would push off the

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.290 
upward strike I would push off the
ground<00:05:09.340> raise<00:05:10.340> my<00:05:10.550> body<00:05:10.850> upward<00:05:12.820> now<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.880> same

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
ground raise my body upward now the same

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.390 
ground raise my body upward now the same
rule<00:05:14.570> applies<00:05:14.960> with<00:05:15.230> all<00:05:15.440> striking

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
rule applies with all striking

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.760 
rule applies with all striking
techniques<00:05:16.880> it<00:05:17.510> wouldn't<00:05:17.930> make<00:05:18.080> sense<00:05:18.140> to

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
techniques it wouldn't make sense to

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.480 
techniques it wouldn't make sense to
throw<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:19.400> roundhouse<00:05:20.210> with<00:05:20.720> your<00:05:20.900> knee

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
throw a roundhouse with your knee

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.440 
throw a roundhouse with your knee
pointed<00:05:22.490> upward<00:05:22.940> because<00:05:24.100> your<00:05:25.100> lower<00:05:25.790> leg<00:05:26.090> is

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
pointed upward because your lower leg is

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.320 
pointed upward because your lower leg is
the<00:05:26.810> momentum<00:05:27.320> is<00:05:27.380> going<00:05:27.500> up<00:05:27.800> and<00:05:28.190> your<00:05:28.970> upper

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
the momentum is going up and your upper

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.720 
the momentum is going up and your upper
leg<00:05:29.480> no<00:05:29.630> momentum<00:05:30.050> is<00:05:30.169> going<00:05:30.260> sideways<00:05:30.730> so

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
leg no momentum is going sideways so

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.780 
leg no momentum is going sideways so
you're<00:05:32.000> not<00:05:32.440> benefitting<00:05:33.440> from<00:05:33.590> that<00:05:34.100> from

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
you're not benefitting from that from

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.330 
you're not benefitting from that from
that<00:05:34.970> combined<00:05:35.390> movement<00:05:35.990> if<00:05:36.410> you<00:05:36.470> want<00:05:36.800> all

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
that combined movement if you want all

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.920 
that combined movement if you want all
of<00:05:37.400> your<00:05:37.820> mass<00:05:38.030> going<00:05:38.480> in<00:05:38.600> the<00:05:38.690> same<00:05:38.870> direction

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
of your mass going in the same direction

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.060 
of your mass going in the same direction
so<00:05:39.880> from<00:05:40.880> here<00:05:41.060> I'd<00:05:41.210> have<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.570> turn<00:05:42.010> my<00:05:43.010> knee

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
so from here I'd have to turn my knee

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.330 
so from here I'd have to turn my knee
over<00:05:43.870> and<00:05:44.870> kick<00:05:45.110> through<00:05:45.410> so<00:05:45.680> now<00:05:45.710> my<00:05:45.980> upper

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
over and kick through so now my upper

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.790 
over and kick through so now my upper
leg<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.580> lower<00:05:46.880> leg<00:05:47.180> are<00:05:47.570> going<00:05:48.260> in<00:05:48.410> the<00:05:48.530> same

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
leg and lower leg are going in the same

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.090 
leg and lower leg are going in the same
direction<00:05:48.970> not<00:05:49.970> one<00:05:50.300> going<00:05:50.600> up<00:05:50.750> and<00:05:50.810> one<00:05:51.050> going

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
direction not one going up and one going

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.730 
direction not one going up and one going
I'm<00:05:52.460> not<00:05:52.640> dividing<00:05:53.150> my<00:05:53.270> momentum<00:05:53.840> for<00:05:54.590> this

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
I'm not dividing my momentum for this

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.070 
I'm not dividing my momentum for this
straight
