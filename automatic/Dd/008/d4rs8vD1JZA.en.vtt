it might be a little bit annoying but
after<00:00:40.200> playing<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.070> while<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.280> can

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
after playing with it for a while I can

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.580 
after playing with it for a while I can
tell<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.910> guys<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.110> definitely<00:00:43.290> not

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
tell you guys but that is definitely not

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.560 
tell you guys but that is definitely not
the<00:00:43.739> case<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.399> thing<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.760> not<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.420> that

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the case this thing is not really that

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
the case this thing is not really that
overpowered<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.320> has<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> lot<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.890> bullet<00:00:47.250> drop

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
overpowered it has a lot of bullet drop

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.380 
overpowered it has a lot of bullet drop
on<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> default<00:00:48.239> bolt<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:49.110> takes<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.680> lot<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
on the default bolt it takes a lot of

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.459 
on the default bolt it takes a lot of
compensation<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> get<00:00:51.660> anyone<00:00:52.050> outside<00:00:52.260> of

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
compensation to get anyone outside of

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.200 
compensation to get anyone outside of
like<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> medium<00:00:53.129> range<00:00:53.430> because<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.789> does<00:00:54.000> hit

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
like a medium range because it does hit

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.150 
like a medium range because it does hit
the<00:00:54.329> dirt<00:00:54.510> quite<00:00:54.809> quickly<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.829> does<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the dirt quite quickly but it does the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.770 
the dirt quite quickly but it does the
most<00:00:56.340> damage<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.539> biggest

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
most damage so that is the biggest

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.389 
most damage so that is the biggest
upside<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.500> thing<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.949> I'm<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.370> a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
upside of this thing is I'm going on a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.860 
upside of this thing is I'm going on a
pretty<00:00:59.640> good<00:00:59.760> streak<00:01:00.030> right<00:01:00.210> here<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.660> i

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
pretty good streak right here but i

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.479 
pretty good streak right here but i
found<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.379> works<00:01:01.590> better<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.250> close

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
found it works better in like close

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.250 
found it works better in like close

to unlock that balance bolt because it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.949 
to unlock that balance bolt because it

much

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.900 
much
easier<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.709> maintain<00:02:13.950> however<00:02:14.670> you're<00:02:14.880> going

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
easier to maintain however you're going

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.699 
easier to maintain however you're going
to<00:02:15.180> have<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.450> get<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.630> headshot<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.319> not<00:02:16.500> going

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
to have to get a headshot it's not going

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.620 
to have to get a headshot it's not going
to<00:02:16.830> be<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:17.610> hit<00:02:18.480> them

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
to be like you can just hit them

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.970 
to be like you can just hit them
anywhere<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.110> body<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.470> get<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.590> one-shot

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
anywhere in the body and get a one-shot

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.590 
anywhere in the body and get a one-shot
kill<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.340> has<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.850> headshot<00:02:21.270> with<00:02:21.450> that

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
kill it has to be a headshot with that

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.510 
kill it has to be a headshot with that
one<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.780> think<00:02:22.050> they<00:02:22.200> get<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.380> kill<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.400> is

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
one I think they get a kill so that is

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.370 
one I think they get a kill so that is
the<00:02:23.670> downside<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.300> whereas<00:02:24.630> with<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
the downside to it whereas with this it

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.650 
the downside to it whereas with this it
does<00:02:25.980> more<00:02:26.160> damage<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:26.940> also<00:02:27.090> has<00:02:27.390> like

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
does more damage but it also has like

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.350 
does more damage but it also has like
insane<00:02:28.080> bullet<00:02:28.500> drops<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:28.980> i<00:02:29.400> can<00:02:30.120> imagine

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
insane bullet drops so i can imagine

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.090 
insane bullet drops so i can imagine
once<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.959> games<00:02:31.170> out<00:02:31.319> for<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.560> while<00:02:31.709> we'll<00:02:31.950> see

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
once the games out for a while we'll see

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.830 
once the games out for a while we'll see
some<00:02:32.310> pretty<00:02:32.550> crazy<00:02:32.850> shots<00:02:33.480> with<00:02:33.690> this

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
some pretty crazy shots with this

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.900 
some pretty crazy shots with this
particular<00:02:34.020> bolt<00:02:34.620> but<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.520> i<00:02:35.550> said<00:02:35.640> it's

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
particular bolt but like i said it's

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.910 
particular bolt but like i said it's
most<00:02:36.120> effective<00:02:36.270> up<00:02:36.750> close<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.319> it's<00:02:37.590> not

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
most effective up close so it's not

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920 
most effective up close so it's not
really<00:02:37.980> overpowered<00:02:38.700> at<00:02:38.819> all<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.180> pretty

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
really overpowered at all it's pretty

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.900 
really overpowered at all it's pretty
marginal<00:02:40.290> i<00:02:40.620> would<00:02:40.920> say<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.520> it's

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
marginal i would say that it's it's

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.850 
marginal i would say that it's it's
going<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.239> have<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> interesting<00:02:43.140> place<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.770> the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
going to have a interesting place in the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.949 
going to have a interesting place in the
game<00:02:44.010> as<00:02:44.220> being<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.850> troll<00:02:45.120> weapon<00:02:45.540> as<00:02:45.660> being<00:02:45.870> a

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
but for the most part I think you're

but for the most part I think you're
better<00:02:52.470> off<00:02:52.590> using<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:53.130> primary<00:02:53.580> weapon<00:02:54.000> you're

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
sniper but that's not to say that you

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.660 
sniper but that's not to say that you
can't<00:02:58.410> be<00:02:58.739> effective<00:02:59.190> with<00:02:59.310> this<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.610> think

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
can't be effective with this I think

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.670 
can't be effective with this I think
I'll<00:02:59.970> do<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.150> more<00:03:00.390> in-depth<00:03:00.840> look<00:03:00.930> at<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.350> expo

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.400 
are saying that's quite frustrating if
you're<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.970> helicopter<00:03:09.810> pilot<00:03:09.959> because<00:03:10.170> it's

you're a helicopter pilot because it's

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.140

really<00:03:10.739> easy<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:10.980> disable<00:03:11.489> helicopters<00:03:12.030> with

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
really easy to disable helicopters with

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.970 
really easy to disable helicopters with
that<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.510> I'm<00:03:12.989> really<00:03:13.140> kind<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.500> curious<00:03:13.769> how

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
that and I'm really kind of curious how

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.410 
that and I'm really kind of curious how
it<00:03:14.130> kind<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.370> changes<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.730> Recon<00:03:15.150> class

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.030 
it kind of changes the Recon class
because<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.900> Recon<00:03:16.230> class<00:03:16.470> will<00:03:16.680> now<00:03:16.800> have<00:03:17.010> a

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
because the Recon class will now have a

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.250
