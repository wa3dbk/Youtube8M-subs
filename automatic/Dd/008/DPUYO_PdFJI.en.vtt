00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
the new air actually does fully come out

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.410 
the new air actually does fully come out
but<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:02.039> colors<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.640> changed<00:01:02.670> they<00:01:03.270> now

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
but the colors have changed they now

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.289 
but the colors have changed they now
have<00:01:03.660> silver<00:01:04.199> space<00:01:04.589> grain<00:01:04.920> aluminum<00:01:05.489> whereas

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
have silver space grain aluminum whereas

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.120 
have silver space grain aluminum whereas
the<00:01:06.450> ipad<00:01:06.750> 4<00:01:07.020> came<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.409> black<00:01:07.619> white<00:01:07.860> or

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
the ipad 4 came in black white or

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.880 
the ipad 4 came in black white or
aluminum<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.780> dimensions<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.560> pretty

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
aluminum the dimensions are pretty

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.249 
aluminum the dimensions are pretty
similar<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:12.390> tiny<00:01:13.080> tiny<00:01:13.680> bit<00:01:14.600> not<00:01:15.600> shorter

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
similar it's a tiny tiny bit not shorter

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.950 
similar it's a tiny tiny bit not shorter
so<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:16.890> point<00:01:17.700> 1<00:01:18.060> inch<00:01:18.330> shorter

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so it's going to be point 1 inch shorter

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.600 
so it's going to be point 1 inch shorter
and<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:20.520> couple<00:01:21.119> or<00:01:21.390> sorry<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.840> about

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
and it's a couple or sorry it's about

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.210 
and it's a couple or sorry it's about
point<00:01:23.610> 8<00:01:23.880> inches<00:01:24.450> wider<00:01:24.869> though<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.920> there's

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
point 8 inches wider though so there's

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.010 
point 8 inches wider though so there's
not<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.670> too<00:01:26.970> many<00:01:27.180> big<00:01:27.450> changes<00:01:27.990> in

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
not going to be too many big changes in

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.260 
not going to be too many big changes in
it<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> little<00:01:29.280> tiny<00:01:29.610> bit<00:01:29.759> thinner<00:01:30.090> as

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
it it is a little tiny bit thinner as

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.020 
it it is a little tiny bit thinner as
well<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.740> main<00:01:31.920> difference<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
well but the main difference in the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.030 
well but the main difference in the
overall<00:01:33.360> look<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.590> everything<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
overall look of it and everything and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.630 
overall look of it and everything and
waiting<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.659> it's<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.409> pound<00:01:37.799> whereas

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
waiting is that it's one pound whereas

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.420 
waiting is that it's one pound whereas
the<00:01:38.939> ipad<00:01:39.540> 4<00:01:39.840> was<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> roughly<00:01:40.650> 11<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> half

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the ipad 4 was a roughly 11 and a half

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.179 
the ipad 4 was a roughly 11 and a half
pounds<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:42.780> did<00:01:42.960> decrease<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> little

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
pounds so they did decrease it a little

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.450 
pounds so they did decrease it a little
bit<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.689> um<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.619> mean<00:01:46.950> really<00:01:47.159> other

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
bit there but um I mean really other

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.880 
bit there but um I mean really other
than<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.689> a7<00:01:49.290> chip<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.710> they've

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
than that and the a7 chip that they've

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.760 
than that and the a7 chip that they've
added<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.520> whereas<00:01:51.090> ipad<00:01:51.479> 4<00:01:51.750> had<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.140> a4

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
added to it whereas ipad 4 had the a4

that<00:01:52.890> hasn't<00:01:53.130> been<00:01:53.159> too<00:01:53.490> much<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:54.000> mean<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
that hasn't been too much I mean the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.749 
that hasn't been too much I mean the
display<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.350> still<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> same<00:01:55.710> retina<00:01:56.369> display

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
display is still the same retina display

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.109 
display is still the same retina display
that<00:01:56.969> ipad<00:01:57.570> 4<00:01:57.899> has<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.890> has<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.310> same<00:01:59.610> camera

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
that ipad 4 has it has the same camera

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.200 
that ipad 4 has it has the same camera
on<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.990> older<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:01.820> both<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.000> front

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
on it as the older one both the front

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.590 
on it as the older one both the front
and<00:02:03.420> back<00:02:03.540> both<00:02:04.020> are<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> exact<00:02:04.710> same<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.600> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
and back both are the exact same and the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.050 
and back both are the exact same and the
battery<00:02:06.990> life<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.500> really<00:02:08.009> pretty<00:02:08.640> much<00:02:08.849> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
battery life is really pretty much the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.660 
battery life is really pretty much the
same<00:02:09.239> as<00:02:09.450> well<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.289> there's<00:02:10.530> not<00:02:10.679> too<00:02:11.069> many<00:02:11.220> big

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
same as well so there's not too many big

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.040 
same as well so there's not too many big
differences<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> ipad

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
differences in the ipad

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.300 
differences in the ipad
an<00:02:13.140> ipad<00:02:13.860> 4<00:02:14.330> but<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.930> one<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.200> i<00:02:16.350> am<00:02:16.860> looking

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
an ipad 4 but the one that i am looking

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.550 
an ipad 4 but the one that i am looking
at<00:02:17.430> right<00:02:17.610> now<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.880> ipad<00:02:18.390> mini<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.380> one

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
at right now the ipad mini is the one

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.500 
at right now the ipad mini is the one
that<00:02:19.710> seems<00:02:19.980> like<00:02:20.220> people<00:02:20.910> are<00:02:21.150> going<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.420> be

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
that seems like people are going to be

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.570 
that seems like people are going to be
getting<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.930> most<00:02:22.170> with<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.770> retina<00:02:23.100> display

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
getting the most with the retina display

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.720 
getting the most with the retina display
and<00:02:24.020> just<00:02:25.020> comparing<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.560> two<00:02:25.800> it's<00:02:26.520> going<00:02:26.700> to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
and just comparing the two it's going to

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.400 
and just comparing the two it's going to
be<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.880> little<00:02:27.150> bit<00:02:27.360> more<00:02:27.540> expensive<00:02:27.840> for<00:02:28.320> the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
be a little bit more expensive for the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.440 
be a little bit more expensive for the
ipad<00:02:28.680> mini<00:02:28.710> with<00:02:29.040> retina<00:02:29.100> display<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:30.060> 16

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
ipad mini with retina display the 16

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.870 
ipad mini with retina display the 16
gigabytes<00:02:30.870> going<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.140> be<00:02:31.290> starting<00:02:32.070> at<00:02:32.160> 400

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
gigabytes going to be starting at 400

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.870 
gigabytes going to be starting at 400
for<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.840> Wi-Fi<00:02:34.290> version<00:02:34.340> whereas<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.520> ipad

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
for the Wi-Fi version whereas the ipad

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.490 
for the Wi-Fi version whereas the ipad
mini<00:02:35.910> without<00:02:36.510> retina<00:02:36.840> splay<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.410> 330<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:40.350> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
mini without retina splay is 330 so the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.810 
mini without retina splay is 330 so the
prices<00:02:40.740> are<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.190> be<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> little<00:02:41.520> bit<00:02:41.700> more

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
prices are going to be a little bit more

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.760 
prices are going to be a little bit more
expensive<00:02:42.090> if<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.600> do<00:02:42.780> want<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.080> retina<00:02:43.620> and

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
expensive if you do want that retina and

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.030 
expensive if you do want that retina and
these<00:02:44.280> other<00:02:44.550> features<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.620> size<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.890> is

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
these other features the size of it is

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.580 
these other features the size of it is
the<00:02:47.220> exact<00:02:47.670> same<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.540> tiny<00:02:48.960> bit<00:02:49.200> lighter

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
the exact same it is a tiny bit lighter

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.160 
the exact same it is a tiny bit lighter
but<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.400> won't<00:02:50.610> notice<00:02:50.790> any<00:02:51.030> difference<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
black white and aluminum so we got a

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.190 
black white and aluminum so we got a
couple<00:03:02.190> different<00:03:02.400> color<00:03:02.880> changes<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.870> also

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
couple different color changes it also

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.760 
couple different color changes it also
has<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.860> a7<00:03:05.520> chip<00:03:05.820> in<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.180> which<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.690> nice<00:03:06.960> but

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770

has the a7 chip in it which is nice but
other<00:03:08.670> than<00:03:08.850> that<00:03:08.970> really<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:09.930> pretty

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
other than that really it's pretty

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.570 
other than that really it's pretty
similar<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.710> other<00:03:10.740> one<00:03:10.980> like<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.370> said

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
similar to the other one like I said

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
battery of life but I would definitely

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.479
