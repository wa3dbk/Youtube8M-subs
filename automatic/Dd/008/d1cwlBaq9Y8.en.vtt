00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
got nice green handles which makes them

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.470 
got nice green handles which makes them
almost<00:04:50.010> look<00:04:50.310> like<00:04:50.340> toys<00:04:50.820> I'm<00:04:51.180> just<00:04:51.360> gonna

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
almost look like toys I'm just gonna

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.450 
almost look like toys I'm just gonna
make<00:04:51.750> jumpers<00:04:52.410> off<00:04:52.560> they<00:04:52.710> make<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:52.980> easier<00:04:53.280> but

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
make jumpers off they make it easier but

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.360 
make jumpers off they make it easier but
they're<00:04:54.180> not<00:04:54.360> tight<00:04:54.630> so<00:04:54.840> always<00:04:55.080> keep<00:04:55.530> your

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
they're not tight so always keep your

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.420 
they're not tight so always keep your
fingers<00:04:56.880> behind<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.510> blades<00:04:58.040> and<00:04:59.040> really

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
fingers behind the blades and really

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.860 
fingers behind the blades and really
think<00:04:59.700> hard<00:04:59.940> about<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:00.510> when<00:05:00.750> you're

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
think hard about that when you're

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.110 
think hard about that when you're
cutting<00:05:01.140> because<00:05:02.100> it's<00:05:02.310> so<00:05:02.460> easy<00:05:02.640> just<00:05:02.790> to

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
cutting because it's so easy just to

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.890 
cutting because it's so easy just to
forget<00:05:03.930> for<00:05:04.170> a<00:05:04.230> moment<00:05:04.410> and<00:05:04.830> ouch<00:05:05.630> and<00:05:06.630> you

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
hurt yourself cutting them out t be

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.180 
hurt yourself cutting them out t be
careful<00:05:32.600> be<00:05:33.600> an<00:05:33.750> angel<00:05:36.650> now<00:05:37.650> what<00:05:37.830> I<00:05:37.860> want<00:05:38.100> to

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
careful be an angel now what I want to

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.240 
careful be an angel now what I want to
do<00:05:38.460> is<00:05:38.790> to<00:05:39.060> have<00:05:39.240> these<00:05:39.510> two<00:05:40.140> angels<00:05:40.470> kind<00:05:41.160> of

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
do is to have these two angels kind of

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.840 
do is to have these two angels kind of
sit<00:05:41.490> on<00:05:41.820> the<00:05:42.720> side<00:05:42.990> like<00:05:43.410> that<00:05:43.740> so<00:05:44.640> what<00:05:44.760> I'm

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
sit on the side like that so what I'm

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.460 
sit on the side like that so what I'm
going<00:05:44.970> to<00:05:45.030> do<00:05:45.210> is<00:05:45.360> put<00:05:45.600> a<00:05:45.630> little<00:05:45.750> line<00:05:46.080> on<00:05:46.350> the

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
going to do is put a little line on the

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.780 
going to do is put a little line on the
back<00:05:46.620> there<00:05:48.590> and<00:05:49.590> a<00:05:49.680> little<00:05:49.950> line<00:05:50.190> on<00:05:50.490> the<00:05:50.640> back

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
back there and a little line on the back

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.780 
back there and a little line on the back
there<00:05:51.270> so<00:05:51.510> what<00:05:51.900> we<00:05:52.170> tend<00:05:52.470> to<00:05:52.620> need<00:05:52.860> is<00:05:53.220> just<00:05:53.430> a

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
there so what we tend to need is just a

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.650 
there so what we tend to need is just a
couple<00:05:54.690> little<00:05:54.990> strips<00:05:55.350> of<00:05:55.500> paper<00:05:55.650> like<00:05:56.040> that

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
couple little strips of paper like that

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.530 
couple little strips of paper like that
fold<00:05:57.660> them<00:05:57.870> in<00:05:58.020> half<00:05:58.050> and<00:05:59.120> they<00:06:00.120> are<00:06:00.270> going<00:06:00.450> to

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
fold them in half and they are going to

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.240 
fold them in half and they are going to
want<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:01.160> stick<00:06:02.160> along<00:06:02.700> that<00:06:02.970> line<00:06:03.300> so<00:06:04.110> you

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
want to stick along that line so you

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:10.580 
want to stick along that line so you
glue<00:06:05.250> one<00:06:05.490> of<00:06:05.610> those<00:06:05.730> tabs<00:06:06.920> and<00:06:07.920> then<00:06:09.470> glue<00:06:10.470> it

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
glue one of those tabs and then glue it

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.750 
glue one of those tabs and then glue it
across<00:06:10.920> there<00:06:12.740> glue<00:06:13.740> one<00:06:13.950> of<00:06:14.070> the<00:06:14.160> tabs<00:06:14.490> you

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
across there glue one of the tabs you

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.310 
across there glue one of the tabs you
can<00:06:17.760> do<00:06:17.850> it<00:06:17.970> across<00:06:18.240> the<00:06:18.600> line<00:06:18.780> so<00:06:19.080> that<00:06:19.230> the

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
can do it across the line so that the

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.830 
can do it across the line so that the
fold<00:06:19.620> is<00:06:19.830> across<00:06:20.130> the<00:06:20.370> line<00:06:20.520> so<00:06:21.090> now<00:06:21.330> we<00:06:21.390> have

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
fold is across the line so now we have

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.240 
fold is across the line so now we have
that<00:06:21.990> little<00:06:22.260> bit<00:06:22.410> there<00:06:22.440> which<00:06:22.890> is<00:06:23.070> gonna

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
that little bit there which is gonna

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.750 
that little bit there which is gonna
hook<00:06:23.520> in<00:06:24.050> nicely<00:06:25.050> in<00:06:25.860> the<00:06:26.070> back<00:06:28.610> except<00:06:29.610> it's<00:06:29.730> a

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
hook in nicely in the back except it's a

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.310 
hook in nicely in the back except it's a
bit<00:06:29.940> too<00:06:30.150> much<00:06:30.390> so<00:06:31.910> just<00:06:32.910> snip<00:06:33.840> a<00:06:33.870> bit<00:06:34.140> off

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
bit too much so just snip a bit off

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.090 
bit too much so just snip a bit off
there

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 
there

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.830 
there
we<00:06:35.280> might<00:06:35.460> have<00:06:35.580> to<00:06:35.730> snip<00:06:36.000> it<00:06:36.030> this<00:06:36.300> off<00:06:36.510> there

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
we might have to snip it this off there

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.790 
we might have to snip it this off there
like<00:06:37.760> that<00:06:38.760> as<00:06:39.060> well<00:06:39.350> you'll<00:06:40.350> have<00:06:40.470> to<00:06:40.530> play

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
like that as well you'll have to play

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.280 
like that as well you'll have to play
with<00:06:41.010> that<00:06:41.100> a<00:06:41.160> bit<00:06:41.430> but<00:06:41.940> that<00:06:42.090> will<00:06:42.300> put<00:06:42.930> on<00:06:43.140> the

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
with that a bit but that will put on the

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.450
